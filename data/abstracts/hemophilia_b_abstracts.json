    "abstract": "Information on inhibitor development in nonsevere hemophilia and its association with clotting factor concentrate type is limited. To assess inhibitor development in patients with nonsevere hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) in the European Haemophilia Safety Surveillance system. Inhibitors and total treated patients are reported annually. Any exposure to concentrate per year was considered a treatment year. Incidence rates per 1000 treatment years and 95% CIs were calculated according to type of concentrate and compared using incidence rate ratios (IRRs). During 2008 to 2023, 90 centers reported on 36,074 (HA) and 9238 (HB) treatment years. The inhibitor rate for nonsevere HA receiving factor (F)VIII was 4.2 per 1000 treatment years (95% CI, 3.5-4.9). Inhibitors developed at median 47.5 years (P25-P75 [IQR], 17.0-69.0), after median 40 exposure days (EDs; IQR, 17-80), with 58% occurring <50 EDs and 88% <100 EDs. Overall, 4 of 149 (2.7%) patients in the inhibitor group were female. Only one inhibitor was reported in nonsevere HB, in a female patient (FIX 7%, after 6 EDs), resulting in an inhibitor rate of 0.1 per 1000 treatment years (95% CI, 0.0-0.6). Compared with standard half-life recombinant FVIII, inhibitor rates on both plasma-derived FVIII (IRR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.11-0.58; <i>P</i> < .001) and extended half-life FVIII (IRR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.02-0.68; <i>P</i> = .002) were significantly reduced. Inhibitors in nonsevere hemophilia occurred at a rate of 4.2 per 1000 treatment years in HA and 0.1 per 1000 treatment years in HB. Compared with standard half-life FVIII, inhibitor development on plasma-derived and extended half-life FVIII were reduced. These data show that inhibitor monitoring is relevant with nonsevere HA in both sexes and should be continued lifelong."

    "title": "Pharmacokinetic evaluation of concizumab for the treatment of hemophilia.",
    "abstract": "Replacement therapy is the global standard of care in hemophilia. However, several unmet needs have favored the development of non-factor therapies. Concizumab, an anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor (anti-TFPI) administered daily, restores thrombin generation in all hemophilia subtypes. The pharmacokinetic profile of concizumab from several clinical trials demonstrates target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) and a consistent exposure-response profile when given daily. Concizumab has an acceptable safe profile and efficacy in hemophilia A or B with and without inhibitors. Despite the availability of diverse therapies for hemophilia management, unmet needs remain, including limited prophylaxis for hemophilia B inhibitor patients. Concizumab was developed to address this gap. Its target-mediated drug deposition results in a nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile and a need for a daily injection schedule, which ensures a stable, consistent, and sustained pharmacokinetic profile. While the daily injection may seem demanding, it does not compromise the optimal benefits of concizumab prophylaxis. Moreover, the acceptable safe profile and efficacy of concizumab in bleed prevention in hemophilia A or B with and without inhibitors provide reassurance that it may be a therapeutic option in managing all hemophilia patients."

    "abstract": "Accurate and reproducible measures of factor activity are required to guide clinical decision-making following gene therapy for haemophilia B (HB). Highly significant discrepancies have been observed in measurements of various factor IX (FIX) concentrates that carry molecular modifications to extend their half-life, arguing for the need for careful analysis of new HB treatment modalities with respect to FIX assay performance. To further characterise variability in FIX activity measured using different one-stage assays (OSAs) and chromogenic assays (CAs) in patients with HB receiving gene therapy utilising the FIX Padua variant and to assess whether assay differences were due to the FIX-Padua variant. FIX activity was assessed centrally (OSA and CA) and locally (OSA only) using plasma samples collected from a phase 2b and phase 3 study of etranacogene dezaparvovec and in an in vitro study of wild-type (wt) recombinant human FIX (rhFIX) and rhFIX-Padua. Lower CA than OSA FIX activity for plasma samples from the phase 3 trial was observed (CA:OSA ratio: 0.408 [±0.049]-0.547 [±0.062]). Local OSA:central OSA FIX activity ratios were 0.789 (±0.314)-1.021 (±0.159). Local OSA:central OSA FIX activity ratios across methods and/or reagents were 0.81 (±0.02)-1.28 (±0.04) for rhFIX-wt-spiked samples and 0.67 (±0.02)-1.13 (±0.09) for rhFIX-Padua-spiked samples. FIX activity differences between central and local OSAs were modest; similar differences were observed in vitro with rhFIX-wt versus rhFIX-Padua. Commonly available OSAs can be used to monitor patients post-etranacogene dezaparvovec administration; we recommend using the same assay platform throughout the post-treatment period."

    "title": "Assessing stigma in a predominantly male hemophilia population: a Chinese cross-sectional study.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by impaired blood clotting, with prevalence of 2.73 per 100,000 individuals in China. Advancements in medical technology have significantly improved patient survival, however, individuals with hemophilia continue to experience chronic pain, recurrent joint hemorrhages, and functional impairments, particularly in the limbs. These physical challenges often lead to psychological issues such as anxiety and depression, contributing to heightened stigma. This study aimed to assess the current level of stigma among patients with hemophilia and to identify associated influencing factors. Convenience sampling was applied to recruit patients from a hemophilia treatment center. As hemophilia predominantly affects males, the sample consisted of 231 males and one female (consistent with epidemiological sex ratios in China). The Social Impact Scale (SIS; 24 items, score range: 24-96, higher scores = greater stigma) and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS; 10 items, score range: 12-66, higher scores = greater support) were used to assess stigma and social support, respectively. Multiple linear regression was employed to analyze factors associated with stigma. The mean total stigma score among hemophilia patients was 63.88 ± 15.27. Multiple linear regression revealed that higher social support (<i>β</i> = -0.69, 95% CI [-0.92, -0.47], <i>P</i> < 0.001) and being married (<i>β</i> = -6.17, 95% CI [-10.06, -2.28], <i>P</i> = 0.002) were associated with lower stigma, whereas more frequent bleeding episodes (<i>β</i> = 7.79, 95% CI [2.04, 13.54], <i>P</i> = 0.008) and lower limb disability (<i>β</i> = -6.11, 95% CI [-9.86, -2.36], <i>P</i> = 0.002) were associated with higher stigma. Lower monthly income was also linked to increased stigma (<i>β</i> = -1.85, 95% CI [-3.58, -0.12], <i>P</i> = 0.036). These variables explained 28.9% of the total variation of the total stigma score. Stigma among patients with hemophilia is at a moderate to severe level. Targeted interventions should be prioritized for unmarried patients, those facing financial hardship, individuals with lower limb disabilities, and those experiencing frequent bleeding episodes. Enhancing psychological health education and social support is essential in mitigating stigma among hemophilia patients."

    "abstract": "Despite widespread advances in DNA sequencing, the functional consequences of most genetic variants remain poorly understood. Multiplexed assays of variant effect can measure the function of variants at scale but cannot readily be applied to the ~10% of human genes encoding secreted proteins. Here we develop a flexible, scalable human cell surface display method, multiplexed surface tethering of extracellular proteins (MultiSTEP), to study the consequences of missense variation in coagulation factor IX (FIX), a serine protease in which genetic variation can cause hemophilia B. We combine MultiSTEP with a panel of antibodies to detect FIX secretion and post-translational modification (PTM), measuring 44,816 variant effects for 436 synonymous variants and 8,528 of the 8,759 possible F9 missense variants. Almost half of missense variants impact secretion, PTM or both. We also identify functional constraints on secretion within the signal peptide and for nearly all gain or loss of cysteine variants. Secretion scores correlate strongly with FIX levels in hemophilia B and reveal that loss-of-secretion variants are more often associated with severe disease. Integration of the secretion and PTM scores enables reclassification of 63.1% of F9 variants of uncertain significance in the My Life, Our Future hemophilia genotyping project. Lastly, we show that MultiSTEP can be applied to other secreted proteins, thus demonstrating that MultiSTEP is a multiplexed, multimodal and generalizable method for systematically assessing variant effects in secreted proteins at scale."

Data on safety and durability from 13 years of follow-up in a cohort of patients who had been successfully treated with scAAV2/8-LP1-hFIXco gene therapy are now available. Ten men with severe hemophilia B received a single intravenous infusion of the scAAV2/8-LP1-hFIXco vector in one of three dose groups (low-dose: 2×10<sup>11</sup> vector genomes [vg] per kilogram of body weight [in two participants]; intermediate-dose: 6×10<sup>11</sup> vg per kilogram [in two]; or high-dose: 2×10<sup>12</sup> vg per kilogram [in six]). Efficacy outcomes included factor IX activity, the annualized bleeding rate, and factor IX concentrate use. Safety assessments included clinical events, liver function, and imaging. Participants were followed for a median of 13.0 years (range, 11.1 to 13.8). Factor IX activity remained stable across the dose cohorts, with mean factor IX levels of 1.7 IU per deciliter in the low-dose group, 2.3 IU per deciliter in the intermediate-dose group, and 4.8 IU per deciliter in the high-dose group. Seven of the 10 participants did not receive prophylaxis. The median annualized bleeding rate decreased from 14.0 episodes (interquartile range, 12.0 to 21.5) to 1.5 episodes (interquartile range, 0.7 to 2.2), which represented a reduction by a factor of 9.7. Use of factor IX concentrate decreased by a factor of 12.4 (interquartile range, 2.2 to 27.1). A total of 15 vector-related adverse events occurred, primarily transient elevations in aminotransferase levels. Factor IX inhibitor, thrombosis, or chronic liver injury did not develop in any participant. Two cancers were identified but were deemed by the investigators, together with an expert multidisciplinary team, as being unrelated to the vector. A liver biopsy that was conducted in 1 participant 10 years after the infusion revealed transcriptionally active transgene expression in hepatocytes without fibrosis or dysplasia. Levels of neutralizing antibodies to AAV8 remained high throughout follow-up, thus indicating potential barriers to readministration of the vector. A single administration of scAAV2/8-LP1-hFIXco gene therapy resulted in durable factor IX expression, sustained clinical benefit, and no late-onset safety concerns over a period of 13 years. These data support the long-term efficacy and safety of AAV gene therapy for severe hemophilia B.

    "abstract": "Gene therapy is a transformative approach to treating genetic disorders in order to improve disease outcomes for patients. Hemophilia A and B are inherited genetic disorders caused by mutations in the <i>FVIII</i> and <i>FIX</i> genes, respectively. Traditional treatments for hemophilia have included intravenous plasma, factor concentrates, and nonfactor therapies that require lifelong prophylaxis and carry risks of factor inhibitor development. Gene therapy offers a novel solution by delivering functional <i>FVIII</i> or <i>FIX</i> genes via adeno-associated virus vectors, which enable the production of the missing factors. Clinical outcomes have shown promise through gene therapies like valoctocogene roxaparvovec for hemophilia A and etranacogene dezaparvovec and fidanacogene elaparvovec for hemophilia B. Each therapy has demonstrated efficacy in reducing bleeding rates and maintaining factor activity. However, challenges such as hepatotoxicity, immune response, and durability of gene expression persist. Future advancements aim to expand eligibility, achieve sustained expression, and minimize adverse effects. Current trials are exploring new vectors, transgenes, and methods to overcome existing limitations. Gene therapy holds the potential to revolutionize hemophilia treatment, offering a path toward long-term management and improved quality of life for patients."

Whilst a commonly recognised injury in the general population, there is limited literature and no guidelines for management in haemophilia patients. This case series aims to provide insight into the clinical characteristics, management and sequelae of subungual haematomas in the haemophilia group. A retrospective case series was performed of patients with haemophilia presenting with subungual haematomas between July 2018 and June 2024, and the background literature reviewed. Data were collected from electronic medical records and analysis was purely descriptive given the small cohort included. Six individual cases were identified with traumatic subungual haematomas. Five patients were male (83.3%), there was an event split between haemophilia A and B cases, with severity ranging from mild to moderate. One patient with mild haemophilia A also had concurrent type 1 von Willebrand disease. Most cases (83.3%) had a 48-72 h delay before hospital presentation. Five cases (83.3%) required either nail trephination or removal. Two moderate haemophilia B patients (33.3%), had recurrent bleeding within the first 2 weeks post injury. Haemophilia patients presenting with subungual haematomas should be considered for nail trephination or surgical intervention as per standard of care following factor replacement. Larger patient series may provide more insight into comparative outcomes in haemophilia patients versus the general population. Early collaboration between haematology and surgical teams is important. Inclusion of this site-specific bleed into patient education resources and haemophilia guidelines warrants consideration."

    "abstract": "Regular prophylactic factor replacement is recommended as optimal therapy for hemophilia B. Factor concentrate with longer half-lives would allow successful prophylaxis as less frequent dosing would be less burdensome for patients and caregivers. Nonacog Beta Pegol (N9-GP), a glycopegylated factor IX with an extended half-life, has been established globally. However, real-world data from India remain limited. This study evaluates the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of low-dose N9-GP prophylaxis in Indian children/adolescents with hemophilia B. In this retrospective study, a total of seven patients with hemophilia B were included. Baseline assessments of the annualized bleeding rate (ABR), Functional Independence Score in Hemophilia (FISH), and Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) were conducted for all patients. Dosing was individualized (mean 34.76 IU/kg; range: 25-40 IU/kg every three weeks) based on patient weight, baseline ABR, and joint status, in accordance with resource-conscious protocols suitable for Indian settings. Patients were monitored for any adverse events throughout the study period. After 12 months of treatment, the ABR, FISH, and HJHS were reassessed and compared with baseline values. Screening for inhibitors was performed for all patients at the end of the 12-month period. The mean age was 11.2 years, ranging from four years to 18 years. The mean overall ABR before using N9-GP was 21.1 (range 12 - 48) bleeds/year. After treatment with N9-GP, the mean overall ABR was 0.42 (0-1) bleeds/year. Six patients had target joints before starting treatment. At the end of 12 months of prophylaxis, only one patient had a target joint involving one joint with mobility and swelling significantly improved in the affected joint. Four patients remained bleed free on N9-GP prophylaxis. Three patients experienced minor bleeding once, which was just before the next dose of prophylaxis. Baseline mean HJHS was 26.71/124 (range 10 - 47). After 12 months on N9-GP, mean HJHS was 7.5/124 (range 0-16). Before treatment, the mean FISH score was 23.8/32 (range 17-29). After treatment, the mean FISH score was 31.4/32 (range 28 - 31). None of them developed any adverse drug reactions or thromboembolic events during the entire course of treatment. None of the patients developed inhibitors. Conclusion: N9-GP has been shown to be well tolerated, safe, and efficacious in the treatment and prevention of bleeding episodes in people with hemophilia B."

One of the most debilitating long-term complications of haemophilia is chronic joint damage with pain, and reduced mobility, due to bleeding into the joints. As the primary cause of morbidity in people with haemophilia (PwH), joint health assessment is critical for disease management and optimizing patient outcomes. Among the tools developed to monitor joint health in PwH, the Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) has emerged as the most widely used and validated clinical tool. There is evidence supporting the use of the HJHS in both children and adults. In contrast to scoring methods that incorporate imaging techniques, which primarily describe the morphology of the joints, the HJHS allows for the assessment and monitoring of joint functionality."

Previous studies, along with our clinical observations, have identified distinct incidence rates and clinical manifestations of factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX) inhibitors in patients with severe hemophilia A (HA) and severe hemophilia B (HB). In order to explore different immune responses to FVIII and FIX in HA and HB patients and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the varying clinical manifestations of these patients, we performed single-cell sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from five HA and five HB patients with inhibitors. After quality control, a total of 75,051 cells were clustered into 19 subsets. Transcriptome analysis revealed differences in the composition of lymphocyte subsets and the functional status of immune cells between the HA and HB groups. Additionally, immune repertoire analysis indicated variations in the diversity of B and T cell clones between the two groups. HA group exhibited a relatively higher proportion of B cells and more active B cells, whereas HB group demonstrated a higher proportion of T cells, with more active CD4+ T helper (Th) cells. Our study provides insights into the distinct biological processes underlying the distinct immune responses to therapeutic FVIII and FIX in HA and HB patients, as revealed through single-cell sequencing of PBMCs from hemophilia patients with inhibitors. The data generated will serve as a valuable resource for future research on how the immune system recognizes and initiates responses to antigens with varying molecular characteristics."

Target FIX activity levels in plasma should be individually set primarily taking bleeding tendency into account, alongside the presence of target joints, physical activity, and preferred dosing schedules. In other words, both PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) are relevant when individualizing therapy. Our objective was to examine the relationship between dose, FIX activity levels, and bleeding specifically for EHL-FIX concentrate recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with albumin (rIX-FP). Data from hemophilia B patients with endogenous FIX activity level ≤ 2 IU/dL from five clinical trials were combined. Bleeding probability was described with a parametric repeated time-to-event (RTTE) model. Data included 2,493 FIX activity levels and 514 bleeds from 114 unique patients with a median age of 26 years (range: 1-61) followed for a median of 416 days (range: 6-1,233). Joints were the most frequent bleeding site (46%), and more than half of the bleeds were trauma-related (52%). Overall, 60% and 40% were categorized as damage-causing or nuisance bleeds, respectively. A baseline hazard of 7.3 bleeds per year was calculated when FIX activity levels were set at zero. The probability of all bleeding decreased by 50% when the FIX activity level was 12 IU/dL. Variability in bleeding hazard between individuals with similar FIX activity levels was substantial (182%). Simulations showed that targeting trough FIX activity levels to 20 IU/dL resulted in a median annual bleeding rate (ABR) of zero (range: 0-3)."

This systematic review evaluates the efficacy and safety of concizumab prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A and B.MethodsThis systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the use of concizumab in hemophilia A or B were identified through a comprehensive search of electronic databases. Outcomes of interest included annualized bleeding rate (ABR), thrombin generation, bleeding episodes, immunogenicity, and adverse events. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0 was used for quality assessment.ResultsFive studies were included. Concizumab prophylaxis was associated with a notable reduction in ABR, with reported decreases from 9.4 to 1.3 episodes/year and from 19.6 to 2.9 episodes/year in hemophilia A, and from 14.9 to 1.6 episodes/year in hemophilia B. Thrombin generation increased in a dose-dependent manner and stabilized by week 24. Across all studies, bleeding episodes were significantly reduced. Adverse events were primarily mild to moderate. No thromboembolic events were reported.ConclusionConcizumab appears to be an effective and safe prophylactic treatment for patients with hemophilia A and B, demonstrating consistent reductions in bleeding rates and enhanced thrombin generation.

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by factor IX (FIX) deficiency, leading to spontaneous bleeding episodes predominantly affecting joints and muscles. Severe cases with FIX activity levels below 1% can develop inhibitors, rendering replacement therapy ineffective and posing additional challenges such as allergic or anaphylactic reactions to FIX infusions. Novel non-factor therapies, including concizumab, offer alternative strategies by targeting tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), a key regulator of coagulation. Concizumab restores thrombin generation and hemostasis, bypassing the need for FIX. Administered subcutaneously, it reduces treatment burden while enhancing adherence and quality of life. We report a pediatric case of severe hemophilia B with inhibitors and recurrent anaphylactic reactions to FIX therapy, and transitioned to concizumab therapy. Initial treatment included FIX replacement but repeated allergic reactions necessitated bypassing therapy such as recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) and later concizumab. Following the initiation of concizumab, the patient experienced significant reductions in bleeding episodes, improved joint health scores, and decreased reliance on rFVIIa, with no hospitalizations or severe adverse events over four years. This case highlights concizumab's transformative role in managing hemophilia B with inhibitors, demonstrating its potential to address unmet clinical needs and improve outcomes, as corroborated by pivotal clinical trials.

A total of 231 patients across 33 countries were enrolled. The mean annualised bleeding rate (ABR) (standard deviation) for treated bleeding episodes was investigated for patients receiving prophylaxis (HA: 4.7 [5.9]; HB: 2.2 [3.0]; HAwI: 10.3 [8.5]; HBwI: 12.4 [14.1]) and those receiving on-demand (OnD) treatment (HA: 21.5 [17.7]; HB: 10.5 [8.6]; HAwI: 15.2 [14.8]; HBwI: 9.3 [13.3]). Physical activity levels were lowest among patients with HBwI. Target joints were similar among haemophilia types and treatments. Overall, mean and median HJHS total scores were lower for patients receiving prophylaxis compared with OnD treatment. The explorer6 study assessed a large haemophilia patient population in a real-world setting across 33 countries. The results indicate that an unmet need remains among patients receiving OnD treatment and those with inhibitors. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03741881."

    "title": "A Systematic Review of the Oral Health Status of Hemophilic Patients.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder, with the most well-known forms being hemophilia A and hemophilia B. It is important for patients with hemophilia to maintain good oral health and prevent oral diseases because of their increased propensity to bleed. Few large-scale studies exist on the oral health status of patients with hemophilia. In our search across three databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed), only 14 articles about the oral health status of hemophilic patients were extracted. Oral health status was classified into caries status, periodontal status, and oral hygiene status and compared with that of a healthy group. In total, 13 of the 14 papers investigated the dental caries status of hemophilia patients, and the most common report was \"no difference\" compared to healthy subjects (7 papers, 53.8%), followed by \"poor\" (4 papers, 30.8%). Periodontal status was investigated in 6 papers, of which 4 (66.7%) reported that the status of hemophilia patients was \"poor\" compared to that of healthy controls. Oral hygiene status was investigated in 12 studies, with 7 studies (58.3%) reporting it to be \"poor\" in hemophilia patients compared to healthy controls, followed by 3 studies (25.0%) reporting \"no difference\". Oral hygiene status is associated with other items, such as caries and periodontal disease, and it is paramount in maintaining good oral health in hemophilic patients. In addition, regular dental visits improve oral hygiene, resulting in the prevention of oral disease. It is important to increase awareness of this information among patients with hemophilia and for medical and dental professionals to cooperate to improve patients' oral health status, with the aim of improving their quality of life."

Continuous prophylaxis with intravenous clotting factor concentrates or subcutaneous factor VIII mimetic agents reduces bleeding and improves quality of life. However, adherence to prophylaxis is challenging. To investigate the impact of clinical and sociocontextual factors, including SDOH, on adherence to prophylaxis in children and adolescents with hemophilia. In this cross-sectional study, parent and adolescent participants were enrolled from 2018 to 2023. Adherence to prophylaxis was measured by Hemophilia Regimen Treatment Adherence Scale-Prophylaxis as overall adherence as well as \"time,\" \"dose,\" \"plan,\" \"remember,\" \"skip,\" and \"communicate\" subscales. Sociocontextual factors were assessed by self-reported validated surveys. Linear regression analysis was performed. Of 41 parent participants, 56% were Hispanic. There was no difference in adherence scores between Hispanic and non-Hispanic parents (p = 0.97). Older age of child (p = 0.002), prophylaxis via peripheral intravenous route (vs. central line, p = 0.004), and use of Spanish language for medical communication (vs. English, p = 0.002) were associated with lower adherence. Higher trust in provider was associated with higher adherence (p = 0.051). Our findings may help guide tailored interventions to improve adherence, including targeting older children/adolescents as they become independent in their care, language-concordant education, and measures to improve social support and enhance trust in healthcare providers."

    "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Total hip replacement and total knee arthroplasty carry a high risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE); therefore, anticoagulation prophylaxis is recommended in these patients. Unfortunately, there are no guidelines about VTE prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia who underwent these high-risk surgeries. To determine whether these patients have a high risk of VTE, we conducted a retrospective study on patients with hemophilia who underwent elective arthroplasty at our hospital in 2016. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: There were 11 patients with hemophilia A and B who underwent high-risk surgeries. Recombinant factor VIII or IX and also active recombinant Factor VII were used for perioperative hemostasis, and LMWH was administered for thromboembolic prophylaxis. Postoperatively, we collected information on the duration of factor VIII/IX infusion, VTE-prophylaxis, and complications. <i>Results</i>: Postoperative bleeding was minimal in most cases, with an average blood loss of 500 mL. No major thrombotic events were reported, and the need for transfusion was low, with only one patient requiring additional blood products. The VTE prophylaxis included prophylactic enoxaparin and hemostatic treatment. At the 1-year follow-up, we did not find any evidence of clinical VTE in our patients. <i>Conclusions</i>: Better risk stratification is needed to identify patients who would benefit from pharmacological prophylaxis. Total arthroplasty in hemophilic patients is feasible and safe when managed by a multidisciplinary team and supported by tailored antithrombotic prophylaxis protocols. The use of recombinant coagulation factors and LMWH ensures effective bleeding control and thromboembolic prevention, enhancing patient outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of individualized care in this high-risk population."

    "abstract": "Inherited bleeding disorders involve prolonged bleeding due to clotting protein deficiencies, with hemophilia A and B being the most common types. The severity of bleeding in people with hemophilia depends on the deficient factor level. Treatment includes coagulation factor concentrates, nonreplacement preparations, gene therapies, and physiotherapy, whereby bleeding is prevented, symptoms are reduced, and the quality of life is improved. Closed kinetic chain exercises improve joint stability and neuromuscular control by stabilizing the proximal base, making them favored in musculoskeletal rehabilitation. Proprioceptive exercise training improves the sensorimotor system's adaptability and injury prevention through tailored programs involving progressively complex movements and surfaces. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of closed kinetic chain exercises and proprioceptive exercise training on improving balance and walking in people with hemophilia. This study is a 3-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial with 63 people with hemophilia aged 13-25 years who meet the inclusion criteria. The primary outcome measures are medio-lateral swing, anterior-posterior swing, walking speed, and Hemophilia Joint Health Score. Secondary outcome measures are kinematic assessment of gait, one-leg stand test, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) test, proprioception assessment, and the Functional Independence Score in Hemophilia. Participants will be evaluated with the Biodex balance system for postural sway, 10-meters walking test for gait speed, Hemophilia Joint Health Score for joint health, Kinovea 2D motion analysis for kinematic evaluation of gait, one-leg stand test for balance measurement, 6MWD for functional capacity, digital goniometer for proprioception, and Functional Independence Score in Hemophilia for functional independence. Participants will be randomly assigned to a closed kinetic chain exercise group, a proprioceptive exercise group, or a control group. All participants in exercise training groups will receive a 30-minute education session on joint protection techniques and energy conservation prior to the first exercise session. Closed kinetic chain exercises will include progressive lower limb exercises of approximately 45 minutes each session. Proprioceptive exercise training will focus on vibration training; reposition exercises and proprioception exercises will be administered to increase proprioceptive input for the same duration as the other group. The control group will receive no intervention. All participants will undergo 24 exercise sessions (2 days a week for 12 weeks). After the treatment, the initial measurements will be repeated. This study began in September 2023 and is scheduled to be completed in May 2025. A total of 34 participants have completed the study to date. This study will investigate the effects of 2 different exercises on functional parameters in people with hemophilia. The effects of different exercise protocols on parameters such as postural sway, walking speed, and joint health will be evaluated. It is predicted that both exercise methods may have positive effects on balance and gait. Clinical Trials.gov NCT05879549; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05879549. DERR1-10.2196/66770."

This case report details the multidisciplinary rehabilitation of a 41-year-old male with moderate hemophilia B (FIX activity: 3.9%) and ICH in a resource-limited setting. Admitted to a high-dependency unit postneurosurgical intervention, the patient received low-dose prophylactic coagulation factor IX (maintained at 34.6%-66.2%) alongside real-time coagulation monitoring. A stepwise rehabilitation protocol was implemented, including early passive joint mobilization, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and progressive task-oriented training, tailored to minimize bleeding risk. Over 7 weeks, the patient achieved marked functional improvement: Activity of Daily Living score increased from 0 to 80, modified Rankin Scale improved from 5 to 3, and Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) rose from 0 to 60, with no secondary bleeding. This case highlights the feasibility of integrating low-dose prophylaxis with early rehabilitation in developing countries, offering a cost-effective model to enhance functional recovery and reduce disability in hemophilia-related ICH."

Recently, the usefulness of ultrasound (US) examinations in the musculoskeletal assessment of PWH has been reported, but the actual use of US has been suggested to be limited. The aim of this study was to clarify the extent to which US is being performed on young male PWH at medical institutions in Japan. This was an observational study using the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan. We identified almost all male PWH aged under 30 years who were prescribed hemostatic agents between 2015 and 2021 in Japan. For each year, we calculated the proportion of PWH who underwent US and, as a sensitivity analysis, the proportion of PWH who underwent US examinations for musculoskeletal disease. The Cochran‒Armitage trend test was used to examine changes in the number of PWH who underwent US examinations over the observation period. The Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients were calculated from the proportion of US examinations performed at each medical institution annually. A total of 2137-2483 male PWH younger than 30 years were identified annually. The annual proportion of PWH who underwent US ranged from 6.1 to 12.9%. By age group, the annual proportions of US were 6.7-14.4%, 8.1-16.6%, and 2.0-8.7% for 0-9, 10-19, and 20-29 years, respectively. The annual proportions of musculoskeletal US were 2.9-7.7%. The proportion of PWH who underwent US increased significantly over the seven-year period; however, it varied by medical institution (Gini coefficients 0.85-0.92). The use of US for young PWH is becoming more widespread in Japan. However, US is performed at different rates among medical institutions."

The long-term safety and efficacy of this treatment are not known. In a 12-month study, 15 participants with severe or moderately severe hemophilia B (factor IX coagulant activity, ≤2% of the normal value) received fidanacogene elaparvovec at a dose of 5×10<sup>11</sup> vector genomes (vg) per kilogram of body weight; thereafter, participants could enroll in a 5-year follow-up study. Safety end points included adverse events and changes in laboratory measures. Efficacy end points included the annualized rate of treated bleeding events (annualized bleeding rate) and factor IX activity. A total of 14 participants provided consent and completed at least 3 years of follow-up (median, 5.5; range 3 to 6); participation was ongoing among 8 at the data cutoff. None of the participants reported treatment-related adverse events after year 1. Throughout follow-up, nine serious adverse events were noted in 4 participants; none were thrombotic or treatment-related. No factor IX inhibitors were detected. Throughout follow-up, mean factor IX activity was in the mild hemophilia range; the mean annualized bleeding rate was less than 1, and 10 participants had no treated bleeding episodes. Surveillance liver ultrasounds obtained from year 1 onward showed no evidence of cancer but showed steatosis in 4 participants who had weight gain and elevated aminotransferase levels (maximum alanine aminotransferase level, 77 U per liter). One participant with a history of hepatitis C, hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and an elevated body-mass index had progression of underlying advanced liver fibrosis. A total of 13 surgical procedures were performed in 8 participants; exogenous factor IX was administered for 10 procedures, and no associated unexpected bleeding complications occurred. Fidanacogene elaparvovec was associated with no or only low-grade adverse effects over a period of 3 to 6 years. Efficacy was maintained in the long term at 5×10<sup>11</sup> vg per kilogram, one of the lowest intravenous doses of AAV used for any indication.

    "abstract": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-based targeted gene editing platforms are being developed to treat genetic diseases like hemophilia. Such novel therapy involves complex concepts and terminology that require aligned language to engage key stakeholders in the hemophilia community. Thus, a globally aligned gene editing lexicon - a consistent language to communicate the fundamentals of gene editing in hemophilia, designed to be credible and accessible for people with hemophilia and caregivers while avoiding unnecessary complexity - is required to address this need. To establish an aligned language and communications framework that facilitates informed consent and shared decision-making regarding gene editing and treatment considerations in hemophilia. Through an innovative partnership with global experts in hemophilia, gene editing, and biotechnology, initial insights were gathered via interviews, workshops, and analysis of existing language within the hemophilia community. Qualitative research involving lived experience experts (people with hemophilia and caregivers; <i>n</i> = 43) and hematologists (<i>n</i> = 24) informed the lexicon development, which was further validated by a steering committee of global experts in the hemophilia and gene editing fields. Finally, optimized language recommendations were developed for a clear, consistent gene editing lexicon. Key themes included insights into audience mindsets, guiding language principles, and optimized terminology for key topics like gene editing concepts and posttreatment considerations. Audience mindsets revealed cautious optimism around gene therapy, with more skepticism around gene editing. Guiding language principles indicated a preference for plainspoken over technical language, definitions that link to patient benefits, and explanations that highlight the precise nature of gene editing. This collaborative approach ensures broad adoption of the lexicon within the hemophilia community and readiness for beta testing."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy will very likely change the treatment paradigm of hemophilia B in the coming years. For the majority of patients, adjunctive exogenous factor (F)IX clotting factor concentrate will continue to be needed in case of surgery or bleeding. However, there is insufficient evidence on the optimal FIX product to be used in these circumstances, given the differences in body distribution between the currently available products. Unknown factors include the behavior of FIX Padua in the extravascular space and its contribution to hemostasis. Other issues are the potential importance of the presence of cross-reactive material and the discrepancies between different assays in measuring FIX activity. In conclusion, even after gene therapy, the differences between different FIX products remain relevant for optimal bleeding and perioperative management. Thus, real-world data on the use of exogenous FIX after gene therapy are needed to determine the preferred exogenous FIX concentrate."

The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy as prophylaxis, control of bleeding episodes, and safety of trenonacog alfa in previously treated participants aged <12 years with severe or moderately severe hemophilia B and no current or history of inhibitors. The study had 3 phases: (1) PK evaluation after a single infusion of 75 ± 5 IU/kg, (2) treatment phase in which participants received trenonacog alfa prophylaxis 35 to 75 IU/kg for 50 exposure days, and (3) a continuation phase in which prophylaxis could be administered for ≥50 additional exposure days. The PK of trenonacog alfa was comparable between adolescents and adults except for higher clearance, shorter mean residence time and elimination half-life, and lower incremental recovery. Prophylaxis resulted in a median annualized bleeding rate of 0.86 (mean = 2.34) for the combined treatment and continuation phases; 33.3% of participants had zero bleeds; and 83.7% of bleeds treated resolved with 1 or 2 infusions. One adverse event was possibly related to trenonacog alfa, a nonserious hypersensitivity reaction leading to early study termination. The efficacy and safety of trenonacog alfa for prophylaxis and bleeding treatment in previously treated pediatric participants were consistent with those reported for adults and adolescents. There appeared to be no clinically important differences between the results for participants aged <6 years and those aged 6 to <12 years. Trenonacog alfa is a suitable option for the management of pediatric persons with hemophilia B."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a coagulation disorder caused by deficiencies in clotting factors and is primarily classified into hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency). Current treatment relies predominantly on replacement therapy, where patients receive clotting factor concentrates either episodically or prophylactically to achieve hemostasis or mitigate bleeding risks. Despite its efficacy, this approach presents limitations, including suboptimal treatment accessibility due to high costs, reduced patient compliance from frequent intravenous administration, and therapeutic failure in patients developing plasma inhibitors. These challenges underscore the need for novel therapeutics addressing unmet clinical demands. On March 28, 2025, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved fitusiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutic for hemophilia. This first-in-class agent demonstrates pan-hemophilia efficacy by targeting antithrombin to enhance thrombin activity, irrespective of factor VIII/IX deficiency status or plasma inhibitor presence. By pioneering a mechanism of antithrombin suppression, enabling sustained therapeutic action, and facilitating precision monitoring protocols, fitusiran has the potential to redefine hemophilia treatment paradigms."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia, an X-linked genetic bleeding disorder, is caused by the deficiency of coagulation factors VIII (hemophilia A) or IX (hemophilia B). Regular replacement therapy with the missing clotting factor is an effective standard-of-care treatment. However, it comes with a significant fallout of frequent intravenous dosing with poor compliance, the risk of inhibitor development, and a substantial treatment burden. Research has progressed from missing clotting factors and factor VIII mimetics to the most recent rebalancing therapy that suppresses tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). Thrombin generation is restricted by TFPI, which inhibits the tissue factor-mediated activation of factor VII. This promising therapeutic approach rebalances hemostasis by inhibiting TFPI, a critical regulator of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, thereby increasing thrombin generation. Novel monoclonal antibodies (concizumab and marstacimab) enhance thrombin generation by blocking TFPI to restore hemostasis. Clinical trials have demonstrated good clinical efficacy and safety of these anti-TFPI, besides their convenient subcutaneous administration using pen devices. These innovative therapies have the potential to enhance the quality of life (QoL) of people with hemophilia. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical development, therapeutic potential, challenges, and prospects of anti-TFPI in the management of hemophilia."

However, designing highly efficient and precise integration of large DNA segments in somatic cells while avoiding unpredictable products remains challenging. Here, we devised a novel long-offset paired nicking target integration (LOTI) strategy, which enhances the capacity of Cas9 nickase (Cas9n) in targeted gene integration in somatic cells, yielding higher knock-in (KI) efficiency compared with classical nickase-based approaches. The underlying repair mechanism involves the DNA repair proteins Rad51 and Rad52, and Ligase I/III. Moreover, we achieved efficient KI of at least 1.5-kb gene fragments in hepatocytes and recovery 55% FIX activity in a hemophilia B mouse model using only one-dose plasmid DNA delivery. Compared with the Cas9-based strategy, LOTI reduces off-target activity and restricts the formulation of unwanted insertions and deletions (indels) at the target site. Thus, LOTI provides a precise and efficient strategy for gene integration in somatic cells in vivo."

This study included a cohort of 143 unrelated HB patients with diagnosed FIX levels. Genetic analysis of the <i>F9</i> gene was performed using DNA sequencing and other molecular techniques. Variant pathogenicity was classified following ACMG/AMP guidelines, supplemented by computational predictions and clinical data. A 100% variant detection rate was achieved, identifying 83 unique variants from 143 patients. Single nucleotide variants were predominant, with missense variants accounting for 71.08%. Of the 83 unique variants, 20 novel variants were identified, including six missenses, four nonsenses, four frameshifts, two large deletions, two in-frame deletions, and two splice-site variants. The serine protease domain contained the highest proportion of variants (49.4%). Pathogenicity analysis revealed a predominance of severe phenotypes (72.03%). Among the novel variants, twelve were classified as pathogenic, one as likely pathogenic, and seven as variants of uncertain significance. A noteworthy case was the NM_000133.4:c.-21C>T promoter variant associated with HB Leyden, which demonstrated age-dependent improvements in factor IX levels. This study expands the mutational spectrum of HB in the Vietnamese population and provide critical insights into genotype-phenotype correlations.

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B is a disease that affects the human coagulation system, causing the absence or deficiency of coagulation factor IX, which may manifest itself in uncontrolled bleeding that is life-threatening to patients. Due to its inheritance, the disease more often affects men, and the severity of symptoms directly correlates with the concentration of the missing factor IX; hence, the aim of therapy is to maintain it at a level that allows for sufficient hemostasis. The basic model of treatment offered to patients is based on primary prevention with coagulation factor IX with a prolonged half-life, which, however, does not solve the numerous problems faced by patients. An innovative proposal that, despite initial concerns, is becoming more and more popular every day is the recently approved genetic therapy in Europe, which uses viral vectors to transfer the correct gene that encodes coagulation factor IX. The introduction of a recombinant gene in place of its defective counterpart seems to be a promising solution and the beginning of a new era in which genetic therapies have a chance to develop their full potential and replace existing therapeutic regimens."

The most widely used laboratory test to measure factor IX (FIX) activity is the modified activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT, one-stage clotting assay [OSA]). Concerns emerged about albutrepenonacog alfa (Idelvion) impact on laboratory measurement. We aimed to evaluate a product-specific calibration curve for determining the activity of Idelvion in Argentina. In our nationwide, prospective, noninterventional study, a product-specific calibration standard (PCS) was prepared from a reconstituted vial. Commercial FIX-deficient plasma (FIXdp) spiked with Idelvion was used as a normal control (NC:0.7 IU/mL) and low control (LC:0.1 IU/mL). A drug-specific OSA calibration curve was constructed starting from 1.0 IU/mL, followed by serial dilutions. Thirteen different aPTT reagents were used. Thiry-six results from 27 Care Centers were retrieved. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) NC local standard human plasma (LSH) and NC PCSs were 0.48 IU/mL (0.38-0.92) and 0.72 IU/mL (0.58-0.82), respectively. Coefficients of variation (CVs) for NC LSH and PCS were 44.6% and 24.8%, respectively; recovery rates (± 20%) were 22% and 83%. Median LC LSH and PCS were 0.09 IU/mL (0.07-0.13) and 0.10 IU/mL (0.07-0.13), respectively; CVs for LC LSH and PCS were 104.8% and 24.7%. Recovery rates (±30%) were 58% and 89%. Idelvion-specific calibration curve showed better performance and lower CV rates independently of the aPTT reagent or the platform used. Calibration using this specific standard might allow more laboratories to obtain acceptable FIX values when processing NC and LC levels and patients' plasmas."

To evaluate PROs from the phase 3 explorer8 study (NCT04082429). Male patients aged ≥12 years with HA/HB without inhibitors were enrolled and randomized 1:2 to no prophylaxis/on-demand treatment (arm 1) or concizumab prophylaxis (arm 2) or allocated to concizumab prophylaxis (arms 3 and 4). PRO questionnaires included the 36-item short-form health survey version 2, Haemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults, Hemophilia Treatment Experience Measure, and Haemophilia Patient Preference Questionnaire. Estimated treatment difference for change in 36-item short-form health survey version 2 \"bodily pain\" and \"physical functioning\" from baseline to week 24 between patients in arms 1 and 2 was 9.5 points (95% CI, 2.4 to 16.7) and 0.3 points (95% CI, -5.1 to 5.6), respectively. Estimated treatment difference at week 24 between patients in arms 1 and 2 was -18.0 points (95% CI, -26.4 to -9.5) for Haemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults \"total score\" and -16.8 points (95% CI, -32.2 to -1.4) for \"physical health.\" Hemophilia Treatment Experience Measure and Haemophilia Patient Preference Questionnaire results favored concizumab prophylaxis over no prophylaxis or previous treatment. PRO data from the phase 3 explorer8 study provided additional support for concizumab prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis as a treatment option for patients with HA/HB."

To assess the PK parameters of pdFIX in children with severe HB and identify factors that influence FIX PK. This non-randomized, open-label PK study enrolled children with severe HB (FIX≤2 %). Patients received 50 IU± 5 IU/kg pdFIX (Human coagulation Factor IX-CTBB) after at least 96 h wash-out period. Blood samples for PK assessments were collected before infusion (pre-dose) and at 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 9 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h post-infusion. FIX activity was measured by a one-stage assay. Twenty patients were enrolled with a median age of 8.3 (range 1.8-15.4) years. The peak plasma levels of FIX: C in all patients were observed within 15 min. Their median terminal half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) was 32.6 (range 23.3-52.0) hours. The median values of in vivo recovery (IVR) at 15 min, clearance (CL), volume of distribution at state (Vss) and area under the curve (AUC) were 1.0 (0.9, 1.2) IU/dL per IU/kg, 5.2 (IQR 4.8, 6.4) mL/h/kg, 207.9 (IQR 183.5, 301.4) mL/kg, 9.77 (IQR 7.76, 11.23) U*h/mL respectively. The t<sub>1/2</sub>, Vss and mean residence time after intravenous injection (MRT) decreased with increasing age and body weight. Changes in CL with body weight were similar to t<sub>1/2</sub>, but no significant correlation exists with age. There is a significant inter-individual variability in PK profiles among Chinese children with severe HB, which is related to age and body weight changes, indicating the necessity of individualized prophylaxis driven by PK."

Current chemically inducible systems are limited by the rapid diffusion and extended metabolism of small molecules, and associated side effects. Here we develop a photoactivatable RNA adenosine base editor (PA-rABE) by harnessing a compact Cas13 variant and a split ADAR2 deaminase fused with the Magnets system, which is activated through blue-light-induced dimerization. PA-rABE achieves highly efficient editing on endogenous RNA with minimal bystander editing and off-target effects. By editing a phosphorylation site of the endogenous CTNNB1 gene, PA-rABE stabilizes the β-catenin protein and activates Wnt signaling in vivo. Using adeno-associated virus vectors to deliver PA-rABE along with an hF9 variant containing a premature termination codon, we show amelioration of clotting defects in hemophilia B mice upon illumination. In summary, PA-rABE offers a controlled RNA base-editing technology for diverse biomedical applications, enabling reversible and spatiotemporally specific modulation."

    "abstract": "Prophylactic treatment for hemophilia in India remains significantly underutilized compared to developed nations, leading to reliance on episodic therapy with limited long-term benefits. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of glycopegylated extended half-life (EHL) clotting factors in patients with hemophilia A and B. A retrospective observational design was employed, including 25 patients aged ≥18 years with moderate or severe hemophilia A or B who transitioned to EHL therapy. Hemophilia A patients (n=19) switched from standard half-life (SHL) factor VIII (FVIII) to weekly EHL FVIII prophylaxis, while hemophilia B patients (n=6) transitioned from on-demand SHL factor IX (FIX) to glycopegylated EHL FIX prophylaxis every 21 days. Outcomes were assessed through the annual bleeding rate (ABR), functional independence score in hemophilia (FISH score), and hemophilia joint health score (HJHS). A subset analysis for quality of life (QoL) was also performed on hemophilia A patients using the Haem-A-QoL questionnaire in patients with hemophilia A. Glycopegylated EHL FVIII therapy significantly reduced ABR and improved joint health and functional scores over 24 months (p<0.001). Hemophilia B patients demonstrated a significant reduction in ABR and joint bleeding rates at eight months (p<0.05). The study found that prophylaxis with individualized doses of glycopegylated EHL factors is not only effective in reducing bleeding episodes and improving joint health but also safe with improved treatment adherence, offering a viable prophylactic option in resource-constrained settings."

    "abstract": "Realistic paths to gene therapy for the X-linked bleeding disorder hemophilia started to materialize in the mid 1990s, resulting in disease correction in small and large animal models. Out of a diversity of approaches, in vivo adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene transfer to hepatocytes emerged as the most promising strategy, eventually forming the basis for multiple advanced clinical trials and regulatory approval of two products for the treatment of hemophilia B (coagulation factor IX deficiency) and one for hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency). Ideally, gene therapy is effective with a single administration, thus providing therapeutic factor levels over a period of years, without the need for frequent injections. Overcoming multiple obstacles, some not predicted by preclinical studies, sustained partial to complete correction of coagulation for several years to an entire decade has now been documented in patients, with observation ongoing. A hyperactive form of FIX improved efficacy in hemophilia B, and superior engineered variants of FVIII are emerging. Nonetheless, challenges remain, including pre-existing immunity to AAV capsids, toxicities, inter-patient variability in response to treatment, and difficulty in obtaining durable therapeutic expression of FVIII. In alternative approaches, in vivo gene editing and ex vivo gene therapies targeting hemopoietic cells are in development."

    "abstract": "One hemophilia treatment concept focuses on rebalancing coagulation and anticoagulation to restore normal blood clotting. Targeting the coagulation regulator, protein S (PS), in hemophilia shows promise to increase the generation of thrombin, a critical enzyme in the clotting process. This study aimed to: (1) assess whether inhibiting PS increases thrombin generation (TG) in plasma from individuals with hemophilia A (HA) and B (HB); and (2) develop a hepatocyte-targeted PS small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy using N-acetylgalactosamine conjugation to restore hemostasis in hemophilia without increasing thromboembolic risks. We assessed TG in plasma from patients with HA and HB. To target the liver specifically, we developed a PS-siRNA conjugated with N-acetylgalactosamine. This approach ensures that PS levels remain adequate in other cells, thereby minimizing the risk of thrombosis. Additionally, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of PS-siRNA in preclinical models. Inhibiting PS with a polyclonal antibody in plasma resulted in a 3- to 5-fold increase in TG in HA and a 4- to 9-fold increase in HB plasma, with a 70% reduction in plasma PS. In preclinical models, subcutaneous PS-siRNA therapy in HA mice and nonhuman primates successfully lowered PS levels and improved clot formation. It also prevented bleeding in both saphenous vein puncture and knee injury models in HA mice. Notably, it enhanced clotting without triggering widespread clot formation. Reducing PS levels enhances TG in hemophilia models, and PS-siRNA therapy shows promise in improving hemostasis. This approach warrants further clinical investigation as a potential treatment for hemophilia."

This study aimed to describe the profile of HA and HB patients, current disease management, clinical burden and costs. Data related to haemophilia patients of all ages alive on 1/1/2022 were extracted from the nationwide French claims database (SNDS). Patients were divided into four treatment groups: on-demand or prophylaxis with or without inhibitors. Haemophilia patients were compared with a control group (ratio 1:3) matched for age, gender and region using risk ratios (RR [95% confidence interval]). The annual direct health care costs per person were estimated. A total of 5,577 (HA) and 1,332 (HB) patients were included (mean age: 36.4 years). Most patients were treated on-demand (HA: 72.8%; HB: 76.6%) and a few had inhibitors (HA: 3.6%; HB: 1.1%). Overall, haemophilia clinical burden was significantly higher than among controls, in particular, mortality (RR:1.42 [1.04-1.92]), work disability (RR: 2.71 [2.22-3.30]), hospitalisation for major bleeding (RR:12.06 [8.67-16.80]), orthopaedic surgery (RR: 2.97 [2.65-3.32]) and hospitalisation all causes (RR: 2.44 [2.31-2.58]). This burden was more important in patients with inhibitors or treated in prophylaxis and was close for HA and HB patients. The annual per-person costs were €282,560 and €181,566 for HA and HB in prophylaxis without inhibitors, respectively. The population with inhibitors, although limited, had even much higher costs. The clinical burden and costs of haemophilia treatments may be very high especially in patients in prophylaxis and/or with inhibitors."

It is well-known that PA affects overall health including bone quality. This study aims to evaluate the level of PA within the different haemophilia severity phenotypes and to elaborate on the interplay of PA in regard to bone quality (bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS)) as well as lean mass. This investigation was part of a large prospective single-center cohort study examining the relation between haemophilia and osteoporosis registered at clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT04524481). PwH underwent a dual x-ray screening using Horizon™ to examine BMD, TBS, and lean mass. Step activity was tracked electronically for seven consecutive days after clinical examination, supported by a self-reported activity diary for seven days. Handgrip strength was examined as an overall fitness proxy. Data of 223 patients with either mild (N = 45), moderate (N = 46), or severe (N = 132) haemophilia A or B, aged 43.6 ± 15.6 years were analyzed. There was no significant difference in objective (p = 0.162) and subjective (p = 0.459) PA levels between severity phenotypes. The most frequent type of PA in all severities was walking (n = 72, 53.3%) and cycling (n = 60, 44.4%). Step activity positively correlated with TBS (rho = 0.202, p = 0.005) and lean mass positively correlated with BMD (rho = 0.309, p < 0.001). Handgrip strength correlated with BMD (rho = 0.361, p < 0.001) as well as TBS (rho = 0.221, p = 0.021) and lean mass (rho = 0.287, p = 0.003). PA does not differ significantly between the severity phenotypes. The majority of PwH in all severity phenotypes performed low-impact PA, which is most likely insufficient to positively affect BMD. However, handgrip strength correlates with BMD and TBS. Despite restrictions in movement function or reduced BMD, it is of major importance to promote PA to maintain a healthy or even increase bone quality."

Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, two gRNAs targeting exon 8 of the f9a gene, were injected along with Cas9 protein into single-cell zebrafish wild-type embryos. DNA was harvested from the tail tips of the resulting adult zebrafish and screened for mutations using PCR. The founder mutant was crossed with wild-type fish to confirm heritability and subsequently reared to homozygosity. Homozygous mutants were analyzed through quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot to assess f9a RNA and F9a protein levels, respectively. Functional assays like kinetic partial thromboplastin time (kPTT), bleeding assay in adult mutants, and venous laser injury on mutant larvae were performed to assess the hemostatic role. Around 61 adults from the CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts were screened, which resulted in a mutant line with a 72 bp deletion in the exon 8 encoding catalytic domain. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western Blot analysis showed reduced levels of f9a RNA and F9a protein in the homozygous mutants compared to wild-type siblings. At five dpf, f9a homozygous mutant larvae demonstrated prolonged venous occlusion times in a laser injury assay. Additionally, plasma from the mutants displayed delayed fibrin formation in kPTT assays and exhibited increased bleeding after mechanical injury. This study created a zebrafish f9a knockout model that mimics the bleeding phenotype observed in hemophilia B patients, which will be valuable for evaluating novel therapeutic approaches for hemophilia B."

To analyse the prevalence of comorbidities and mortality in people with haemophilia (PwH) compared to matched controls in subgroups (factor consumption and sex). This study used longitudinal individual-level data (11 years) from national registers in three Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland and Sweden) from the MIND study (NCT03276130) for PwH and matched controls (1:5 on birth year and sex). It compared the prevalence of arthropathy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, depression, anxiety, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, diabetes, cancer, kidney disease and epilepsy, and mortality. Three severity subgroups for PwH were identified by use of factor concentrates and sex, including female carriers. Data for 2716 PwH (24,921 person-years) were analysed. PwH had increased prevalence of single and multiple comorbidities (p < 0.001), and increased mortality (p < 0.001). Arthropathy was more prevalent in all male PwH subgroups in Nordic countries, and among women including carriers in Sweden (odds ratios: ∼2→12). Arthropathy was a concomitant comorbidity alongside depression, hypertension, cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, hepatitis and HIV. Hypertension was more prevalent for PwH than controls in most subgroups. Hepatitis and HIV had the highest odds ratios among PwH in Denmark and Sweden. Arthropathy occurs in combination with a complex of comorbidities. The potential common pathophysiologic denominator should be further explored. Higher prevalence of comorbidities and mortality rates in men and women with haemophilia call for a holistic approach with more ambitious treatment goals for PwH across severities and sexes.

    "title": "Could PTH/Ca Ratio Serve as a New Marker for Evaluating Bone Metabolism in Hemophilia Patients?",
    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Low bone mineral density (BMD) is common in hemophilia patients. Identifying high-risk patients for low BMD early is essential to prevent complications and reduce morbidity. The parathyroid hormone (PTH)/calcium (Ca) ratio is a cost-effective marker for predicting BMD, highlighting the need for routine screening and early intervention in this population. Hemophilia is a hereditary bleeding disorder caused by deficiencies in clotting factors VIII (hemophilia A) and IX (hemophilia B). Patients with hemophilia are at risk of low bone mineral density (BMD). This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of low BMD, associated risk factors, and raise awareness regarding its significance in hemophilia patients. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively assessed bone metabolism in 62 hemophilia patients followed at our center. BMD was evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Additionally, serum levels of 25-OH-D3, alkaline phosphatase, PTH, Ca, phosphor, and creatinine were measured. The PTH/Ca, PTH/25-OH-D3, and Ca×25-OH-D3/PTH ratios were calculated. <b>Results:</b> The median age of the 62 patients with hemophilia included in the study (hemophilia A: 87.1%, hemophilia B: 12.9%) was 37 years (range: 21-66), and all were male. Of these patients, 67.7% (<i>n</i> = 42) had severe, 21% (<i>n</i> = 13) had moderate, and 11.3% (<i>n</i> = 7) had mild hemophilia. A total of 85.5% of patients were on factor prophylaxis, and 75.4% had a target joint. In laboratory analysis, the median 25-OH-D3 level was 13.4 µg/L and 75% patients had 25-OH-D3 deficiency. According to DEXA results, 62.9% had lower than normal BMD. When we divided the patients into normal and low BMD groups according to DEXA results, weight (<i>p</i> = 0.006), height (<i>p</i> = 0.024), factor levels (<i>p</i> = 0.004), PTH (<i>p</i> = 0.010), AST (<i>p</i> = 0.029), and PTH/Ca (<i>p</i> = 0.011) levels were statistically significantly different between the groups. The severity of the disease and the rate of receiving prophylaxis were higher in the group with low BMD (<i>p</i> = 0.015, <i>p</i> = 0.006, respectively). In multivariate analysis, PTH/Ca ratio and weight were found to be independent risk factors for BMD. A linear relationship was found between PTH/Ca ratio and BMD. The optimal cut-off value for PTH/Ca was 6.57, with a selectivity of 65% and specificity of 82%. When we divided the patients into groups according to the cut-off value of 6.57, we found that the probability of low BMD increased approximately 7-fold in the group with PTH/Ca > 6.57 (OR 7.045, 95% CI 1.485-33.42, <i>p</i> = 0.014). There was an inverse association between patient weight and low BMD (<i>p</i> = 0.043). <b>Conclusions:</b> Low BMD is a critical public health concern frequently observed in patients with hemophilia. The study highlights a high rate of low BMD and 25-OH-D3 deficiency in hemophilia patients, with the PTH/Ca ratio shown to be useful in predicting BMD. The PTH/Ca ratio is suggested as an accessible, cost-effective, and practical test for evaluating BMD in hemophilia patients."

The original dose regimen (ODR) of 80 mg monthly was optimized to AT-DR targeting AT activity levels 15% to 35% to mitigate thrombotic risk (starting dose of 50 mg once every 2 months, individually adjusted to 20 mg once every 2 months, or 20/50/80 mg monthly as needed). Primary and secondary end points were safety and efficacy, respectively. Integrated safety analyses assessed safety of AT-DR and ODR across all fitusiran studies and integrated efficacy analyses compared efficacy of AT-DR in ATLAS-OLE with phase 3 parent study control groups. At interim data cutoff, 213 participants were enrolled on AT-DR (78% on regimens of once every 2 months).

    "abstract": "Haemophilia A and B are congenital X-linked bleeding disorders resulting from deficiencies in clotting factors VIII (haemophilia A) and IX (haemophilia B). Patients with severe deficiency, defined as having less than 1% of normal plasma factor activivity, often have spontaneous bleeding within the first few years of life. Those with moderate and mild deficiencies typically present with post-traumatic or post-surgical bleeding later in life. A high index of suspicion and measurement of factor activity in plasma facilitates early diagnosis. In the 21st century, therapeutic advances and comprehensive care have substantially improved both mortality and morbidity associated with these conditions. Management strategies for haemophilia include on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes and all surgeries and regular treatment (ie, prophylaxis) aimed at reducing bleeds, morbidity, and mortality, thereby enhancing quality of life. Treatment options include factor replacement therapy, non-replacement therapies that increase thrombin generation, and gene therapies that facilitate in vivo clotting factor synthesis. The therapies differ in their use for prophylaxis and on-demand treatment, the mode and frequency of administration, duration of treatment effect, degree of haemostatic protection, and side-effects. Monitoring the effectiveness of these prophylactic therapies involves assessing annual bleeding rates and joint damage. Personalised management strategies, which align treatment with individual goals (eg, playing competitive sports), initiated at diagnosis and maintained throughout the lifespan, are crucial for optimal outcomes. These strategies are facilitated by a multidisciplinary team and supported by clinician-led education for both clinicians and patients."

Two rFVIIa products are commercially approved for use in the United States and the European Union. Eptacog alfa and eptacog beta share the same amino acid sequence but differ in posttranslational modifications. Although rFVIIa has been used to manage bleeding in persons with hemophilia and inhibitors for over 30 years, its mechanisms of action is still being studied. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies have suggested that rFVIIa could promote hemostasis by (1) increasing tissue factor-dependent activation of factor (F)X (FX); (2) directly activating FX on the surface of activated platelets; and (3) downregulating protein C anticoagulant activity through binding to the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR). Studies of rFVIIa and rFVIIa variants in murine models demonstrate that platelet-dependent activity is sufficient for hemostatic efficacy. Dosing levels required in clinical practice are most consistent with a platelet-dependent mechanism of action. However, <i>in vivo</i> models also suggest that pathways involving EPCR binding contribute to rFVIIa hemostatic activity. Eptacog beta displays increased platelet- and EPCR-dependent endothelial cell binding compared to eptacog alfa. Thus, the relative contribution of these mechanisms to the overall hemostatic efficacy of eptacog alfa and eptacog beta may differ. Further research is required to assess the clinical relevance of these differences. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which rFVIIa promotes hemostasis in patients will provide insights when evaluating clinical outcomes of safety and efficacy for innovative bypassing therapies."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B is an inherited disorder caused by a mutation in the FIX gene, which results in insufficient blood clotting factor IX (FIX) production from hepatocytes. Currently, there are no treatments for hemophilia B patients. The patients should be continuously administrated with clotting factor concentrates 2-3 times a month to prevent bleeding. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an engineered FIX-secreting hepatocyte sheet that can release FIX for an extended period. Within this study, the engineered FIX-secreting hepatocyte sheet was developed by integrating two core technologies, including a gene editing platform to generate FIX-secreting cells and cell sheet technology to improve cell delivery efficacy. The human FIX gene was inserted into the APOC3 site of iPSCs by CRISPR/Cas9, which secretes the target protein after differentiation into hepatocytes. FIX-secreting hepatocyte sheets were obtained by temperature-responsive polymer grafted cell culture dishes (TRCD). Immunohistochemical and functional tests were performed for hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from FIX KI-iPSCs and wild-type iPSCs (WT-iPSCs). After validating the functional activity and secretion of FIX protein, the engineered hepatocyte-like cell sheets were transplanted to NOD/SCID mice for the in vivo experiments. The insertion of the human FIX gene into the APOC3 site demonstrated a significant increase in FIX secretion in hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from FIX KI-iPSCs compared with those obtained from WT-iPSCs. Among the iPSCs to hepatocyte differentiation stages, the hepatic endoderm stage was most suitable for seeding the cells on TRCD and generating cell sheets by temperature changes from 37<sup>o</sup>C to room temperature when the hepatocyte-like cells have reached maturity. The engineered FIX-secreting cell sheets showed intensive expression of the FIX proteins without losing hepatocyte morphology for 20 days. Furthermore, an in vivo study showed that engineered FIX-secreting cell sheets retained their FIX secretion functions for two weeks, whereas single-cell injected traditionally were barely detected in the experimental animals. The engineered FIX-secreting cell sheets fabricated from functionally improved iPSCs with practical cell delivery tools could be a promising tool for clinically treating Hemophilia B."

    "title": "Multiplex, multimodal mapping of variant effects in secreted proteins.",
    "abstract": "Despite widespread advances in DNA sequencing, the functional consequences of most genetic variants remain poorly understood. Multiplexed Assays of Variant Effect (MAVEs) can measure the function of variants at scale, and are beginning to address this problem. However, MAVEs cannot readily be applied to the ~10% of human genes encoding secreted proteins. We developed a flexible, scalable human cell surface display method, Multiplexed Surface Tethering of Extracellular Proteins (MultiSTEP), to measure secreted protein variant effects. We used MultiSTEP to study the consequences of missense variation in coagulation factor IX (FIX), a serine protease where genetic variation can cause hemophilia B. We combined MultiSTEP with a panel of antibodies to detect FIX secretion and post-translational modification, measuring a total of 44,816 effects for 436 synonymous variants and 8,528 of the 8,759 possible missense variants. 49.6% of possible <i>F9</i> missense variants impacted secretion, post-translational modification, or both. We also identified functional constraints on secretion within the signal peptide and for nearly all variants that caused gain or loss of cysteine. Secretion scores correlated strongly with FIX levels in hemophilia B and revealed that loss of secretion variants are particularly likely to cause severe disease. Integration of the secretion and post-translational modification scores enabled reclassification of 63.1% of <i>F9</i> variants of uncertain significance in the <i>My Life, Our Future</i> hemophilia genotyping project. Lastly, we showed that MultiSTEP can be applied to a wide variety of secreted proteins. Thus, MultiSTEP is a multiplexed, multimodal, and generalizable method for systematically assessing variant effects in secreted proteins at scale."

    "abstract": "Treatment options for patients with hemophilia (PWH) have changed substantially in the last years. This study aimed to compare hemophilia treatment in the eastern part of Germany in 2021 with data from 2015. Substitution diaries and patient records of PWH from 2021 were collected in 13 hemophilia centers from the \"Kompetenznetz Hämorrhagische Diathese Ost\" (KHDO) and compared with 2015. A total of 130 children and 357 adults, 411 hemophilia A (HA) and 76 hemophilia B (HB), were included in 2021, and 359 were already analyzed in 2015. In 2021, 97.8% of children and 95.7% of adults with severe hemophilia had prophylaxis compared with 98.8 and 80.2% in 2015. Plasma-derived concentrates were used in 25.6%, recombinant in 30.2%, extended half-life (EHL) factor concentrates in 24.4%, and emicizumab in 19.8% of the children with severe HA (sHA). In adults with sHA, plasma-derived, recombinant concentrates, EHL, and emicizumab were used in 21.0, 33.2, 31.2, and 14.2%, respectively. All children and 93.3% of the adults with severe HB (sHB) were on EHL. Median annual factor consumption per body weight increased in adults with sHA, remained stable in children with sHA and adults with sHB, and decreased in children with sHB between 2015 and 2021. Annualized bleeding rate (ABR) decreased in children with sHB and sHA. The use of EHL and emicizumab has changed hemophilia treatment. About 50% of the sHA patients switched to EHL or emicizumab and almost all sHB patients to EHL. More adults with sHA received prophylaxis and ABR decreased in children."

    "abstract": "Prophylaxis with coagulation factor concentrates is the mainstay of treatment in severe hemophilia A and B. Data on bleeding rates in persons with congenital haemophilia B (PwcHB) receiving prophylaxis are inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis were aimed at assessing bleeding outcomes, including annualised bleeding rates (ABR) and the proportion of patients with zero bleeding events, in PwcHB receiving prophylaxis with plasma-derived or recombinant FIX products with standard (rSHL) or extended half-life (rEHL). A systematic search was conducted using the bibliographic database Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42024592785). The search yielded 2440 citations and a total of 42 studies (2 randomised and 40 nonrandomised) were included in the final analysis. The pooled estimated mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) ABR was significantly lower in PwcHB treated prophylactically with rEHL FIX than in those receiving rSHL FIX products (1.29 [95% CI: 0.91, 1.66] vs. 3.12 [95% CI: 2.63, 3.62], p < 0.01). The proportion of participants with zero bleeding events was significantly higher in PwcHB treated prophylactically with rEHL FIX than in those receiving rSHL FIX (0.53 [95% CI: 0.37, 0.69] vs. 0.24 [95% CI: 0.14, 0.39], p = 0.01). The ABR did not differ according to age groups (more or less than 12 years). The results of this meta-analysis suggest that compared to standard half-life FIX concentrates, prophylaxis with rEHL FIX products is associated with a reduction in ABR and a higher proportion of patients with no bleeding episodes."

We report final data from the B-SURE study, evaluating the real-world usage and effectiveness of rFIXFc in France. Previously treated patients (all ages/severities) received on-demand or prophylactic rFIXFc during B-SURE. Annualised bleeding rate (ABR), injection frequency (IF) and factor consumption (FC) were prospectively evaluated for patients on rFIXFc prophylaxis (primary endpoints). Six months of retrospective factor IX (FIX) data were collected for comparison; patients with ⩾3 months of treatment pre- and post-switch to rFIXFc were analysed. B-SURE was a 24-month, prospective, non-interventional, real-world study across haemophilia treatment centres in France. Ninety-one male patients enrolled across 21 centres (34% <18 years, 89% severe haemophilia B). Eighty-four patients received prophylaxis at rFIXFc initiation; mean prospective observation period was 21.5 months. Sixty-eight of 84 patients had prior FIX prophylaxis; on rFIXFc prophylaxis, these patients achieved low median ABR (1.2), IF (47.45 injections/year) and mean FC (2844 IU/kg/year). Compared with previous FIX, mean ABR was reduced by 40% (<i>n</i> = 63); mean IF and FC were reduced by 38.20 injections/year and 1008 IU/kg/year (<i>n</i> = 57).

Most physicians and patients were satisfied/highly satisfied with rFIXFc prophylaxis. rFIXFc was well tolerated with no new safety concerns. Findings support the safety and effectiveness of rFIXFc, with reduced IF and FC while maintaining/improving bleed protection. <b><i>Trial registration</i>:</b> NCT03655340."

    "abstract": "In an effort to expedite the publication of articles, AJHP is posting manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. Hemophilia B is a rare, hereditary bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency in clotting factor IX (FIX). Traditional therapeutic strategies involve an economically and physically burdensome combination of prophylactic and episodic (ie, on-demand) administration of clotting factor concentrates (CFCs). The first gene therapy for hemophilia B, etranacogene dezaparvovec (Hemgenix), was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2022, with approval for fidanacogene elaparvovec (Beqvez) following in April 2024, produced by CSL Behrig and Pfizer, respectively. This literature review aims to provide an overview of current therapeutic strategies for the treatment of hemophilia B, introducing and focusing on the efficacy and safety of the novel gene therapies etranacogene dezaparvovec and fidanacogene elaparvovec. Both FDA-approved hemophilia B gene therapies, etranacogene dezaparvovec and fidanacogene elaparvovec, utilize adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for delivery of the gene encoding FIX. Each of these medications has a distinct AAV serotype, but they have the same treatment modality, with the goal of curing the disease and reducing or eliminating prophylactic CFC requirements. Despite their different AAV serotypes, both products deliver a functional copy of the gene encoding the Padua variant (variant R338L) of human FIX. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy in increasing FIX concentrations leading to reduced frequency of spontaneous bleeding episodes; however, safety and response durability remain concerns. For the first time in history, individuals with hemophilia B have access to potentially curative therapies through gene therapy. Both etranacogene dezaparvovec and fidanacogene elaparvovec offer significant efficacy, reducing the number of bleeding episodes and raising FIX concentrations with a single lifetime administration. While concerns remain regarding long-term safety and durability, these therapies represent a major advancement in reducing treatment burden and improving quality of life for patients. The future of hemophilia B management now holds the promise of greater independence from frequent prophylactic treatments."

The anti-inflammatory and extracellular tissue repair-stimulating properties of SVF increase its effectiveness in regeneration and repair mechanisms. One of the most common symptoms of hemophilia A and B is hemophilic arthropathy (HA). If HA is not adequately managed initially, patients may require major surgery, including total joint arthroplasty. In a 34-year-old male patient who was treated with intraarticular adipose-derived SVF with the diagnosis of hemophilia B and right grade 4 hemophilic knee arthrosis, clinical and radiological scores showed significant improvement in the 3rd month, 6th month, and 1st year controls after the procedure. Intraarticular adipose-derived SVF treatment should be kept in mind as an effective treatment option with minimal invasiveness and few side effects in HA that does not respond to conservative treatments."

Typically associated with intravascular coagulation, AVN is extremely rare in patients with bleeding disorders such as hemophilia B. In this report, we describe the therapeutic management of a 46-year-old male with hemophilia B, presenting with chronic left hip pain and AVN of the femoral head. He presented with progressive groin pain for 6 months and was unable to ambulate without the assistance of crutches. Radiographs showed evidence of degenerative joint disease secondary to AVN of the femoral head. After exhausting treatment options, the patient elected to proceed with an elective total hip arthroplasty. Intricate preoperative planning and hemophilia management were required by a multidisciplinary team to mitigate bleeding risks and promote success of the surgery. Postoperatively, the patient experienced a short-term rise in creatinine, but experienced no bleeding complications. The long-term follow-up revealed significant functional improvement without any complications of hemophilia B. There are no reports outlining AVN in hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) or step-by-step treatment strategies for successful hip replacement in these patients."

A cross-sectional multicenter study covering persons with MHA and MHB in Sweden, Finland, and Norway. Inhibitors were analyzed with the Bethesda assay, and NNAs were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Plasma samples from 137 MoHem study participants (median age 29 years; Q1-Q3, 15-54) were analyzed. NNAs were present in 11 of 82 (13%) of people with MHA and 7 of 55 (13%) of those with MHB irrespective of prophylactic or on-demand treatment, most frequently after 150 exposure days (EDs). Three NNA positive patients had a history of high-titer inhibitor, but current analyses were negative (<0.6 BU/mL). Baseline FVIII/FIX activity was similar among NNA positive and negative patients. Current bleeding rates were low, but patients with NNAs captured a higher Hemophilia Joint Health Score (7 [median]; Q1-Q3, 3-20 vs. 4; 1-9) (<i>P</i> = .02) and had more frequently undergone arthroplasty or arthrodesis (5 [33%] vs. 15 [13%]) (<i>P</i> = .03). NNAs were detected in 13% of Nordic persons with MHA and MHB, most frequently after 150 EDs. Patients with NNAs had more severe hemophilic arthropathy than patients without NNAs. The relationship between NNAs and clinical outcome in hemophilia should be further explored in a large cohort including pharmacokinetics and longitudinal observations with repeated blood sampling."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B is a genetic disorder characterized by clotting factor IX deficiency and bleeding in joints and muscles. Current treatments involve intravenous infusion of plasma-derived products or recombinant proteins, which have limited efficacy due to the short half-life of infused proteins. Recently, gene therapy for bleeding disorders has offered a potential solution. This study aimed to develop an in vitro gene therapy model using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to incorporate the <i>F9</i> cDNA in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to produce clotting factor IX. RNA guide sequences targeting the promoter-exon 1 region of the <i>F9</i> gene were designed to incorporate a wild-type <i>F9</i> cDNA into the cells. Knockin was performed with the CRISPR/Cas9 system and pDONOR-CMV/cDNAF9/IRES/EGFP vector template recombination in Lenti-X HEK293 cells and MSCs. A lentiviral <i>F9</i> cDNA vector was designed as a FIX secretor model to validate the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Results showed successful gene editing and <i>F9</i> expression in both cell models, although editing efficiency was lower in hMSCs. Future investigations will focus on improving gene editing efficiency using different transfection conditions or hybrid methodologies. This study demonstrates the potential of CRISPR/Cas9-based gene therapy in hMSCs as a target for hemophilia B. Further optimizations are required to translate these findings into clinical applications."

To assess the association between genetic variants, endogenous factor (F)IX levels over time, treatment, and bleeding phenotype in children with HB Leyden. Data on genetic variants, FIX levels at diagnosis and over time, bleeding, and treatment details were extracted from the international PedNet in children with hemophilia born since 2000. Of 457 individuals with HB, 24 showed an HB Leyden genotype. The most frequent F9 variant was c.-35G>A, affecting 14 individuals, followed by c.-35G>C (n = 4), c.-49T>A (n = 2), and c.-52C>T, c.-34A>G, and c.-22delT (n = 1 each). Major clinical differences in bleeding and treatment modality were observed when comparing c.-35G>A with non-c.-35G>A genotypes. For all children with a c.-35G>A genotype, FIX levels increased before the age of 4 years but did not normalize over time, irrespective of initial severity. In children with non-c.-35G>A genotypes, an increase in FIX was less common (4/9) and occurred later. HB Leyden is caused by the variant c.-35G>A in >50% of cases in whom a FIX increase occurs at very young ages, which is associated with low bleeding rates. This contrasts with the phenotype of individuals with HB Leyden due to a non-c.-35G>A variant. Our study may thus help guide clinical decision-making in this rare HB entity."

    "title": "Invasive Intracranial Electroencephalography Monitoring in the Child with a Bleeding Disorder: Challenges and Considerations.",
    "abstract": "Hereditary bleeding disorders stem from the absence or insufficient levels of particular clotting proteins, essential for facilitating coagulation in the clotting cascade. Among the most prevalent are hemophilia A (deficiency of factor VIII), hemophilia B (deficiency of factor IX), and von Willebrand disease (VWD). Management of pharmacoresistant epilepsy is more difficult in a patient with bleeding disorder due to increased risk of bleeding during surgery. While patients who have both a bleeding disorder and epilepsy are rare, reporting on the management of these patients who may require intracranial monitoring for pharmacoresistant epilepsy offers valuable insights into the challenges and considerations necessary for safely navigating the complex intersection of bleeding risk and seizure control. Two patients with bleeding disorders (VWD and factor XI deficiency) underwent invasive intracranial monitoring for medical refractory epilepsy followed by epilepsy focus resection surgery. Both patients were found to have a bleeding disorder during their preoperative laboratory work. After abnormal laboratories were reported, both patients were referred to hematology for further evaluation and surgical planning. The first patient was a 10-year-old boy with medically refractory focal epilepsy who was found to have type IIM VWD. He underwent surgery for subdural grid placement followed by resection on postoperative day 6. He required wilate® (human von Willebrand factor/coagulation factor VIII complex) infusions from the day of surgery prior to surgery through postoperative day 14. The second case was a 2-year-old boy with a history of tuberous sclerosis and medically refractory epilepsy who was found to have factor XI deficiency (hemophilia C) who required fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusions throughout his hospitalization. He underwent surgery for sEEG followed by resection of the tubers. Both patients remained stable throughout their invasive monitoring and completed epilepsy resection surgeries without reported complications. Both patients achieved seizure freedom after surgery since their most recent follow-up of 1 month and 13 months. The two patients successfully underwent invasive neuromonitoring with subdural grids and sEEG for seizure focus identification followed by resective epilepsy surgery without bleeding complications while achieving seizure freedom. While epilepsy patients with a bleeding disorder should not automatically be denied surgery due to the increased risk of hemorrhage, it is crucial that any decision is based on a comprehensive, multidisciplinary evaluation. This case report highlights the potential for future meta-analysis and further conversations regarding improved protocols for patients with bleeding disorders."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B, or Christmas disease, is a hemorrhagic inherited disorder. Previous studies have reported measurement discrepancies in factor VIII activity between clot-based and chromogenic assays in approximately one-third of patients with non-severe hemophilia A. However, similar discrepancies in hemophilia B have been less extensively studied. This research compares clot-based and chromogenic assays in 33 patients with non-severe hemophilia B and investigates the mutations associated with these discrepancies. Citrate and EDTA samples were collected from 33 patients with non-severe hemophilia B at Iran's hemophilia comprehensive care center. Clinical information was also gathered. Both clot-based and chromogenic assays were performed on these patients. DNA was extracted from the EDTA samples for those with discrepancies in the test results, and PCR was conducted to sequence their genes to find mutations. Among 33 plasma samples from patients with non-severe hemophilia B, 7 showed a measurement discrepancy according to the definition of ISTH (<0.5, >2.0, or an absolute difference >10), which includes both reverse and classic types of discrepancies. In this study, mutations that previously did not show contradictory results now exhibit discrepancies. A difference in classification was observed in 21 % of the patients. The findings indicate that the impact of specific mutations varies depending on the assay conditions. In addition to mutations, other factors also play a role in this discrepancy. Both types of assays are essential for the accurate diagnosis and classification of hemophilia B."

This included 20 case reports and four case series which addressed various dental treatment procedures performed on people with mild/moderate/severe hemophilia A or hemophilia B. A total of 28 patients were presented with a mean age of 20.4 years. The pre-treatment factor ranged from 200 to 2500 IU and the post-treatment factor range was 1000-3000 IU. There was a wide range of variation in the utilization of prophylactic factors for dental treatment procedures among people with hemophilia. This variation highlights the need for larger prospective clinical studies that address the rationale for using clotting factor concentrate and its impact on dental treatment outcomes for individuals with mild, moderate, or severe hemophilia."

Postoperatively, on day 4, the patient developed wound dehiscence and impending compartment syndrome. During revision surgery, a significant quantity of blood clots was removed, without any active bleeders. Due to the uncertain diagnosis, thromboelastography (TEG) analysis was done, which showed a fibrinolytic pattern, and the patient's factor IX level was found to be 4% of the normal value.

We conducted a systematic literature review of model-based CEAs of haemophilia treatments by searching databases, the Tufts Medical Center CEA registry, and grey literature. We summarized and qualitatively synthesized the approaches and results of the included CEAs, without a meta-analysis due the diversity of the studies. 32 eligible studies were performed in 12 countries and reported 53 pairwise comparisons. Most studies analysed patients with haemophilia A rather than haemophilia B. Comparisons of prophylactic versus on-demand treatment indicated that prophylaxis may not be cost-effective, but there was no clear consensus. Emicizumab was generally cost-effective compared with clotting factor treatments and was always dominant for patients with inhibitors. Immune tolerance induction following a Malmö protocol was found to be cost-effective compared to bypassing agents, while there was no consensus for the other protocols. Gene therapies as well as treatment with extended half-life coagulation factors were always cost-effective over their comparators. Studies were highly heterogenous regarding their time horizons, model structures, the inclusion of bleeding-related mortality and quality-of-life impacts. This heterogeneity limited the comparability of the studies. 19 of the 32 included studies received industry funding, which may have biased their results. It was not possible to perform a quantitative synthesis of the results due to the heterogeneity of the underlying studies. Differences in results between previous CEAs may have been driven by heterogeneity in modelling approaches, clinical input data, and potential funding biases. A more consistent evidence base and modelling approach would enhance the comparability between CEAs."

To assess the incidence of rebleeding and review treatment outcomes in subjects with haemophilia with inhibitors enrolled in the phase 3 PERSEPT 1 clinical trial. To treat mild/moderate bleeding episodes (BEs), subjects administered an initial 75 or 225µg/kg dose of eptacog beta, followed (if necessary) by additional 75µg/kg doses at predefined intervals until bleed control. This analysis used subject-reported rebleeding to determine a rebleeding incidence for the first 24 h. Rebleeding through later timepoints was an exploratory, intention-to-treat analysis of bleed treatment data. Four hundred and sixty-five BEs were analysed. Through 24 h, the proportion of rebleeds was 0% (initial 75µg/kg dose) and 0.5% (initial 225µg/kg dose). Through 48 h, the proportion of rebleeds was 3.2% (75µg/kg initial dose) and 5.6% (225µg/kg initial dose); the difference between initial dose strategies was not statistically significant. The majority of rebleeds were controlled with a single dose of eptacog beta and no subject who treated a rebleed required hospitalization. Subjects with haemophilia with inhibitors who used eptacog beta to treat mild/moderate BEs experienced a low incidence of rebleeding. Rebleeds that did occur were effectively controlled with eptacog beta (median, one dose) without the need for hospitalization."

    "abstract": "The history of hemophilia is well documented, yet reports focus heavily on the male perspective and severe forms of the disease. Although hemophilia was initially believed to only affect men with women seen as silent carriers, it is now universally acknowledged that women and girls can also be affected. In this narrative review, we tracked the progression of beliefs about women and hemophilia as documented in the literature from pre-1800s to the present time. We present a timeline of evolving beliefs and testing practices and identified 9 distinct time periods when key shifts occurred related to various scientific discoveries. Our review highlights how women affected by hemophilia experienced complete dismissal of their health issues despite evidence of bleeding symptoms as early as the 1900s. We identified 1990 as a major timepoint for shifting beliefs when large scale acknowledgment that hemophilia also affects women is documented and systematic testing for bleeding risk is first suggested. Women evolve from being seen as unaffected genetic transmitters only, to being recognized as a population affected by hemophilia in unique ways requiring timely testing and effective treatment. Yet, despite this clear progress, recent publications continue to document many persistent issues such as delayed diagnosis, untreated symptoms, and barriers to care. Ongoing research and advocacy efforts are required to improve knowledge translation until real-world outcomes are seen in screening, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of bleeding."

    "title": "Digital Technologies in Hereditary Coagulation Disorders: A Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "This systematic review aims to comprehensively survey digital technologies used in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of hereditary blood coagulation disorders. The systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. A systematic search was conducted on PubMed on January 29, 2024. Articles were excluded if they were reviews, meta-analyses, or systematic reviews. Articles were included if they were published from January 1, 2014, onward, written in English, described an actual application of digital tools, were in the context of hereditary coagulation disorders, and involved studies or trials on humans or human data with at least three subjects. The initial PubMed search on January 29, 2024, identified 2,843 articles, with 672 from January 1, 2014, onward. After screening, 21 articles met the exclusion and inclusion criteria. Among these, 12 focused on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and 9 on digital applications. AI was predominantly used for diagnosis (five studies) and treatment (four studies), while digital applications were mainly used for treatment (eight studies). Most studies addressed hemophilia A, with a smaller number including hemophilia B or von Willebrand disease. The findings reveal a lack of intervention studies in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. However, digital tools, including AI and digital applications, are increasingly used in managing hereditary coagulation disorders. AI enhances diagnostic accuracy and personalizes treatment, while digital applications improve patient care and engagement. Despite these advancements, study biases and design limitations indicate the need for further research to fully harness the potential of these technologies."

    "abstract": "Fitusiran is an investigational small interfering RNA therapeutic that targets antithrombin (AT) to rebalance hemostasis in people with hemophilia. Here, we present the results of a completed phase 2 open-label extension study, which evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of fitusiran in participants with moderate or severe hemophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors. Male participants who had completed the phase 1 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02035605) were enrolled. Participants received monthly subcutaneous fitusiran (50 or 80 mg) under the original dose regimen until a voluntary dosing pause in 2020, after which the AT-based dose regimen was introduced, targeting the recommended AT activity levels of 15% to 35%. Thirty-four participants (hemophilia A, n = 27; hemophilia B, n = 7) were enrolled in the phase 2 study and treated with fitusiran for a median exposure of 4.1 years. Adverse events reported on the original and the AT-based dose regimen were consistent with the identified risks of fitusiran. After implementation of the AT-based dose regimen, there were no thrombotic events, and a reduction in the incidence of elevated transaminases and biliary events was reported. The observed median annualized bleed rate (ABR) on the AT-based dose regimen (0.87) was comparable with the ABR under the original dose regimen (0.70). Furthermore, fitusiran prophylaxis was associated with improved health-related quality of life compared with baseline and provided successful hemostatic control during surgical procedures and invasive interventions. Overall, fitusiran was well tolerated, and effective bleeding control was maintained on an AT-based dose regimen. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02554773."

    "abstract": "To assess the real-world efficacy and safety of recombinant factor IX albumin fusion protein (rIX-FP) in patients with hemophilia B (HB) in France. Data on dosing frequency, weekly consumption, and bleeds before-and-after switching to rIX-FP, were collected from December 2021 to February 2024. Annualized (spontaneous) bleeding rates [A(s)BRs] were calculated only in patients on prophylaxis with a follow-up ≥ 6 months. This interim analysis focused on 77 patients ≥ 12 years; 62 (81%) had severe HB. After switching to rIX-FP, the infusion interval was 14 (7-14) days. Weekly consumption was 43 (35.5-53) IU/kg. ABRs and AsBRs were 0.5 (0-1.9) and 0 (0-0.7) (n = 63) at 18.2 (12.3-21.9) months of follow-up. Prophylactic efficacy of rIX-FP was considered 'Excellent'/'Good' in 65/68 (95%) patients. Among the 43 patients previously treated with rFIXFc, 21 increased the infusion interval from 7 (7-11) days with rFIXFc to 14 (7-14) days with rIX-FP; 33/43 (77%) reduced weekly factor IX (FIX) consumption from 59.95 (46.35-77.93) to 42.5 (35.88-50.25) IU/kg. Patients maintained good protection against bleeds. This analysis confirmed that switching to rIX-FP allows for reducing injection frequency and FIX consumption while maintaining good bleed protection."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B, a severe genetic disorder, involves substantial treatment costs and frequent interventions. Etranacogene dezaparvovec (EDZ) is a recently approved gene therapy for hemophilia B. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of EDZ compared with conventional factor IX (FIX) prophylaxis. A semi-Markov model simulated a cohort of adult males with severe hemophilia B to assess the economic impact of EDZ versus FIX prophylaxis over a lifetime horizon from a health system perspective in the USA. Inputs derived from clinical trials included therapy durability and transition probabilities based on Pettersson Scores. Scenario analyses incorporated frameworks suggested by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review for single or short-term transformative therapies. Base-case analysis showed that at a cost of US$3.5 million, EDZ led to lifetime cost savings of US$11 million and an additional 0.64 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with FIX. However, FIX has extremely high annual costs. When annual cost offsets attributed to EDZ were capped at US$150,000, EDZ was found to have a threshold price of US$3.1 million at a willingness-to-pay of US$150,000 per QALY. EDZ proved to be a dominant strategy over FIX prophylaxis in the base-case scenario, providing large cost savings and slightly better outcomes. The substantial costs associated with FIX are a primary driver behind these results. The introduction of cost-offset caps significantly affects the value-based price of EDZ. Using caps on cost offsets in considering price can help to balance affordability and value in the health system."

    "abstract": "Non-factor replacement therapies (NFTs) have been developed to address the limitations of conventional replacement therapies, aiming to improve hemostasis and provide enhanced protection against bleeding episodes and long-term joint damage for patients both with and without inhibitors. Factor VIII (FVIII)-mimetic agents, such as emicizumab, have transformed the management of hemophilia A with inhibitors, offering a lower treatment burden and an effective alternative for those without inhibitors as well. Rebalancing agents, including anti-tissular factor pathway inhibitor agents (concizumab and marstacimab) and serpin inhibitors like fitusiran, have shown promising efficacy for patients with hemophilia B with inhibitors and other hemophilia subtypes. Administered subcutaneously, NFTs generate stable thrombin levels and feature a long half-life, which can shift severe hemophilia toward a milder phenotype. These therapies are effective regardless of inhibitor status and hold potential for application in other bleeding disorders. Evaluating the potential thrombotic risk after implementing mitigation measures, along with the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), remain critical areas for further analysis. NFTs pose additional challenges due to their complex mechanism of action and the absence of a standardized laboratory assessment method. Unresolved issues include optimal management strategies for major surgeries and tailored approaches for safe use in older populations. This review highlights the progress and future potential of NFTs in treating persons with hemophilia."

    "title": "The Evolution of Hemophilia Pharmacological Treatments and Therapeutic Targets at the Turn of the Third Millennium.",
    "abstract": "Historically, the aim of treatment for hemophilia, the congenital X-linked hemorrhagic disorder due to deficiencies of coagulation Factor (F) VIII (hemophilia A) or FIX (hemophilia B), has been the replacement through factor concentrates, whose regular administration (i.e., prophylaxis) has been shown to be highly effective in preventing bleeding complications and it is currently considered the gold standard of hemophilia treatment. However, continuous technological progress (i.e., plasma-derived factor concentrates, recombinant standard and extended half-life [EHL] products) has allowed clinicians operating at hemophilia treatment centers to individualize the management of persons with hemophilia, improving outcomes, adherence to therapy, and their quality of life. The achievement of normal hemostasis, the final goal that now seems possible with new-generation EHL products, non-replacement and gene therapies, will translate into normalization of life for persons with hemophilia, also addressing health equity (i.e., rendering them indistinguishable from their healthy peers). The evolution of hemophilia treatment and, in parallel, of therapeutic targets in the management of hemophilia patients over the last decades will be critically discussed in this narrative review."

    "title": "Intracranial hemorrhage in an infant leads to the diagnosis and treatment of severe hemophilia B: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia B is a rare bleeding disorder in males, characterized by a deficiency in coagulation factor IX (FIX). Replacement of FIX with a recombinant FIX (rFIX) fusion protein, to sustain therapeutic plasma levels, is recommended as both treatment and prophylaxis to prevent bleeding episodes, particularly intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). This case report outlines the management of ICH in a 7-month-old infant with severe hemophilia B, following an accidental trauma-related event, resulting in a thin compound fracture of the left occiput. FIX levels were extremely low (˂1.0%) and large deletions of the coagulation F9 gene (including exons 1-6) were identified. Intensive treatment with a rFIX fusion protein conjugated to the immunoglobulin Fc fragment (rFIXFc) continued for 18 days before hospital discharge. A continuous regimen of weekly rFIXFc infusions was implemented. Thirty days after initiating rFIXFc therapy, neutralizing antibodies or FIX inhibitors (common in patients with large F9 gene deletions) were observed, causing a diffuse skin rash. Such allergic reactions typically indicate progression to potentially serious nephrotic syndrome. A unique immunotolerance regimen of oral oxatomide and intravenous hydrocortisone was started to proactively prevent allergic reactions in this patient during rFIXFc prophylaxis. Even though low titers of the inhibitor (0.6-1.0 Bethesda units) were observed occasionally during subsequent follow-up, there were no signs of further allergies or development of nephrotic syndrome. This is an uncommon case in which rFIXFc was continued despite the appearance of an allergic reaction and the development of FIX inhibitors. Subsequent allergic reactions were prevented with a combination of oral oxatomide and intravenous hydrocortisone given prior to prophylactic rFIXFc. Further studies are recommended to determine the usefulness of this combination with rFIX therapy."

    "abstract": "Children with hemophilia have a significantly higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) compared to the normal population. Prophylaxis reduces the risk of ICH and earlier initiation of prophylaxis may now be feasible, especially in hemophilia A (HA). The aim of the study is to explore the potential for preventing ICH by earlier start of prophylaxis by assessing the natural course of ICH before the initiation of prophylaxis and describe timing and incidence (clinicaltrials gov. Identifier: NCT02979119). In total, 2,727 children (2,275 with HA; 452 with hemophilia B [HB]) were included from the PedNet Registry, followed from 28 days until 36 months of life. ICH was observed in 61 children (incidence 2.2%; 10 per 1,000 patient years), with 75% of cases occurring before 1 year of age. Cumulative incidence was significantly lower in HB (0.9%) compared to HA (2.5%) and in non-severe HA (0.7%) compared to severe HA (3.5%). ICH occurred early, with a rise at 3 months, and a median age of 7.0 months in severe HA and 5.4 months in severe HB. In 40% of children, ICH occurred before the diagnosis of hemophilia was established, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis. Assuming that prophylaxis would have been started at the time of diagnosis and preventing all ICH in children with severe HA, the number needed to treat with prophylaxis would be 44 patients to prevent one ICH. Hopefully, prophylaxis options allowing initiation early in life, ideally before 3 months of age for children with severe HA, will reduce the incidence of ICH in the future."

    "abstract": "Patients with haemophilia (PWH) often have difficulty accessing dental services. To determine the accessibility of dental care for PWH and to examine their perceptions of how coronavirus type-2 (CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) has affected their ability to access dental treatments following the pandemic. The questionnaire survey was conducted between July 2022 and December 2022 at haemophilia treatment centres in Hungary. Variables with statistical significance (Pearson's Chi-squared test; p < .05) were included in logistic regression analyses. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used as a machine learning technique to identify the most predictive variables. Twenty-one percent of the sixty-eight participants reported that they had been refused dental treatment, mainly in primary care (86%). Dental refusal was influenced by infectious disease (OR: 4.48, CI: 1.14-17.69) and previous dental bleeding complications (OR: 4.23, CI: 1.10-16.27). There was correlation between dental visits and having a permanent dentist or receiving oral hygiene advice (OR: 9.95, CI: 2.86-34.62 and OR: 3.84, CI: 1.09-13.58). Participation in an oral hygiene consultation increased patients' satisfaction with their dental care (OR: 6.28, 95% CI: .71-55.88). Twenty-eight percent of patients had experienced difficulties since the start of the COVID-19, but 84% had visited their dentist at least once between 2021 and 2022 (p = .002). Nevertheless, 16% of respondents went for only the most necessary treatments due to pandemic. Refusal of dental care was high among participants, especially in primary care. The COVID-19 pandemic has exaggerated the difficulties of PWH in accessing dental treatment. Patients with haemophilia (PWH) have difficulty accessing dental care, and the coronavirus type 2 (CoV-2) disease pandemic (COVID-19) has created a new barrier. The study revealed a high prevalence of dental care refusal (21%), particularly in primary care (86%). This 2022 survey found that 28% of patients experienced difficulties since the pandemic started and 16% only sought necessary treatments."

    "title": "Lipid Nanoparticle-Mediated Liver-Specific Gene Therapy for Hemophilia B.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>/<b>Objectives</b>: Hemophilia B is a hereditary bleeding disorder due to the production of liver malfunctional factor IX (FIX). Gene therapy with viral vectors offers a cure. However, applications are limited due to pre-existing antibodies, eligibility for children under 12 years of age, hepatotoxicity, and excessive costs. Lipid nanoparticles are a potential alternative owing to their biocompatibility, scalability, and non-immunogenicity. However, their therapeutic applications are still elusive due to the poor transfection efficiencies in delivering plasmid DNA into primary cells and target organs in vivo. To develop efficient liver-targeted lipid nanoparticles, we explored galactosylated lipids to target asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPRs) abundantly expressed on hepatocytes. <b>Methods</b>: We developed 12 novel liposomal formulations varying the galactose lipid Gal-LNC 5, cationic lipid MeOH16, DOPE, and cholesterol. We evaluated their physicochemical properties, toxicity profiles, and transfection efficiencies in hepatic cell lines. Among the formulations, Gal-LNC 5 could efficiently transfect the reporter plasmid eGFP in hepatic cell lines and specifically distribute into the liver in vivo. Toward developing functional factor IX, we cloned Padua mutant FIX-L in a CpG-free backbone to enhance the expression and duration. <b>Results</b>: We demonstrated superior expression of FIX with our galactosylated lipid nanoparticle system. <b>Conclusions</b>: The current research presents a specialized lipid nanoparticle system viz. Gal-LNC which is a specialized lipid nanoparticle system for liver-targeted gene therapy in hemophilia B patients that has potential for clinical use. The Gal-LNC successfully delivers a CpG-free Padua FIX gene to liver cells, producing therapeutically relevant levels of FIX protein. Among its benefits are the ideal qualities of stability, targeting the liver specifically, and maximizing efficiency of transfection. Optimization of liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle systems and function FIX plasmids will pave the way for novel lipid nanoparticle-based gene therapy products for hemophilia B and other monogenic liver disorders."

The clinical application of techniques that modify the expression of a gene is called gene therapy (GT). These techniques include platforms (viral and non-viral) that bring genetic modification systems or healthy genes to the target cells. ClinicalTrial.gov is a repository of clinical trials that incorporates protocols using TG. In this work, a systematic review of the works registered in ClinicalTrial.gov on the use of TG in hematological diseases was carried out. A total of 41 GT-related clinical trials were found most of which were registered in the United States of America (56.1%). On the other hand, 41.46% of the protocols obtained private funding. Of 50% of all pathologies, only diseases of hematological origin of monogenic origin (hemophilia A, hemophilia B, and Fanconi anemia) received TG. On the other hand, the number of clinical protocols registered by country was positively correlated with economic development, scientific development, investment in health per capita, and quality of life. Finally, there are still many bioethical, social, political, and economic controversies that must be solved."

To present the first national cohort of persons with HB to define the demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns in Turkey. This multicenter, retrospective study included 433 alive persons with HB registered in 35 centers between 1961 and 2018. Analyses were performed by age subgroups (0-17 years, 18-64 years, and ≥65 years), disease severity by factor levels (severe, <1 IU/dL; moderate, 1-5 IU/dL; mild, >5 IU/dL). Additionally, patients were stratified based on the initiation year of follow-up at the relevant study center, creating 2 periods: 1993-2006 (referred to as period A) and 2007-2018 (referred to as period B). Predominantly male (98.6%), the median age at data entry was 22.1 years (<i>n</i> = 429). The majority (49.0%) had moderate HB, followed by severe (30.0%) and mild (15.7%) disease. Of the 377 patients with complete treatment details, 209 (55.4%) were under prophylaxis from their diagnosis onwards, while 79 patients (21.0%) only received on-demand treatment. Additionally, 89 patients (23.6%) initially underwent on-demand treatment and later were switched to prophylaxis. Knees were the primary site of bleeding and the most frequently intervened joints. Most of the major (47.5%) and minor (53.3%) orthopedic procedures were carried out in persons with severe HB, while half of radioactive synovectomy procedures were performed on persons with moderate HB.

Gene therapy is a transformative, irreversible treatment with long-lasting effects, necessitating development of new clinical pathways to ensure optimal outcomes. To develop a consensus framework and service specification for delivery of AAV gene therapy for haemophilia in adults within the UK using the hub-and-spoke model proposed by the European Association of Haemophilia and Allied Disorders and the European Haemophilia Consortium. The UK Haemophilia Centre Doctors Organisation (UKHCDO) set up a working party to develop expert consensus guidance, working with NHS England to ensure alignment with NHS England commissioning and the national service specification. These guidelines detail the patient pathway, counselling and governance requirements for the hub-and-spoke model. The national service specification requires the hub site to manage governance for AAV-based gene therapy. Proposed regional and national multidisciplinary teams will harmonize clinical practices incorporating expertise from various specialities and professional groups. Key requirements identified include standardized documentation and multidisciplinary collaboration. Nationally agreed patient information and counselling checklists will streamline the informed consent process and facilitate data collection for long-term safety and efficacy monitoring. These guidelines provide a structured framework for the delivery of liver-directed gene therapy.

    "abstract": "Few studies have evaluated direct medical or societal costs of haemophilia in the United Kingdom (UK), and how patient characteristics impact future costs is uncertain. Cost predictors were identified and examined using cross-sectional data from the CHESS I and II studies. Patient- and physician-reported outcomes were analysed for UK adult males aged ≤ 65, with haemophilia A or B and no recent clinical trial participation. Demographics, haemophilia type and severity, inhibitors, annual bleed rate (ABR), problem joints (PJs), treatment type, and comorbidities, were utilised in regression analyses. Health-related quality of life was assessed using EQ-5D. Generalised linear models estimated expected non-drug haemophilia-related direct medical costs (DMC) and societal costs (non-drug DMC, direct non-medical and indirect costs). Average marginal effects (AMEs) determined predictors of cost. Costs for 378 patients were analysed. Mean age was 33 years and 79% (299) had haemophilia A. Mean annual per-patient DMC were £165,001 (including factor treatment costs) and £4,091 when excluding factor replacement treatment costs (non-drug DMC). Mean annual per-patient non-treatment societal costs were £11,550 (standard deviation £20,171) among those with data available (n = 51). Number of PJs, ABR, and treatment regimen were significant determinants of haemophilia-related non-drug DMC (all P < 0.001). Non-drug DMC increased as ABR increased (AMEs were £2,018 for ABR 1-5, £3,101 for ABR 6-10 and £5,785 for ABR ≥ 11, vs. ABR 0) and by £1,869 per additional PJ. No significant predictors of non-drug haemophilia-related societal costs were identified. Mean EQ-5D score was 0.66, with lower scores observed for people with haemophilia B (0.48) compared with haemophilia A (0.71) and with increasing haemophilia severity. UK direct medical and societal costs of haemophilia are substantial. Non-drug DMC were particularly associated with ABR and number of PJs. These findings may be useful for real-world evaluations of the economic burden of haemophilia in the UK."

    "abstract": "Concizumab is an anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor monoclonal antibody in development as a once-daily, subcutaneous prophylaxis for patients with haemophilia A or haemophilia B with or without inhibitors. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of concizumab in patients with haemophilia A or B without inhibitors. Here we report the results from the confirmatory analysis cutoff. This prospective, multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3a trial (explorer8) was conducted at 69 investigational sites in 31 countries. Eligible patients were male, aged 12 years or older, and had congenital severe haemophilia A or moderate or severe haemophilia B without inhibitors and with documented treatment with clotting factor concentrate in the 24 weeks before screening. The trial was paused because of non-fatal thromboembolic events in three patients (two from this trial [explorer8] and one from a related trial in haemophilia with inhibitors [explorer7; NCT04083781]) and restarted with mitigation measures, including a revised dosing regimen of subcutaneous concizumab at 1·0 mg/kg loading dose on day 1 and subsequent daily doses of 0·20 mg/kg from day 2, with options to decrease to 0·15 mg/kg, stay on 0·20 mg/kg, or increase to 0·25 mg/kg on the basis of concizumab plasma concentration measured after 4 weeks on concizumab. Patients recruited after treatment restart were randomly assigned 1:2 using an interactive web response system to receive no prophylaxis and continue on-demand clotting factor (group 1) or concizumab prophylaxis (group 2). The primary endpoints were the number of treated spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes for patients with haemophilia A and haemophilia B separately, assessed at the confirmatory analysis cutoff in randomly assigned patients. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. There were two additional groups containing non-randomly-assigned patients: group 3 contained patients who entered the trial before the trial pause and were receiving concizumab in the phase 2 trial (explorer5; NCT03196297), and group 4 contained patients who received previous clotting factor concentrate prophylaxis or on-demand treatment in the non-interventional trial (explorer6; NCT03741881), patients randomly assigned to groups 1 or 2 before the treatment pause, and patients from explorer5 enrolled after the treatment pause. The safety analysis set contained all patients who received concizumab. Superiority of concizumab over no prophylaxis was established if the two-sided 95% CI of the treatment ratio was less than 1 for haemophilia A and for haemophilia B. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04082429, and its extension part is ongoing. Patients were recruited between Nov 13, 2019 and Nov 30, 2021; the cutoff date for the analyses presented was July 12, 2022. 173 patients were screened, of whom 148 (86%) were randomly assigned or allocated to the four groups in the study after trial restart on Sept 30, 2020 (nine with haemophilia A and 12 with haemophilia B in group 1; 18 with haemophilia A and 24 with haemophilia B in group 2; nine with haemophilia A in group 3; and 46 with haemophilia A and 30 with haemophilia B in group 4). The estimated mean annualised bleeding rate ratio for treated spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes during concizumab prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis was 0·14 (95% CI 0·07-0·29; p<0·0001) for patients with haemophilia A and 0·21 (0·10-0·45; p<0·0001) for patients with haemophilia B. The most frequent adverse events in patients who received concizumab were SARS-CoV-2 infection (19 [13%] of 151 patients), an increase in fibrin D-dimers (12 [8%] patients), and upper respiratory tract infection (ten [7%] patients). There was one fatal adverse event possibly related to treatment (intra-abdominal haemorrhage in a patient from group 4 with haemophilia A with a long-standing history of hypertension). No thromboembolic events were reported between the trial restart and confirmatory analysis cutoff. Concizumab was effective in reducing the bleeding rate compared with no prophylaxis and was considered safe in patients with haemophilia A or B without inhibitors. The results of this trial suggest that concizumab has the potential to be one of the first subcutaneous treatment options for patients with haemophilia B without inhibitors. Novo Nordisk."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B is a quantitative or qualitative factor IX anomaly that manifests as an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern in which females are carriers. Postoperative epidural hematoma emerges as a typical complication in spinal surgery, although its incidence is infrequent. No documentation of postoperative epidural hematoma in carriers of hemophilia B exists. A 64-year-old female patient presented with progressive pain and muscle weakness in both lower limbs. Despite a history of childbirth and prior colorectal cancer surgery, the patient displayed no abnormal bleeding tendencies. Subsequently undergoing decompression surgery for lumbar spinal canal stenosis, the patient experienced paralysis and pain in both legs within 5 hours postoperatively. A magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed severe spinal canal compression attributed to a postoperative epidural hematoma, prompting emergency decompression surgery that ameliorated symptoms. The application of gelatin-thrombin matrix sealants (GTMS) facilitated hematoma removal, resulting in an uneventful recovery. In a postoperative interview, it was revealed that her grandson was undergoing treatment for hemophilia B. Additionally, she exhibited diminished factor IX levels and was diagnosed as a hemophilia B carrier. A definitive preoperative diagnosis of the carrier status is imperative. In instances where surgical intervention is warranted, the implementation of factor IX replacement and intraoperative hemostasis with GTMS is promising for potentially averting the onset of postoperative epidural hematoma."

    "abstract": "Most invasive dental procedures elicit some degree of bleeding which ultimately leads to clotting and eventual hemostasis. However, patients with inherited coagulation disorders may exhibit prolonged or, in some cases, excessive bleeding requiring multiple perioperative interventions. Von Willebrand disease is the most common inherited coagulopathy and often manifests via easy bruising, epistaxis, or prolonged bleeding. Hemophilia A (factor VII) and B (factor IX) are factor deficiencies that are clinically indistinguishable and managed according to severity and the required dental treatment. Other coagulopathies are rare (ie, inheritance is autosomal recessive) and may only become evident in homozygotes or compound heterozygotes. Current lab values and medical consultation with the patient's hematologist are imperative prior to rendering invasive dental treatment. There are a myriad of sedation and general anesthesia considerations, including risks for epistaxis with nasal instrumentation and bruising with improper patient positioning. Preoperative treatment with desmopressin or factor replacement may be required and generally should facilitate normal hemostasis. Additional therapies should be considered to help ensure adequate postoperative hemostasis, including pressure dressings, resorbable clotting materials, laser therapy, and oral rinses."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the level of care available for haemophilia patients. The descriptive, retrospective analytical study was conducted from December 15, 2020, to March 1, 2021, after approval from the Mustansiriyah University, Baghdad, Iraq, and comprised data from 3 haemophilia treating centres in Iraq participating in the World Bleeding Disorders Registry. The data collected related to patients with haemophilia A and B enrolled in the registry since March 2018, and included age at diagnosis, type of haemophilia, disease severity, age at first bleed and at first joint bleed, type of replacement therapy and outcome. Data was analysed using statistical package of social sciences (SPSS) version 20. Of the 638 patients with mean age 16.2±4.3 (range: 9-29 years), 581(91%) had haemophilia A, 57(8.9%) had haemophilia B, 385(60.5%) had severe haemophilia, 126(19.8%) moderate and 125(19.7%) mild. Further, 259(41%) patients had been diagnosed for <1 year. There were 1354 bleeding events, and haemarthrosis accounted for 959(70.8%) of them. The mean annualised bleeding rate for severe patients was 2 ± 0.6(range 0-4), while the mean annualised joint bleeding rate was 4 ± 1.3(range :2-8). There were 256(32.3%) patients who were tested for inhibitors, and 62(24.3%) were positive. Among 426(73.3%) haemophilia A patients with a treatment history, 248(58%) were on prophylactic therapy, and the corresponding value among 37(65%) haemophilia B patients was 17(46%). Access to treatment was found to be limited, and patients were found to be suffering from high bleeding rates and joint damage."

    "abstract": "Alu-elements comprise a large part of the human genome and some insertions have been shown to cause diseases. Here, we illuminate the protective role of an Alu-element in the 3'UTR of the human Factor 9 gene and its ability to ameliorate a poly(A) site mutation in a hemophilia B patient, preventing him from developing a severe disease. Using a minigene, we examined the disease-causing mutation and the modifying effect of the transposon in cellulo. Further, we simulated evolutionary scenarios regarding alternative polyadenylation before and after Alu insertion. A sequence analysis revealed that Old World monkeys displayed a highly conserved polyadenylation sites in this Alu-element, whereas New World monkeys lacked this motif, indicating a selective pressure. We conclude that this transposon has inserted shortly before the separation of Old and New World monkeys and thus also serves as a molecular landmark in primate evolution."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of inherited bleeding disorders (BDs) is low in the general population (10-20 per 100,000 individuals), particularly hemophilia B cases, which may remain undiagnosed for a very long time until exposed to some surgical procedure. The dental professional must be aware of the possibility that patients with no previous history of abnormal bleeding may manifest their first bleeding episode in the dental office. Particularly as periodontists, we often encounter patients with bleeding gums and severe bleeding complications may precipitate while performing routine periodontal procedures. Hence, we must have a thorough knowledge of BDs and their management in challenging hemorrhagic situations. Management of such patients necessitates a multidisciplinary approach by involving the patient's hematologist and advanced laboratory facilities. The present case report is an attempt to discuss the diagnosis and management of a bleeding episode that occurred post periodontal flap surgery in an undiagnosed hemophilia B patient."

    "abstract": "Over the years, the palette of treatment options for hemophilia has grown extensively, leading to an increased life expectancy and quality of life for people living with hemophilia. Nonetheless, it is frequently emphasized that none of the current treatment modalities provides a \"cure.\" It is therefore hoped that innovative treatments such as gene therapy may bridge this void. However, the precise definition of a \"cure\" for hemophilia remains unclear. In this review, we show how the concept of cure is currently used in the field of hemophilia. We then relate the discussion on cure to debates surrounding the classification of hemophilia and philosophical debates on the concepts of health and disease."

    "abstract": "New treatments for patients with bleeding disorders (PWB) have emerged, including products with extended half-life and subcutaneous administration. These less frequent treatments can potentially enhance quality of life (QoL), but adherence becomes critically important. To investigate adherence and QoL among PWB and explore the correlation between treatment adherence and QoL in adult patients with haemophilia A (HA), haemophilia B (HB) and Von Willebrand disease (vWD) in Denmark. This survey used disease-specific patient-reported questionnaires: Veritas-PRO and Veritas-PRN to measure adherence, and Haemo-A-QoL and VWD-QoL to assess QoL. Responses were obtained from 149 patients with HA, 32 with HB and 118 with vWD. Adherence was reported by 87.1% of patients on prophylaxis and 71.2% of patients treated on demand, according to Veritas-PRO and Veritas-PRN cut-off scores. High QoL was generally reported, decreasing with age in HA and HB, but not in vWD. Danish patients with HA, HB and vWD reported high QoL and high adherence to prescribed treatments. There was no correlation between treatment adherence and QoL among the different patient groups. These findings highlight the need for further research to better understand adherence behaviours and identify opportunities to further improve QoL in PWB."

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched for studies of adult males with severe or moderately severe HA or HB who received AAV-based gene therapy. Annualized bleeding rate (ABR), annualized infusion rate (AIR), total factor use, factor levels, and adverse events (AEs) were extracted. Eight HA trials representing 7 gene therapies and 211 patients and 12 HB trials representing 9 gene therapies and 184 patients were included. For HA, gene therapy resulted in an annualized decrease of 7.58 bleeding events (95% confidence interval [CI], -11.50 to -3.67) and 117.2 factor infusions (95% CI, -151.86 to -82.53) compared with before gene therapy. Factor VIII level at 12 months ranged from 10.4 to 70.31 IU/mL by 1-stage assay. HB gene therapies were associated with an annualized decrease of 5.64 bleeding events (95% CI, -8.61 to -2.68) and 58.92 factor infusions (95% CI, -68.19 to -49.65). Mean factor IX level at 12 months was 28.72 IU/mL (95% CI, 18.78-38.66). Factor expression was more durable for HB than HA; factor IX levels remained at 95.7% of their peak whereas factor VIII levels fell to 55.8% of their peak at 24 months. The pooled percentage of patients experiencing a serious AE was 19% (10%-31%) and 21% (10%-37%) for HA and HB gene therapies, respectively. No thrombosis or inhibitor formation was reported. AAV-based gene therapies for both HA and HB demonstrated significant reductions in ABR, AIR, and factor use."

    "abstract": "Little information regarding the management of invasive procedures in people with hemophilia B (HB) after undergoing gene therapy is available. Here, we report the management of invasive procedures in people with severe or moderately severe HB who had previously been treated with etranacogene dezaparvovec in the phase 2b and phase 3 Health Outcomes with Padua Gene; Evaluation in Hemophilia B clinical trials (NCT03489291 and NCT03569891). The objective of this study was to describe the use of exogenous FIX, endogenous FIX activity prior to invasive procedures, and peri- and postoperative bleeds in participants who underwent invasive procedures after receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec gene therapy. This retrospective analysis included invasive procedures performed within 3 and 2 years following a single infusion of 2 × 10<sup>13</sup> gc/kg of etranacogene dezaparvovec in participants in the phase 2b and Health Outcomes with Padua Gene; Evaluation in Hemophilia B trials, respectively. Data for factor (F)IX dosing, duration of postoperative FIX use, FIX activity prior to invasive procedures, and postoperative bleeds were collected and analyzed. The analysis included 64 procedures in 29 participants: 9 major surgeries, 24 minor surgeries, 11 endoscopies, 3 endoscopies with biopsy/polypectomy, and 17 dental procedures. Uncontaminated endogenous FIX activity corresponded to mild hemophilia or normal levels prior to 98% of all procedures, with a median endogenous FIX activity of 43.8 IU/dL (range, 3.1-113 IU/dL). All major surgeries were managed with exogenous FIX, 67% with ≤4 days of FIX infusion. Most minor surgeries (88%), endoscopies (82%), and dental procedures (94%) were managed with no or a single FIX infusion. Postoperative bleeds occurred after 1 minor surgery and 4 dental procedures. There were no symptomatic thrombotic events or FIX inhibitor developments. Etranacogene dezaparvovec has the potential to facilitate perioperative management in people with HB by reducing the need for perioperative exogenous FIX and its associated risks."

    "abstract": "The value of gene therapies for haemophilia needs to be assessed holistically. To determine the value of etranacogene dezaparvovec (ED) compared to current extended half-life (EHL) recombinant factors (rFIX), using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). MCDA EVIDEM methodology adapted to orphan drugs was used, with nine quantitative criteria and four contextual criteria. The MCDA framework was rated by 28 multidisciplinary experts. Descriptive statistics were performed for quantitative and qualitative criteria. Haemophilia B (HB) was considered a severe disease (mean ± SD: 4.3 ± 0.7) with some unmet needs (mean ± SD 3.3 ± 0.9). Experts found ED more effective (mean ± SD 2.0 ± 2.3) and provide better quality of life (QoL) (mean ± SD: 1.8 ± 1.5) than the comparative HB treatments but with safety uncertainties (mean ± SD -1.2 ± 1.8). ED could lead to medical cost and non-medical cost savings over time (mean ± SD: 1.6 ± 2.0 and 2.0 ± 1.5, respectively). The quality of the evidence was high (mean ± SD: 3.9 ± 0.9). ED was considered aligned with the priorities of the National Health System (NHS) and the specific interests of patients. ED's value contribution was 0.45 (+1 = highest value). ED brings added value in the treatment of moderately severe and severe HB (sHB) compared to current EHL rFIX, addressing the severity of the disease and increasing efficacy and patients' QoL especially related to the single dose and low bleeding rate. Concerns about long-term safety need to be addressed."

An MRI of 41 ankle joints of 21 haemophilic boys was performed on a 3 T MRI system using an mGRE sequence in addition to the conventional protocol. Conventional MRI and mGRE were separately and independently assessed by three readers, namely, two musculoskeletal radiologists and a general radiologist for joint hemosiderin. We set as a reference the consensus reading of the two musculoskeletal radiologists, who also evaluated the presence of synovial thickening, effusion, and osteochondral changes. Excellent inter-reader agreement was obtained using the mGRE sequence compared to the conventional protocol (ICC: 0.95-0.97 versus 0.48-0.89), with superior sensitivity (90-95% versus 50-85%), specificity (95.2-100% versus 76.2-95.2%), and positive (95-100% versus 71-94.4%) and negative predictive value (91.3-95.5% versus 87-63%). Hemosiderin deposition was associated with osteochondral changes, synovial thickening, clinical score, and the total number of ankle bleeds, while it was inversely related with the time elapsed between the last joint bleed and MRI. (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The application of an mGRE sequence significantly improved hemosiderin detection, even when performed by the less experienced reader. Joint hemosiderin deposition was associated with the other components of haemophilic arthropathy and was mostly apparent in recent joint bleeds."

We conducted a phase 3 open-label study of fidanacogene elaparvovec at a dose of 5×10<sup>11</sup> vector genome copies per kilogram of body weight. Men 18 to 65 years of age with hemophilia B and a factor IX level of 2% or less were eligible for screening if they had received at least 6 months of therapy with prophylactic factor IX concentrate. The primary end point, tested for noninferiority, was the annualized bleeding rate (treated and untreated bleeding episodes) from week 12 to month 15 after treatment with fidanacogene elaparvovec as compared with the prophylaxis lead-in period. Superiority, additional efficacy end points, and safety were also assessed. Of 316 men who underwent screening for the lead-in study, 204 (64.6%) were not eligible; 188 (59.5%) of those were ineligible owing to the presence of anti-AAV neutralizing antibodies. Of the 45 participants who received fidanacogene elaparvovec, 44 completed at least 15 months of follow-up. The annualized rate of bleeding for all bleeding episodes decreased by 71%, from 4.42 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80 to 7.05) at baseline to 1.28 (95% CI, 0.57 to 1.98) after gene therapy, a treatment difference of -3.15 episodes (95% CI, -5.46 to -0.83; P = 0.008). This result shows the noninferiority and superiority of fidanacogene elaparvovec to prophylaxis. At 15 months, the mean factor IX activity was 26.9% (median, 22.9%; range, 1.9 to 119.0) by one-stage SynthASil assay. A total of 28 participants (62%) received glucocorticoids for increased aminotransferase levels or decreased factor IX levels (or both) starting between 11 and 123 days. No infusion-related serious adverse events, thrombotic events, development of factor IX inhibitors, or malignant conditions were observed. Fidanacogene elaparvovec was superior to prophylaxis for the treatment of participants with hemophilia B, leading to reduced bleeding and stable factor IX expression.

    "abstract": "In 2022-2023, the US Food and Drug Administration approved 2 novel gene therapies, valoctocogene roxaparvovec and etranacogene dezaparavovec, for hemophilia A and B, respectively. These one-time-administered gene therapies have been marketed at prices that create financial challenges for payers and patients. Understanding the magnitude and uncertainties around the long-term value of these therapies and how they can potentially relate to managed care practices is of high interest to the payer and patient community. To conduct a systematic review of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) studies to assess (1) the long-term value of valoctocogene roxaparvovec and etranacogene dezaparavovec and (2) the relevance and validity of the underlying data and assumptions used in the CEA models and discuss how they relate to the challenges identified for CEAs of gene therapies. A systematic review of cost-effectiveness studies of novel hemophilia A and B gene therapy was conducted. PubMed and Embase were searched for published studies from inception to January 12, 2024. Original research articles published in English that conducted a CEA on gene therapy treatments for hemophilia A and B, with a comparison of incremental costs and health effects, were considered. Critical appraisal of the quality of reporting and the underlying modeling assumptions were conducted to assess the relevance and validity of the results. Two hundred thirty-eight studies were identified, of which 4 met the inclusion criteria. Three studies were conducted from a US health care perspective and 1 from a Dutch societal perspective. Despite the high upfront costs of the gene therapies, all included studies' (3 hemophilia A and 1 hemophilia B) modeled results showed that gene therapies had lower overall costs and better health outcomes compared with factor concentrate replacement therapies and emicizumab. The results were driven by the assumption that gene therapies will have a durable effect of at least 10 years and offset the high cost of the current standard of care. The modeled health improvements varied substantially across studies, showing that the long-term value is sensitive to varying clinical and economic assumptions. The novel hemophilia gene therapy treatments can potentially be a cost-effective use of treatment resources if the treatment effects are durable over time. To reduce the risk for payers while still facilitating patient access, outcomes-based agreements similar to what has recently been proposed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for sickle-cell therapies are well supported."

To provide real-world descriptions of eptacog beta use for BE treatment in patients on emicizumab or eptacog beta prophylaxis. This is a retrospective case series of 14 patients who received eptacog beta at seven haemophilia treatment centres, with HA (n = 11) or HB (n = 3) and inhibitors or anaphylaxis to factor replacement. Twenty-four spontaneous and traumatic BEs are described (muscle hematomas, joint hemarthroses, port site, and epistaxis) involving 11 subjects. Eptacog beta was effective for acute bleed treatment as both first-line therapy and for treatment of BEs refractory to eptacog alfa in 23/24 events. When eptacog beta was used for prophylaxis, 2/3 patients reported a decreased frequency of breakthrough BEs compared with prophylactic eptacog alfa and one patient experienced a similar frequency of breakthrough BEs compared with prophylactic activated prothrombin complex concentrate. Eptacog beta provided effective bleed control for three subjects who underwent minor surgical procedures. Treatment with eptacog beta was estimated to be 46%-72% more cost-effective than eptacog alfa. No safety concerns or adverse events were reported. In this case series, eptacog beta was safe, effective, and economical as first-line therapy, treatment of refractory BEs, management of perioperative bleeding, or prophylaxis in haemophilia patients with inhibitors."

    "abstract": "Patients with severe and sometimes moderate hemophilia B are prophylactically treated with factor IX concentrates to prevent bleeding. For some time now, various extended terminal half-life (EHL) recombinant factor IX concentrates are available allowing less frequent administration during prophylaxis in comparison to standard half-life recombinant FIX (rFIX). Especially, recombinant FIX-Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc; Alprolix®) exhibits a rapid distribution phase, potentially due to binding to type IV collagen (Col4) in the extravascular space. Studies suggest that the presence of extravascular rFIXFc is protective against bleeding as without measurable FIX activity in plasma, and no extra bleeding seems to occur. The physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for rFIXFc which we describe in this study, is able to accurately predict the observed concentration-time profiles of rFIXFc in plasma and is able to quantify the binding of rFIXFc to Col4 in the extravascular space after an intravenous dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc in a male population. Our model predicts that the total AUC of rFIXFc bound to Col4 in the extravascular space is approximately 19 times higher compared to the AUC of rFIXFc in plasma. This suggests that rFIXFc present in the extravascular compartment may play an important role in achieving hemostasis after rFIXFc administration. Further studies on extravascular distribution of rFIXFc and the distribution profile of other EHL-FIX concentrates are needed to evaluate the predictions of our PBPK model and to investigate its clinical relevance."

To evaluate the clinical applicability of targeted LRS-based analysis compared with routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. Gene variants of retrieved subjects were retrospectively and prospectively analyzed. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to further analyze undiagnosed cases. Breakpoints of novel genomic rearrangements were mapped and validated using long-distance PCR and long-range PCR combined with sequencing. In total, 122 subjects were retrieved. In retrospective analysis of the 90 HA cases, HA-LRS assay showed consistent results in 84 cases compared with routine methods and characterized 6 large deletions with their exact breakpoints confirmed by further validation in 6 cases (routine methods only presented failure in amplifying the involved exons). In prospective analysis of the 21 HA subjects, 20 variants of F8 were identified in 20 cases. For the remaining HA patient, no duplication/deletion or single-nucleotide variant (SNV)/insertion and deletion (InDel) was found, but a potential recombination involving exons 14 and 21 of F8 was observed by LRS. Whole-genome sequencing analysis and further verification defined a 30 478 base pairs (bp) tandem repeat involving exons 14 to 21 of F8. Among the 11 HB patients, HB-LRS analysis detected 11 SNVs/InDels in F9, consistent with routine methods. Targeted LRS-based analysis was efficient and comprehensive in identifying SNVs/InDels and genomic rearrangements of hemophilia genes, especially when we first expanded the panel to include F9.

In this study, the cassettes that expressed FXa, FXaop and FXa-FVII were packaged into an engineered AAV capsid, AAV843, and were delivered into hemophilia A and B mice by intravenous injection. AAV-FXaop could be stably expressed in vivo and showed the best immediate and prolonged hemostatic effects, similar to those of commercial drugs (Xyntha and Benefix). AAV-FXaop also significantly inhibited bleeding in hemophilia A mice with inhibitors. In addition, FXa expression in joints significantly alleviated the occurrence of hemophilic synovitis.

Various methods of gene transfer have been developed to enable the production of the deficient enzyme or protein. One of the most important is adeno-associated virus vectors, which have been shown to be viable for use in in vivo gene therapy. Several gene therapies have already been approved. They are also promising for acquired diseases. Important examples include gene therapy for haemophilia A and B, X-linked myotubular myopathy, spinal muscular atrophy and several liver diseases such as Criggler-Najjar disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and Fabry disease. However, the introduction of a foreign compound into hepatocytes leads to hepatic reactions with heterogeneous phenotypic expression and a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from mild transaminase elevation to acute liver failure. Several mechanisms appear to be involved in liver injury, including an immune response, but also direct toxicity depending on the method of gene transfer. As a result, the incidence, expression and severity of liver injury vary from indication to indication and from patient to patient. Patients treated for haemophilia A are more prone to transaminase elevation than those treated for haemophilia B. Corticosteroids are successfully used to correct liver reactions but also to prevent degradation of the transferred gene and loss of therapeutic activity. The aim of this review is to describe the risk of liver injury according to the indication for gene therapy and the short- and long-term management currently proposed to prevent or correct liver reactions in clinical practice."

PopPK analyses were used to determine a product's optimal posology to target predefined steady-state FIX activity trough levels in a hypothetical population of 10,000 people with severe HB. Model-derived optimal posologies were compared across several parameters including trough levels, proportion of patients per regimen and consumption, considering 64 hypothetical patient scenarios of different FIX trough level targets and ages. Results indicated a marked difference between FIX products estimated to achieve target trough levels, consumption and dosing frequencies. rIX-FP was associated with higher trough levels than rFIX and rFIXFc, at a lower weekly dose and administration frequency, across all age groups. N9-GP use in adolescents and adults was associated with lower consumption compared with rIX-FP. Insights from this study may be utilized by clinicians to inform decision-making, by considering the model-generated estimated optimal posologies alongside multiple clinical factors and patient preferences."

    "abstract": "Testing for coagulation factors VIII (FVIII) and IX (FIX) plays significant importance in the diagnostic and treatment of hemophilia A and B. External quality assessment (EQA) scheme aimed to assess the participants' performance of testing for coagulation factors and identify shortcomings in clinical practice. This study aimed to investigate the performance trends of the participating laboratories in China national external quality assessment Scheme (China NEQAS) for FVIII and FIX over a five-year period (2019-2023). A total of ten external quality assessment (EQA) rounds were conducted from 2019 to 2023 in the China NEQAS for FVIII and FIX. The distribution of method, reagent and instrument were calculated. The trends of method- specific inter-laboratory coefficient of variation (CV) and pass rates were analyzed over 5 years. The dilutions for coagulation factor testing were also investigated. All laboratories use one-stage assays to detect FVIII and FIX activity. The inter-laboratory overall CV decreased year by year (10.9 % to 9.3 % for FVIII and 13.5 % to 10.2 % for FIX), and the laboratory pass rate steadily increased (88.0 % to 93.4 % for FVIII and 81.3 % to 92.7 % for FIX). The majority of laboratories employed a single dilution methodology for the assessment of FVIII and FIX activity. The interlaboratory CV was elevated for the Siemens reagent (Actin FSL) during analysis of moderately abnormal FIX concentrations of EQA samples in most batches. The implementation of the external quality assessment has contributed to facilitate the enhancement of testing quality. Chromogenic assay is a supplement to accurate determination when necessary. Laboratories may choose to perform dilution tests or direct assays to identify the presence of inhibitors, particularly when they are suspected."

    "abstract": "<b>Aims/Background</b> Reliable health-related quality of life data are critical in developing countries, in order to advocate for government agencies to develop national hemophilia care programmes. This study aims to explore the current status and influencing factors of health-related quality of life among adolescents with hemophilia in Hubei Province, so as to provide empirical data for professionals. <b>Methods</b> A total of 84 children with hemophilia aged 8 to 18, who were registered in Tongji Hemophilia Treatment Center and Hubei Hemophilia Home, were selected using a cluster sampling method. The \"General Situation Questionnaire of Hemophiliac Adolescents\", designed by Tongji Hemophilia Treatment Center, and \"the Chinese version of Canadian hemophilia outcomes-kid's life assessment tool (CHO-KLAT)\", were used for this study conducted from June 1, 2022 to December 30, 2022. <b>Results</b> 82 completed questionnaires were included. The average age of the 82 adolescents was 13.04 ± 3.29 years and all were males. Among them, 67 were hemophilia A and 15 were hemophilia B. 61 cases were severe type, 19 were moderate type and 2 cases were mild type. The average total score of the CHO-KLAT for adolescents with hemophilia in Hubei Province was 49.49, which was lower than their counterparts in developed countries. The statistically significant influencing factors included residence, annual family income, and disease type. <b>Conclusion</b> This study provides empirical data support for the health management of adolescents with hemophilia, highlighting the importance of improving medical resource access, transfusion convenience, and psychological support in enhancing the quality of life for this group. The results emphasize the need for healthcare systems and policymakers to take specific measures to address these factors to improve the treatment and care conditions for adolescents with hemophilia."

    "abstract": "<i>Mycobacterium cosmeticum</i> is an emerging rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) species that has been rarely reported to cause human disease. RGM catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) are often challenging to treat given the need for line removal, variable species-dependent antimicrobial susceptibility, combination antimicrobial treatment, and historically longer courses of antibiotics. We present a case of an immunocompetent pediatric patient with severe hemophilia B and <i>M. cosmeticum</i> CRBSI. While the patient's hemophilia B precluded a standard line holiday, he successfully cleared his infection with two line exchanges followed by two weeks of antibiotics. RGM, including emerging species <i>M. cosmeticum</i>, may be considered in patients with an indolent presentation of CRBSI. Our case suggests source control with shorter courses of antimicrobials can be successful."

    "abstract": "People with hemophilia often experience pain and suffer from comorbidities related to their bleeding disorder. Consequently, unemployment due to disability is prevalent among people with hemophilia. To explore associations between unemployment due to disability and treatment while adjusting for known risk factors for unemployment. Collecting data from 20 hemophilia centers from 15 European countries, the Age-related DeVelopments ANd ComorbiditiEs in hemophilia study recruited 785 participants aged 40 years and over with hemophilia A or B. A comprehensive electronic case report form included items related to patient characteristics, demographic information, past and current treatment regimens, and medical history, including a lifelong history of comorbidities. Baseline data from the Age-related DeVelopments ANd ComorbiditiEs in hemophilia study was analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models. Employment status was available for 756 of 785 participants aged 40 to 88 years (median, 53 years). We used regression analysis to compare people with hemophilia who were fully employed with those who were unemployed due to disability. This analysis included 424 participants. Using multivariable logistic regression, we found that age (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; <i>P</i> < .01), severe hemophilia (OR, 10.81; <i>P</i> < .01), current smoker (OR, 2.53; <i>P</i> < .01), and psychiatric disorder (OR, 4.18; <i>P</i> = .02) were associated with increased odds of unemployment due to disability. In contrast, prophylactic treatment (OR, 0.44; <i>P</i> = .01) was associated with decreased odds. Our analysis suggests that by maintaining factor levels above a critical threshold (3%-5%), prophylactic treatment for people with hemophilia could help avoid unemployment due to disability. While prophylaxis is more costly and can be burdensome, the benefits to material well-being and quality of life could be substantial."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B is an inherited hemorrhagic disorder characterized by a deficiency of blood coagulation factor IX (FIX) that results in abnormal blood coagulation. The blood coagulation is already evident in hemophiliacs at the fetal stage, and thus intracranial hemorrhage and other bleeding complications can occur at birth, leading to sequelae. Therefore, it is important to develop effective treatments for hemophiliacs in utero. In this study, in order to transplacentally deliver FIX from pregnant mice to their fetuses, an improved adenovirus (Ad) vector expressing human FIX fused with the IgG Fc domain (FIX Fc fusion protein), which plays a crucial role in neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated transcytosis across the placenta, was intravenously administered to E13.5 pregnant mice. Significant levels of FIX Fc fusion protein were detected in 0-day-old newborn mice whose mothers were administered an Ad vector expressing FIX Fc fusion protein. Wild-type FIX overexpressed in the pregnant mice was not delivered to the fetuses. Plasma FIX levels in the newborn mice were relatively well correlated with those in their mothers, although transplacental delivery efficiencies of FIX Fc fusion protein were slightly reduced when the FIX Fc fusion protein was highly expressed in the mother mice. Plasma FIX levels in the newborn mice were about 3.6-6.4% of those in their mothers, Transplacental delivery of FIX Fc fusion protein to their fetuses successfully improved the blood clotting ability in the newborn mice."

The European Medicines Agency has approved gene therapy for the severe and moderately severe forms of hemophilia B that uses the FIX-Padua variant (etranacogene dezaparvovec). The aim was to provide a document dedicated to hemophilia B gene therapy and give a comprehensive overview of the topic. An Italian group of experts in hemophilia carried out a narrative review of the literature and discussed during a virtual meeting several key aspects of the delivery of this treatment in Italy. The discussion covered the organizational model, the role of the multidisciplinary team, the laboratory surveillance, and the patient's journey, from the follow-up to the identification of safety issues and outcome measures. This article highlights the need to follow the Hub and Spoke organizational model and sheds light on the role of each professional figure within the multidisciplinary teams to favor patient engagement, management, and retention. Moreover, this article stresses the need to perform laboratory tests for patient screening and follow-up and proposes a checklist to help patient identification. Finally, the needs of Italian hemophilia centers have been considered to ensure an efficient implementation of the care delivery model. It is crucial to ensure that centers are appropriately organized, equipped, and trained to adequately select patients, deliver the gene therapy, and perform follow-up."

    "title": "Navigating the Challenges of Factor X Deficiency: A Case Study.",
    "abstract": "The clotting pathway involves intrinsic and extrinsic pathways converging into a common pathway. These pathways require activated factors that sequentially convert prothrombin to thrombin, which then converts fibrinogen to fibrin, forming a stable clot. Clotting factor deficiency impairs this cascade leading to excessive bleeding or bruising due to insufficient clot formation. Here, we present the case of a 47-year-old female who initially complained of epigastric pain. By the third day of admission, she experienced four to five episodes of bleeding gums, resulting in a blood loss of approximately 300 mL. The patient exhibited abnormal prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) values, leading to a diagnosis of Factor X (FX) deficiency upon further evaluation. This case report emphasizes the need to diagnose coagulopathies such as FX deficiency and how early diagnosis will help not only in patient care and management but also in screening family members who may be affected."

    "abstract": "Despite numerous efforts to raise awareness, many hemophilia carriers and female persons with hemophilia (PWHs) remain undiagnosed. Between May 2021 and April 2023, we identified potential and obligate carriers of hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) by updating pedigrees of all PWHs followed at the Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels. Retrospective data on previously screened females were collected, including bleeding history, coagulation factor levels, and testing for the proband's pathogenic variant. In addition, a proactive approach involved sending 125 invitation letters to unscreened or incompletely screened individuals, through related PWHs. In pedigrees of 287 male PWHs (226 HA and 61 HB) and 7 female index patients from 236 families (184 HA and 52 HB), a total of 900 female individuals were identified. Of those, 454 were obligate and/or genetically proven carriers, and 118 were noncarriers. Genetic testing was conducted in 133 obligate, 237 potential, and 4 sporadic carriers, with 190 obligate and 328 potential carriers remaining untested. Among carriers with known factor levels (261/454), 42 HA (23.0%) and 23 HB carriers (29.5%) had a factor level <40 IU/dL. Carriers with a factor deficiency were screened on average 6 years earlier than other females (P = .034). This study, to our knowledge, represents the first systematic effort to identify potential carriers among families of all PWHs within a single center, emphasizing the challenges in comprehensive screening for female individuals genetically linked to one or more PWHs. Such initiatives are vital for achieving equitable access to hemophilia care for all potentially affected individuals, irrespective of gender. This trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT05217992."

To determine the contemporary incidence of severe primary PPH in women with VWD and HCs. All women with VWD or HCs who delivered between 2012 and 2017 were selected from all 6 Dutch hemophilia treatment centers. Data on patient and disease characteristics, peripartum hematologic and obstetric management, and outcomes were retrospectively collected. Incidence of severe primary (≥1000 mL of blood loss ≤24 hours after childbirth) and primary (≥500 mL within ≤24 hours after childbirth) PPH was compared with the (1) previous cohort and (2) general Dutch population and between (3) women with VWD and HCs with third-trimester coagulation activity levels <50 international units (IU)/dL vs ≥50 IU/dL and (4) women treated with vs without peripartum hemostatic prophylaxis. Three-hundred forty-eight deliveries (151 VWD, 167 hemophilia A, and 30 hemophilia B carriers) were included. The severe primary PPH incidence was 10% (36/348) and remained stable over time, whereas this incidence has increased in the general population (to 8%), leading to a similar risk (<i>P</i> = .17). Severe primary PPH risk was comparable between women with coagulation activity levels <50 and ≥50 IU/dL (11% [7/66] vs 10% [29/279]; odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.43-2.44) and comparable between those with and those without prophylaxis (12% [11/91] vs 10% [25/254]; odds ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.59-2.68). Severe primary PPH in women with VWD and HCs remained stable and is comparable with the increasing prevalence in the general population. More research is needed to find the optimal pregnancy management strategy for safe delivery in VWD and HC."

To investigate patient and caregiver handling and preference for the concizumab pen-injector compared with current injection systems used to treat hemophilia. This preference and handling study was conducted in accordance with authority guidelines for approval of new devices and included adults and adolescents with HA/HB with or without inhibitors and caregivers currently administering factor replacement therapy or factor VIII mimetic (emicizumab) therapy. All participants underwent a training session, followed by a test session during which participants independently administered a single pen-injection into an injection pad or manikin. Time to train, time to prepare and inject, and number of complete independent injections handling the pen were assessed. Participants evaluated handling and preference via the Hemophilia Device Handling and Preference Assessment Questionnaire. 80 participants (44 adults, 21 adolescents, 15 caregivers) currently using factor replacement therapy (n=41, 51%) or emicizumab (n=39, 49%) participated. Average training time and time to complete an injection were 7 min 49s and 1 min 21s. In total, 98% of independent complete injections were achieved at first attempt. 98% (n=78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 91-100%) of participants assessed the pen-injector as either \"easy\" or \"very easy\" to use. 88% of participants preferred the pen-injector (n=70; 95% CI 78-94%) over their current injection system, and 9% (n=7) reported \"no preference\". Participants found the concizumab pen-injector easy to learn and easy to use and preferred it over their current injection systems."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B (HB) is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by defects in the FⅨ gene, leading to severe coagulation dysfunction. This study designed eight pairs of primers covering eight exons of the FⅨ gene and used PCR and DNA sequencing to detect FⅨ gene mutations in 31 HB patients. Sequencing results were compared with normal sequences using Chromas software on Blast to identify mutation sites. Findings revealed the CpG dinucleotide region as a mutation hotspot and the 192nd nucleotide (FⅨ192) as a dinucleotide polymorphism site in the Chinese population. Pathogenic mutations included point mutations, deletions, insertions, and mutations affecting amino acids or splicing sites. For cases with only polymorphic sites, further exon sequencing is needed. This study adds new mutation data to the global HB database, supports research on racial differences in FⅨ gene mutations, and contributes to domestic HB statistics. The results aid in understanding the FⅨ gene's role in coagulation, elucidating HB pathogenesis, and providing a basis for future gene therapy."

This case also highlights that patient was conservatively managed with Factor IX replacement alone with a very good clinical outcome. HP should be considered as a differential diagnosis of any progressive swelling of hard and soft tissues occurring in a patient with severe haemophilia."

A prospective survey was conducted in three different hospitals of Benin from April 2021 to March 2022, to analyse clinical and biological features of patients with haemophilia previously diagnosed or identified based on personal/family history. A total of 101 patients were studied, 97 with haemophilia A and 4 with haemophilia B, including 26 new cases identified after family investigation. Their median age was 11 years, and the most frequent initial manifestations were cutaneous-mucosal haemorrhages (29.70%) and post-circumcision haemorrhages (25.74%). Previous joint bleedings were present in 77% of them, with an arthropathy in 65 cases, which particularly affected the knees (75%), elbows (41%) and ankles (29%). Factor VIII (FVIII) levels combined with activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) values did not always enable, as would be expected, the distinction between severe and moderate haemophilia, since they were >1 IU/dl in 31 of 74 patients with APTT > 80 s, and between 1 and 2 IU/dl in 26 other cases with previous joint haemorrhages, including 18 with chronic arthropathy. Therefore, for these patients, severe haemophilia could not be excluded, and this uncertainty probably reflects technical difficulties affecting the pre-analytical and analytical stages of the APTT and FVIII/IX assays. Our study proved that haemophilia is a significant reality in Benin, but also remains under-diagnosed in some districts of the country. In addition, more reliable biological tests are needed in the future to better define the severity of the disease and improve treatment of patients."

Patients enrolled in the multicenter, open-label explorer7 phase 3 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04083781) were randomized to receive no prophylaxis (arm 1) or concizumab prophylaxis (arm 2) or were nonrandomly allocated to concizumab prophylaxis (arms 3 and 4). The study included questionnaires to assess patients' perception of HRQoL (Haemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults), treatment burden (Hemophilia Treatment Experience Measure), and treatment preference (Haemophilia Patient Preference Questionnaire). The estimated treatment difference between patients receiving concizumab prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis at week 24 for Haemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults \"total score\" was -22.6 points (95% CI, -42.5; -2.7), directionally favoring patients receiving concizumab prophylaxis. For Hemophilia Treatment Experience Measure \"total score,\" the estimated treatment difference was -19.9 points (95% CI, -34.3, -5.6) in favor of concizumab vs no prophylaxis. The majority of patients receiving concizumab expressed a preference for concizumab over their previous treatment, the main reasons being \"fewer bleeds,\" \"require less time,\" and \"less painful to inject.\" Across all PROs, there were less responses collected than anticipated, limiting interpretations. PROs collected during the explorer7 study showed improvements in some domains of HRQoL, treatment burden, and patient treatment preference in persons with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors receiving concizumab prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis."

    "abstract": "Coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) is essential for hemostasis. After activation, it combines with activated FIX (FIXa) on anionic membranes to form the intrinsic Xase enzyme complex, responsible for activating FX in the rate-limiting step of sustained coagulation. Hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B are due to inherited deficiencies in the activity of FVIII and FIX, respectively. Treatment of HA over the last decade has benefited from an improved understanding of FVIII biology, including its secretion pathway, its interaction with von Willebrand factor in circulation, the biochemical nature of its FIXa cofactor activity, the regulation of activated FVIII by inactivation pathways, and its surprising immunogenicity. This has facilitated biotechnology innovations with first-in-class examples of several new therapeutic modalities recently receiving regulatory approval for HA, including FVIII-mimetic bispecific antibodies and recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector-based gene therapy. Biological insights into FVIII also guide the development and use of gain-of-function FVIII variants aimed at addressing the limitations of first-generation rAAV vectors for HA. Several gain-of-function FVIII variants designed to have improved secretion are currently incorporated in second-generation rAAV vectors and have recently entered clinical trials. Continued mutually reinforcing advancements in the understanding of FVIII biology and treatments for HA are necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of hemophilia therapy: normalizing hemostasis and optimizing well-being with minimal treatment burden for all patients worldwide."

    "abstract": "This viewpoint discusses cost-effectiveness estimates for EtranaDez, a gene therapy for hemophilia B, using the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review's (ICER) framework for single and short-term therapies (SSTs). EtranaDez offers long-term benefits from a single administration, in contrast to the high costs and frequent dosing required by current factor IX prophylaxis. However, the projected gains in health from EtranaDez are small relative to the cost implications of the therapy, and consequently, how the cost offsets associated with EtranaDez are counted has a substantial impact on assessing its cost-effectiveness. Strategies for assessing cost offsets used in the ICER SST framework include a 50/50 cost-sharing model between the health care system and the manufacturer and a cap of $150,000 annually on health care cost offsets. Results from the standard full cost-offset analysis as reported by ICER depicted EtranaDez as a dominant therapy with substantial cost savings compared with factor IX prophylaxis. However, while considering the ICER SST framework, particularly the $150,000 annual cap scenario, the cost-effectiveness was significantly reduced. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio varied notably between these scenarios, challenging the conventional perception of value of gene therapy in health care. These cost-sharing scenarios highlight the potential of the ICER SST framework to help curtail inefficient health care spending. In cases in which the cost of existing treatment is exceedingly high, the application of such frameworks would improve efficiency in resource allocation, fostering a balance between incentives for innovation and economic sustainability in managed care systems."

    "abstract": "Patients with hemophilia frequently require supplementary interventions, either invasive (suturing, gel foam, or cauterization) or non-invasive (fibrin sealant/glue), to attain hemostasis post dental procedures. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of fibrin sealant against traditional methods for achieving hemostasis post dental surgery. The medical records of patients with factor VIII or IX deficiency, or von Willebrand disease, who underwent dental procedures in the Department of Dentistry, Seth GSMC and KEM Hospital, were evaluated for inclusion in this retrospective matched cohort study. Cohort-1 included those treated with a fibrin sealant (Tisseel Lyo) with/without traditional hemostatic measures post-procedure, while cohort-2 (controls) included those in whom no fibrin sealant was used. A total of 128 patients, 64 in each group, were evaluated. There was no statistically significant difference in demographics, disease-related variables, dental complaints, or preoperative treatment given between the groups. However, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the requirement for secondary procedures for hemostasis (suturing, gel foam application, and/or cauterization) and postoperative requirement for factor replacement (P = 0.003) in the fibrin glue group as compared to the controls. In this study, fibrin sealant demonstrated superior efficacy in mitigating the necessity for active hemostasis control."

    "title": "Recent Advances in Gene Therapy for Hemophilia: Projecting the Perspectives.",
    "abstract": "One of the well-known X-linked genetic disorders is hemophilia, which could be hemophilia A as a result of a mutation in the <i>F8</i> (factor VIII) gene or hemophilia B as a result of a mutation in the <i>F9</i> (factor IX) gene, leading to insufficient levels of the proteins essential for blood coagulation cascade. In patients with severe hemophilia, factor VIII or factor IX activities in the blood plasma are considerably low, estimated to be less than 1%. This is responsible for spontaneous or post-traumatic bleeding episodes, or both, leading to disease complications and death. Current treatment of hemophilia relies on the prevention of bleeding, which consists of expensive lifelong replacement infusion therapy of blood plasma clotting factors, their recombinant versions, or therapy with recombinant monoclonal antibodies. Recently emerged gene therapy approaches may be a potential game changer that could reshape the therapeutic outcomes of hemophilia A or B using a one-off vector in vivo delivery and aim to achieve long-term endogenous expression of factor VIII or IX. This review examines both traditional approaches to the treatment of hemophilia and modern methods, primarily focusing on gene therapy, to update knowledge in this area. Recent technological advances and gene therapeutics in the pipeline are critically reviewed and summarized. We consider gene therapy to be the most promising method as it may overcome the problems associated with more traditional treatments, such as the need for constant and expensive infusions and the presence of an immune response to the antibody drugs used to treat hemophilia."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a rare congenital bleeding disorder that results from complete or partial deficiency of blood coagulation factor (F)VIII (hemophilia A) or FIX (hemophilia B) due to pathogenic variants in their coding genes. Hemophilia requires complex management. To date, there is no evidence-based clinical practice guideline on hemophilia treatment based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This evidence-based clinical practice guideline from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis aims to provide an overview of evidence and support patients, caregivers, hematologists, pediatricians, other clinicians, researchers, and stakeholders in treatment decisions about congenital hemophilia A and B. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of physicians and patients with global representation, balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The panel prioritized a set of clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. A methodological team supported the guideline development process, including searching for evidence and performing systematic reviews. The GRADE approach was used, including GRADE Evidence to Decision frameworks. The recommendations were subject to public comment. The panel selected 13 questions, of which 11 addressed the treatment of hemophilia A and 2 the treatment of hemophilia B. Specifically, the panel addressed questions on prophylactic and episodic treatment with FVIII concentrates, bypassing agents, and nonfactor therapy (emicizumab) for hemophilia A (with and without inhibitors) as well as immune tolerance induction for hemophilia A. For hemophilia B, the panel addressed questions on prophylactic and episodic treatment of bleeding events with FIX concentrates. Agreement was reached for all 13 recommendations, of which 7 (54%) were based on evidence from randomized clinical trials, 3 (23%) on observational studies, and 3 (23%) on indirect comparisons. Strong recommendations were issued for prophylactic over episodic treatment for severe and moderately severe hemophilia A and B. Only conditional recommendations were issued for the remaining questions. Future research should focus on direct treatment comparisons and the treatment of hemophilia B with and without inhibitors. Future updates of this guideline will provide an updated evidence synthesis on the current questions and focus on new FVIII and FIX concentrates, novel nonfactor therapies, and gene therapy for severe and nonsevere hemophilia A and B."

The prospective, non-interventional explorer6 study included patients ≥12 years old with severe HA, severe/moderate HB or HAwI/HBwI of any severity, treated according to local standard of care (excluding previous/current exposure to concizumab or emicizumab). Baseline characteristics and historical clinical data were collected and patient-reported outcomes, including treatment burden, were assessed. The explorer6 study enrolled 231 patients with haemophilia (84 HAwI/HBwI) from 33 countries. At baseline, patients with HA/HB treated with prophylaxis had the lowest median annualised bleeding rates (ABRs; 2.0), irrespective of haemophilia type; of these patients, 27.5% (HA) and 31.4% (HB) had target joints. Patients with HAwI/HBwI treated episodically reported the highest treatment burden. Of these patients, 28.5% (HAwI) and 25.1% (HBwI) performed sports activities in the month before screening. Despite receiving routine clinical care, historical and baseline information from patients enrolled in explorer6 showed that patients with HA/HB treated episodically and patients with HAwI/HBwI had higher ABRs, higher treatment burden and participated in sports less than those with HA/HB treated with prophylaxis. Emerging treatments could be beneficial in addressing these unmet medical needs."

After the first 50 exposure days (EDs), ie, in previously treated patients (PTPs), data on inhibitor development are limited. To report inhibitor development according to factor (F)VIII or FIX concentrate use in PTPs with severe hemophilia A and B. Inhibitor development in PTPs was collected since 2008 from 97 centers participating in European HAemophilia Safety Surveillance. Per concentrate, inhibitors were reported quarterly and the number of PTPs treated annually. Incidence rates (IRs)/1000 treatment years with 95% CIs were compared between concentrate types (plasma derived FVIII/FIX, standard half-life recombinant FVIII/FIX, and extended half-life recombinant (EHL-rFVIII/IX) concentrates using IR ratios with CI. Medians and IQRs were calculated for inhibitor characteristics. For severe haemophilia A, inhibitor rate was 66/65,200 treatment years, IR 1.00/1000 years (CI 0.80-1.30), occurring at median 13.5 years (2.7-31.5) and 150 EDs (80-773). IR on plasma-derived pdFVIII (IR, 1.13) and standard half-life recombinant FVIII (IR, 1.12) were similar, whereas IR on EHL-rFVIII was lower at 0.13 (incidence rate ratio, 0.12; 95% CI, <0.01-0.70; <i>P</i> < .01).For severe hemophilia B, inhibitor rate was 5/11,160 treatment years and IR was 0.45/1000 years (95% CI, 0.15-1.04), at median 3.7 years (95% CI, 2.1-42.4) and 260 EDs (95% CI, 130 to >1000). Data were insufficient to compare by type of FIX concentrates. Low inhibitor rates were observed for PTPs with severe hemophilia A and B. Data suggested reduced inhibitor development on EHL-rFVIII, but no significant difference between plasma-derived FVIII and standard half-life recombinant FVIII. FIX inhibitor rates were too low for robust statistical analysis."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by a mutation in the gene responsible for encoding coagulation factor IX (FIX). Gene therapy offers promising potential for curing this disease. However, the current method of relatively high dosage of virus injection carries inherent risks. The purpose of this study was to introduce a novel scAAV-DJ/8-LP1-hFIXco vector transduced human umbilical cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells (HUCMSCs) as an alternative cell-based gene therapy to conventional gene therapy for Hemophilia B. The LP1-hFIXco gene structure was designed by us through searching the literature from NCBI and the scAAV-DJ/8-LP1-hFIXco vector was constructed by a commercial company. The HUCMSCs were cultivated in routine approach and transduced with scAAV-DJ/8-LP1-hFIXco vector. The human FIX activation system was employed for detection of hFIXco activity. The RNA and protein expression levels of the hFIXco were evaluated using PCR and western blot techniques. In animal studies, both NSG and F9-KO mice were used for the experiment, in which clotting time was utilized as a parameter for bleeding assessment. The immunohistochemical analysis was used to assess the distribution of HUCMSCs in mouse tissue sections. The safety for tumorigenicity of this cell-based gene therapy was evaluated by pathological observation after hematoxylin-eosin staining. The transduction of HUCMSCs with the scAAV-DJ/8-LP1-hFIXco vector results in consistent and sustainable secretion of human FIXco during 5 months period both in vitro and in mouse model. The secretion level (hFIXco activity: 97.1 ± 2.3% at day 7 to 48.8 ± 4.5% at 5 months) was comparable to that observed following intravenous injection with a high dose of the viral vector (hFIXco activity: 95.2 ± 2.2% to 40.8 ± 4.3%). After a 5-month observation period, no clonal expansions of the transduced cells in tissues were observed in any of the mice studied. We have discovered a novel and safer HUCMSCs mediated approach potentially effective for gene therapy in hemophilia B."

To contribute elements to interpret unclassified HB-associated FIX missense variants by a multiple-level approach upon identification of a reported, but uncharacterized, FIX missense variant associated with mild HB. Molecular modeling of wild-type and V92A FIX variants, expression studies in HEK293 cells with evaluation of protein (ELISA, western blotting) and activity (activated partial thromboplastin time-based/chromogenic assays) levels after recombinant expression, and multiple prediction tools. The F9(NM_000133.4):c.275T>C (p.V92A) variant was found in a mild HB patient (antigen, 45.4 U/dL; coagulant activity, 23.6 IU/dL; specific activity, 0.52). Newly generated molecular models showed alterations in Gla/EGF1-EGF2 domain conformation impacting Ca<sup>++</sup> affinity and protein-protein interactions with activated factor XI (FXIa). Multitool analysis indicated a moderate impact on protein structure/function of the valine-to-alanine substitution, in accordance with patient and modeling data. Expression studies on the V92A variant showed a specific activity (0.49 ± 0.07; wild-type, 1.0 ± 0.1) recapitulating that of the natural variant, and pointed toward a moderate activation impairment as the main determinant underlying the p.V92A defect. The validated multitool approach, integrated with evidence-based data, was challenged on a panel (n = 9) of unclassified FIX missense variants, which resulted in inferred protein (secretion/function) outputs and HB severity. The rational integration of multitool and multiparameter analyses contributed elements to interpret genotype/phenotype relationships of unclassified FIX missense variants, with implications for diagnosis, management, and treatment of HB patients, and potentially translatable into other human disorders."

Although new recombinant FIX (rIX) therapeutics like albumin fusion proteins (rIX-FP) enable longer plasma half-life and thus less frequent administration, the complexity of intravenous (i.v.) injection remains. The study aimed to characterize rIX-FP variants with anticipated enhanced specific activity, which would leverage rIX-FP's superior pharmacokinetic profile with beneficial characteristics for subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. Two rIX-FP variants, R338L (\"Padua variant\") and R338L/E410K, were characterized in vitro. Pharmacokinetic profiles of FIX antigen and activity levels were evaluated in FIX-deficient mice after i.v. and s.c. administration of these variants (dosing based on antigen levels). The efficacy of the most promising variant was tested after i.v. and s.c. administration (dosing based on activity) in a tail clip bleeding model. A marketed wild-type (WT) rIX-FP product served as the comparator. Both rIX-FP variants showed a 4- to 5-fold increase in specific activity in vitro compared with rIX(WT)-FP, while FXIa-mediated activation was the fastest for rIX(WT)-FP and rIX(R338L)-FP. Compared with rIX(WT)-FP and rIX(R338L/E410K)-FP, rIX(R338L)-FP exhibited higher FIX activity exposure after i.v. and s.c. administration and demonstrated comparable efficacy with rIX(WT)-FP in reducing bleeding time and blood loss in FIX-deficient mice requiring ∼4 times lower protein amount. rIX(R338L)-FP was shown to be a promising candidate for s.c. administration, exhibiting increased specific activity combined with higher activity-based exposure and indicating efficacy at a lower protein dose."

    "title": "Blood coagulation factor IX: structural insights impacting hemophilia B therapy.",
    "abstract": "Coagulation factor IX plays a central role in hemostasis through interaction with factor VIIIa to form a factor X-activating complex at the site of injury. The absence of factor IX activity results in the bleeding disorder hemophilia B. This absence of activity can arise either from a lack of circulating factor IX protein or mutations that decrease the activity of factor IX. This review focuses on analyzing the structure of factor IX with respect to molecular mechanisms that are at the basis of factor IX function. The proteolytic activation of factor IX to form activated factor IX(a) and subsequent structural rearrangements are insufficient to generate the fully active factor IXa. Multiple specific interactions between factor IXa, the cofactor VIIIa, and the physiological substrate factor X further alter the factor IXa structure to achieve the full enzymatic activity of factor IXa. Factor IXa also interacts with inhibitors, extravascular proteins, and cellular receptors that clear factor IX(a) from the circulation. Hemophilia B is treated by replacement of the missing factor IX by plasma-derived protein, a recombinant bioequivalent, or via gene therapy. An understanding of how the function of factor IX is tied to structure leads to modified forms of factor IX that have increased residence time in circulation, higher functional activity, protection from inhibition, and even activity in the absence of factor VIIIa. These modified forms of factor IX have the potential to significantly improve therapy for patients with hemophilia B."

Roctavian is the first licensed HA gene therapy that was conditionally approved in Europe in August 2022 and approved in the United States in June 2023. Beyond Roctavian, there are ongoing pivotal trials of additional AAV vectors for HA, others that are progressing through preclinical development or early-phase clinical trial, as well as non-AAV approaches in clinical development. This review focuses on the clinical development of Roctavian for which the collective clinical trials represent the largest body of work thus far available for any licensed AAV product. From this pioneering clinical development, several outstanding questions have emerged for which the answers will undoubtedly be important to the clinical adaptation of Roctavian and future efforts in HA gene therapy. Most notably, unexplained year-over-year declines in factor VIII (FVIII) expression after Roctavian treatment contrast with stable FVIII expression observed in other AAV HA gene therapy clinical trials with more modest initial FVIII expression. This observation has been qualitatively replicated in animal models that may permit mechanistic study. The development and approval of Roctavian is a landmark in HA therapeutics, although next-generation approaches are needed before HA gene therapy fulfills its promise of stable FVIII expression that normalizes hemostasis."

In this retrospective, single-centre cohort study, subjects were included if they were obligate or genetically proven HB carriers. Distributions of aPTT and FIX:C were described and the relationship between FIX:C levels in carriers and severity of familial HB was analysed. Ratios of FIX:C to FII:C, FVII:C, FX:C were calculated. Seventy-two female HB carriers (median age: 34 years; IQR 24-43) were included. Median aPTT and FIX:C levels were 33.0 s [IQR 30.0-37.0] and 57 IU/dL [IQR 43-74]. Fifteen carriers (21%) had mild HB (FIX:C levels of 10-40 IU/dL). FIX:C levels trended higher in carriers of mild HB versus carriers of moderate/severe HB. In six carriers, the median ratio of FIX:C to other Vitamin K dependent factors was 0.44, with 92% of ratios being ≤ 0.75. aPTT and FIX:C levels were unreliable in diagnosing HB carrier status.

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B is characterized by a deficiency of clotting factor IX (FIX), leading to excessive bleeding. Hemophilia B is commonly treated using replacement FIX therapy, which may be administered prophylactically or on-demand following a bleeding episode. Previous research has found high health care resource use (HCRU) and costs among Medicare and commercially insured people with hemophilia B (PwHB), with FIX therapy being a primary driver of health care costs. To assess HCRU, outcomes, and costs among US Medicaid beneficiaries receiving FIX prophylaxis for hemophilia B. This study employed a retrospective comparative cohort design to assess HCRU, outcomes, and costs among adult male Medicaid beneficiaries receiving FIX prophylaxis for hemophilia B, relative to a matched comparator population of beneficiaries without bleeding disorders. Nationwide Medicaid claims and enrollment data from 2015 to 2020 were used for this analysis. Adult male PwHB who received FIX prophylaxis, defined as not having identified gaps in FIX therapy exceeding 60-days during a 1-year measurement period, and were continuously enrolled in Medicaid for at least 2 years, were matched 1:4 to comparator beneficiaries without bleeding disorders based on baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. Key measures of HCRU and outcomes included inpatient hospital admissions, outpatient hematologist visits, and bleeding events. Measures of health care costs were assessed among a subset of beneficiaries enrolled in fee-for-service Medicaid. PwHB receiving FIX prophylaxis were significantly more likely to have multiple inpatient hospital admissions and had a longer cumulative length of stay per person relative to comparator beneficiaries (30.2 vs 14.8 days, respectively; <i>P</i> = 0.0473). PwHB receiving FIX prophylaxis also had significantly higher rates of bleeding events relative to comparator beneficiaries (0.54 vs 0.02 per person, respectively; <i>P</i> < 0.0001) and outpatient hematologist visits (1.58 vs 0.20 per person, respectively; <i>P</i> < 0.0001). Annual costs among PwHB receiving FIX prophylaxis were significantly higher than costs among comparator beneficiaries ($928,370 vs $34,553 per person, respectively; <i>P</i> < 0.0001) and were overwhelmingly driven by costs associated with FIX therapy. This analysis found higher rates of HCRU and costs among Medicaid beneficiaries receiving FIX prophylaxis for hemophilia B relative to a matched comparator population of beneficiaries without bleeding disorders. Future research should examine hemophilia B costs and outcomes within the context of new treatments with innovative mechanisms of action, such as gene therapies, RNA interference therapies, and antitissue factor pathway inhibitor therapies."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia B (HB), characterised by deficient factor IX (FIX), leads to spontaneous bleeds. Severe cases require prophylactic FIX replacement. This post hoc analysis assessed the first spontaneous bleeds among previously untreated patients (PUPs) with HB treated with recombinant FIX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) (NCT02234310) to identify factors influencing bleeds. Subjects included paediatric PUPs with HB (≤2 IU/dL endogenous FIX). Analyses described treatment patterns (on demand [OD] vs. prophylaxis) and prophylaxis type (started on vs. switched to prophylaxis). Kaplan-Meier analyses assessed the time to first spontaneous bleed, including median time to event and fitting models with predictors for treatment regimen and/or baseline age. PUPs B-LONG enrolled 33 subjects. Baseline age did not influence the time to first spontaneous bleed for any rFIXFc regimen. Those who started on prophylaxis with rFIXFc (n = 11), compared with those treated OD (n = 22), had an extended time to first spontaneous bleed. Starting prophylaxis afforded a 93% reduced risk of first spontaneous bleed versus starting OD (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.071 [0.009-0.592]) (p = .015). rFIXFc prophylaxis, particularly starting early, reduced the risk of bleeding and delayed time to first spontaneous bleed compared with rFIXFc OD. Hence, initial treatment regimens impact bleed patterns in paediatric PUPs."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a rare X-linked congenital bleeding disorder due to a deficiency of factor VIII (hemophilia A [HA]) or factor IX (hemophilia B [HB]). Replacement and nonreplacement treatments are available but have limitations. Gene therapy (GT) provides an effective, long-term, single-dose treatment option, now approaching clinical practice. This study aimed to understand patient perspectives on GT for HA and HB in Italy using a qualitative questionnaire distributed through Italian patient associations, addressing patient views on daily life, treatments, unmet needs, quality of life (QoL), and GT for hemophilia. In total, 141 participants had HA, and 14 had HB (severe 78.6%). Daily life was most affected by pain and/or joint function limitations (57.5% of participants), high infusion frequency (42.5%), management of breakthrough bleeding episodes (40.3%), and anxiety/fear of severe or sudden bleeding (38.8%). Despite current treatments, about half of the participants experienced three or more annual bleeding episodes. Most participants knew of GT (87.2%) and expected improvements in QoL (60.5%), reduced frequency of current treatments (53.5%), and a permanent cure (49.1%); 46.4% were unaware of its once-off dosage and 46.4% were not concerned about the costs they anticipated to be associated with GT. Although several fears were reported, 25.0% of participants were willing to undergo GT with the support of a multidisciplinary team. This survey provided valuable insight into patient perspectives on hemophilia and GT in Italy. Overall, relevant proportions of patients still experience limitations affecting their daily life. Most were positive about GT and anticipated improvements in their clinical outcomes and QoL."

To assess the association between endogenous factor level and bleeding phenotype in children with nonsevere (factor [F]VIII/FIX activity 1%-25%) hemophilia A (HA) and B without prophylaxis. Data on annualized bleeding rate (ABR), annualized joint bleeding rate (AJBR), and onset of bleeding were extracted from the international PedNet cohort including children born since 2000. Mean ABR and AJBR were modeled and compared according to FVIII/FIX endogenous activity (1%-2%, 3%-5%, 6%-10%, 11%-15%, 16%-20%, and 21%-25%) using negative binomial regression. Onset of bleeding was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Eight hundred twenty-five children (40% with moderate hemophilia; 87% with HA) with median follow-up of 7.4 years/child were included. The median age at onset of bleeding and median bleeding rates changed with increasing endogenous activity. From endogenous FVIII 1% to 2% to 21% to 25%, the age at onset of bleeding changed from a median of 1.4 to 14.2 years, ABR from 1.6 to 0.1/y, and AJBR from 0.5 to 0.0/y. From endogenous FIX 1% to 2% to 16% to 25%, the onset of bleeding changed from a median of 1.7 to 6.1 years, ABR from 0.5 to 0.1/y, and AJBR from 0.1 to 0.0/y. The negative correlation between AJBR and factor level was most strongly pronounced up to a factor level of 6% in HA and hemophilia B. Endogenous factor activity of >5% was identified as a threshold to significantly lower joint bleeding rate, while FVIII levels >15% and FIX levels >10% were sufficient to achieve the goal of 0 bleeds in this pediatric cohort."

    "abstract": "Fidanacogene elaparvovec, an adeno-associated virus-based gene therapy vector expressing the high-activity factor IX (FIX) variant FIX-R338L, is in development for hemophilia B. One-stage clotting (OS) assays and chromogenic substrate (CS) assays are commonly used to measure FIX-R338L variant activity. Data from ongoing trials suggest FIX activity varies between different OS and CS assays. To better understand FIX-R338L activity in clinical samples, an international multisite field study was conducted across a central laboratory and 18 local laboratories, using standard protocols, reagents, and instrumentation, with individual participant samples from a phase 1/2a study of fidanacogene elaparvovec. Unlike the wild-type FIX control, FIX-R338L activity was higher with the OS silica-based assay versus OS ellagic acid-based and CS assays. Variation in FIX activity was greater at the lowest activity levels. Activated FIX (FIXa) in plasma could result in higher OS assay activity or increased thrombin generation, which could overestimate FIX activity. However, FIXa was not detected in the participant samples, indicating that it was not contributing to the OS assay differences. Since individuals on gene therapy may receive exogenous replacement FIX products, replacement products were spiked into patient plasma samples to target a therapeutic concentration. Exogenous FIX was additive to endogenous FIX-R338L, with no interference from FIX-R338L. These results demonstrate FIX-R338L activity can be measured with OS and CS assays in clinical laboratories and provide insight into assay variability when measuring FIX with endogenously produced FIX-R338L. The findings may help establish best practices for measuring FIX-R338L activity (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02484092)."

    "abstract": "Thrombin generation assays (TGAs) assess the overall functionality of the hemostatic system and thereby provide a reflection of the hemostatic capacity of patients with disorders in this system. Currently, four (semi-)automated TGA platforms are available: the Calibrated Automated Thrombogram, Nijmegen Hemostasis Assay, ST Genesia and Ceveron s100. In this study, we compared their performance for detecting patients with congenital single coagulation factor deficiencies. Pooled patient samples, healthy control samples and normal pooled plasma were tested on all four platforms, using the available reagents that vary in tissue factor and phospholipid concentrations. The TGA parameters selected for analysis were peak height and thrombin potential. Results were normalized by using the calculated mean of healthy controls and a correction for between-run variation. Outcomes were presented as relative values, with the mean of healthy controls standardized to 100 %. Across all platforms and reagents used, thrombin potentials and peak heights of samples with coagulation factor deficiencies were lower than those of healthy controls. Reagents designed for bleeding tendencies yielded the lowest values on all platforms (relative median peak height 19-32 %, relative median thrombin potential 19-45 %). Samples representing more severe coagulation factor deficiencies generally exhibited lower relative peak heights and thrombin potentials. Thrombin generation assays prove effective in differentiating single coagulation factor deficient samples from healthy controls, with modest discrepancies observed between the platforms. Reagents designed for assessing bleeding tendencies, featuring the lowest tissue factor and phospholipid concentrations, emerged as the most suitable option for detecting coagulation factor deficiencies."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B is the first bleeding disorder for which gene therapy clinical programs began. Presently, adenovirus-associated vectors represent the best means to deliver the transgene, and their administration by intravenous route has been used in recent clinical trials. The natural occurring factor IX (FIX) Padua variant, which allows for a 5- to 8-fold higher activity of FIX, while maintaining a normal protein concentration, was subsequently used to enhance the level of transgene expression. All the recent trials using this variant showed good results, and accumulating data suggest that long-term expression durability could be maintained at a significant hemostatic level. However, the risk of loss of transgene expression associated to immune response with liver enzymes elevation remains a concern, especially as to the efficacy and duration of immunosuppressive treatment. Notwithstanding this limitation, the results of clinical trials suggest that gene therapy in hemophilia B has the potential to provide long-term benefits with sustained factor activity levels predicted to last several years in many patients."

However, the underlying mechanism for the genotype-phenotype correlation of these variants has not been well studied. Here, we systematically examined the effects of 13 pathogenic point variants in the SP of FIX using different approaches. Our results showed that these point variants lead to HB by missense variants and/or aberrant premessenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing. The missense variants in a hydrophobic core (h-region) mainly affected the cotranslational translocation function of the SP, and those in C-terminal containing cleavage site (c-region) caused FIX deficiency mainly by disturbing the cotranslational translocation and/or cleavage of the SP. Almost absolute aberrant pre-mRNA splicing was only observed in variants of c.82T>G, but a slight change of splicing patterns was found in variants of c.53G>T, c.77C>A, c.82T>C, and c.83G>A, indicating that these variants might have different degrees of impact on pre-mRNA splicing. Although two 6-nt deletion aberrant pre-mRNA splicing products caused FIX deficiency by disturbing the SP cleavage, they could produce some functional mature FIX, and vitamin K could increase the secretion of functional FIX. Taken together, our data indicated that pathogenic variants in the SP of FIX caused HB through diverse molecular mechanisms or even a mixture of several mechanisms, and vitamin K availability could be partially attributed to varying bleeding tendencies in patients carrying the same variant in the SP."

This cross-sectional, multicenter study was conducted in seven provinces in the central and western regions of China from April 2019 to June 2023. Samples were collected for the factor IX activity, inhibitor screen, and gene mutation. Furthermore, the status of six index joints and quality of life (QoL) were assessed. A total of 185 HB patients (mild 15, moderate 75, and severe 95) with a median age of 12.17 years were enrolled. 30.3% (56/185) of patients had a family history of HB. 34.6% (64/185) of HB patients had diagnostic delay and 38.5% (69/179) experienced treatment delay. The incidence of inhibitors was 6.1% (11/179). We identified 123 genetic variants in this study, with missense mutations being the most common. 84.0% (89/106) of HB mothers were genetically identified as carriers, with 27.7% (13/47) of carriers having clotting factor levels less than 0.40 IU/ml. 71.4% (132/185) of HB patients had a history of joint hemorrhage, with a rate of target joint in these patients was 64.4% (85/132). Lower extremity joints were most often affected in patients. The Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) score was significantly positively correlated with the Hemophilia Early Arthropathy Detection with Ultrasound in China (HEAD-US-C) (<i>r</i> = 0.542, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Patients who received prevention treatment, inhibitor negative, without treatment delay, and without high-intensity replacement therapy showed a higher total score of the short form-36 health survey (SF-36). One-third of HB patients had delay in diagnosis and treatment, and the incidence of inhibitors was 6.1%. Target joints were present in nearly half of HB patients. Missense was the main mutation type. 84.0% of mothers of HB patients in this study were found to be carriers. HEAD-US-C and HJHS can complement each other in the evaluation of joint status and give a valid basis for early clinical management. Early detection and preventive treatment, as well as reducing high-intensity replacement therapy and inhibitor generation, can effectively improve the QoL of patients."

Patients with medically recorded bleeds (MRBs) were identified using diagnostic codes. Rates and rate ratios of inpatient admissions, emergency department (ED) visits, and outpatient visits among PWHB with and without MRBs were estimated. The presence of comorbidities was identified using diagnostic codes, and the analysis was stratified by age group. There were 345 PWHB with MRBs and 252 without MRBs. More than half of PWHB with MRBs (56.8%) had 1 or more comorbidity vs 39.3% of PWHB without MRBs. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was high in PWHB, regardless of bleed status and age group, whereas the prevalence of other comorbidities increased with age group. The rate of all-cause inpatient admissions for PWHB with MRBs was 14.8 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 12.8-17.1), 2.5 times higher than for PWHB without MRBs. The rate of all-cause ED visits for PWHB with MRBs was 67.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 63.2-72.3), 2.7 times higher than for those without MRBs. This study reports significant resource use and clinical burden among PWHB who seek medical care. PWHB with MRBs had considerable all-cause resource use compared with PWHB without MRBs. The prevalence of mental illness was consistently high across all age groups."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Hemophilia is a congenital disorder characterized by deficiency or absence of clotting factor VIII in hemophilia A (HA) or clotting factor IX in hemophilia B (HB), resulting in frequent, repeated, and prolonged spontaneous or traumatic bleeding into joints or soft tissue. Severity is classified by the patient's baseline level of clotting factor activity as mild (>5%-40%), moderate (1%-5%), or severe (<1%). In Spain, there is limited information on the societal economic burden of disease. <b>Objective:</b> To estimate the economic and humanistic burden of disease in adult patients with non-inhibitor moderate and severe HA and HB in Spain. <b>Methods:</b> Spanish data from the CHESS II study (2018-2020) on patients' clinical characteristics, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and hemophilia-related healthcare resource utilization were analyzed. Economic burden was determined by estimating condition-related annual per-patient direct (medical and nonmedical) and indirect costs, stratified according to hemophilia type and severity and presented as 2022 Euros. HRQoL was assessed via the EQ-5D-5L. <b>Results:</b> Of 341 patients in the Spanish CHESS II cohort, 288 patients met the inclusion criteria: 181 had HA (37% [n = 66] moderate and 63% [n=115] severe) and 107 had HB (26% [n = 28] moderate and 74% [n = 79] severe). Mean annual direct cost was higher in HB than in HA, and higher in severe than in moderate patients, resulting in an annual cost/patient of €17 251 (moderate HA), €17 796 (moderate HB), €116 767 (severe HA) and €206 996 (severe HB). The main direct cost component in all groups except moderate HA was factor replacement therapy. Mean per-patient indirect cost was €4089 (moderate HA), €797 (moderate HB), €8633 (severe HA) and €8049 (severe HB). Finally, the mean total cost (direct and indirect) for moderate and severe patients were €91 017 (HA) and €163 924 (HB). EQ-5D-5L [SD] scores were lower in patients with severe HA (0.77 [0.18]) and severe HB (0.70 [0.22]) compared with patients with moderate HA (0.81 [0.15]) and moderate HB (0.86 [0.17]). <b>Conclusions:</b> Independently of the type of hemophilia, greater condition severity was associated with increased costs and a decrease in HRQoL."

We have developed an Adeno-associated virus (AAV) based strategy to integrate the bypass coagulation factor, activated FVII (murine, mFVIIa) gene into the Rosa26 locus using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 mediated gene-editing. AAV vectors designed for expression of guide RNA (AAV8-gRNA), Cas9 (AAV2 neddylation mutant-Cas9), and mFVIIa (AAV8-mFVIIa) flanked by homology arms of the target locus were validated in vitro. Hemophilia B mice were administered with AAV carrying gRNA, Cas9 (1 × 10<sup>11</sup> vgs/mouse), and mFVIIa with homology arms (2 × 10<sup>11</sup> vgs/mouse) with appropriate controls. Functional rescue was documented with suitable coagulation assays at various time points. The data from the T7 endonuclease assay revealed a cleavage efficiency of 20-42 %. Further, DNA sequencing confirmed the targeted integration of mFVIIa into the safe-harbor Rosa26 locus. The prothrombin time (PT) assay revealed a significant reduction in PT in mice that received the gene-editing vectors (22 %), and a 13 % decline in mice that received only the AAV-FVIIa when compared to mock treated mice, 8 weeks after vector administration. Furthermore, FVIIa activity in mice that received triple gene-editing vectors was higher (122.5mIU/mL vs 28.8mIU/mL) than the mock group up to 15 weeks post vector administration. A hemostatic challenge by tail clip assay revealed that hemophilia B mice injected with only FVIIa or the gene-editing vectors had significant reduction in blood loss. In conclusion, AAV based gene-editing facilitates sustained expression of coagulation FVIIa and phenotypic rescue in hemophilia B mice."

In hemophilic mice injected with KP1-packaged recombinant AAV (rAAV) expressing the hyperactive FIX variant specific activity plasma levels were 10-fold or 2-fold enhanced when compared with wild-type or Padua huFIX injected mice, respectively. In rhesus macaques AAV-LK03 capsid outperformed AAV-KP1 in terms of antigen expression and liver transduction. Two animals from each group showed sustained low-level huFIX expression at 3 months after administration, while one animal from each group lost huFIX mRNA and protein expression over time, despite comparable vector copies. We investigated whether epigenetic differences in the vector episomes could explain this loss of transcription. Cut&Tag analysis revealed lower levels of activating histone marks in the two animals that lost expression. When comparing rAAV genome associated histone modifications in rhesus macaques with those in mice injected with the same vector, the activating histone marks were starkly decreased in macaque-derived episomes. Differential epigenetic marking of AAV genomes may explain different expression profiles in mice and rhesus macaques, as well as the wide dose response variation observed in primates in both preclinical and human clinical trials."

To estimate long-term clinical impact and cost of EDZ in the United States (US). A decision-analytic model was developed to evaluate the long-term impact of introducing EDZ for PwHB over a 20-year time horizon. Factor IX (FIX) prophylaxis comparator was a weighted average of different FIX prophylaxis regimens based on US market share data. We compared a scenario in which EDZ is introduced in the US versus a scenario without EDZ. Clinical inputs (annualized FIX-treated bleed rate; adverse event rates) were obtained from HOPE-B phase 3 trial. EDZ durability input was sourced from an analysis predicting long-term FIX activity with EDZ. EDZ one-time price was assumed at $3.5 million. Other medical costs, including FIX prophylaxis, disease monitoring, bleed management, and adverse events were from literature. The model estimated annual and cumulative costs, treated bleeds, and joint procedures over 20 years from EDZ introduction. Approximately 596 PwHB were eligible for EDZ. EDZ uptake was estimated to avert 11,282 bleeds and 64 joint procedures over 20 years. Although adopting EDZ resulted in an annual excess cost over years 1-5 (mean: $53 million annually, total $265 million), annual cost savings were achieved beginning in year 6 (mean: $172 million annually; total $2.58 billion in years 6-20). The total cumulative 20-year cost savings was $2.32 billion, with cumulative cost savings beginning in year 8. Introducing EDZ to treat PwHB is expected to result in cost savings and patient benefit over 20 years. Initiating PwHB on EDZ sooner can produce greater and earlier savings and additional bleeds avoided. These results may be a conservative estimate of the full value of EDZ, as PwHB would continue to accrue savings beyond 20 years."

The objectives of this study were to describe the bleeding phenotype in HAC and HBC using the standardized Tosetto bleeding score (BS); to determine whether the BS correlates better with factor levels measured with a chromogenic assay than with factor levels measured with chronometric and thrombin generation assays; and to compare the results in HAC and HBC. This ambispective, noninterventional study included obligate and sporadic HAC and HBC followed at a hemophilia treatment center between 1995 and 2019. The median BS (3, range 0-21 vs. 3.5, range 0-15, P = ns, respectively) and the abnormal BS rate (35.6% vs. 38.2%, P = ns) were not significantly different in 104 HAC and 34 HBC (mean age: 38 years, 6-80 years). However, some differences were identified. The risk of factor deficiency was higher in HBC than HAC. Specifically, Factor VIII activity (FVIII):C/Factor IX activity (FIX):C level was low (<40 IU/dl) in 18.3% (chronometric assay) and 17.5% (chromogenic assay) of HAC and in 47% and 72.2% of HBC ( P < 0.001). Moreover, the FIX:C level thresholds of 39.5 IU/dl (chronometric assay) and of 33.5 IU/dl (chromogenic assay) were associated with very good sensitivity (92% and 100%, respectively) and specificity (80% for both) for bleeding risk prediction in HBC. Conversely, no FVIII:C level threshold could be identified for HAC, probably due to FVIII:C level variations throughout life."

We highlight the limitations of maintaining factor levels with factor replacement therapy alone, particularly in hemophilia patients who have developed factor inhibitors. In addition, we draw attention to the need for dose escalation, the cost, and the need for immune-tolerance induction therapy.

PK-guided dosing was reliable according to post hoc analyses, based on low absolute errors that were regarded as clinically irrelevant in most cases. The predefined predictive performance was achieved in mid and peak factor levels but not in trough factor levels due to measurement inaccuracy. PK guidance also seemed feasible."

    "abstract": "Recombinant factor IX (rFIX) and recombinant FIX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) are standard half-life and extended half-life FIX replacement therapies, respectively, and represent established treatment options indicated for adults and children with haemophilia B. These FIX replacement therapies can be administered as prophylaxis (to prevent bleeding) or 'on-demand' (to stop bleeding). This analysis aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of once-weekly prophylaxis with rFIXFc versus on-demand treatment with rFIX in patients with haemophilia B without inhibitors in the Italian healthcare setting. A Markov model was developed to assess a hypothetical cohort of adolescent or adult male patients (≥ 12 years) with haemophilia B (FIX level of ≤ 2 IU/dL) without inhibitors. Model inputs were derived from the pivotal phase 3 clinical studies for rFIXFc and rFIX, published literature and assumptions when published data were unavailable. The model employed a lifelong time horizon with 6-monthly transitions between health states, and it estimated total costs, total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), number of bleeds, number of surgeries and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. rFIXFc prophylaxis was associated with lower total costs per patient (€5,308,625 versus €6,564,510) and greater total QALYs per patient (15.936 versus 11.943) compared with rFIX on-demand; rFIXFc prophylaxis was therefore the dominant treatment strategy. The model also demonstrated that rFIXFc prophylaxis was associated with fewer incremental bleeds (- 682.29) and surgeries (- 0.39) compared with rFIX on-demand. rFIXFc prophylaxis provides improved health outcomes and lower costs, and represents a cost-effective treatment option compared with rFIX on-demand for adolescent and adult male patients with haemophilia B. This comparative assessment of cost-effectiveness should help to inform both clinicians and healthcare policy makers when making treatment decisions for patients with haemophilia B."

To compare free TFPI (fTFPI) levels in patients with severe haemophilia A (sHA) and severe haemophilia B (sHB) and to investigate in these patients as a whole the relationships between bleeding and TG potential, between TG potential and fTFPI level and between fTFPI level and bleeding tendency. Data on bleeding episodes retrospectively recorded during follow-up visits over 5-10 years were collected and used to calculate the annualised joint bleeding rate (AJBR). fTFPI levels and basal TG parameters were determined in platelet-poor plasma (PPP) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) using calibrated automated tomography (CAT). Mean fTFPI levels did not differ significantly between sHA (n = 34) and sHB (n = 19) patients. Mean values of endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and thrombin peak (peak) in PPP and PRP were two-fold higher when fTFPI levels < 9.4 versus > 14.3 ng/mL. In patients treated on demand, ETP and peak in PRP were doubled when AJBR was <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <semantics><mrow><mo>≤</mo> <mn>4.9</mn></mrow> <annotation>$ \\le 4.9$</annotation></semantics> </math> , AJBR being halved in patients with a low fTFPI level (9.4 ng/mL). In patients on factor prophylaxis, no association was found between TG parameters and either fTFPI level or AJBR. In patients treated on demand, bleeding tendency was influenced by fTFPI levels, which in turn affected basal TG potential. In patients on prophylaxis, bleeding tendency is probably determined primarily by the intensity of this treatment."

    "abstract": "To establish a haplotype-based noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) workflow for single-gene recessive disorders that adapt to dizygotic (DZ) twin pregnancies. Twin pregnancies at risk of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, hemophilia B, spinal muscular atrophy, phenylketonuria, and nonsyndromic hearing loss were recruited. For subsequent analysis, capture sequencing targeting highly heterozygotic single nucleotide polymorphism sites was conducted. Paternal-specific alleles were used to calculate the total and individual fetal fractions and determine zygosity. A two-step Bayes Factor model was applied to clarify the complex genomic landscape in the maternal plasma: the first step involved determining whether the twins inherited the same haplotype, and the second step involved estimating their individual genotypes. NIPT results were subsequently confirmed by invasive diagnosis. Nine twin pregnancies were recruited, including five DZ and four monozygotic (MZ) twins. The earliest gestational age was 8<sup>+0</sup> weeks, and the minimum fetal fraction was 4.6%. Three twin pregnancies were reported with one affected fetus, while the remaining six were reported without affected fetuses. Two dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies were confirmed to be MZ twins. The NIPT results were 100% consistent with those of invasive procedures or diagnostic genetic testing after birth. This study is the first to perform NIPT for single-gene disorders in twin pregnancies and preliminarily confirm its clinical feasibility. Acknowledging the twins' genotypes in the first trimester is valuable as it empowers obstetric care providers and parents to have adequate time for pregnancy management and decision-making."

    "abstract": "Of newly diagnosed cases of haemophilia B, the proportion of sporadic cases is usually 50% of severe cases and 25% of moderate/mild cases. However, cases presumed to be sporadic due to family history may not always be sporadic. Few case reports have been published on mosaicism in haemophilia B. The present study aimed to trace the origin of the pathogenic variant in a well-defined cohort of sporadic cases of haemophilia B by haplotyping markers. It also aimed to determine the frequency of mosaicism in presumed non-carrier mothers. The study group was 40 families, each with a sporadic case of haemophilia B analysed in two-to-three generations by Sanger sequencing, haplotyping and using the sensitive droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) technique. In 31/40 (78%) of the families, the mother carried the same pathogenic variant as her son, while Sanger sequencing showed that 9/40 (22%) of the mothers did not carry this variant. Of these variants, 2/9 (22%) were shown to be mosaics by using the ddPCR technique. 16/21 carrier mothers, with samples from three generations available, had a de novo pathogenic variant of which 14 derived from the healthy maternal grandfather. The origin of the pathogenic variant in sporadic cases of haemophilia B is most often found in the X-chromosome derived from the maternal grandfather or, less often, from the maternal grandmother. Mosaic females seem to be found at the same frequency as in haemophilia A but at a lower percentage of the pathogenic variant."

Participants with FVIII inhibitors, mild HA, or HB were excluded from this analysis, plus those aged 18 to 19 years. Annualized bleeding rates (ABRs), target joints, and other patient-reported outcomes were evaluated. <b>Results</b> Overall, 468 and 691 PwHA with available data for the outcomes of interest were stratified by hemophilia severity and treatment regimen in CHESS II and CHESS PAEDs, respectively. In these studies, 173 (37.0%) and 468 (67.7%) participants received FVIII prophylaxis, respectively; no participants received the FVIII mimetic emicizumab or gene therapy. ABRs of 2.38 to 4.88 were reported across disease severity and treatment subgroups in both studies. Target joints were present in 35.7 and 16.6% of participants in CHESS II and CHESS PAEDS; 43.8 and 23.0% had problem joints. Chronic pain was reported by a large proportion of PwHA (73.9% in CHESS II; 58.8% in CHESS PAEDs). Participants also reported low EQ-5D scores (compared with people without HA), anxiety, depression, and negative impacts on their lifestyles due to HA. <b>Conclusions</b> These analyses suggest significant physical, social, and mental burdens of HA, irrespective of disease severity. Optimization of prophylactic treatment could help reduce the burden of HA on patients."

    "abstract": "Etranacogene dezaparvovec is a recently approved gene therapy for people with hemophilia B (PwHB). Current standard of care is prophylaxis with factor IX (FIX) to prevent bleeding. Etranacogene dezaparvovec increases blood FIX levels such that FIX prophylaxis could be eliminated. To estimate the budgetary impact of etranacogene dezaparvovec adoption and utilization in a commercial health plan of the United States. A budget impact model was developed to evaluate the introduction of etranacogene dezaparvovec to treat severe or moderately severe hemophilia B. The model considered a hypothetical 1-million-member plan over a 5-year horizon. FIX therapy prophylaxis use was estimated based on a weighted average of relevant brands using US market share data. A scenario of etranacogene dezaparvovec adoption/utilization was compared with one without etranacogene dezaparvovec utilization. Two etranacogene dezaparvovec uptake (market share growth) analyses were performed: one with gradual uptake and alternatively assuming all eligible PwHB received etranacogene dezaparvovec in year 1. The one-time cost of etranacogene dezaparvovec was assumed to be $3.5 million. Other costs (FIX prophylaxis, disease monitoring, bleed management, and adverse events) were estimated from published literature. All costs were in 2022 US dollars. Bleed and adverse event rates were sourced from the HOPE-B trial comparing etranacogene dezaparvovec to previous FIX therapy prophylaxis. The model estimated annual and per-member per-month costs over 5 years. Secondary analyses were performed considering a 10-year horizon. In the 1-million-member health plan, an estimated 1.8 PwHB were eligible for treatment with etranacogene dezaparvovec. Gradual uptake of etranacogene dezaparvovec resulted in cumulative 5-year budget impact of $848,509 compared with a scenario without etranacogene dezaparvovec. In years 1-5, the incremental annual and per-member per-month costs ranged from $79,824 to $271,435 and from $0.007 to $0.023, respectively. In the alternative uptake analysis, etranacogene dezaparvovec became cost saving annually beginning in year 2 and cumulatively beginning in year 5, for a 5-year savings of $754,844. Secondary analyses over 10 years found both uptake analyses cost saving. Other scenarios considered did not affect results substantially. Introducing etranacogene dezaparvovec as treatment for PwHB would have a modest budget increase within 5 years after treatment but may become cost saving if all eligible PwHB were treated in year 1. Initiating PwHB on etranacogene dezaparvovec sooner may produce greater overall savings and earlier annual savings. Etranacogene dezaparvovec is a treatment option that may provide overall cost savings for US commercial health plans, which would increase as the plan size increases."

The study's aim was to clarify the roles of kinesiophobia and self-efficacy in the relationship between pain catastrophizing and PA in PWH. This cross-sectional study included adult PWH at the Haemophilia Centre of a Tertiary hospital in Beijing, China. The following questionnaires were used to collect data: the general information, the International Physical Activity Short Questionnaire, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia Scale, and the Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale. The study included a total of 187 PWH, including 154 having haemophilia A and 33 having haemophilia B. The median interquartile range of PA was 594 (198, 1554) MET-min/wk. There were significant differences in PA of patients based on age stage, treatment modality, highest pain score within the last seven days, and presence of haemophilic arthropathy (p < .05). It was showed that pain catastrophizing could directly predict PA (p < .001), accounting for 38.13% of the total effect. Pain catastrophizing also had indirect effects on PA through the mediating factors of kinesiophobia or self-efficacy, and through the chain-mediating effect of kinesiophobia and self-efficacy, accounting for 38.40%, 17.07%, and 6.40%, respectively. The study discovered that PWH have limited PA due to pain catastrophizing. This not only directly affects their activity but also indirectly influences it through kinesiophobia and self-efficacy."

    "abstract": "Brazil is one of the countries with the largest population of people with hemophilia (PwH) worldwide. In this scoping review, we aim to investigate the Brazilian context for hemophilia regarding three predefined concepts: (i) clinical-epidemiological profile, (ii) burden of disease and (iii) patient journey and unmet needs. Three questions in each concept guided the screening of references retrieved by systematic searches carried out in MEDLINE, LILACS and the Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations. Quantitative and qualitative studies conducted in Brazil from 2002 onwards were assessed for eligibility. Ninety-two studies were included. A total of 66 studies addressed the concept \"Clinical-epidemiological profile\", 31 investigated the concept of \"Burden of disease\" and 26 addressed the concept \"Patient journey and unmet needs\". Based on these studies, pain and arthropathy affect a substantial proportion of the PwH, with physical functioning, pain and school or work being the domains of quality of life with the greatest impact. About 43 % to 82.6 % of the PwH are unemployed. Rates of inhibitor development are highly variable across studies, especially in hemophilia A. Adherence to prophylactic treatment ranges from 25 % to 72 %. The annualized bleeding rate is estimated at 2.4 ± 4.1. The barriers to treatment identified include distance to reference centers, lack of coordination of specialized and emergency care and restricted access to rehabilitation. Hemophilia poses a considerable burden on the PwH. Despite the available modalities of treatment, there are remaining unmet needs that should be addressed by researchers and policy makers in the future."

Prophylaxis with factor replacement has high efficacy in reducing bleeding but is limited by the need for frequent intravenous infusion and fluctuations in haemostasis between doses. Additional prophylaxis therapies are being developed which may overcome some of the current treatment barriers. Gene therapy (GT) is being developed to provide a functional cure such that there is sustained factor expression and minimal to no need for additional haemostatic therapy. There are now two approved gene therapies for haemophilia which may be transformative for many individuals. Benefits of GT should go beyond increasing factor activity and reducing bleeding as persons with haemophilia aim to achieve a 'haemophilia-free mind' and health equity with optimal health and well-being."

Immune suppression has only been partly effective in clinical trials at ameliorating the immune response and the lack of good animal models has delayed progress in identifying mechanisms and developing more effective approaches to controlling these effects of AAV gene transfer.

This review summarizes the nonclinical studies and clinical development that supported regulatory clearance. Similar to other gene therapies for single gene disorders, both the short-term safety and the phenotypic improvement were unequivocal, justifying the modest-sized safety and efficacy database, which included 57 participants across the phase 2b (3 participants) and phase 3 (54 participants) studies. The most common adverse reactions included liver enzyme elevation, headache, flu-like symptoms, infusion-related reactions, creatine kinase elevation, malaise, and fatigue; these were mostly transient. One participant had hepatocellular carcinoma on a study-mandated liver ultrasound conducted 1 year after vector infusion; molecular analysis of the resected tumor showed no evidence of vector-related insertional mutagenesis as the etiology. A remarkable 96% of participants in the phase 3 trial were able to stop factor IX (FIX) prophylaxis, with the study demonstrating noninferiority to FIX prophylaxis in terms of the primary end point, annualized bleeding rate. Key secondary end points such as the annualized infusion rate, which declined by 97%, and the plasma FIX activity level at 18 months after infusion, with least squares mean increase of 34.3 percentage points compared with baseline, were both clinically and statistically significant. The FDA's landmark approval of Hemgenix as a pioneering treatment for hemophilia stands on the shoulders of >20 years of gene therapy clinical research and heralds a promising future for genomic medicines."

Based on a pharmacokinetic assessment and clinical needs, the first regimen was 47 ± 7 IU/Kg every 9 ± 2 days. All but one patient remained on rIX-FP prophylaxis, adjusting infusion frequency and/or dose; the last prescribed frequency was ≥10 days in 10/13 patients, being reduced in seven and increased in four vs. the first regimen. The weekly FIX dose was unchanged; FIX trough levels were >5% in all patients. The annual infusion number and FIX IU/Kg significantly decreased (~60%) in eight patients previously on SHL FIX prophylaxis, with similar concentrate costs. Very low bleeding rates (most traumatic bleeds and the last quartile of the infusion interval), improved orthopedic and pain scores, unchanged HEAD-US scores and problem joints, and high treatment adherence (>90%) and satisfaction were registered. <b>Conclusions</b>: Personalized, carefully adjusted rIX-FP regimens contribute to the diffusion and optimization of prophylaxis in persons with severe and moderate hemophilia B, with long-term favorable bleeding, joint, and patient-reported outcomes."

The purpose of this study was to provide genetic information on mothers of hemophilia patients and to understand the clotting factor activity and phenotype of HCs. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the mental health status of HCs in China. A total of 127 hemophilia mothers, including 93 hemophilia A (HA) mothers and 34 hemophilia B (HB) mothers, were enrolled in this study. Long distance PCR, multiplex PCR, and Sanger sequencing were used to analyze mutations in F8 or F9. Coagulation factor activity was detected by a one-stage clotting assay. The Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90, China/Mandarin version) was given to HCs at the same time to assess their mental health. A total of 90.6% of hemophilia mothers were diagnosed genetically as carriers, with inversion in intron 22 and missense mutations being the most common mutation types in HA and HB carriers, respectively. The median clotting factor level in carriers was 0.74 IU/mL (ranging from 0.09 to 1.74 IU/mL) compared with 1.49 IU/mL (ranging from 0.93 to 1.89 IU/mL) in noncarriers, of which 14.3% of HCs had clotting factor levels of 0.40 IU/mL or below. A total of 53.8% (7/13) of HA carriers with low clotting factor levels (less than 0.50 IU/mL) had a history of bleeding, while none of the HB carriers displayed a bleeding phenotype. The total mean score and the global severity index of the SCL-90 for surveyed HCs were 171.00 (±60.37) and 1.78 (±0.59), respectively. A total of 67.7% of the respondents had psychological symptoms, with obsessive-compulsive disorder being the most prevalent and severe. The pooled estimates of all nine factors were significantly higher than those in the general population (P<0.05). The detection rate of gene mutations in hemophilia mothers was 90.6%, with a median clotting factor level of 0.74 IU/mL, and 14.3% of HCs had a clotting factor level of 0.40 IU/mL or below. A history of bleeding was present in 41.2% of HCs with low clotting factor levels (less than 0.50 IU/mL). Additionally, given the fragile mental health status of HCs in China, it is critical to develop efficient strategies to improve psychological well-being."

Factor prophylaxis has been shown to decrease the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), which supports recommendations to begin at a young age. Clinical and demographic characteristics were analyzed for 883 ITs ≤2 years old with hemophilia A and B, seen at US Hemophilia Treatment Centers and enrolled in the Community Counts Registry, a surveillance program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ICH in the first 2 years of life was seen in 68 of 883 (7.7%) ITs, of whom 8 of 68 (11.8%) were on continuous prophylaxis at the time of ICH. ITs in this study usually started prophylaxis within the first year of life (mean, 10.3 months), with earlier ages of prophylaxis initiation in later birth cohorts in ITs with hemophilia A. Compared with those without a family history (FH) of hemophilia, known positive FH of hemophilia was associated with earlier age of diagnosis (P ≤ .0001) and decreased rates of vaginal delivery (P = .0006). The use of factor VIII mimetics and extended half-life clotting factor prophylaxis increased with later birth cohorts for ITs with hemophilia A and B. The study highlights that ICH rates in ITs with hemophilia remains substantial and underscores the need for further research to identify modifiable risk factors to prevent ICH by earlier diagnosis and initiating prophylaxis early, even within the first month of life."

Spontaneous bleeds are common in severe forms of haemophilia and can also occur in moderate and mild haemophilia. Severe or repeated bleeding at a joint can evolve into chronic haemophilic arthropathy, with functional damage of the joint, disability, and intense chronic articular pain. Nonetheless, acute and chronic pain may emerge due to secondary conditions related to bleedings. This narrative review aims to critically discuss the most recent evidence about pain in haemophilia to give healthcare professionals a clear picture of current knowledge hence favouring the optimisation of clinical management of pain. Extensive literature search with the terms 'hemophilia' AND 'pain', focusing on the time window 2021-2023. Acute and chronic pain is a critical aspect of haemophilia at all ages. It should be considered a multifaceted phenomenon, with a positive role as an early emergency signal of a clinical event (haemarthrosis), and numerous detrimental aspects linked to its burden that heavily affects the health-related quality of life, with psychological and social consequences. Despite its prevalence and frequency in people with haemophilia, pain is often underestimated by healthcare professionals, leading to insufficient and inadequate treatment, also due to uncertainty linked to the presence of the coagulation disorder or arthritic flares."

    "abstract": "The advent of therapeutic recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX) protein infusions revolutionized the care of persons with haemophilia in the 1990s. It kicked off an era with the increasing use of prophylactic factor infusions for patients and transformed conversations around the ideal trough activity levels as well as the ultimate goals in tailored, individualized care. Our knowledge surrounding the immunologic basis of inhibitor development and treatment derives from a time when patients were receiving frequent factor infusions and focused on immune tolerance induction following inhibitor development. More recently, care was revolutionized again in haemophilia A with the approval of emicizumab, a bispecific antibody mimicking activated FVIII function, to prevent bleeding. The use of emicizumab prophylaxis has resulted in a significantly slower accumulation of factor exposure days and continued effective prophylaxis in the case of inhibitor development. While emicizumab is effective at reducing the frequency of bleeding events in patients with haemophilia A, management of breakthrough bleeds, trauma, and surgeries still requires additional treatment. Ensuring that FVIII is a therapeutic option, particularly for life-threatening bleeding events and major surgeries is critical to optimizing the care of persons with haemophilia A. Other novel non-factor concentrate therapies, including rebalancing agents, will dramatically change the landscape for persons with haemophilia B with inhibitors. This review discusses the changing landscape regarding the timing of inhibitor development and management strategies after inhibitor development, stressing the importance of education across the community to continue to vigilantly monitor for inhibitors and be prepared to treat persons with inhibitors."

    "title": "In vivo LNP-CRISPR Approaches for the Treatment of Hemophilia.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that is caused by mutations in coagulation factor VIII (hemophilia A) or IX (hemophilia B) genes resulting in blood clotting disorders. Despite advances in therapies, such as recombinant proteins and products with extended half-lives, the treatment of hemophilia still faces two major limitations: the short duration of therapeutic effect and production of neutralizing antibodies against clotting factors (inhibitor). To overcome these limitations, new hemophilia treatment strategies have been established such as gene therapy, bispecific antibody, and rebalancing therapy. Although these strategies have shown promising results, it is difficult to achieve a permanent therapeutic effect. Advances in the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology have allowed sustainable treatment by correcting mutated genes. Since genome editing generates irreversible changes in host genome, safety must be ensured by delivering target organs. Therefore, the delivery tool of the CRISPR system is crucial for safe, accurate, and efficient genome editing. Recently, non-viral vector lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as safer tools for delivering CRISPR systems than other viral vectors. Several previous hemophilia pre-clinical studies using LNP-CRISPR showed that sufficient and sustainable therapeutic effects, which means that LNP-CRISPR-mediated genome-editing therapy can be a valid option for the treatment of hemophilia. In this paper, we summarize the latest advancements in the successful treatment of hemophilia and the potential of CRISPR-mediated genome-editing therapy using LNPs."

    "title": "Safety and Efficacy of Recombinant Fusion Protein Linking Coagulation Factor IX with Albumin (rIX-FP) in Previously Untreated Patients with Hemophilia B.",
    "abstract": "<b>Introduction</b> Recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX (FIX) with albumin (rIX-FP) has been shown to be an effective, well-tolerated treatment for patients with severe hemophilia B who had previously received factor replacement therapy. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of rIX-FP in previously untreated patients (PUPs). <b>Methods</b> Patients with moderately severe/severe hemophilia B (≤2% FIX) previously untreated with FIX replacement products received rIX-FP (25-75 IU/kg) prophylaxis weekly or on-demand treatment over ≥50 exposure days (EDs). Primary outcomes were the number of patients who developed FIX inhibitors and mean incremental recovery (IR) following a 50 IU/kg dose of rIX-FP. Secondary outcomes included incidence of adverse events (AEs) and annualized bleeding rates (ABRs). <b>Results</b> In total, 12 PUPs with a median age of 0 years (range, 0-11 years) were treated with rIX-FP for a median of 50 EDs (6/12 prophylaxis; 6/12 on-demand then prophylaxis). Overall, 11/12 patients did not develop FIX inhibitors; one 11-year-old patient developed an inhibitor against FIX after 8 EDs and was ultimately withdrawn. Mean (standard deviation) IR was 1.2 (0.4, <i>n</i> = 8) (IU/dL)/(IU/kg). Of the 137 treatment-emergent AEs recorded, five were attributed to rIX-FP. On the prophylaxis regimen, median ABR was 1.0 (range, 0-3.9, <i>n</i> = 12). No thromboembolic events or deaths occurred during the study. <b>Conclusion</b> This study provides data to support the safety and efficacy of rIX-FP in PUPs requiring on-demand or prophylactic treatment for moderately severe/severe hemophilia B, consistent with results in previously treated patients. Overall, 1/12 patients developed an inhibitor against FIX."

    "title": "Current and emerging gene therapies for haemophilia A and B.",
    "abstract": "After decades of stumbling clinical development, the first gene therapies for haemophilia A and B have been commercialized and have normalized factor (F)VIII and factor (F)IX levels in some individuals in the long term. Several other clinical programs testing adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector gene therapy are at various stages of clinical testing. Multiyear follow-up in phase 1/2 and 3 studies showed long-term and sometimes curative but widely variable and unpredictable efficacy. Liver toxicities, mostly low-grade, occur in the 1st year in at least some individuals in all haemophilia A and B trials and are poorly understood. Wide variability and unpredictability of outcome and slow decline of FVIII levels are a major disadvantage because immune responses to AAV vectors preclude repeat dosing, which otherwise could improve suboptimal or restore declining expression, while overexpression may predispose to thrombosis. Long-term safety outcomes will need lifelong monitoring because AAV vectors infused at high doses integrate into chromosomes at rates that raise questions about potential oncogenicity and necessitate vigilance. Alternative gene transfer systems employing gene editing and/or non-viral vectors are under development and promise to overcome some limitations of the current state of the art for both haemophilia A and B. AAV gene therapies for haemophilia have now become new treatment options but not universal cures. AAV is a powerful but imperfect gene transfer platform. Biobetter FVIII transgenes may help solve some problems plaguing gene therapy for haemophilia A. Addressing variability and unpredictability of efficacy, and delivery of gene therapy to ineligible patient subgroups may require different gene transfer systems, most of which are not ready for clinical translation yet but bring innovations needed to overcome the current limitations of gene therapy."

    "abstract": "The healthcare systems in Asia vary greatly due to the socio-economic and cultural diversities which impact haemophilia management. An advisory board meeting was conducted with experts in haemophilia care from Asia to understand the heterogeneity in clinical practices and care provision in the region. The overall prevalence of haemophilia in Asia ranges between 3 and 8.58/100,000 patients. Haemophilia A was more prevalent as compared to haemophilia B with a ratio of around 5:1. There is under-diagnosis in the region due to lack of diagnosis, registries and/or lack of appropriate facilities in suburban areas. Most patients are referred to the haematologists by their families or primary care physicians, while some are identified during bleeding episodes. Genetic testing faces obstacles like resource constraints, services available at limited centres and unwillingness of patients to participate. Prophylaxis is offered for people with haemophilia (PWH) with a severe bleeding phenotype. Recombinant factors are approved in most countries across the region and are the preferred therapy. The challenges highlighted for not receiving a high standard of care include patients' reluctance to use an intravenous treatment, poor patient compliance due to frequency of infusions, budget constraints and lack of funding, insurance, availability and accessibility of factor concentrates. Prevalence of neutralizing antibodies ranged from 5% to 20% in the region. Use of immune tolerance induction and bypassing agents to treat inhibitors depends on their cost and availability. Haemophilia care in Asia has evolved to a great extent. However, some challenges remain for which a strategic approach along with multi-stakeholder involvement are needed."

    "title": "Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Etranacogene Dezaparvovec Versus Extended Half-Life Prophylaxis for Moderate-to-Severe Haemophilia B in Germany.",
    "abstract": "Haemophilia B is a rare genetic disease that is caused by a deficiency of coagulation factor IX (FIX) in the blood and leads to internal and external bleeding. Under the current standard of care, haemophilia is treated either prophylactically or on-demand via intravenous infusions of FIX. These treatment strategies impose a high burden on patients and health care systems as haemophilia B requires lifelong treatment, and FIX is costly. Etranacogene dezaparvovec (ED) is a gene therapy for haemophilia B that has been recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and has received a recommendation for conditional marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency. We aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of ED versus extended half-life FIX (EHL-FIX) prophylaxis for moderate-to-severe haemophilia B from a German health care payer perspective. A microsimulation model was implemented in R. The model used data from the ED phase 3 clinical trial publication and further secondary data sources to simulate and compare patients receiving ED or EHL-FIX prophylaxis over a lifetime horizon, with the potential for ED patients to switch treatment to EHL-FIX prophylaxis when the effectiveness of ED waned. Primary outcomes of this analysis included discounted total costs, discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness, and the incremental net monetary benefit. The annual discount rate for costs and effects was 3%. Uncertainty was examined via probabilistic analysis and additional univariate sensitivity analyses. Probabilistic analysis indicated that patients treated with ED instead of EHL-FIX prophylaxis gained 0.50 QALYs and experienced cost savings of EUR 1,179,829 at a price of EUR 1,500,000 per ED treatment. ED was the dominant treatment strategy. At a willingness to pay of EUR 50,000/QALY, the incremental net monetary benefit amounted to EUR 1,204,840. Depending on the price, ED can save costs and improve health outcomes of haemophilia patients compared with EHL-FIX prophylaxis, making it a potentially cost-effective alternative. These results are uncertain due to a lack of evidence regarding the long-term effectiveness of ED."

To assess safety, neurodevelopmental, and efficacy outcomes of children with HB receiving N9-GP prophylaxis across 2 open-label, single-arm, phase 3 studies: paradigm5 (previously treated patients [PTPs]) and paradigm6 (previously untreated patients [PUPs]) in this interim analysis. PTPs (aged ≤12 years) and PUPs (aged <6 years) with severe/moderate (≤2% FIX level) HB were recruited to N9-GP prophylaxis (40 IU/kg once weekly) in paradigm5 and paradigm6, respectively. Safety assessments included FIX inhibitor incidence, adverse events, neurocognitive and neurologic outcomes, polyethylene glycol concentration in plasma, and medical events of special interest. Efficacy endpoints included bleeds, N9-GP hemostatic effect, and FIX consumption. Overall, 25 patients in paradigm5 and 50 patients in paradigm6 received N9-GP and were followed for up to 8 and 6 years, respectively. No inhibitory antibodies were reported in PTPs; 4 of the 50 PUPs developed inhibitors. Extensive evaluation revealed no neurocognitive or neurologic concerns with N9-GP use in children during the study period. Across both studies, few adverse events were reported as possibly related to N9-GP. High hemostatic response rate, high treatment adherence, low annualized bleeding rates, and no new target joints were reported. These data provide the longest follow-up for an extended half-life FIX and confirm the long-term efficacy of N9-GP prophylaxis in children with HB with no observed neurocognitive or neurologic safety concerns."

    "abstract": "Joint damage in patients with haemophilia (PwH) is commonly assessed by imaging, but few reports have described how structural changes in joints, for example, haemophilic arthropathy (HA)-affect gait ability. We evaluated gait function among PwH with HA, PwH without HA, and people without haemophilia (non-PwH) using a Zebris FDM-T treadmill (FDM-T), an easy-to-use gait assessment instrument with a force sensor matrix. The following gait parameters were collected: centre of pressure trajectory intersection (COPi) anterior/posterior variability, COPi lateral variability, COPi anterior/posterior symmetry, COPi lateral symmetry, single-limb support line (SLSL) length, and SLSL variability. Participants walked at their typical gait speed. The physical function of the PwH was assessed by the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS). Parameters were compared among the three groups. Twelve PwH with HA, 28 PwH without HA, and 12 non-PwH were enrolled. Gait speed significantly differed between groups (non-PwH, 3.1 ± 0.7; PwH without HA, 2.0 ± 0.7; PwH with HA; 1.5 ± 0.4). The COPi anterior/posterior variability, COPi lateral variability, SLSL length, and SLSL variability were greater in the PwH groups than in the non-PwH group. The COPi lateral symmetry differed between PwH with HA and the other groups. The HJHS was not correlated with gait parameters among PwH with HA. Gait parameters and speed were abnormal in both PwH with HA and PwH without HA. The FDM-T can be used to identify early stages of physical dysfunction that cannot be detected by conventional functional assessments such as the HJHS."

Insurance denials and high costs remain barriers to its use. To determine the safety and efficacy of crushed tranexamic acid tablets in water (cTXAw) for children with bleeding disorders. We retrospectively reviewed records of children (<10 years) with bleeding disorders who received cTXAw or EACA OS from 1 December 2018, through 31 July 2022, at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota). Bleeding outcomes were defined according to ISTH criteria. Thirty-two patients were included (median age, 3 years; male, n = 23). Diagnoses were VWD (n = 17), haemophilia (n = 5), FVII deficiency (n = 3), inherited platelet disorder (n = 4), ITP (n = 2), and combined FV and FVII deficiencies (n = 1). Thirty-two courses of cTXAw (monotherapy 24/32; mean duration 6 days) and fifteen courses of EACA (monotherapy 12/15; mean duration 5 days) were administered. No surgical procedures (n = 28) were complicated by bleeding. Of the 19 bleeding events, 16 had effective haemostasis, two had no reported outcome, and one had no response. cTXAw and EACA were equally effective in preventing and treating bleeding (p value > .1). No patients had adverse effects. Eight of 19 patients (42%) who were initially prescribed EACA OS did not receive it because of cost or insurance denial. The estimated average wholesale price of one treatment was $94 for cTXAw and $905 for EACA OS. CTXAw appears to be an effective, safe, and low-cost alternative option to EACA OS for young children with bleeding disorders."

    "title": "Prophylactic Treatment of Children with Hemophilia in Sweden.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia A/B are caused by deficiency or lack of coagulation factors VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX), respectively, in plasma. A person with hemophilia develops bleeding in the joints and muscles at an early age, which, if left untreated, leads to early arthropathy. Preventive treatment can be achieved by regular (prophylactic) administration of FVIII/FIX. In 1958, this was implemented on a small scale in Sweden with FVIII in patients with severe hemophilia A, and in those with hemophilia B in 1972 when FIX became available. However, there were problems with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis infection from contaminated blood products. In the 1990s, recombinant FVIII and FIX concentrates were introduced. The major remaining problems then were the development of inhibitors, and the need for a venous route for the injections in very young children. High-titer inhibitors were treated by immune tolerance induction according to a modified model of the original Bonn high-dose protocol. A central venous line, i.e., Port-A-Cath, has enabled early prophylaxis in many children with poor venous access and has enabled the early start of home treatment with adequate injection frequency. Scoring systems for X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and function of joints were developed early in Sweden and have been widely disseminated worldwide, partly with modifications. Extended half-life products with half-life increased three to five times have been developed, which can provide superior bleed protection when dosed once-weekly and can maintain therapeutic trough levels when administered less frequently. The ultimate prophylaxis therapy in the future may be gene therapy."

However, data on the long-term development of arthropathy are still scant. To evaluate long-term arthropathy development since the introduction of prophylaxis according to birth cohort, hemophilia severity, and inhibitor status. This single-center historic cohort study included persons with severe and moderate hemophilia A and hemophilia B born between 1935 and 2005. Arthropathy on X-rays was evaluated using the Pettersson score. Patient and joint characteristics were studied per birth cohort (<1970, 1970-1980, 1981-1990, and >1990) and compared according to hemophilia severity. The distribution of affected joints and cumulative incidence of arthropathy were analyzed. The association of Pettersson score with birth cohort and inhibitor characteristics was explored using multivariable regression analyses adjusted for age at evaluation. In total, 1064 X-rays of 363 patients were analyzed. Of persons with severe hemophilia (<i>n</i> = 317, 87.3%), 244 (77.0%) developed arthropathy. Prophylaxis was started at younger ages over time, from a median of 18 to 2.1 years, and concomitantly, arthropathy decreased in consecutive birth cohorts. Ankles were most commonly affected in 188 of 258 (72.9%) patients. Persons with moderate hemophilia (<i>n</i> = 46, 12.7%) had a lower risk of arthropathy (27/46 [58.7%]), but a reduction over time was less pronounced. In the multivariable analyses, birth cohort and age at evaluation were predictors for the development of arthropathy, while inhibitor status showed no association. The development and severity of arthropathy have decreased over the past decades. However, patients have remained at risk for developing arthropathy, especially in their ankles."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia B is characterised by a deficiency of factor IX (FIX) protein due to genetic variants in the FIX gene (F9). Genetic testing may have a vital role in effectively managing haemophilia B. However, in many developing countries, comprehensive genetic variant detection is unavailable. This study aimed to address the lack of genetic data in our country by conducting genetic variant detection on people affected by haemophilia B in our region. Twenty-one participants were screened with a direct Sanger sequencing method to identify variants in the F9 gene. The identified variants were then compared to previously published variants and/or to a reference database. A total of ten F9 genetic changes were detected, with five of them being novel. These identified variants were distributed across different domains of the FIX protein. Only one participant had a history of inhibitor formation against FIX replacement therapy. Notably, this participant had two distinct genetic changes present adjacent to each other. Thus, we hypothesise that the presence of multiple variants within the same functional region of the gene may increase the risk for inhibitor development. The discovery of novel pathogenic variations in the F9 gene highlights the importance of genetic analysis in specific geographical regions. The possible link between a complex variant and inhibitor formation illustrates the potential role that genetic screening has as a pre-treatment tool in predicting treatment reactions and outcomes."

Hematological, ophthalmological, neurodegenerative, and metabolic therapeutic areas have witnessed successful treatment of hemophilia and muscular dystrophy, restoration of immune system in children with immunodeficiencies, and restoration of vision. This review focuses on three leading vector platforms of the past two decades: adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), adenoviruses (AdVs), and lentiviruses (LVs).

The study began on June 27, 2018, and participants were treated between January, 2019, and March, 2020; the date of data cutoff was April 21, 2022. 54 adult males (40 White, two Asian, one Black or African American, 11 other or missing) received a single intravenous infusion of etranacogene dezaparvovec and were followed for a median of 26·51 months (IQR 24·54-27·99), after a lead-in period of 7·13 months (6·51-7·82). In the updated analysis comparing months 7-24 after gene therapy to the lead-in period, mean adjusted ABR significantly reduced from 4·18 to 1·51 (p=0·0002) for all bleeds and from 3·65 to 0·99 (p=0·0001) for factor IX-treated bleeds. During each 6-month period after gene therapy, at least 67% of participants experienced no bleeding (36 of 54 during months 0-6 and stable thereafter), compared with 14 (26%) of 54 during the lead-in period. 24 months after gene therapy, 1 (2%) participant had one-stage factor IX activity less than 5%, whereas 18 (33%) had factor IX activity more than 40% (non-haemophilia range), with mean factor IX activity stable and sustained at 36·7% (SD 19·0%). 52 (96%) of 54 participants expressed endogenous factor IX, remaining free of factor IX prophylaxis at month 24. No new safety concerns were identified and no treatment-related serious adverse events or treatment-related deaths occurred. The most common treatment-related adverse events were an increase in alanine aminotransferase (nine [17%] of 54 patients), headache (eight [15%]), influenza-like illness (seven [13%]), and an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (five [9%]). By providing durable disease correction throughout the 24 months after gene therapy, etranacogene dezaparvovec provides a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with severe or moderately severe haemophilia B. uniQure and CSL Behring."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is an X-linked congenital bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) (in hemophilia A) or factor IX (FIX) (in hemophilia B) and is one of the most important hereditary conditions in Iraq. The current study tried to provide a glimpse into the epidemiological and clinical status, as well as complications and treatment used for patients with hemophilia A in Karbala, Iraq. This retrospective research was carried out by reviewing the medical records of 90 male patients diagnosed with hemophilia A registered at the Hereditary Blood Disease Center in Karbala Teaching Hospital for children in Karbala, Iraq. The data was collected from May 10, 2023, until June 15, 2023, and included age, severity, type of bleeding, therapeutic approach, chronic viral infections including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The median age of the patients was 15 years (18.86±14.42). In this study, one-third of patients' presentations started in the first year of life. The most common type was severe hemophilia A (factor VIII activity < 1%). Consequently, more than half of the patients were treated with factor VIII concentrate. Four patients had hepatitis C, while HIV was confirmed in one patient. The epidemiological or clinical parameters of hemophilia A patients in Karbala seem similar to those in other cities in Iraq. By considering this preliminary data, further comprehensive studies for patients with hemophilia and associated complications in other provinces or cities in Iraq are highly suggested to provide a clear perspective about the prevalence and epidemiological burdens."

    "title": "[New perspective of anticoagulation in intensive care unit: basic and clinical advances in coagulation factor XII and XI inhibitors].",
    "abstract": "Anticoagulation therapy stands as a key treatment for thrombotic diseases. The consequential bleeding risk tied to existing anticoagulation methods significantly impacts patient prognosis. In the intensive care unit (ICU), patients often necessitate organ support, leading to the inevitable placement of artificial devices in blood vessels, thereby requiring anticoagulation treatment to avert clot formation that might impede organ support. Nevertheless, these patients commonly encounter a heightened risk of bleeding. Hemophilia B, identified in 1953, manifests as a deficiency in coagulation factor XI (FXI), which focused people's perspective on the endogenous coagulation pathway, that is, the contact pathway. Upon interaction between the surface of artificial devices and FXII, FXII activates, subsequently triggering FXI and initiating the \"coagulation cascade\" within the contact pathway. Inhibitors targeting the contact pathway encompass two primary categories: FXII inhibitors and FXI inhibitors, capable of impeding this process. This article reviews the role of FXII and FXI in activating the contact pathway, seeking to illuminate their contributions to thrombus formation. By listing the relatively mature drugs and their indications, clinicians are familiar with this new anticoagulant."

    "title": "A novel class of self-complementary AAV vectors with multiple advantages based on cceAAV lacking mutant ITR.",
    "abstract": "Self-complementary AAV vectors (scAAV) use a mutant inverted terminal repeat (mITR) for efficient packaging of complementary stranded DNA, enabling rapid transgene expression. However, inefficient resolution at the mITR leads to the packaging of monomeric or subgenomic AAV genomes. These noncanonical particles reduce transgene expression and may affect the safety of gene transfer. To address these issues, we have developed a novel class of scAAV vectors called covalently closed-end double-stranded AAV (cceAAV) that eliminate the mITR resolution step during production. Instead of using a mutant ITR, we used a 56-bp recognition sequence of protelomerase (TelN) to covalently join the top and bottom strands, allowing the vector to be generated with just a single ITR. To produce cceAAV vectors, the vector plasmid is initially digested with TelN, purified, and then subjected to a standard triple-plasmid transfection protocol followed by traditional AAV vector purification procedures. Such cceAAV vectors demonstrate yields comparable to scAAV vectors. Notably, we observed enhanced transgene expression as compared to traditional scAAV vectors. The treatment of mice with hemophilia B with cceAAV-FIX resulted in significantly enhanced long-term FIX expression. The cceAAV vectors hold several advantages over scAAV vectors, potentially leading to the development of improved human gene therapy drugs."

    "abstract": "Early gene therapy clinical trials for the treatment of Haemophilia B have been instrumental to our global understanding of gene therapy and have significantly contributed to the rapid expansion of the field. The use of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) as vectors for gene transfer has successfully led to therapeutic expression of coagulation factor IX (FIX) in severe haemophilia B patients. Expression of FIX has remained stable following a single administration of vector for up to 8 years at levels that are clinically relevant to reduce the incidence of spontaneous bleeds and have permitted a significant change in the disease management with reduction or elimination of the need for coagulation factor concentrates. These trials have also shed light on several concerns around AAV-mediated gene transfer such as the high prevalence of pre-existing immunity against the vector capsid as well as the elevation of liver transaminases that is associated with a loss of FIX transgene expression in some patients. However, this field is advancing very rapidly with the development of increasingly more efficient strategies to overcome some of these obstacles and importantly raise the possibility of a functional cure, which has been long sought after. This review overviews the evolution of gene therapy for haemophilia B over the last two decades."

    "abstract": "The disease burden and bleeding risk of patients with mild hemophilia may be underestimated. Their health-related quality of life (QoL) may be negatively impacted by insufficient treatment and bleed-related joint damage connected to a potentially delayed diagnosis. This study aims to gain information on the care reality and QoL of patients aged ≥12 years with mild hemophilia in Germany. An anonymous cross-sectional patient survey using standardized questionnaires was conducted in a validated electronic patient-reported outcome system. Medical specialists, hemophilia centers, patient organizations, and support groups across Germany invited the patients. A total of 43 patients (35 patients with hemophilia A, 5 patients with hemophilia B, and 3 patients for whom the information was missing) with a median age of 33 years were analyzed. The median age at diagnosis was 6.0 years (interquartile range [IQR] 2.0-15.0), and the median factor activity was 14.0% (IQR 12.0-25.0). Nearly 85% of the patients received factor concentrates in the past, and the most common reasons for the treatment were surgery or joint bleeding (each 65.6%). Half of the patients who provided feedback experienced complications during bleeding episodes. Prophylactic treatment with factor concentrates was rare (10.3%). The patients had minor problems regarding their health status. Bleeding complications and joint bleeding, in particular, may be highly underestimated in patients with mild hemophilia, highlighting a medical need in this population. Patients with a potential benefit from prophylaxis need to be identified. Mild hemophilia has a negative impact on patients' QoL. Hemophilia centers satisfied the patients' needs. Further research is needed to address the current lack of awareness and improve adequate treatment in the future."

    "abstract": "The hemophilias are the most common severe inherited bleeding disorders and are caused by deficiency of clotting factor (F) VIII (hemophilia A) or FIX (hemophilia B). The resultant bleeding predisposition significantly increases morbidity and mortality. The ability to improve the bleeding phenotype with modest increases in clotting factor levels has enabled the development and regulatory approval of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector gene therapies for people with hemophilia A and B. The canine hemophilia model has proven to be one of the best predictors of therapeutic response in humans. Here, we report long-term follow-up of 12 companion dogs with severe hemophilia that were treated in a real-world setting with AAV gene therapy. Despite more baseline bleeding than in research dogs, companion dogs demonstrated a 94% decrease in bleeding rates and 61% improvement in quality of life over a median of 4.1 years (range 2.6-8.9). No new anti-transgene immune responses were detected; one dog with a pre-existing anti-FVIII inhibitor achieved immune tolerance with gene therapy. Two dogs expressing 1%-5% FVIII post gene therapy experienced fatal bleeding events. These data suggest AAV liver-directed gene therapy is efficacious in a real-world setting but should target expression >5% and closely monitor those with levels in the 1%-5% range."

    "abstract": "Current hemophilia B treatment guidelines recommend routine prophylaxis with factor IX (FIX) replacement products, tailored to maintain plasma activity at levels that will prevent bleeds. However, plasma FIX activity may not be the primary determinant or best indicator of hemostatic efficacy due to its extravascular distribution. FIX replacement therapy has evolved to include extended half-life (EHL) products that provide effective bleed protection when administered at intervals of 7 days or longer. rFIXFc is a recombinant fusion protein with an extended circulation time. rFIXFc has a biodistribution profile consistent with distribution into extravascular space, where it may support hemostasis at sites of vessel injury independent of circulating plasma activity levels. The safety and efficacy of rFIXFc prophylaxis is well established in adults, adolescents and children including previously untreated patients with hemophilia B, with substantial evidence from clinical trials and real-world clinical practice. This review describes the pharmacokinetic characteristics of rFIXFc, summarizes available safety and efficacy data, and evaluates the use of rFIXFc in special populations. Current hemophilia B treatment challenges, including target FIX plasma levels, perioperative use, and management of patients with comorbidities, are discussed together with the potential role of EHL products in the future treatment landscape of hemophilia B."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy has the potential to offer people with haemophilia (PwH) a life free from bleeding and the burden posed by current treatment regimens. To date, gene therapy has only been available in clinical trial settings, to PwH without pre-existing or historical factor inhibitors, significant concomitant liver damage or pre-existing neutralising antibodies to the adeno-associated viruses used to deliver the therapy. Thus, most PwH treated at centres not currently involved in gene therapy trials, either as a referral/follow-up centre or as a dosing centre, have been unable to access the therapy. This Exigency sub-study aims to gain a greater understanding of the opinions of PwH in the United Kingdom who have not had access to gene therapy: asking what they understand, what concerns they have, and whether they perceive any barriers preventing their access to gene therapy. Twenty-three PwH were approached; 14 consented, and one withdrew prior to interview. The mean age of the participants was 35.7 years (range 25-74 years). Eleven had haemophilia A and two haemophilia B. Two were treated with standard half-life factor products, five with extended half-life products, five with a FVIII mimetic and one with a clinical trial product. One family member (a participant's partner) was also interviewed. The participants identified four barriers to gene therapy: concerns about the process of gene therapy (Expectations), uncertainty about the results (outcomes), (Access) to treatment, and a lack of understanding about gene therapy (education). This Exigency study subgroup sees gene therapy as a positive treatment development that promises an improved quality of life. For this participant group, four issues impact their decision to undergo gene therapy. If the promise of gene therapy is to be realised, these barriers need to be acknowledged and addressed by healthcare professionals, patient organisations, and gene therapy providers."

    "abstract": "The increased life expectancy in patients with hemophilia (PwH) over the last years has raised the incidence of comorbidities, including thromboembolic events. Thromboembolic events are rare in PwH and most of them occur in the presence of exogenous risk factors. There is still scarce scientific evidence on the optimal antithrombotic treatment and management approach in this population. In the hemophilic population thromboembolic events are rare. Most of them are often multifactorial and occur in the presence of both exogenous (orthopedic surgery, intensive replacement therapy, use of central venous catheters…) and endogenous (cardiovascular diseases) risk factors. We describe the case of a 43-year-old patient with severe hemophilia B (sHB) receiving prophylaxis with eftrenonacog alfa (rFIXFc) and antithrombotic treatment due to portal vein thrombosis. The patient was treated with extended half- life factor IX (EHL-FIX) prophylaxis maintaining higher trough levels to avoid new bleeding episodes associated to the underlying disease and the use of antithrombotic therapy with low molecular weight heparin. EHL-FIX concentrates allow prolonged intervals between intravenous infusions and higher hemostatic protection thanks to increased factor trough levels. This current case report provides clinical evidence in antithrombotic management in a patient with severe hemophilia B."

Patients require lifelong treatment and it is costly, but there is a lack of research in China on the treatment and burden for this group. Our aim was to review the actual treatment pattern of hemophilia B patients in China, and describe the financial burden and other disease burden from the patient's perspective. Using data collected by the Beijing Hemophilia Home Care Center, descriptive statistics were made on the sociodemographic characteristics and treatment of patients. The annual drug costs were calculated according to the actual factor dosage and price. During the study period, 29.9% of the patients only received on-demand treatment, while the rest of the patients received varying numbers of prophylaxis treatment. The total cost of clotting factors for 341 patients in one year was 16.0 million CNY ($2.5 million), with 46990.8 CNY ($7283.7) per patient. The drug cost of prophylaxis was significantly higher than that of on-demand treatment. The amount of prothrombin complex concentrates used by patients was the largest, more than 5 times of recombinant coagulation factor IX. Based on the average annual wage and average working time of Chinese employees in 2021, the average annual wage loss of HB patients reached 31544.2 CNY ($4889.4). The results of the questionnaire showed that 77.1% and 65.3% of patients had chronic pain and acute pain of different frequencies. The level of prophylaxis for Chinese patients is low; safer and more effective recombinant drugs are not widely available. Patients also face a high burden of drug costs, as well as indirect costs that cannot be underestimated. Therefore, continued efforts are needed to improve the quality of life of patients by reducing their financial burden and promote standardized treatment."

In Europe, eptacog beta is indicated for the treatment of bleeds and the prevention of bleeds during surgery or invasive procedures in adults and adolescents (≥12 years old) with congenital haemophilia A or B with high-titre inhibitors (≥5 BU) or with low-titre inhibitors who are expected to have a high anamnestic response to factor VIII or factor IX, or to be refractory to increased dosing of these factors. The efficacy and safety of eptacog beta were evaluated in three Phase III clinical studies, PERSEPT 1, 2 and 3. For the EMA filing dossier, the analysis of data from PERSEPT 1 and 2 differed from the analysis used to support the filing in the US. In this review, we summarise current data regarding the mode of action, clinical efficacy and safety of eptacog beta for the management of haemophilia A and B in patients with inhibitors from a European perspective. In addition to providing a valuable summary of the analyses of the clinical data for eptacog beta conducted for the EMA, our review summarises the potential differentiators for eptacog beta compared with other current bypassing agents."

To analyze best available evidences of VTE rates in persons with hemophilia A or B undergoing lower limb TJR and the use of postoperative pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. We systematically screened 4 online biomedical databases to identify studies reporting VTE rates in patients with hemophilia after TJR. Case reports and case series with less than 10 patients were excluded. Twenty-six observational studies were included in this systematic review, reporting 1181 TJRs in patients with hemophilia A or B. Eight studies had VTE rates as the primary outcome. Five studies reported screen-detected VTE, while 21 reported symptomatic VTE events. Overall, 17 VTE events were reported (1.4%; 95% CI, 0.9%-2.3%), including 10 (6.6%) after 151 surgeries with postoperative VTE screening and 7 (0.7%) after 1080 surgeries without postoperative screening. Thromboprophylaxis protocols were specified in 21 studies; postoperative thromboprophylaxis was used in 15 (1.3%) surgeries. This information was not available for 29.0% of the analyzed population. Despite the low thromboprophylaxis use in patients with hemophilia, rates of symptomatic VTE after TJR appeared to be low. We also highlighted the need to better report the thrombotic outcome in persons with hemophilia to face the ongoing changes in the hemophilia landscape."

Low success rates of immune tolerance induction therapy in hemophilia B necessitate the search for novel immune tolerance therapies. Skin-associated lymphoid tissues have been successfully targeted in allergen-specific immunotherapy. We aimed to develop a prophylactic immune tolerance protocol based on intradermal administration of FIX that would prevent inhibitor formation and/or anaphylaxis in response to replacement therapy. We measured FIX inhibitor, anti-FIX immunoglobulin G1, and immunoglobulin E titers using the Bethesda assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after 4 weeks of twice-weekly intradermal FIX or FIX-Fc administration followed by 5 to 6 weeks of weekly systemic FIX injections in C3H/HeJ hemophilia B mice. We also measured skin antigen-presenting, follicular helper T, and germinal center B cell frequencies in skin-draining lymph nodes after a single or repeat intradermal FIX administration. Intradermal administration enhanced FIX inhibitor formation in response to systemic administration. We further found that intradermal administration alone triggers inhibitor formation, even at a low dose of 0.4 IU/kg, which is 100-fold lower than the intravenous dose of 40 IU/kg typically required to induce inhibitor development in hemophilia B mice. Also, intradermal administration triggered germinal center formation in skin-draining lymph nodes and sensitized mice to systemic administration. Factor IX-Fc fusion protein did not modulate inhibitor formation. Intradermal FIX administration is highly immunogenic, suggesting that the skin compartment is not amenable to immune tolerance induction or therapeutic delivery of clotting factors."

We systematically searched the Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases, for clinical trials involving patients diagnosed with hemophilia and treated with AAV-mediated gene therapy. Data on the annualized bleeding rate (ABR), annualized infusion rate (AIR), the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), severe adverse events (SAEs), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation were extracted as our outcomes. A total of 12 articles from 11 clinical trials were selected from 868 articles for meta-analysis. Pooled analyses showed that AAV-based gene therapy in hemophilia patients reduced the number of bleeding events and the number of factor infusion events by an approximate average of 7 per year and 103 per year, respectively. Eighty percent, 18%, and 63% of hemophilia patients had elevated TRAE, SAE, and ALT levels, respectively. Moreover, subgroup analysis found a significant reduction in ABR and AIR 2-3 years after the therapy. Additional findings that were not pooled including coagulation factor activity are presented in the accompanying tables. Our analysis supported the efficacy and safety of AAV-mediated gene therapy for hemophilia, providing evidence for its application as a therapeutic option for widespread clinical use in hemophilia patients in the future."

Exonic changes generally lead to alterations in protein production, secretion, activity, or clearance. However, owing to the overlap between proteins and splicing codes, missense variants can also affect messenger RNA splicing, thus adding a layer of complexity and influencing disease phenotypes. To extensively characterize a panel of 13 exonic variants in the F9 gene occurring at 6 different factor IX positions and associated with varying severities of hemophilia B (HB). Computational predictions, splicing analysis, and recombinant factor IX assays were exploited to characterize F9 variants. We demonstrated that 5 (38%) of 13 selected F9 exonic variants have pleiotropic effects. Although bioinformatic approaches accurately classified effects, extensive experimental assays were required to elucidate and deepen the molecular mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects. Importantly, their characterization was instrumental in developing tailored RNA therapeutics based on engineered U7 small nuclear RNA to mask cryptic splice sites and compensatory U1 small nuclear RNA to enhance exon definition. Overall, albeit a multitool bioinformatic approach suggested the molecular effects of multiple HB variants, the deep investigation of molecular mechanisms revealed insights into the HB phenotype-genotype relationship, enabling accurate classification of HB variants. Importantly, knowledge of molecular mechanisms allowed the development of tailored RNA therapeutics, which can also be translated to other genetic diseases."

The work presented here aimed to evaluate MarzAA and SoC treatment of bleeding events on a standardized four-point efficacy scale (poor, fair, good, and excellent). Two continuous-time Markov modeling approaches were explored; a four-state model analyzing all four categories of bleeding improvement and a two-state model analyzing a binarized outcome (treatment failure (poor/fair), and treatment success (good/excellent)). Different covariates impacting improvement of bleeding episodes as well as a putative relationship between MarzAA exposure and improvement of bleeding episodes were evaluated. In the final four-state model, higher baseline diastolic blood pressure and higher age (> 33 years of age) were found to negatively and positively impact improvement of bleeding condition, respectively. Bleeding events occurring in knees and ankles were found to improve faster than bleeding events at other locations. The covariate effects had most impact on early treatment success (≤ 3 hours) whereas at later timepoints (> 12 hours), treatment success was similar for all patients indicating that these covariates might be clinically relevant for early treatment response. A statistically significant relationship between MarzAA zero-order absorption and improvement of bleedings (P < 0.05) were identified albeit with low precision. No statistically significant difference in treatment response between MarzAA and intravenous SoC was identified, indicating the potential of MarzAA for treatment of episodic bleeding events with a favorable subcutaneous administration route."

    "title": "What is the rationale for mesenchymal stromal cells based therapies in the management of hemophilic arthropathies?",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia A and B are rare X-linked genetic bleeding disorders due to a complete or partial deficiency in the coagulation factors VIII or IX, respectively. The main treatment for hemophilia is prophylactic and based on coagulation factor replacement therapies. These treatments have significantly reduced bleeding and improved the patients' quality of life. Nevertheless, repeated joint bleedings (hemarthroses), even subclinical hemarthroses, can lead to hemophilic arthropathy (HA). This disabling condition is characterized by chronic pain due to synovial inflammation, cartilage and bone destruction requiring ultimately joint replacement. HA resembles to rheumatoid arthritis because of synovitis but HA is considered as having similarities with osteoarthritis as illustrated by the migration of immune cells, production of inflammatory cytokines, synovial hypertrophy and cartilage damage. Various drugs have been evaluated for the management of HA with limited success. The objective of the review is to discuss new therapeutic approaches with a special focus on the studies that have investigated the potential of using mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the management of HA. A systematic review of the literature has been made. Most of the studies have focused on the interest of MSCs for the delivery of missing factors VIII or IX but in some studies, more insight on the effect of MSC injection on synovial inflammation or cartilage structure were provided and put in perspective for possible clinical applications."

    "abstract": "Until extended half-life (EHL) factor IX (FIX) concentrates became available in Japan in 2010, patients with hemophilia B received intravenous FIX replacement therapy with standard half-life (SHL) FIX concentrates. To investigate the amount of factor dispensed and the associated medical expenditures for the treatment of hemophilia B in the real-world clinical setting in Japan. This retrospective study comprised patients with hemophilia B (N=197) who had filled prescriptions for FIX concentrates reported in Japan's Medical Data Vision database from 2015 to 2019. Patients were included if they had 2 or more prescriptions for the same FIX concentrates within the first 6 months of the study period and the interval between prescriptions was at least 2 weeks. Since 2015, there was a decrease in the proportion of patients using SHL FIX concentrates and a corresponding increase in international units of dispensed EHL FIX concentrates. Median annualized dispensed dosages (IU/kg body weight) of EHL FIX concentrates were lower than for SHL concentrates for outpatient use only. Annual total health care expenditures per patient and annual expenditures for prescribed FIX concentrates increased each year during the study period. Following a switch from an SHL to an EHL concentrate, the median amount of prescribed FIX concentrate decreased slightly, although median total health care expenditures and FIX concentrate expenditures increased. In the real-world setting in Japan, medical expenditures and the proportion of patients prescribed EHL FIX concentrates for the treatment of hemophilia B have increased."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy (GT) has recently become a new therapeutic option for hemophilia A and B. However, patient levels of knowledge and attitudes toward it are poorly understood. A general lack of knowledge and education has been highlighted in previous studies. To date, no studies focused on patient attitudes toward GT, priorities, concerns, and information needs, nor how these factors might influence their willingness to accept it. To evaluate knowledge and attitudes toward GT of an Italian cohort of patients with hemophilia. A questionnaire was administered to patients with hemophilia A and B to evaluate: (1) clinical data; (2) GT knowledge; (3) willingness to accept GT, perceived benefits and concerns, and information needs. Eighty-five patients participated in the study; 64 with severe hemophilia A and 4 with severe hemophilia B. Participants appeared to know only general information on GT, but little about its detailed functioning. The avoidance of frequent infusions and the reduction of bleeding episodes seem to be the most relevant expected benefits. The possibility of failing or losing effectiveness of GT over time was the main concern. Regarding willingness to undergo GT, 54.4% of respondents gave a negative response, mainly due to fear that treatment will lose effectiveness over time, fear of side effects, and lack of GT knowledge. Greater knowledge increased the acceptability of this disruptive therapy among patients with severe hemophilia. Overall, Italian patients with hemophilia showed poor knowledge of GT. However, it seems that greater knowledge was associated with a greater willingness to have GT."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy is now a reality for individuals with haemophilia, yet little is known regarding the quality-of-life impact of factor correction. As few data exist, and recognizing the analogy to liver transplantation (OLTX), we identified OLTX+ and OLTX- men in the ATHNdataset to compare post-OLTX factor VIII and IX on quality of life (QoL) by Haem-A-QoL and PROMIS-29. OLTX- were matched to OLTX+ by age, race, and haemophilia type and severity. Deidentified demographic data, including post-transplant factor levels, genotype and target joint disease were analysed by descriptive statistics. Haem-A-Qol and PROMIS-29 were compared in OLTX+ and OLTX- by student's t-test and univariate regression models. Of 86 people with haemophilia A (HA) or haemophilia B (HB) cared for at 10 haemophilia treatment centers (HTCs), 21 (24.4%) OLTX+ and 65 (75.6%) OLTX- were identified. OLTX+ and OLTX- had a similar frequency of target joint disease (p = .806), HA genotypes, null versus non-null (p = .696), and HIV infection (p = .316). At a median 9.2 years post-OLTX, median FVIII, .63 IU/mL [IQR 0.52-0.97] and FIX, .91 IU/mL [IQR .63-1.32], Haem-A-QoL, PROMIS-29, and HOT scores were comparable. Severe HA/HB had lower post-OLTX 'dealing with haemophilia' scores (p = .022) and higher 'sports and leisure' (p = .010) and 'view of yourself' scores (p = .024) than OLTX+ non-severe participants. Non-caucasian OLTX+ had significantly lower scores in sports and leisure (p = .042), future expectations (p = .021) and total score (p = .010). Nine years after OLTX, QoL is comparable to OLTX-, but significantly better in OLTX+ with severe than non-severe disease and in caucasians than non-caucasians."

    "title": "Deciphering conundrums of adeno-associated virus liver-directed gene therapy: focus on hemophilia.",
    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus gene therapy has been the subject of intensive investigation for monogenic disease gene addition therapy for more than 25 years, yet few therapies have been approved by regulatory agencies. Most have not progressed beyond phase 1/2 due to toxicity, lack of efficacy, or both. The liver is a natural target for adeno-associated virus since most serotypes have a high degree of tropism for hepatocytes due to cell surface receptors for the virus and the unique liver sinusoidal geometry facilitating high volumes of blood contact with hepatocyte cell surfaces. Recessive monogenic diseases such as hemophilia represent promising targets since the defective proteins are often synthesized in the liver and secreted into the circulation, making them easy to measure, and many do not require precise regulation. Yet, despite initiation of many disease-specific clinical trials, therapeutic windows are often nonexistent, resulting in excess toxicity and insufficient efficacy. Iterative progress built on these attempts is best illustrated by hemophilia, with the first regulatory approvals for factor IX and factor VIII gene therapies eventually achieved 25 years after the first gene therapy studies in humans. Although successful gene transfer may result in the production of sufficient transgenic protein to modify the disease, many emerging questions on durability, predictability, reliability, and variability of response have not been answered. The underlying biology accounting for these heterogeneous responses and the interplay between host and virus is the subject of intense investigation and the subject of this review."

    "title": "Adherence tool for prophylactic haemophilia treatment in adult and adolescent patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a congenital bleeding disorder resulting from a low level or deficiency of clotting factors. It is an x-linked recessive disease and happens almost exclusively in males whereas females are the carrier of the affected gene. The most common types of hemophilia are hemophilia A and Hemophilia B. Hemophilia is classified into mild, moderate and severe. Prophylaxis treatment has more advantages clinically compare to on-demand therapy. It may reduce the bleeding frequency, gives protection from joint damage, may lower the number of total bleeding episodes per year, and may reduce annualised spontaneous and trauma related bleeding events. However, prophylaxis treatment needs regular weekly infusions therefore it is painful to administer especially if the vein is difficult to access. It may cause pain at the site of injections and may lead to non-adherence to treatment. Non-adherence to a regimen will result in insufficient clotting factor levels in the body. The efficacy of the medication is reduced and may lead to a high bleeding tendency. Thus far, the study on adult haemophilic patient adherence tool is scarce and limited; and therefore this review is warranted. The study protocol is conducted as per the PRISMA-P guideline. There are 4 concepts in this systematic review which are Haemophilia, adult and adolescence, preventive treatment and adherence. Articles will be sought from electronic databases PUBMED, Ovid EMBASE, CINAHL, and SCOPUS using the MeSH term, synonym free-text word, truncation, and proximity operators as per each database. The proposed keywords within each concept will be joined using the Boolean operator \"OR \"and the 4 different concepts combined using the Boolean operator \"AND\". Search will be limited to Human, English language, and publication until 2022. Studies will be included if they meet the study inclusion criteria. The quality of the studies will be appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS) for observation-based studies. This systematic review does not require formal ethical approval as data will be extracted from selected published studies. The results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication and relevant conference presentations.(PROSPERO registration CRD42021273813)."

    "abstract": "Thromboembolic events are increasingly reported in the aging haemophilia population. The purpose of this study was to understand current practices and identify knowledge and research gaps in the management of persons with haemophilia requiring antithrombotic therapy for cardiovascular disorders (CVD) or venous thromboembolism (VTE). We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus for studies reporting on more than two patients with inherited haemophilia A or B, without inhibitors, requiring antithrombotic therapy for CVD or VTE. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers and analysed using descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis. We included 32 studies reporting on 432 persons with haemophilia. Three themes described the observed practice variation: (1) Difficulty weighing competing bleeding and thrombotic risks; (2) Tensions in providing standards of care and minimizing bleeding risk; (3) Advocacy for individualized strategies and multidisciplinary care. Different management strategies were used to treat persons with haemophilia in the setting of thromboembolic events, such as avoiding or choosing lower intensity antithrombotic therapy, or procedural alternatives to antithrombotic therapy. Initiation or alteration in haemostatic therapies along with antithrombotic therapy were common strategies and reported in 30 studies. However, data on target factor levels and bleeding and thrombotic events were largely missing. Our scoping review highlights unmet needs in the management of an aging population of persons with haemophilia with increasing prevalence of CVD and VTE. Management is inconsistent and divergent from those of non-haemophilic patients. Prospective data are needed to inform optimal and evidence-based management strategies of CVD and VTE in persons with haemophilia."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B (HB) is a rare, hereditary disease caused by a defect in the gene encoding factor IX (FIX) and leads to varying degrees of coagulation deficiency. The prevailing treatment for people with HB (PWHB) is FIX replacement product. The advent of recombinant coagulation products ushered in a new era of safety, efficacy, and improved availability compared with plasma-derived products. For people with severe HB, lifelong prophylaxis with a FIX replacement product is standard of care. Development of extended half-life FIX replacement products has allowed for advancements in the care of these PWHB. Nonetheless, lifelong need for periodic dosing and complex surveillance protocols pose substantive challenges in terms of access, adherence, and healthcare resource utilization. Further, some PWHB on prophylactic regimens continue to experience breakthrough bleeds and joint damage, and subpopulations of PWHB, including women, those with mild-to-moderate HB, and those with inhibitors to FIX, experience additional unique difficulties. This review summarizes the current challenges faced by PWHB, including the unique subpopulations; identifying the need for improved awareness, personalized care strategies, and new therapeutic options for severe HB, which may provide future solutions for some of the remaining unmet needs of PWHB."

    "abstract": "The development of antibodies (inhibitors) to clotting factors compromises the management of hemophilia A and B, resulting in resistance to clotting factor replacement and, in many cases, the need for bypassing agents to achieve hemostasis. To evaluate the association between the presence of inhibitors and achievement of perioperative hemostasis, development of complications, and presurgical plan deviations. We conducted a retrospective study using data from the Indiana Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center surgical database (1998-2019). Associations between perioperative outcomes and inhibitor status were assessed while controlling for patient and procedural characteristics. A total of 1492 surgeries were performed in 539 persons with hemophilia, with 72 procedures performed in 20 patients with inhibitors (15 with hemophilia A; 5 with hemophilia B). High-responding inhibitors (>5 BU/mL) were present in 27 procedures, low-responding inhibitors (≤5 BU/mL) were present in in 13 procedures, and 32 procedures were performed in patients with historically persistent inhibitors. Adjusting for age, diagnosis, surgery setting, hemostatic agent, data collection period, and surgery type (major/minor), inhibitors were associated with a higher risk of inadequate perioperative hemostasis (33.4% vs 8.6%; adjusted relative risk [adjRR], 3.78; 95% CI, 1.89-7.56; <i>P</i> < .001). Reported complications include hemorrhage, fever, pain, thrombosis, and infections. Complications were not statistically different based on inhibitor status (31.7% vs 14.6%; adjRR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.63-2.49; <i>P</i> = .526). Presurgical plan deviations (eg, hemostatic medication dose adjustments, procedure rescheduling, and changes in the length of postoperative hospitalization) occurred more frequently in surgeries involving inhibitors (70.8 vs 39.5%; adjRR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.12-1.93; <i>P</i> = .005). Inhibitors are associated with higher risks of adverse perioperative outcomes. Strategies to address inhibitor development should be prioritized to avoid undesirable perioperative outcomes."

    "abstract": "A woman in her 70s who was undergoing treatment for an overlap syndrome of autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis developed persistent genital bleeding. Coagulation tests revealed a longer activated partial thromboplastin time, a 7% decrease in coagulation factor IX activity (FIX:C) and a FIX inhibitor (of 3 BU/ml). Lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin antibody, and anti-β2 glycoprotein I antibody were positive, and the activated partial thromboplastin time cross-mixing test suggested the presence of LA. Additionally, all intrinsic coagulation factors decreased, but activity of all factors except FIX showed dilution linearity, which suggested a false decrease in activity due to LA. Although definitive diagnosis was difficult due to concurrent LA, this case was strongly suspected to be autoimmune coagulation FIX deficiency complicated by LA. Bypass therapy was not performed because the patient had no anemia and was positive for LA, and immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone was initiated immediately. Eleven weeks after diagnosis, FIX:C was 41% and zFIX inhibitor was less than 1 BU/ml, leading to remission."

    "abstract": "Factor (F)IX can bind to type IV collagen in the endothelial basement membrane and diffuse into extravascular spaces. Previous studies in rodents have reported a large biodistribution of FIX. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential hemostatic activity of extravascular FIX and its role in protecting against joint bleeds. The capacity of 4 different FIX molecules (plasma-derived and recombinant) to bind type I and type IV collagen was studied here. FIX molecules were also administered intravenously at doses of 50 to 3000 IU/kg in FIX knockout mice. A specific FIX signal was detected in immunohistochemistry in the liver as well as in muscles and knee joints with recombinant FIX molecules injected at 1000 and 3000 IU/kg but not at the usual clinical doses of 50 to 100 IU/kg, while plasma-derived FIX generated a FIX signal at all doses, including 50 IU/kg. Such a signal was also detected after five 100 IU/kg daily infusions of recombinant FIX, suggesting that FIX can accumulate in the extravascular space during prophylaxis. The extravascular procoagulant activity of FIX, assessed in saphenous vein bleeding assays, was significantly higher in hemophilia B mice after these 5 days of prophylaxis compared to a single infusion of 100 IU/kg of FIX and assessment of FIX activity 7 days later. Taken together, these results show that in individuals with severe hemophilia B receiving regular prophylaxis with FIX, extravascular accumulation of FIX over time may have a significant impact on the coagulation capacity and protection toward bleeding."

In the absence of head-to-head comparative trials, the aim of this study was to estimate the efficacy of rIX-FP versus rFIXFc using matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs). MAIC analyses leveraged individual patient data from the PROLONG-9FP trial and published summary-level data from the B-LONG trial for subjects who received weekly prophylaxis regimens. Individual patient data were used to assign weights and balance subjects from PROLONG-9FP with subjects from B-LONG on baseline disease severity, age, prior FIX regimen, and body mass index (BMI). Six efficacy outcomes were analyzed including annualized bleeding rate (ABR), annualized spontaneous bleeding rate (AsBR), annualized joint bleeding rate (AjBR), and the proportion of subjects without bleeding events (for total, spontaneous, and joint bleeding events). After adjustment for baseline disease severity, age, prior FIX regimen, and BMI, rIX-FP was associated with a statistically significant decrease in AsBR (rate ratio [RR] 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22, 0.82; P = 0.0107), and the proportion of patients without bleeding events (odds ratio [OR] 3.24; 95% CI 1.41, 7.45; P = 0.0057), spontaneous bleeding events (OR 3.47; 95% CI 1.56, 7.73; P = 0.0023), and joint bleeding events (OR 2.41; 95% CI 1.10, 5.26; P = 0.0274) compared with rFIXFc. Prophylactic treatment with rIX-FP was also associated with a numerically lower ABR (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.32, 1.75; P = 0.5095) and AjBR (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.37, 1.82; P = 0.6178). The MAICs demonstrated that weekly prophylaxis treatment of severe hemophilia B with rIX-FP resulted in favorable efficacy outcomes as compared to rFIXFc.

Of 143 answers received, 137 could be analysed, representing about 3.5% of patients with severe or moderate haemophilia over 16year-old. They were 80.3% with haemophilia A and 19.7 % with haemophilia B, with a severe form of the disease for 80.3 % of them. Curiosity for HGT was formulated by 64.2% of the participants, 33.6 % being interested by this approach as soon as it will be available and 38.7 % preferring to wait until more patients have been treated. Only 3.6 % of the participants would never consider receiving HGT. The level of awareness and knowledge was estimated to be limited by 39.5 % of the patients. More than 60 % of them declared having never or almost never discussed HGT with the team of their haemophilia centre. Before deciding to get HGT, 54.4 % of the participants considered that it will be very important to compare it with their current treatment and 53.7 % would like to be better informed by their care providers. These results highlight the need for training and education for patients, but also for professionals at haemophilia centres, about HGT and the shared decision-making process. Objective, unbiased and transparent information must be available for patients about this very promising therapy which nonetheless carries more uncertainty and unknowns compared to other haemophilia treatments."

In this cross-sectional study, an orthopedic specialist visited 448 patients and conducted screenings for skeletal complications. The assessment included evaluating the type of hemophilia, disease severity, treatment modality, the presence of inhibitors, and the identification of skeletal complications. Ninety patients with hemophilia A, with a mean age (SD) of 31.6 (14.4) years, and 10 patients with hemophilia B, with a mean age of 30.5 (20.6) years, were assessed. The most frequently affected joints were the knee and ankle joints. In the univariate analysis, patients with severe disease were more likely to exhibit synovitis, a target joint, and bone disease compared to patients with non-severe disease. Additionally, a history of treated or active hepatitis and an annual bleeding rate showed significant associations with the target joint. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, disease severity (OR 14.43, 95% CI 1.6-129.6) and a higher age at diagnosis (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00-1.13) increased the likelihood of developing osteoporosis. A history of hepatitis (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.28-10.48) was identified as an independent risk factor for the target joint. Skeletal complications are a common occurrence in hemophilia. Regular consultations with orthopedic specialists, focusing on bleeding control and hepatitis prevention, are essential for reducing the impact of this debilitating complication."

The goal of the current study was to identify the amino acid substitution(s) responsible for the enhanced activity of An96 and create a humanized An96 FIX transgene for gene therapy application. Reductionist screening approaches, including domain swapping and scanning residue substitution, were used and guided by one-stage FIX activity assays. In vitro characterization of top candidates included recombinant high-purity preparation, specific activity determination, and enzyme kinetic analysis. Final candidates were packaged into adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors and delivered to hemophilia B mice. Five of 42 total amino acid substitutions in An96 appear sufficient to retain the enhanced activity of An96 in an otherwise human FIX variant. Additional substitution of the Padua variant further increased the specific activity 5-fold. This candidate, designated ET9, demonstrated 51-fold greater specific activity than hFIX. AAV2/8-ET9 treated hemophilia B mice produced plasma FIX activities equivalent to those observed previously for AAV2/8-An96-Padua, which were 10-fold higher than AAV2/8-hFIX-Padua. Starting from computationally inferred ancient FIX sequences, novel amino acid substitutions conferring activity enhancement were identified and translated into an AAV-FIX gene therapy cassette demonstrating high potency. This ancestral sequence reconstruction discovery and sequence mapping refinement approach represents a promising platform for broader protein drug and gene therapy candidate optimization."

CNVplex technology, optical genome mapping, and long-distance polymerase chain reaction were employed to characterize the breakpoints of the chromosomal rearrangements. Cases 1 and 2 exhibited FIX activities below 1%. Case 3 displayed FIX activities within the reference range. However, cases 4 and 5 showed a significant increase in FIX activities. Alu-mediated nonallelic homologous recombination was identified as the cause of <i>F9</i> deletion in case 1; FoSTeS/MMBIR (Fork Stalling and Template Switching/microhomology-mediated break-induced replication) contributed to both <i>F9</i> deletion and tandem duplication observed in cases 2 and 3; BIR/MMBIR (break-induced replication/microhomology-mediated break-induced replication) mediated by the same pair of low-copy repeats results in similar duplication-triplication/inversion-duplication (DUP-TRP/INV-DUP) rearrangements in cases 4 and 5, leading to complete <i>F9</i> duplication and triplication, respectively. Large deletions involving the <i>F9</i> gene exhibit no apparent pattern, and the extra-hematologic clinical phenotypes require careful analysis of other genes within the deletion. The impact of complete <i>F9</i> duplication and triplication on FIX expression might depend on the integrity of the <i>F9</i> upstream sequence and the specific rearrangement mechanisms. Notably, DUP-TRP/INV-DUP rearrangements significantly elevate FIX activity and are closely associated with thrombotic phenotypes."

Was to determine the incidence of complications in a cohort of patients diagnosed with moderate and severe hemophilia A or B under treatment in a specialized institution. A retrospective study of a cohort of patients with replacement therapy for hemophilia A or B, evaluating treatment and complications between January/2012 and July/2019. Sociodemographic, clinical and disease management-related variables were extracted from the medical records. Time to inhibitor development and rate associated with bleeding and hospitalizations were evaluated. A total of 159 male patients were identified with hemophilia A (n = 140; 88.1%) and B (n = 19; 11.9%) with a mean follow-up of 5.9±2.3 years. The mean age was 23.6±16.1 years, hemophilia was reported as severe in 125 patients in hemophilia A (89.3%) and 13 patients in hemophilia B (68.4%). Primary prophylaxis was registered in 17.0% of patients, 44.7% secondary, and 38.3% tertiary, with recombinant factors (n = 84; 52.8%) followed by plasma derived factors (n = 75; 47.2%). The incidence of inhibitor development was 0.3 per 100 patients/year, with mean time to event of 509 days. The incidence of bleeding was 192 per 100 patients/year, especially at the joint (n = 99; 62.3%) and muscle (n = 25; 15.7%) level. The incidence of hospitalization was 3.7 per 100 patients/year. The most common complication was joint bleeding which was expected in this type of patients. Low proportion of patients developed factor inhibitors during the follow up."

    "abstract": "With the first gene therapies for haemophilia approved by the European Commission, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, it is important to consider the remaining unmet needs and challenges that may arise throughout patients' treatment journeys. We discuss existing unmet needs and important considerations prior to, during, and following haemophilia gene therapy treatment in the UK, and propose potential next steps. Key areas for attention are education, psychological support, and guidance on implementation. Strategies are urgently required to fulfil these needs. An immediate priority for information providers should be comprehensive education for people with haemophilia (PWH) and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Greater access to resources and training in psychological services will be required throughout the treatment pathway. More specific guidance is required to define the implementation model, criteria for accreditation, and responsibilities of care centres. Furthermore, PWH may revisit discussions with HCPs multiple times pre-infusion, thus the patient journey is unlikely to be linear. Consideration of these challenges, and of potential strategies to address them, will be integral to optimising the future success of this promising therapy."

    "abstract": "High upfront costs and long-term benefit uncertainties of gene therapies challenge Medicaid budgets, making value-based contracts a potential solution. However, value-based contract design is hindered by cost-offset uncertainty. The aim of this study is to determine actual cost-offsets for valoctocogene roxaparvovec (hemophilia A) and etranacogene dezaparvovec (hemophilia B) from Colorado Medicaid's perspective, defining payback periods and its uncertainty from the perspective of Colorado Medicaid. This cost analysis used 2018-2022 data from the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy & Financing to determine standard-of-care costs and employed cost simulation models to estimate the cost of Medicaid if patients switched to gene therapy versus if they did not. Data encompassed medical and pharmacy expenses of Colorado Medicaid enrollees. Identified cohorts were patients aged 18+ with ICD-10-CM codes D66 (hemophilia A) and D67 (hemophilia B). Severe hemophilia A required ≥ 6 claims per year for factor therapies or emicizumab, while moderate/severe hemophilia B necessitated ≥ 4 claims per year for factor therapies. Patients were included in the cohort in the year they first met the criteria and were subsequently retained in the cohort for the duration of the observation period. Standard-of-care included factor VIII replacement therapy/emicizumab for hemophilia A and factor IX replacement therapies for hemophilia B. Simulated patients received valoctocogene roxaparvovec or etranacogene dezaparvovec. Main measures were annual standard-of-care costs, cost offset, and breakeven time when using gene therapies. Colorado Medicaid's standard-of-care costs for hemophilia A and B were $426,000 [standard deviation (SD) $353,000] and $546,000 (SD $542,000) annually, respectively. Substituting standard-of-care with gene therapy for eligible patients yielded 8-year and 6-year average breakeven times, using real-world costs, compared with 5 years with published economic evaluation costs. Substantial variability in real-world standard-of-care costs resulted in a 48% and 59% probability of breakeven within 10 years for hemophilia A and B, respectively. Altering eligibility criteria significantly influenced breakeven time. Real-world data indicates substantial uncertainty and extended payback periods for gene therapy costs. Utilizing real-world data, Medicaid can negotiate value-based contracts to manage budget fluctuations, share risk with manufacturers, and enhance patient access to innovative treatments."

To explore HRQoL and PA in patients with moderate haemophilia A (MHA) and B (MHB). A cross-sectional, multicentre study covering patients with MHA and MHB in Sweden, Finland, and Norway. HRQoL was assessed with the EuroQoL 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D) form and PA with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire among participants aged ≥15 years. We report on 104 patients aged 15-84 years from the MoHem study. Overall, EQ-5D utility was .85 (median) (Q1-Q3 0.73-1.0) with corresponding visual analogue scale (VAS) 80 (70-90), which were similar regardless of treatment modality, FVIII/FIX:C, and MHA or MHB. Pain and mobility were most frequently affected dimensions. Utility (r = -.54), VAS (r = -.42), and PA (r = -.32) correlated negatively with arthropathy (HJHS). Only patients aged 41-50 years displayed lower utility (p = .02) and VAS (p < .01) than the Norwegian population norm. Patients on prophylaxis aged 35-54 years reported higher PA than those treated on-demand (p = .01). Haemophilic arthropathy had negative impact on HRQoL and PA in Nordic patients with moderate haemophilia. Middle-aged patients captured lower utility and VAS than observed in the general population. Tailored prophylaxis and improved joint health may influence positively on HRQoL and PA also in moderate haemophilia."

These reports evaluated clinical pharmacology, efficacy, safety, adverse events, warnings, and precautions. Valoctocogene phase 3 study in males (n = 134): 87% had factor VIII (FVIII) levels that at least met criteria for mild hemophilia. Etranacogene phase 3 study in males (n = 54): within 3 weeks of infusion, mean factor IX (FIX) levels had reached 26.8 IU/dL. Both therapies provided clinically and statistically significant decreases in bleeding events and prophylactic factor infusions. Most common adverse event was elevations in liver function tests that were treated with glucocorticoids. The endogenous production of clotting factors mimics physiological production while decreasing morbidity and mortality related to bleeding events similar to the effects of existing replacement strategies. Gene therapy was also shown to increase patient quality of life. Valoctocogene and etranacogene provide another treatment for selected patients with hemophilia. Treatment for the patient with hemophilia (gene therapy vs replacement strategy) must be personalized as new clinical data are published being cognizant of drug affordability."

Etranacogene dezaparvovec-drlb received FDA approval on 22 November 2022 for the treatment of HB in adult patients who use FIX prophylaxis therapy, have current or historical life-threatening hemorrhage, or have experienced repeated, serious spontaneous bleeding episodes. This drug profile discusses the safety and efficacy of etranacogene dezaparvovec-drlb in patients with HB. Etranacogene dezaparvovec-drlb therapy results in stable and sustained expression of near-normal to normal FIX levels in patients with HB regardless of neutralizing antibodies to AAV5 up to a titer of 678. Its use has led to significant reduction in bleeding and FIX prophylaxis. Etranacogene dezaparvovec-drlb was well tolerated; however, 17% of patients required corticosteroid therapy for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation.

To compare the efficacy of etranacogene dezaparvovec versus rIX-FP, rFIXFc and N9-GP using ITC, and support HOPE-B results. Data were leveraged from Phase 3 pivotal trials: HOPE-B, PROLONG-9FP, B-LONG and Paradigm 2. Annualised bleeding rates (ABR), spontaneous (AsBR) and joint (AjBR) bleeding rates, percentage of patients with no bleeds, and FIX consumption were assessed using inverse probability of treatment weighting and matching adjusted indirect comparisons. Etranacogene dezaparvovec demonstrated statistically significantly lower bleeding rates versus all comparators. Rate ratios for ABR, AsBR and AjBR versus rIX-FP were 0.19 (p < .0001), 0.08 (p < .0001) and 0.09 (p < .0001), respectively. Rate ratios for ABR, AsBR and AjBR versus rFIXFc were 0.14 (p < .0001), 0.13 (p = .0083) and 0.15 (p = .0111), respectively. Rate ratios for ABR and AsBR, versus N9-GP were 0.24 (p = .0231) and 0.13 (p = .0071), respectively. Etranacogene dezaparvovec demonstrated significantly higher percentage of patients with no bleeds versus rIX-FP and rFIXFc; odds ratios: 17.60 (p < .0001) and 5.65 (p = .0037), respectively. Etranacogene dezaparvovec resulted in significantly lower FIX consumption than all comparators.

With the entry of etranacogene dezaparvovec into the market, this review summarizes the treatment landscape in hemophilia B and discusses the current unknowns in the field. Gene therapy appears to be a feasible option for adults with severe and moderately severe hemophilia B. Etranacogene dezaparvovec enables most patients to reach stable factor IX (FIX) levels after a single intravenous infusion, eliminating the need for regular prophylaxis; thus, drastically reducing treatment burden and avoiding variable bleeding risk owing to fluctuating FIX activity levels. Efficacy of etranacogene dezaparvovec has been demonstrated even in the presence of preexisting neutralizing antibodies (up to a titer of 1:678), with a relative low risk of transaminitis and its associated potential loss of transgene expression. However, long-term data are required to ascertain the durability of FIX levels achieved and safety.

    "abstract": "Hereditary bleeding disorders may have a wide variety of clinical presentations ranging from mild mucosal and joint bleeding to severe central nervous system (CNS) bleeding, of which intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the most dreaded complication. In this review, we will discuss the pathophysiology of specific hereditary bleeding disorders, namely, hemophilia A, hemophilia B, and von Willebrand disease (vWD); their clinical manifestations with a particular emphasis on neurological complications; a brief overview of management strategies pertaining to neurological complications; and a review of literature guiding treatment strategies. ICH is the most significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hemophilia. Adequate control of bleeding with the administration of specific factors or blood products, identification of risk factors for bleeding, and maintaining optimal coagulant activity are essential for appropriately managing CNS bleeding complications in these patients. The administration of specific recombinant factors is tailored to a patient's pharmacokinetics and steady-state levels. During acute bleeding episodes, initial factor activity should be maintained between 80 and 100%. Availability of monoclonal antibody Emicizumab has revolutionized prophylactic therapies in patients with hemophilia. Management of ICH in patients with vWD involves using plasma-derived factor concentrates, recombinant von Willebrand factor, and supportive antifibrinolytic agents individualized to the type and severity of vWD. Hemophilia and vWD are the most common hereditary bleeding disorders that can predispose patients to life-threatening CNS complications-intracranial bleeds, intraspinal bleeding, and peripheral nerve syndromes. Early care coordination with a hematologist can help develop an effective prophylactic regimen to avoid life-threatening bleeding complications in these patients. Further research is needed to evaluate using emicizumab as an on-demand treatment option for acute bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia."

    "abstract": "Remarkably, it has been 40 years since the isolation of the 2 genes involved in hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB), encoding clotting factor (F) VIII (FVIII) and FIX, respectively. Over the years, these advances led to the development of purified recombinant protein factors that are free of contaminating viruses from human pooled plasma for hemophilia treatments, reducing the morbidity and mortality previously associated with human plasma-derived clotting factors. These discoveries also paved the way for modified factors that have increased plasma half-lives. Importantly, more recent advances have led to the development and Food and Drug Administration approval of a hepatocyte-targeted, adeno-associated viral vector-mediated gene transfer approach for HA and HB. However, major concerns regarding the durability and safety of HA gene therapy remain to be resolved. Compared with FIX, FVIII is a much larger protein that is prone to misfolding and aggregation in the endoplasmic reticulum and is poorly secreted by the mammalian cells. Due to the constraint of the packaging capacity of adeno-associated viral vector, B-domain deleted FVIII rather than the full-length protein is used for HA gene therapy. Like full-length FVIII, B-domain deleted FVIII misfolds and is inefficiently secreted. Its expression in hepatocytes activates the cellular unfolded protein response, which is deleterious for hepatocyte function and survival and has the potential to drive hepatocellular carcinoma. This review is focused on our current understanding of factors limiting FVIII secretion and the potential pathophysiological consequences upon expression in hepatocytes."

    "abstract": "Congenital coagulopathies have, throughout the history of medicine, been a focus of scientific study and of great interest as they constitute an alteration of one of the most important and conserved pathways of evolution. The first therapeutic strategies developed to address them were aimed at restoring the blood components lost during hemorrhage by administering whole blood or plasma. Later on, the use of cryoprecipitates was a significant breakthrough as it made it possible to decrease the volumes of blood infused. In the 1970' and 80', clotting factor concentrates became the treatment and, from the 1990's to the present day, recombinant factors -with increasingly longer half-lives- have taken over as the treatment of choice for certain coagulopathies in a seamless yet momentous transition from biological to biotechnological drugs. The beginning of this century, however, saw the emergence of new advanced (gene and cell) treatments, which are currently transforming the therapeutic landscape. The possibility to use cells and viruses as well as specific or bispecific antibodies as medicines is likely to spark a revolution in the world of pharmacology where therapies will be individualized and have long-term effects. Specifically, attention is nowadays focused on the development of gene editing strategies, chiefly those based on CRISPR/Cas technology. Rare coagulopathies such as hemophilia A and B, or even ultra-rare ones such as factor V deficiency, could be among those deriving the greatest benefit from these new developments."

    "abstract": "Haplotype-based noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) is applicable for various recessive single-gene disorders in proband families. However, a comprehensive exploration of critical factors influencing the assay performance, such as fetal fraction, informative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) count, and recombination events, has yet to be performed. It is critical to identify key factors affecting NIPD performance, including its accuracy and success rate, and their impact on clinical diagnostics to guide clinical practice. We conducted a prospective study, recruiting 219 proband families with singleton pregnancies at risk for eight recessive single-gene disorders (Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, phenylketonuria, methylmalonic acidemia, hemophilia A, hemophilia B, non-syndromic hearing loss, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia) at 7-14 weeks of gestation. Haplotype-based NIPD was performed by evaluating the relative haplotype dosage (RHDO) in maternal circulation, and the results were validated via invasive prenatal diagnosis or newborn follow-ups. Among the 219 families, the median gestational age at first blood draw was 8<sup>+5</sup> weeks. Initial testing succeeded for 190 families and failed for 29 due to low fetal fraction (16), insufficient informative SNPs (9), and homologous recombination near pathogenic variation (4). Among low fetal fraction families, successful testing was achieved for 11 cases after a redraw, while 5 remained inconclusive. Test failures linked to insufficient informative SNPs correlated with linkage disequilibrium near the genes, with F8 and MMUT exhibiting the highest associated failure rates (14.3% and 25%, respectively). Homologous recombination was relatively frequent around the DMD and SMN1 genes (8.8% and 4.8%, respectively) but led to detection failure in only 44.4% (4/9) of such cases. All NIPD results from the 201 successful families were consistent with invasive diagnostic findings or newborn follow-up. Fetal fraction, informative SNPs count, and homologous recombination are pivotal to NIPD performance. Redrawing blood effectively improves the success rate for low fetal fraction samples. However, informative SNPs count and homologous recombination rates vary significantly across genes, necessitating careful consideration in clinical practice. We have designed an in silico method based on linkage disequilibrium data to predict the number of informative SNPs. This can identify genomic regions where there might be an insufficient number of SNPs, thereby guiding panel design. With these factors properly accounted for, NIPD is highly accurate and reliable."

However, we still need to understand more about the properties of FXa-storing platelets and how dietary factors affect them. We created transgenic mice called 2bFXa-HB, which had stable expression and storage of FXa in their platelets, resulting in the alleviation of the bleeding disorder in these mice. Even after inducing anti-factor IX (FIX) inhibitors in 2bFXa-HB mice, the hemorrhage phenotype could still be rescued by the expression of FXa. The activation capacity of 2bFXa-HB platelets remained unchanged, and there were no signs of elevated thrombotic risk in these mice. In an acute alcohol exposure mouse model, a single administration of alcohol reduced both the number of platelets and their activation capacity, as well as impaired coagulation function. However, it did not increase the markers of thrombotic risk in either 2bFXa-HB or HB mice. These results suggest that FXa storage in platelets is safe and effective for treatment of HB, but alcohol could impair the therapeutic effect of FXa-containing platelets."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B (HB) is caused by an inherited deficiency of plasma coagulation factor IX (FIX). Approximately 60% of pediatric patients with HB possess a severe form of FIX deficiency (<1% FIX activity). Treatment typically requires replacement therapy through the administration of FIX. However, exogenous FIX has a limited functional half-life, and the natural anticoagulant protein S (PS) inhibits activated FIX (FIXa). PS ultimately limits thrombin formation, which limits plasma coagulation. This regulation of FIXa activity by PS led us to test whether inhibiting PS would extend the functional half-life of FIX and thereby prolong FIX-based HB therapy. We assayed clotting times and thrombin generation to measure the efficacy of a PS antibody for increasing FIX activity in commercially obtained plasma and plasma from pediatric patients with HB. We included 11 pediatric patients who lacked additional comorbidities and coagulopathies. In vivo, we assessed thrombus formation in HB mice in the presence of the FIXa ± PS antibody. We found an accelerated rate of clotting in the presence of PS antibody. Similarly, the peak thrombin formed was significantly greater in the presence of the PS antibody, even in plasma from patients with severe HB. Furthermore, HB mice injected with PS antibody and FIX had a 4.5-fold higher accumulation of fibrin at the thrombus induction site compared with mice injected with FIX alone. Our findings imply that a PS antibody would be a valuable adjunct to increase the effectiveness of FIX replacement therapy in pediatric patients who have mild, moderate, and severe HB."

    "title": "Congenital Bleeding Disorders and COVID-19-A Systematic Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Hypercoagulability is a prominent feature of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and can lead to fatal consequences. Although the impact of COVID-19 on several disorders is well-established, its effect on congenital bleeding disorders (CBDs) is not well-documented. To address this ambiguity, a systematic review was conducted on the available studies to determine the impact of COVID-19 and vaccination aimed to prevent COVID-19 on patients with CBDs. We performed a systematic literature review using relevant keywords and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol. We conducted our search on the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases until July 2023. Out of 31 included studies, 12 case series covering 770 patients with CBD and COVID-19 were further analyzed. The majority of the patients had hemophilia A (<i>n</i> = 352, ∼46%) or hemophilia B (<i>n</i> = 74, ∼10%), while the remaining patients had von Willebrand disease (<i>n</i> = 43, 5.6%) or rare bleeding disorders (n = 27, 3.5%). A total of 25 deaths (3.2%) and 22 intensive care unit admissions (2.8%) were recorded. Bleeding complications were reported in the majority of the 12 case series (<i>n</i> = 7, 58.3%) and in most of the case reports (<i>n</i> = 8, ∼57%), while thrombotic complications were only reported in two studies (16.6%). The mortality rate ranged from 0% in five studies (41.6%) to 5.7% and the rate of hospitalization ranged from 0 to 40%. Bleeding complications were reported in a range of 0 to 81%, while the thrombotic complication rate in one study was 6.9%. The mortality rate varied from 0 to 5.7%, and the hospitalization rate ranged from 0 to 40%. Bleeding complications were reported in a range of 0 to 81%, while the rate of thrombotic complications in one study was 6.9%. Vaccination was reported in five case series, which included 821 patients with CBDs with the majority having hemophilia A (<i>n</i> = 479; 67.2%) and hemophilia B (<i>n</i> = 85; ∼12%). The most frequently reported side effects were myalgia (6.5%), flu-like symptoms (4.8%), fever (4.7%), and headache (4%). COVID-19 in patients with CBDs appears to provoke thrombotic complications and bleeding events more frequently, as well as a higher rate of hospitalization, which may be partially due to the increased risk of bleeding events. Although it seems that patients with CBD have lower mortality rates, further studies are necessary to fully understand this, especially considering comorbidities and low number of available studies."

    "abstract": "With population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling more readily available and PK-guided prophylaxis endorsed by current hemophilia guidelines, we conducted a systematic review to summarize current evidence in the literature. To assess the efficacy of PK-guided compared with non-PK-guided prophylaxis. We did not restrict inclusion to specific study design labels and included all studies consisting of at least one distinct cohort arm receiving PK-guided prophylaxis. We searched the following databases from inception to date of search: MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the EU Clinical Trial Register. Following title, abstract, and full-text screening conducted independently by 2 review authors, we summarized studies qualitatively and synthesized included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) quantitatively by fitting random-effects models. Search of databases on February 3, 2023, yielded 25 studies fitting our inclusion criteria. Of those, only 2 RCTs and 17 nonrandomized studies included a standard prophylaxis comparator group. Furthermore, risk of bias in the latter was substantial, primarily due to before-after study designs and retrospective comparator groups. Thus, nonrandomized studies were only presented qualitatively. A random-effects meta-analysis of the 2 identified RCT remained inconclusive with regards to bleeding outcomes (ratio of means, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.85-1.56) and factor consumption (ratio of means, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.58-1.18). Evidence in the literature suggesting a clinical benefit of PK-guided over standard fixed-dose prophylaxis was weak and mainly found in nonrandomized studies limited by lack of concurrent controls, heterogeneity in outcome reporting, small sample sizes, and high risk of bias."

    "title": "Characterization of a recombinant factor IX molecule fused to coagulation factor XIII-B subunit.",
    "abstract": "Severe haemophilia B (HB) is characterized by spontaneous bleeding episodes, mostly into joints. Recurrent bleeds lead to progressive joint destruction called haemophilic arthropathy. The current concept of prophylaxis aims at maintaining the FIX level >3-5 IU/dL, which is effective at reducing the incidence of haemophilic arthropathy. Extended half-life FIX molecules make it easier to achieve these target trough levels compared to standard FIX concentrates. We previously reported that the fusion of a recombinant FIX (rFIX) to factor XIII-B (FXIIIB) subunit prolonged the half-life of the rFIX-LXa-FXIIIB fusion molecule in mice and rats 3.9- and 2.2-fold, respectively, compared with rFIX-WT. However, the mechanism behind the extended half-life was not known. Mass spectrometry and ITC were used to study interactions of rFIX-LXa-FXIIIB with albumin. Pharmacokinetic analyses in fibrinogen-KO and FcRn-KO mice were performed to evaluate the effect of albumin and fibrinogen on in-vivo half-life of rFIX-LXa-FXIIIB. Finally saphenous vein bleeding model was used to assess in-vivo haemostatic activity of rFIX-LXa-FXIIIB. We report here the key interactions that rFIX-LXa-FXIIIB may have in plasma are with fibrinogen and albumin which may mediate its prolonged half-life. In addition, using the saphenous vein bleeding model, we demonstrate that rFIX-FXIIIB elicits functional clot formation that is indistinguishable from that of rFIX-WT."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia B (HB) is an X-linked hereditary bleeding disorder characterized by coagulation factor IX (FIX) deficiency. To improve the quality of life of patients and adherence to treatment, recombinant factor concentrates modified to extend their half-life have been developed, called extended half-life factors (EHL: extended half-life). Nonacog beta pegol (N9-GP) is a glycopegylated recombinant human FIX molecule that has a half-life of 93 h with a single dose and has shown a higher recovery percentage than other molecules. To diagnose and monitor the treatment of haemophiliac patients, FIX activity is determined with the one-stage clotting assay (OSA) and/or the chromogenic assay. The objective of this work, carried out in three centres, was to measure the recovery of N9-PG with 10 different activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) reagents on three platforms, in samples spiked in vitro with N9-GP, at four different concentration levels. It was measured the recovery of N9-GP with 10 different APTT reagents (polyphenol, ellagic acid, silice dioxide, colloidal silica as APTT activator on three platforms, in sample spiked in vitro with N9-GP. The results show heterogeneity in the activity of N9-GP measured by OSA with the different APTT reagents when the calibrations were performed with the specific calibrator of each coagulometer. A recovery percentage between 87% and 108% was obtained only with polyphenol and ellagic acid as activator in the three platforms evaluated. The other reagents studied overestimate or underestimate, with no clear profile. When a calibration curve was performed with a calibrator prepared from the N9-GP vial, all APTT reagents met the established recovery requirement. APTT reagents with polyphenol or ellagic acid as activator would be the only ones appropriate when using the commercially available OSA with specific calibrator to monitor patients treated with N9-GP."

This manuscript summarizes hurdles encountered and obstacles overcome in the development of successful adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors for hemophilia B and for an inherited retinal dystrophy caused by mutations in the <i>RPE65</i> gene. In the case of hemophilia B, careful analysis of the first unsuccessful attempts led to the realization that the human immune response to AAV vectors was preventing durable expression; elucidation of the response to the recombinant virion led to strategies that enabled successful long-lasting gene transfer. For <i>RPE65</i> deficiency, a key to success was development and validation of a novel clinical endpoint for a disease that previously lacked a pharmacologic treatment."

Monitoring perioperative factor levels guides dosing to maintain adequate levels for hemostatic control. We report prospectively collected post hoc surgical data in patients with hemophilia B who underwent major surgery with extended half-life recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) in phase 3 studies (B-LONG/Kids B-LONG and B-YOND). Achieved FIX plasma levels were described for those who underwent major surgeries with ≥1 peak and/or predose FIX assessment available on the day of surgery (Day 0 [D0]) from the central laboratory. Dosing, injection frequency, adverse events, and hemostatic responses were assessed. Two representative cases were described further including blood loss, transfusions, and concomitant medication assessment. Of 35 major surgeries, 17 (<i>N</i> = 16 subjects) with sufficient FIX measurements were included in this analysis; 13 of 17 surgeries were orthopedic. On D0, a median loading (preoperative) dose of 101.1 International Units (IU)/kg/injection achieved a median peak FIX of 103.3 IU/dL. Across postoperative Days 1 to 3, 4 to 6, and 7 to 14, the median predose levels were 75.1 IU/dL with 1 injection/d, 71.6 IU/dL with 0 to 1 injection/d, and 43.2 IU/dL with 0 to 1 injection/d, respectively. Hemostasis was rated excellent (14 of 16) or good (2 of 16) across surgeries. Both case studies (knee arthroscopy and ankle fusion) illustrate measured FIX levels with rFIXFc. The aggregate analysis and representative cases of major surgeries demonstrate that rFIXFc can achieve FIX levels for effective hemostasis during invasive high-risk procedures."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vectors has become a realistic therapeutic option for hemophilia. We examined the potential of a novel engineered liver-tropic AAV3B-based vector, AAV.GT5, for hemophilia B gene therapy. <i>In vitro</i> transduction with AAV.GT5 in human hepatocytes was more than 100 times higher than with AAV-Spark100, another bioengineered vector used in a clinical trial. However, liver transduction following intravenous injection of these vectors was similar in mice with a humanized liver and in macaques. This discrepancy was due to the low recovery and short half-life of AAV.GT5 in blood, depending on the positive charge of the heparin-binding site in the capsid. Bypassing systemic clearance with the intra-hepatic vascular administration of AAV.GT5, but not AAV-Spark100, enhanced liver transduction in pigs and macaques. AAV.GT5 did not develop neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in two of four animals, while AAV-Spark100 induced serotype-specific NAbs in all macaques tested (4 of 4). The NAbs produced after AAV-Spark100 administration were relatively serotype specific, and challenge with AAV.GT5 through the hepatic artery successfully boosted liver transduction in one animal previously administered AAV-Spark100. In summary, AAV.GT5 showed different vector kinetics and NAb induction compared with AAV-Spark100, and intra-hepatic vascular administration may minimize the vector dose required and vector dissemination."

This ambispective study aims to report a real-world experience with rIX-FP in a Spanish centre with PWHB who switched from SHL-FIX or began prophylaxis with rIX-FP. Five PWHB were included in this study, Four PTP switched to rIX-FP with prophylaxis every 7 days whilst one PUP started with an every-14-days regimen. 3 PTPs extended their dosing intervals to every 14 days or every 21 days. In all PTPs, median annualized spontaneous and joint bleeding rates were maintained at 0.00 and median (range) of ABR was 0.92 (0.00-2.77) after switch to rIX-FP. Mean trough level with previous product was 3.68% (<i>SD</i> = 2.06), while it was 7.08% (<i>SD</i> = 3) with all rIX-FP dosing intervals. After switching to rIX-FP, all PTP reduced their annual infusion rate between 50 and 84% and their annual FIX consumption by 61% (59-67%). This is the first reported real-world experience with albutrepenonacog alfa in a small cohort in Spain and demonstrates good bleeding control together with a reduction of the infusion rate, factor consumption and higher through factor level than previous treatment."

    "title": "Hemophilia Gene Therapy: The End of the Beginning?",
    "abstract": "Extensive preclinical research over the past 30 years has culminated in the recent regulatory approval of several gene therapy products for hemophilia. Based on the efficacy and safety data in a recently conducted phase III clinical trial, <i>Roctavian</i><sup>®</sup> (<i>valoctocogene roxaparvovec</i>), an adeno-associated viral (AAV5) vector expressing a B domain deleted factor VIII (FVIII) complementary DNA, was approved by the European Commission and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with severe hemophilia A. In addition, <i>Hemgenix</i><sup>®</sup> (<i>etranacogene dezaparvovec</i>) was also recently approved by the European Medicines Agency and the FDA for the treatment of patients with severe hemophilia B. This product is based on an AAV5 vector expressing a hyper-active factor IX (FIX) transgene (FIX-Padua) transgene. All AAV-based phase III clinical trials to date show a significant increase in FVIII or FIX levels in the majority of treated patients, consistent with a substantial decrease in bleeding episodes and a concomitant reduction in factor usage obviating the need for factor prophylaxis in most patients. However, significant interpatient variability remains that is not fully understood. Moreover, most patients encountered short-term asymptomatic liver inflammation that was treated by immune suppression with corticosteroids or other immune suppressants. In all phase III trials to date, FIX expression has appeared relatively more stable than FVIII, though individual patients also had prolonged FVIII expression. Whether lifelong expression of clotting factors can be realized after gene therapy requires longer follow-up studies. Further preclinical development of next-generation gene editing technologies offers new prospects for the development of a sustained cure for hemophilia, not only in adults, but ultimately in children with hemophilia too."

    "title": "Clinical Profile of Adult Hemophilia Patients with Special Reference to FISH and WFHPE Score: An Observational Cross-sectional Study.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive inherited disease affecting the coagulation pathway due to congenital deficiencies in either factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B). The clinical assessment of a patient's functional ability and the state of joint conditions is carried out by the clinicians by administering questionnaires namely the Gilbert or the World Federation of Hemophilia Physical Examination (WFH-PE) score for joint condition and Functional Independence Score in Hemophilia (FISH) for joint function. Here, we have studied the clinical profile of adult hemophilia patients with the short- and long-term complications of the disease. Additionally, the FISH score and the Gilbert score are calculated to assess functional independence and joint condition, respectively. The scores were also compared according to the severity of the disease. An observational cross-sectional study of 40 adult hemophilia patients was carried out in Sir Sayajirao General Hospital and Medical College, Baroda, Gujarat, India, over a period of 1 year. Data regarding age, sex, and complications associated with the disease were collected in the form of a questionnaire. The overall mean and standard deviation (SD) of FISH and Gilbert scores were calculated and correlated with the severity of the disease. The majority of cases (19) were between 20 and 40 years, and most (24) were diagnosed in childhood. All the subjects were male and all except one had hemophilia A. Family history was seen in only half of the cases. Nine had mild, 20 had moderate, and 11 had severe disease. Around 46% of the subjects had joint arthropathy with the knee joint most affected (60%) followed by the ankle (22.5%). The mean FISH score was 27.132 ± 4.0691 with a minimum score of 15 in severe disease suggesting more functional deficit. The average Gilbert score was 7.4 ± 2.985 with a maximum score of 14 in severe disease suggesting more joint damage Interpretations and conclusion: All subjects were male and except one all had hemophilia A. Majority were between 20 and 40 years but most were diagnosed before 10 years of age and only 50% had positive family history. Arthropathy is the most common complication with the knee joint being most affected. Majority of mild hemophiliacs achieved a maximum FISH score denoting maximum functional capacity. Compared to existing studies, our study showed better FISH scores in moderate hemophiliacs suggesting more functional independence. While comparing Gilbert's score to other studies, moderate and severe hemophiliacs in our study showed less joint damage."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B (HB) is a bleeding disorder characterized by coagulation factor (F) IX (FIX) deficiency. The current standard-of-care for severe HB is prophylaxis with long-term repetitive intravenous (i.v.) infusions of recombinant FIX (rFIX) with standard half-life or extended half-life. Unmet needs remain regarding the development of non-invasive administration routes for coagulation factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of intranasal delivery (IND) of rFIX and rFIX fused to Fc fragment (rFIX-Fc) in mice. Drops of rFIX and rFIX-Fc were deposited in the nostrils of wild-type, FcRn knock-out, FcRn humanized, and FIX knock-out mice. rFIX mucosal uptake was evaluated by measuring plasma FIX antigen and FIX activity (FIX:C) levels, and by performing histologic analysis of the nasal mucosa following IND. After IND, both rFIX and rFIX-Fc were equally delivered to the blood compartment, irrespective of the mouse strain studied, mostly through a passive mechanism of transportation across the mucosal barrier, independent of FcRn receptor. Both plasma FIX antigen and FIX:C activity levels increased following IND in FIX knock-out mice. This proof-of-concept study describes evidence supporting the nasal route as an alternative to FIX i.v. infusion for the treatment of HB."

In patients with hemophilia A or B, inhibition of TFPI is an alternative therapeutic approach that augments the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Marstacimab is an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes TFPI and is being evaluated as a prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in patients with severe hemophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors (antibodies against coagulation factors). However, the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of marstacimab may be affected by the induction of antidrug antibody (ADA) responses. Here, we describe the evolution and validation of three quasi-quantitative electrochemiluminescence-based methods to detect marstacimab ADAs, starting from their use in a first-in-human phase 1 study to their use in phase 2 and 3 clinical studies of patients with severe hemophilia. For all three methods, validation criteria evaluated the performance of the assays in screening and confirmatory cut points, precision, selectivity, drug tolerance, target interference, and stability. Additional criteria for validation were dilution linearity (Methods 1 and 2) and low positive control concentration, prozone effect, plate homogeneity, and robustness (Method 3). The three methods met validation criteria and are a potentially valuable tool in detecting the induction of marstacimab ADAs during treatment in patients with hemophilia."

Transition programs help to prepare adolescents for this transfer and prevent declining treatment adherence. Evaluating transition readiness may identify areas for improvement. Assess transition readiness among Dutch adolescents and young adults with haemophilia, determine factors associated with transition readiness, and identify areas of improvement in transition programs. All Dutch adolescents and young adults aged 12-25 years with haemophilia were invited to participate in a nationwide questionnaire study. Transition readiness was assessed using multiple-choice questions and was defined as being ready or almost ready for transition. Potential factors associated with transition readiness were investigated, including: socio-demographic and disease-related factors, treatment adherence, health-related quality of life, and self-efficacy. Data of 45 adolescents and 84 young adults with haemophilia (47% with severe haemophilia) were analyzed. Transition readiness increased with age, from 39% in 12-14 year-olds to 63% in 15-17 year-olds. Nearly all post-transition young adults (92%, 77/84) reported they were ready for transition. Transition readiness was associated with treatment adherence, as median VERITAS-Pro treatment adherence scores were worse in patients who were not ready (17, IQR 9-29), compared to those ready for transition (11, IQR 9-16). Potential improvements were identified: getting better acquainted with the adult treatment team prior to transition and information on managing healthcare costs. Nearly all post-transition young adults reported they were ready for transition. Improvements were identified regarding team acquaintance and preparation for managing healthcare costs."

    "abstract": "Bypassing agents (BPAs) are used to treat acute bleeding episodes, manage bleeding during perioperative care, and prophylactically minimize bleed occurrence in persons with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors (PwHABI). However, the effectiveness of BPAs that have been prescribed for the last several decades can be variable, motivating the development of a new recombinant activated factor VII, eptacog beta. This review covers key eptacog beta findings from phase 1b and phase 3 (PERSEPT) clinical trials, which formed the basis for its regulatory approval to treat PwHABI ages 12 and older. Descriptions of eptacog beta structure and glycosylation profile, mechanism of action, preclinical study results, and cost analyses are also presented. PwHABI have had only two options for bleed treatment for the past several decades. With its distinct glycosylation profile, eptacog beta offers a novel therapy aiming to improve upon BPAs currently in use, providing an option with more than one dosing regimen and a rapid response that allows most bleeds to be treated with just one dose. This has become particularly important given the use of subcutaneous medications (e.g., emicizumab) for prophylaxis of bleeding. Clinicians should consider eptacog beta as a BPA for all PwHABI."

    "abstract": "Extended half-life recombinant FIX (rFIX) molecules have been generated to reduce the dosing burden and increase the protection of patients with hemophilia B. Clinical pharmacology studies with recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) report a similar initial peak plasma recovery to that of rFIX, but with a larger volume of distribution. Although the pegylation of N9-GP results in a larger plasma recovery, there is a smaller volume of distribution, suggesting less extravasation of the latter drug. In this study, we set out to compare the biodistribution and tissue localization of rFIX, rFIXFc, and glycoPEGylated rFIX in a hemophilia B mouse model. Radiolabeled rFIX, rFIXFc, and rFIX-GP were employed in in vivo single-photon emission computed tomography imaging (SPECT/CT), microautoradiography (MARG), and histology to assess the distribution of FIX reagents over time. Immediately following injection, vascularized tissues demonstrated intense signal irrespective of FIX reagent. rFIX and rFIXFc were retained in joint and muscle areas through 5 half-lives, unlike rFIX-GP (assessed by SPECT). MARG and immunohistochemistry showed FIX agents localized at blood vessels among tissues, including liver, spleen, and kidney. Microautoradiographs, as well as fluorescent-labeled images of knee joint areas, demonstrated retention over time of FIX signal at the trabecular area of bone. Data indicate that rFIXFc is similar to rFIX in that it distributes outside the plasma compartment and is retained in certain tissues over time, while also retained at higher plasma levels. Overall, data suggest that Fc fusion does not impede the extravascular distribution of FIX."

We aimed to investigate the clinical course and prognosis of patients with HCC and haemophilia. Twenty-two patients with haemophilia, who were initially diagnosed with HCC between 2003 and 2021, were included. Their clinical courses and prognoses were retrospectively analysed. The results were compared with those of the 24th Nationwide Follow-up Survey of Primary Liver Cancer. All 22 patients were male; of these, 20 patients had haemophilia A, and 2 had haemophilia B. The mean age of diagnosis was 63 years (range 45-78 years) which is lower than the mean of 72 years reported in the Nationwide Survey. The mean diameter of the largest tumour was 30 mm (range 11-70 mm), and 18 tumours (82%) were solitary at the initial diagnosis. Standard treatments for HCC were performed in all patients. Sixty-one transarterial chemoembolisation, 28 RFA, 10 hepatectomies, and 2 radiation treatments were performed, and molecular-targeted agents were administered to 5 patients during their clinical courses. No deaths were associated with complications of HCC treatments. The median survival time after initial treatment was 6.4 years (range 0.9-18.7 years) which did not differ much from the median survival time of 5.8 years in the Nationwide Survey. Standard treatment for HCC could improve the prognosis of patients with HCC and haemophilia."

Understanding the clinical spectrum and diagnostic approach will help with the design of measures to address the situation in these places. The primary objective of this study was to examine the clinicopathological parameters of haemophiliac patients. From the departmental archive, a thorough history of each patient was retrieved, including values of bleeding time, prothrombin time, activated partial prothrombin time, and percentage of specific factor activity. Out of a total of 385 cases over the period of six years, 86.75% were classified as haemophilia A and 13.25% of cases were diagnosed as haemophilia B. In terms of the severity of the disease, 44.93% were classified as severe, 42.08% as moderate, and 12.99% as mild. Joint bleeding was the first and most typical clinical manifestation of the disease, accounting for 34.80% of cases, followed by ecchymosis (23.12%), post-traumatic bleeding (12.73%), epistaxis (12.20%), and gum bleeding (8.05%). 1.56% of patients had a positive screening test for the hepatitis C virus, followed by 1.30% for HIV and 0.78% for hepatitis B surface antigen. In the presence of joint bleeding, ecchymosis, and post-traumatic bleeding in an otherwise healthy individual, a clinician should be alerted to the possibility that the patient has haemophilia and should request a work-up for the bleeding disorder."

Real-world data were obtained from 37 patients (median age: 16 years, range 2-71) of whom 14 were aged <12 years. Observed FIX activity levels were significantly higher than levels predicted using the published model, with a median prediction error of -48.8%. The new model showed a lower median prediction error (3.4%) and better described rFIX-Fc PK, especially for children aged <12 years. In the new model, an increase in age was correlated with a decrease in clearance (P < .01). The published population PK model significantly underpredicted FIX activity levels. The new model better describes rFIX-Fc PK, especially for children aged <12 years. This study underlines the necessity to strive for representative population PK models, thereby avoiding extrapolation outside the studied population."

    "abstract": "Extended half-life (EHL) factor VIII and IX concentrates as prophylaxis against bleeds have been available to selected persons with haemophilia (PWH) in Australia since March 2018. Preliminary analysis of switching to EHL demonstrated increased treatment adherence, fewer injections and improved bleeding outcomes. To characterise clinical practices regarding the use of EHL in Australia, to further evaluate treatment regimens and bleeding outcomes, and to analyse the influence of EHL product pharmacokinetics on clinical decision-making. A national, retrospective study was conducted using the Australian Bleeding Disorders Registry (ABDR). Patients on EHL products during the entire 2019 calendar year were included for analysis. A complete and validated dataset of 174 PWH was analysed, 115 Haemophilia A (HA) and 59 Haemophilia B (HB). Adherence to EHL therapy was 85.7% in HA and 87.2% in HB. About 63.5% of HA and 64.4% of HB PWH reported zero spontaneous bleeds over 12months. Ankles were the most frequent spontaneous bleed site. Approximately one-third patients underwent dose adjustments, with most frequent reasons being pharmacokinetics, body weight change and breakthrough bleeds. About 19.5% of PWH had target joint history, with spontaneous bleeds reported in 58% of that cohort on EHL. Multivariate regression showed significant impact of non-adherence, target joint history and short half-life on spontaneous bleeds in the HA cohort; however only short half-life had significant impact in the HB cohort. EHL usage in Australia shows excellent treatment adherence and bleeding outcomes. This study affirms the use and value of widely available population-based pharmacokinetics as a clinical tool."

    "abstract": "Blood platelets have unique storage and delivery capabilities. Platelets play fundamental roles in hemostasis, inflammatory reactions, and immune responses. Beyond their functions, platelets have been used as a target for gene therapy. Platelet-targeted gene therapy aims to deliver a sustained expression of neo-protein in vivo by genetically modifying the target cells, resulting in a cure for the disease. Even though there has been substantial progress in the field of gene therapy, the potential development of immune responses to transgene products or vectors remains a significant concern. Of note, multiple preclinical studies using platelet-specific lentiviral gene delivery to hematopoietic stem cells in hemophilia have demonstrated promising results with therapeutic levels of neo-protein that rescue the hemorrhagic bleeding phenotype and induce antigen-specific immune tolerance. Further studies using ovalbumin as a surrogate protein for platelet gene therapy have shown robust antigen-specific immune tolerance induced via peripheral clonal deletions of antigen-specific CD4- and CD8-T effector cells and induction of antigen-specific regulatory T (Treg) cells. This review discusses platelet-targeted gene therapy, focusing on immune tolerance induction."

    "abstract": "Extended half-life factor IX (FIX) products have revolutionized prophylactic treatment for patients with hemophilia B as patients maintain protective FIX levels with minimal occurrence of spontaneous bleeding. rIX-FP is an extended half-life FIX product that allows prolonged dosing intervals. To assess individualized and prolonged prophylactic dosing interval up to 21 days in adult patients (≥18 years) with hemophilia B in the rIX-FP clinical trial program. Patients who were included in the PROLONG-9FP phase III study or who received rIX-FP during surgery could continue into an extension study for long-term assessment. Patients began 7-day prophylaxis with rIX-FP, and after 6 months, they could extend dosing intervals to every 14 days. In the extension study, adult patients could switch to a 21-day regimen if well-controlled on a 14-day regimen. Eleven patients transitioned from a 7-day prophylaxis regimen to a 14-day regimen and finally to a 21-day regimen, 5 of whom were treated on demand at enrollment. Patients who switched to the 21-day regimen had a median annualized spontaneous bleeding rate of 0.0 across all regimens. The median observed FIX activity remained >5 IU/dL until day 21 after a single 100-IU/kg dose of rIX-FP. After 6 months on the 21-day regimen, 2 patients switched back to a 14-day regimen. No inhibitors, anaphylactic reactions, or thromboembolic events occurred. Patients who are well controlled on a once-weekly regimen might extend their treatment interval to 14 days, and in adult patients, further extension to up to 21 days (100 IU/kg) may be considered."

    "abstract": "For patients with hemophilia B, extended half-life factor IX (FIX) products are available for prophylaxis and for treating bleeds. Different methods are used to extend the half-lives of recombinant FIX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) and nonacog beta pegol (N9-GP). This affects their biodistribution and plasma FIX levels, although differences do not always correlate with clinical outcomes. A matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) of prophylaxis with rFIXFc and N9-GP was performed, based on licensed dosing in the European Union. Combined rFIXFc data from the weekly and individualized interval prophylaxis arms of the B-LONG clinical trial, and N9-GP data from the 40 IU/kg once-weekly prophylaxis arm of PARADIGM 2 were used in a MAIC. Individual patient data for rFIXFc (n=87) were matched to aggregated data for N9-GP (n=29). Estimated annualized bleeding rates (ABRs) for rFIXFc were recalculated using a Poisson regression model with adjustment for over-dispersion, and compared with ABRs reported for N9-GP, using incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI). There was no evidence of significant differences in estimated ABRs between prophylaxis with rFIXFc and N9-GP. Analysis of pooled rFIXFc weekly and interval-adjusted dosing compared with N9-GP 40 IU/kg once weekly produced estimated ABRs of 2.59 versus 2.51 (IRR 1.03; 95% CI 0.56-1.89), as well as 1.34 versus 1.22 (IRR 1.10; 95% CI 0.42-2.91) and 1.13 versus 1.29 (IRR 0.88; 95% CI 0.47-1.63) for overall, spontaneous, and traumatic bleeding events, respectively. The study did not reveal any significant differences in the efficacy of rFIXFc and N9-GP prophylaxis. Given differences in trough levels (rFIXFc dosing was targeted to achieve a trough 1-3 IU/dL above baseline versus a reported estimated N9-GP mean trough of 27.3 IU/dL), interpreting plasma FIX levels as potential surrogate efficacy markers requires consideration of compound-specific pharmacokinetic profiles."

Hence, this study aimed to analyze the variant spectrum of <i>F8</i> and <i>F9</i> genes in Arab hemophilia patients. Molecular genetic and sequencing studies were performed on a cohort of 135 Saudi hemophilia patients. Out of all screened hemophilia patients (97 hemophilia A and 39 hemophilia B), 15 (11.1%) were positive for inversion 22 and 4 (3%) for inversion 1. Out of a total of 32 (23.7%) substitution/deletion mutations, 2 novel variants were identified: a novel splice acceptor site missense mutation (c.5816-2A > G) causing a pathogenic variant of the <i>F8</i> gene and another splicing site point mutation in intron/exon 23 (g.164496G > A).

    "title": "Switching and increasing prophylaxis regimen with a genetically recombinant fusion of coagulation factor IX and albumin in haemophilia B: a case report.",
    "abstract": "We present a case of a boy diagnosed in 2007 with severe haemophilia B [factor IX (FIX) concentration < 1%] at age of 9 months. He was initially treated with recombinant FIX concentrates, but changes in regimens were frequent due to spontaneous hemarthros. In 2013, he entered a phase III trial (NCT01662531) and received rIX-FP, IDELVION at 50 IU/kg once a week. Although the boy was safely maintained with this regimen (2015-2017), the number of hemarthros increased after he started to play football. Thus, rIX-FP regimen was modified (40 IU/kg twice/week) to optimize therapy. This modification was efficient on maintaining patient's thought levels (33%), helped during his fully incorporation at school and social life, and significantly improved synovial hypertrophy. In the last year, the boy has not suffered any bleeding episode and his joint situation improved significantly, which allowed reducing doses to weekly recommended doses. FIX replacement therapies with intravenous plasma-derived FIX (pdFIX) or standard half-life recombinant FIX (rFIX) concentrates are hampered by the relatively short terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of these substances (around 17-34 h), resulting in the need for frequent infusions (e.g. once every 3 or 4 days) to maintain protective FIX levels. In the past years, the first genetically recombinant fusion of rFIX with another protein - a recombinant human albumin - was developed (albutrepenonacog-alfa or rIX-FP; IDELVION) as a strategy to extend the t1/2 of rFIX-FP (around 95 h). We provide information about the difficult management of a patient with a major bleeding haemorrhagic phenotype, which caused serious limitations in the patient's daily life, impacting his quality of life at his young age, and how the switch to IDELVION allowed the situation to improve considerably."

    "title": "Hemophilia patients: are they naturally anticoagulated?",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia is an X-linked bleeding disorder, characterized by low plasma levels of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) (hemophilia A) or FIX (hemophilia B). Because of this, hemophilia patients (HP) were considered as naturally-anticoagulated and therefore protected from thrombosis. Over the last decades hemophilia care underwent striking changes by the introduction of prophylaxis with repeated injections of standard or modified coagulation factor products that maintain steady-state trough levels of the deficient factor. Meanwhile, new medications, not based on replacement therapy, were developed (i.e., emicizumab and others). However, emicizumab (the only licensed drug) can be used only for prophylaxis; during acute bleeding or surgery, HP require additional therapies, supplementing emicizumab with FVIII/IX concentrates or with bypassing agents (e.g., recombinant activated FVII or activated prothrombin complex concentrate). Owing to the new therapeutic strategies, the hemostatic competency of HP is now much better assured than in the past and therefore their life expectancy is considerably improved. Furthermore, the combined effects of the improved life-expectancy and of the steady-state hemostatic competence achieved by prophylaxis, make HP to be near(normal). They are, therefore, liable to be affected by the circumstantial risk factors of venous thromboembolism (VTE) that are common in the general population. Furthermore, HP undergo frequent surgery/invasive procedures (especially major orthopedic surgery) when they are treated with coagulation factor concentrates or bypassing agents that may increase the risk of post-operative VTE. Therefore, one wonders if HP should be considered for perioperative antithrombotic prophylaxis to prevent postoperative VTE.Clinical data on the value of antithrombotic prophylaxis in this setting are scanty. Indeed, data from an observational multicentre prospective study of 46 HP who underwent orthopedic surgery concluded that the prevalence of postoperative symptomatic VTE was similar to that estimated in the general population. Multicenter prospective trials are warranted to address the value of antithrombotic prophylaxis to avoid post-operative VTE in HP, especially during major surgery when regular prophylaxis is supplemented with additional coagulation factor products or bypassing agents. Until this information is available, HP undergoing major surgery whilst on antihemorrhagic prophylaxis supplemented with coagulation factor concentrates or bypassing agents, should at least receive intermittent pneumatic compression."

    "abstract": "Ruling out advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis is mandatory for persons with hemophilia (PWH) who are candidates for gene therapy. However, clinical evaluation and noninvasive tests (NITs) may be inaccurate after hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance. We conducted a prospective hepatological screening to detect advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis in PWH after HCV clearance. Any risk factor of chronic liver damage was registered by using biochemical data, liver stiffness measurement (LSM), and ultrasound (US). A pre/post-HCV clearance analysis was conducted prospectively in a subgroup of patients who underwent LSM, US, and NITs for fibrosis. We evaluated 119 patients (median age, 53 years; range, 36-87 years) with a previous HCV infection (hemophilia A, n = 108; hemophilia B, n = 11). Ninety-six (81%) presented at least 1 potential risk factor of chronic liver damage. Metabolic risk factors were the most prevalent, with 51 patients (44%) having US steatosis. In 21 patients (18%), clinical, biochemical, liver morphology, and/or LSM were suggestive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis. Furthermore, 10 patients (8%) had esophageal varices and 3 (3%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. In 57 patients included in the prospective analysis, LSM and NITs were reduced after HCV clearance (P < .05), but US signs specific of cirrhosis remained unchanged. Overall, 23 of 80 patients (29%) with LSM <10 KPa had at least 1 US sign suggestive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis. A similar proportion (18%) was observed for LSM <8 KPa. Overall, risk factors of chronic liver damage are frequent after HCV clearance, but changes in LSM and NITs after clearance may be inaccurate to rule out advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis. A specific diagnostic workup is warranted to evaluate liver health in PWH in the era of gene therapy."

To study the differences in FIX:C using OSA and CSA in moderate and mild hemophilia B (HB), their impact on classification of severity, and correlation with genotype. Single-center study including 21 genotyped and clinically characterized PwHB. FIX:C by OSA was measured using ActinFSL (Siemens) and CSA by Biophen (Hyphen). In addition, in vitro experiments with wild-type FIX were performed. Reproducibility of CSA was assessed between three European coagulation laboratories. FIX:C by CSA was consistently lower than by OSA, with 10/17 PwHB having a more severe hemophilia type by CSA. OSA displayed a more accurate description of the clinical bleeding severity, compared with CSA. A twofold difference between OSA:CSA FIX:C was present in 12/17 PwHB; all patients had genetic missense variants in the FIX serine protease domain. Discrepancy was also observed with diluted normal plasma, most significant for values below 0.10 IU/mL. Assessment of samples with low FIX:C showed excellent reproducibility of the CSA results between the laboratories. FIX:C was consistently higher by OSA compared with the CSA. Assessing FIX:C by CSA alone would have led to diagnosis of a more severe hemophilia type in a significant proportion of patients. Our study suggests using both OSA and CSA FIX:C together with genotyping to classify HB severity and provide essential information for clinical management."

    "title": "Evaluating Gene Therapy as a Potential Paradigm Shift in Treating Severe Hemophilia.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia is characterized by a deficiency in coagulation factors VIII or IX. The general standard of care for severe hemophilia is frequent intravenous recombinant or plasma-derived factor replacement to prevent bleeding. While this treatment is effective in preventing bleeding, frequent infusions are burdensome for patients. Nonadherence to the therapeutic regimen leaves people with hemophilia at risk for spontaneous and traumatic bleeds into joints as well as life-threatening bleeds such as intracranial hemorrhage. The chronicity of the disorder often leads to the formation of target joints, causing long-term pain and impairing mobility. As a monogenic disorder with well-understood genetics, hemophilia is an ideal disorder for implementing innovations in gene therapies. Indeed, recent approvals of two gene therapy products have the potential to shift the hemophilia treatment paradigm. Valoctocogene roxaparvovec and etranacogene dezaparvovec-drlb are gene therapies for hemophilia A and B, respectively. These therapies, given as a single intravenous infusion, may improve patients' quality of life, decreasing treatment burden and resulting in factor expression that virtually eliminates the need for factor replacement. Since both treatments involve viral vectors targeted to the liver, short- and long-term safety and efficacy monitoring involves monitoring liver enzymes to track liver health. Long-term monitoring of efficacy, durability of gene expression, and safety are ongoing. Gene therapy presents a promising new therapeutic option for patients with hemophilia and warrants continued innovation and investigation."

    "abstract": "Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening emergency that may be confused with other less serious conditions. The onset of true anaphylaxis typically occurs within minutes following exposure to an offending agent, and it can variably include dyspnea/wheezing, hemodynamic compromise, rash, hives/pruritus, swelling, or gastrointestinal symptoms. The absence of an expected association between exposure(s) and classic symptoms should lead to the consideration of alternative diagnoses. Here, we describe the course of a patient with hemophilia B who developed stridor and wheezing after exposure to the recombinant factor VII, NovoSeven, and tranexamic acid (TXA) for the management of hematomas. Due to a reported prior history of anaphylaxis to multiple factor replacements, the patient's initial management included NovoSeven with steroid/antihistamine prophylaxes and close monitoring with epinephrine at the bedside. Despite the administration of prophylaxis, the patient developed significant stridor, was treated with epinephrine and nebulizers and additional steroids, and was transferred to the intensive care unit. There, a pattern of NovoSeven administration followed variably by wheezing and stridor continued for two days until the patient's respiratory condition was predictable and stable. The patient's subsequent clinical course following transfer to the general medical ward was not consistent with anaphylaxis. This case highlights the importance of evaluating for mimickers of anaphylaxis, especially where only select symptoms such as stridor and wheezing are present without other serious signs of anaphylaxis such as hypoxemia, hypotension, or significant tachycardia."

    "title": "Augmented Degradation of Factors VIII and IX in the Intermittent Movement State.",
    "abstract": "The most common clinical presentation of hemophilia A and hemophilia B is bleeding in large joints and striated muscles. It is unclear why bleeding has a predilection to affect joints and muscles. As muscles and joints are involved in intermittent movement, we explored whether this phenomenon could be associated with an impact on factor VIII and IX levels. Purified proteins and a mouse model were assessed using coagulation assays, Western blot analysis and immuno-staining. Movement caused an increase in thrombin activity and a decrease in factor VIII and factor IX activity. The decrease in factor VIII activity was more significant in the presence of thrombin and during movement. Under movement condition, sodium ions appeared to enhance the activity of thrombin that resulted in decreased factor VIII activity. Unlike factor VIII, the reduction in factor IX levels in the movement condition was thrombin-independent. High factor VIII levels were found to protect factor IX from degradation and vice versa. In mice that were in movement, factor VIII and IX levels decreased in the microcirculation of the muscle tissue compared with other tissues and to the muscle tissue at rest. Movement had no effect on von Willebrand factor levels. Movement induces reduction in factor VIII and IX levels. It enables an increase in the binding of sodium ions to thrombin leading to enhanced thrombin activity and augmented degradation of factor VIII. These data suggest a potential mechanism underlying the tendency of hemophilia patients to bleed in muscles and joints."

    "abstract": "The Medical Directors of nine Italian Hemophilia Centers reviewed and discussed the key issues concerning the replacement therapy of hemophilia patients during a one-day consensus conference held in Rome one year ago. Particular attention was paid to the replacement therapy needed for surgery using continuous infusion (CI) versus bolus injection (BI) of standard and extended half-life Factor VIII (FVIII) concentrates in severe hemophilia A patients. Among the side effects, the risk of development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) and thromboembolic complications was addressed. The specific needs of mild hemophilia A patients were described, as well as the usage of bypassing agents to treat patients with high-responding inhibitors. Young hemophilia A patients may take significant advantages from primary prophylaxis three times or twice weekly, even with standard half-life (SHL) rFVIII concentrates. Patients affected by severe hemophilia B probably have a less severe clinical phenotype than severe hemophilia A patients, and in about 30% of cases may undergo weekly prophylaxis with an rFIX SHL concentrate. The prevalence of missense mutations in 55% of severe hemophilia B patients allows the synthesis of a partially changed FIX molecule that can play some hemostatic role at the level of endothelial cells or the subendothelial matrix. The flow back of infused rFIX from the extravascular to the plasma compartment allows a very long half-life of about 30 h in some hemophilia B patients. Once weekly, prophylaxis can assure a superior quality of life in a large severe or moderate hemophilia B population. According to the Italian registry of surgery, hemophilia B patients undergo joint replacement by arthroplasty less frequently than hemophilia A patients. Finally, the relationships between FVIII/IX genotypes and the pharmacokinetics of clotting factor concentrates have been investigated."

These infections were introduced into people with hemophilia through the innovation of factor concentrates in the 1970s and 1980s. Concentrates, heralded as a major advance in treatment at the time, brought devastation and death to the community already challenged by the complications of bleeding into joints, vital organs, and the brain. Over the past 5 decades, considerable advances in hemophilia treatment have improved the survival, quality of life, and participation of people with hemophilia, although challenges remain and health equity with their unaffected peers has not yet been achieved. The decision to take a gene therapy product is one in which an informed, holistic, and shared decision-making approach must be employed. Bias on the part of health care professionals and people with hemophilia must be addressed and minimized. Here, we review data leading to the regulatory authorization of valoctocogene roxaparvovec, an adeno-associated virus 5 gene therapy, in Europe to treat hemophilia A and etranacogene dezaparvovec-drlb in the United States and Europe to treat hemophilia B. We also provide an overview of the decision-making process and recommend steps that should be taken by the hemophilia community to ensure the safety of and optimal outcomes for people with hemophilia who choose to receive a gene therapy product."

    "abstract": "The current study describes real-world clinical outcomes and factor usage among patients with haemophilia B switching from standard half-life factor IX (SHL FIX) treatment to recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) prophylaxis in European treatment centres. This non-interventional, retrospective, multicentre chart review evaluated medical records from adult and paediatric patients with haemophilia B in Denmark, Germany and the UK. Patients had documented SHL FIX treatment, on-demand or prophylaxis, for ≥ 6 months before starting rFIXFc prophylaxis, and subsequent data for ≥ 6 months afterwards (up to 24 months). Primary endpoints included annualised bleeding rates (ABRs), prophylactic factor consumption and injection frequency. Data from 30 patients (24/30 [80.0%] with severe disease) showed overall mean (standard deviation, SD) ABRs of 4.7 (6.3) on SHL FIX treatment and 1.7 (2.3) after switching to rFIXFc prophylaxis. The reduction in mean (SD) ABRs was greater when switching from SHL FIX on-demand treatment (n = 6), with a decrease from 10.5 (9.9) to 2.6 (4.5), than when switching from SHL FIX prophylaxis (n = 24), with a decrease from 3.3 (4.3) to 1.5 (1.4). Among prior SHL FIX prophylaxis patients, switching to rFIXFc prophylaxis increased the proportion of those with zero bleeds from 21.7% to 45.8% during the 6 months before and after switching, respectively. In the total population, five of six target joints (83.3%) present when patients started rFIXFc prophylaxis subsequently resolved. In patients switching from SHL FIX prophylaxis to rFIXFc prophylaxis, mean (SD) weekly injection frequency was reduced by 1.0 (0.7) and mean (SD) factor consumption was reduced by 27.7 (49.6) IU/kg/week. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of rFIXFc prophylaxis in real-world clinical practice. Improvements in both clinical effectiveness and factor usage associated with rFIXFc prophylaxis may potentially reduce patient burden and improve quality of life."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia care has improved greatly because of advances in treatment options and comprehensive care. In-depth insight into the perspectives of persons with hemophilia and health care providers on their care may provide targets for further improvements. To assess satisfaction of the hemophilia population with their care, to explore factors determining care satisfaction, and to identify areas for potential health care improvements, including digital health tools. First, to assess care satisfaction and factors determining satisfaction and health care improvements, data from a nationwide, cross-sectional questionnaire among 867 adult and pediatric Dutch persons with hemophilia A or B were analyzed. This included the Hemophilia Patient Satisfaction Scale questionnaire, Canadian Hemophilia Outcomes Kids' Life Assessment Tool satisfaction questions, a visual analog scale satisfaction score, and open questions. Second, to further explore factors determining satisfaction and health care improvements, semistructured interviews were conducted with 19 persons with hemophilia or their parents and 18 health care providers. High care satisfaction was found, with an overall median Hemophilia Patient Satisfaction Scale score of 12 (IQR, 6-21). Participants in the interviews reported that patient-professional interactions, availability of care, and coordination of care were major factors determining satisfaction. Suggested health care improvements included improved information provision and coordination of care, especially shared care with professionals not working within comprehensive care centers. Participants suggested that digital health tools could aid in this. Satisfaction with hemophilia care is high among persons with hemophilia in the Netherlands, although several potential improvements have been identified. Accentuating these is especially relevant in the current era of treatment innovations, in which we might focus less on other aspects of care."

    "abstract": "Dalcinonacog alfa (DalcA), a novel subcutaneously administered recombinant human factor IX (FIX) variant is being developed for adult and paediatric patients with hemophilia B (HB). DalcA has been shown to raise FIX to clinically meaningful levels in adults with HB. This work aimed to support dosing regimen selection in adults and perform first-in-paediatric dose extrapolations using a model-based pharmacokinetic (PK) approach. A population PK model was built using adult data from two clinical trials (NCT03186677, NCT03995784). With allometry in the model, clinical trial simulations were performed to study alternative dosing regimens in adults and children. Steady-state trough levels and the time-to-reach target were derived to inform dose selection. Almost 90% of the adults were predicted to achieve desirable FIX levels, i.e. 10% FIX activity, following daily 100 IU/kg dosing, with 90% of the subjects reaching target within 1.6-7.1 days. No every-other-day regimen met the target. A dose of 125 IU/kg resulted in adequate FIX levels down to 6 years, whereas a 150 IU/kg dose was needed below 6 down to 2 years of age. For subjects down to 6 years that did not reach target with 125 IU/kg, a dose escalation to 150 IU/kg was appropriate. The children below 6 to 2 years were shown to need a dose escalation to 200 IU/kg if 150 IU/kg given daily was insufficient. This study supported the adult dose selection for DalcA in the presence of sparse data and enabled first-in-paediatric dose selection to achieve FIX levels that reduce risk of spontaneous bleeds."

    "abstract": "Few studies have evaluated the impact of subclinical microstructural changes and psychosocial factors on cognitive function in patients with haemophilia. To determine the prevalence and characteristics of cognitive impairment in patients with haemophilia, and identify associated risk factors. We recruited haemophilia A or B patients who were aged ≥10 years old from three public hospitals in Hong Kong. A neurocognitive battery was administered to evaluate their attention, memory, processing speed and cognitive flexibility performances. They also underwent magnetic resonance imaging to identify cerebral microbleeds. Validated self-reported questionnaires were administered to assess their mental health status and adherence to prophylactic treatment. General linear modelling was used to investigate the association of neurocognitive outcomes with risks factors, adjusting for age and education attainment. Forty-two patients were recruited (median age 32.0 years; 78.6% haemophilia A; 80.9% moderate-to-severe disease). Six patients (14.3%) had developed cerebral microbleeds. A subgroup of patients demonstrated impairments in cognitive flexibility (30.9%) and motor processing speed (26.2%). Hemarthrosis in the previous year was associated with worse attention (Estimate = 7.62, 95% CI: 1.92-15.33; p = .049) and cognitive flexibility (Estimate = 8.64, 95% CI: 2.52-13.29; p = .043). Depressive (Estimate = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.10-0.55; p = .023) and anxiety (Estimate = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.19-0.41; p = .0069) symptoms were associated with inattentiveness. Among patients receiving prophylactic treatment (71.4%), medication adherence was positively correlated with cognitive flexibility (p = .037). A substantial proportion of patients with haemophilia demonstrated cognitive impairment, particularly higher-order thinking skills. Screening for cognitive deficits should be incorporated into routine care. Future studies should evaluate the association of neurocognitive outcomes with occupational/vocational outcomes."

One such tool, the Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS), is embedded for use within the Australian Bleeding Disorders Registry (ABDR). This provides a unique opportunity to analyse patterns of tool usage as well as associations between scores, demographics and clinical outcome factors. To characterise clinician practices regarding use of HJHS in routine clinical assessment of persons with haemophilia (PWH), to examine relationships between HJHS, and age, inhibitor status and body mass index (BMI), and to identify potential barriers to HJHS tool usage. A national, retrospective study was conducted using data extracted from the ABDR between 2014 and 2020, complemented by a qualitative questionnaire exploring haemophilia treatment centre (HTC) structure, resourcing and clinician perspectives about HJHS. 28.1% (622/2220) of PWH had at least one HJHS recorded in the ABDR during the defined study period (546 haemophilia A, 76 haemophilia B). HJHS were recorded more in children than adults and performed more in severe than non-severe haemophilia. Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant association of age, severity and inhibitor status with HJHS. No association was identified between BMI and HJHS. Qualitative surveys revealed significant variation in physiotherapy funding, availability and methods of tool use between HTCs. This study provides valuable insights into joint health assessment in Australia. It improved our understanding of factors influencing long-term joint outcomes. Practical limitations of HJHS tool were also discussed."

Although PK-guided dosing is increasingly applied, it is generally not considered standard clinical practice. The aim of this scoping review is to map barriers and facilitators for the implementation of PK-guided dosing in clinical practice and to identify knowledge gaps. A literature search was performed and 110 articles were included that describe PK-guided dosing in patients with bleeding disorders, mostly hemophilia A. We defined two overarching themes, efficacy and feasibility, and discuss five topics within each theme. For each topic, barriers, facilitators and knowledge gaps were described. Although consensus was found with regard to some topics, contradicting reports were found for others, especially with respect to the efficacy of PK-guided dosing. These contradictions highlight the need for future research to elucidate current ambiguities."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia A (HA) and haemophilia B (HB) are X-linked inherited bleeding disorders caused by the absence or deficiency of coagulation factors VIII (FVIII) and IX (FIX), respectively. Recent advances in the development of effective treatments for haemophilia have led to a significant increase in life expectancy. As a result, the incidence of some comorbidities, including fragility fractures, has increased in people with haemophilia (PWH). The aim of our research was to perform a review of the literature investigating the pathogenesis and multidisciplinary management of fractures in PWH. The PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify original research articles, meta-analyses, and scientific reviews on fragility fractures in PWH. The mechanism underlying bone loss in PWH is multifactorial and includes recurrent joint bleeding, reduced physical activity with consequent reduction in mechanical load, nutritional deficiencies (particularly vitamin D), and FVIII and FIX deficiency. Pharmacological treatment of fractures in PWH includes antiresorptive, anabolic and dual action drugs. When conservative management is not possible, surgery is the preferred option, particularly in severe arthropathy, and rehabilitation is a key component in restoring function and maintaining mobility. Appropriate multidisciplinary fracture management and an adapted and tailored rehabilitation pathway are essential to improve the quality of life of PWH and prevent long-term complications. Further clinical trials are needed to improve the management of fractures in PWH."

Most bleeds in patients with hemophilia occur in their joints and muscles, and because of these bleeding episodes, patients may end up developing musculoskeletal alterations resulting from hemophilic arthropathy, even receiving hemostatic treatment. The third edition of the World Federation of Hemophilia's Guidelines for the Management of Hemophilia defines 12 principles that encompass all the different types of multidisciplinary care required by people with hemophilia, one of these being clinical and epidemiological research. The expected number of patients with hemophilia across the world has been estimated at 1125 000, most of them undiagnosed, and the total number of patients with severe hemophilia at 418 000 males. Data available from medium and high-income countries show that the prevalence at birth (incidence) and the prevalence of hemophilia differ, which means that patients with hemophilia are at a disadvantage in terms of life expectancy as compared with the general population. In medium-to-high-income countries, the life expectancy disadvantage of patients with hemophilia A and B as compared with the rest of the population is 30% and 24%, respectively. This life expectancy disadvantage is much greater in countries with more limited access to treatments for hemophilia."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B (HB) is an X-linked recessive disease caused by <i>F9</i> gene mutation and functional coagulation factor IX (FIX) deficiency. Patients suffer from chronic arthritis and death threats owing to excessive bleeding. Compared with traditional treatments, gene therapy for HB has obvious advantages, especially when the hyperactive FIX mutant (FIX-Padua) is used. However, the mechanism by which FIX-Padua works remains ambiguous due to a lack of research models. Here, in situ introduction of <i>F9-Padua</i> mutation was performed in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) via CRISPR/Cas9 and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs). The hyperactivity of FIX-Padua was confirmed to be 364% of the normal level in edited hiPSCs-derived hepatocytes, providing a reliable model for exploring the mechanism of the hyperactivity of FIX-Padua. Moreover, the <i>F9</i> cDNA containing <i>F9-Padua</i> was integrated before the <i>F9</i> initiation codon by CRISPR/Cas9 in iPSCs from an HB patient (HB-hiPSCs). Integrated HB-hiPSCs after off-target screening were differentiated into hepatocytes. The FIX activity in the supernatant of integrated hepatocytes showed a 4.2-fold increase and reached 63.64% of the normal level, suggesting a universal treatment for HB patients with various mutations in <i>F9</i> exons. Overall, our study provides new approaches for the exploration and development of cell-based gene therapy for HB."

    "abstract": "Factor VIII (FVIII) is an important component of blood coagulation as its congenital deficiency results in life-threatening bleeding. Current prophylactic therapy of the disease (hemophilia A) is based on 3-4 intravenous infusions of therapeutic FVIII per week. This poses a burden on patients, demanding reduction of infusion frequency by using FVIII with extended plasma half-life (EHL). Development of these products requires understanding FVIII plasma clearance mechanisms. This paper overviews (i) an up-to-date state of the research in this field and (ii) current EHL FVIII products, including recently approved efanesoctocog alfa, for which the plasma half-life exceeds a biochemical barrier posed by von Willebrand factor, complexed with FVIII in plasma, which results in ~1 per week infusion frequency. We focus on the EHL FVIII products' structure and function, in particular related to the known discrepancy in results of one-stage clotting (OC) and chromogenic substrate (CS) assays used to assign the products' potency, dosing, and for clinical monitoring in plasma. We suggest a possible root cause of these assays' discrepancy that is also pertinent to EHL factor IX variants used to treat hemophilia B. Finally, we discuss approaches in designing future EHL FVIII variants, including those to be used for hemophilia A gene therapy."

FIX mutants were expressed in vitro by transient transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. One-stage activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) based assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to measure the coagulation activity and antigen level of FIX in conditioned medium. Western blot analysis was also used to evaluate interference of the mutations with synthesis and secretion of FIX. A structural model of the FIX G413V mutant was constructed and structural disturbance caused by the mutation was determined by molecular dynamics simulations. Both C268Y and I316F impaired expression of FIX. However, the I316F mutant degraded quickly, whereas the C268Y mutant mostly accumulated intracellularly. The G413V mutant could be synthesized and secreted normally, but procoagulant activity was almost completely lost. This loss is likely mostly due to the impact on the catalytic residue cS195. The three FIX mutations identified in Chinese hemophilia B patients either impaired the expression of FIX, as was seen with the I316F and C268Y mutants, or impaired the function of FIX, as was seen with the G413V mutant."

About eleven years later, in August 2022, the first hemophilia A gene therapy product was approved by the European Commission and hemophilia treatment entered a new era. This review does not focus on the newest advances but rather the practical aspects of gene therapy aiming to provide an overview for physicians who treat hemophiliacs who did not participate in the clinical trials. The current status of gene therapy, focusing particularly on products likely to be clinically available soon, are reviewed and summarized. Currently, possible limitations of gene therapy are pre-existing neutralizing antibodies toward the vector, liver health, age, and inhibitor status. Possible safety concerns include infusion reactions, liver damage, and adverse effects from immune suppressants or steroids. In summary, generally speaking, gene therapy is effective, at least for several years, but the exact effect may be unpredictable and intensive monitoring for several months is needed. It can also be considered safe with careful practice on selected patients. In its current form, gene therapy will not replace all hemophilia treatments. Advances in non-factor therapy will also improve hemophilia care greatly in the future. We envisage that gene therapy may be included in multiple novel therapies for hemophilia and benefit some hemophilia patients while novel non-factor therapies may benefit others, together fulfilling the unmet needs of all hemophilia patients."

It is also known to occur in association with factor borne infections, especially hepatitis C. This is the first case report of nephrotic syndrome occurring in a child receiving prophylactic factor VIII in the absence of inhibitors of hepatitis infection. However, the pathophysiology of this phenomenon is poorly understood. A 7-year Sri Lankan boy diagnosed with severe hemophilia A on weekly factor VIII prophylaxis was diagnosed with three episodes of nephrotic syndrome, a condition in which there is leakage of plasma protein into urine. He had three episodes of nephrotic syndrome, all of which responded well to 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily dose of oral steroids, achieving remission within 2 weeks of starting daily prednisolone. He has not developed inhibitors for factor VIII. His hepatitis screening remained negative. There is a possible link between factor therapy for hemophilia A and nephrotic syndrome, which can be a T-cell-mediated immune response.

Half of the patients with X-linked disorders and COVID-19 (9/18) were male, the age varied from 1 to 71 years, and most patients were White (9/12; six patients had missing data). The most common symptoms were cough (13/17; one patient had missing data) and fever (12/16; two patients had missing data), whereas the most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (3/11; seven patients had missing data) and cardiopathy (2/12; six patients had missing data).

In both pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, systemic AAV administration has been associated with neurotoxicity in peripheral nerve ganglia and spinal cord. Neurological signs have also been seen following direct AAV injection into the brain, both in non-human primates and in a clinical trial for late infantile Batten disease. Neurotoxic events appear variable across species, and preclinical animal studies do not fully predict clinical observations. Accumulating data suggest that AAV-associated neurotoxicity may be underdiagnosed and may differ between species in terms of frequency and/or severity. In this review, we discuss the different animal models that have been used to demonstrate AAV-associated neurotoxicity, its potential causes and consequences, and potential approaches to blunt AAV-associated neurotoxicity."

Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of extravascular FIX using animal models of tail clip bleeding and ferric chloride-induced thrombosis. Mutant rFIX proteins with described enhanced (rFIX<sub>K5R</sub>) or reduced (rFIX<sub>K5A</sub>) binding to extracellular matrix were generated and characterized using <i>in vitro</i> aPTT, one-stage clotting, and modified FX assays. Using hemophilia B mice, pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and <i>in vivo</i> efficacy of these proteins were compared against rFIX wild-type protein (rFIX<sub>WT</sub>) in a tail clip bleeding and FeCl<sub>3</sub>-induced thrombosis model. Respective tissue disposition of FIX was evaluated using immunofluorescence. In vitro characterization demonstrated comparable clotting activity of rFIX proteins. The PK profile showed that rFIX<sub>K5A</sub> displayed the highest plasma exposure compared to rFIX<sub>WT</sub> and rFIX<sub>K5R</sub>. Immunofluorescence evaluation of liver tissue showed that rFIX<sub>K5R</sub> was detectable up to 24 hours, whereas rFIX<sub>WT</sub> and rFIX<sub>K5A</sub> were detectable only up to 15 minutes. In the tail clip bleeding model, rFIX<sub>K5R</sub> displayed significant hemostatic protection against bleeding incidence for up to 72 hours postintravenous administration of 50 IU/kg, whereas the efficacy of rFIX<sub>K5A</sub> was already reduced at 24 hours. Similarly, in the mesenteric artery thrombus model, rFIX<sub>K5R</sub> and rFIX<sub>WT</sub> demonstrated prolonged efficacy compared to rFIX<sub>K5A</sub>. Using two different <i>in vivo</i> models of hemostasis and thrombosis, we demonstrate that mutated rFIX protein with enhanced binding (rFIX<sub>K5R</sub>) to extravascular space confers prolonged hemostatic efficacy in vivo despite lower plasma exposure, whereas rFIX<sub>K5A</sub> rapidly lost its efficacy despite higher plasma exposure."

    "abstract": "Muscle-directed gene therapy with adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors is undergoing clinical development for treating neuromuscular disorders and for systemic delivery of therapeutic proteins. Although these approaches show considerable therapeutic benefits, they are also prone to induce potent immune responses against vector or transgene products owing to the immunogenic nature of the intramuscular delivery route, or the high doses required for systemic delivery to muscle. Major immunological concerns include antibody formation against viral capsid, complement activation, and cytotoxic T cell responses against capsid or transgene products. They can negate therapy and even lead to life-threatening immunotoxicities. Herein we review clinical observations and provide an outlook for how the field addresses these problems through a combination of vector engineering and immune modulation."

    "abstract": "Define consensus recommendations to improve care coordination between Hospital Pharmacy, Hematology and Nursing, inter- and intra-center, in the care of hemophilia patients. Recommendations for the improvement of care coordination in the management of hemophilia patients were identified and assessed by a multidisciplinary panel of professionals with experience in this field (Hospital Pharmacy, Hematology and Nursing) and supported by scientific evidence. The identified recommendations were assessed by Rand/UCLA consensus methodology (Delphi-adapted) based on their appropriateness and, subsequently, on their necessity. In both cases, it was used ordinal Likert scale. Data were statistically analyzed through different metrics. Fifty-three recommendations for the improvement of care coordination between Hospital Pharmacy, Hematology and Nursing in the management of hemophilia patients were identified, grouped into eight areas of action: i) Hemophilia units, reference centers and multidisciplinary care; ii) Role of Hematology, Hospital Pharmacy and Nursing in the patient journey of hemophilia patients; iii) Telepharmacy and telemedicine; iv) Pharmacokinetic monitoring; v) Transition to adult patient regimen; vi) Patient health education; vii) Surgery, emergency room and hospital admission; and viii) Outcome evaluation. All recommendations were assessed as appropriate and necessary by the external expert panel. Hemophilia patient journey is complex and depends on different variables. It also requires the involvement of different healthcare professionals who must act in a coordinated and integrated manner at all stages of the patient's life, adapted to their individual needs. On this matter, the identified and agreed recommendations may improve continuity and quality of care, as they facilitate the integration and coordination of the professionals involved in the management of this pathology, especially Hospital Pharmacy, Hematology and Nursing."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia-related distress (HRD) has been shown to be higher among those with lower educational attainment, but potential racial/ethnic differences have not been previously described. Thus, we examined HRD according to race/ethnicity. This cross-sectional study was a planned secondary analysis of the hemophilia-related distress questionnaire (HRDq) validation study data. Adults aged ≥ 18 years with Hemophilia A or B were recruited from one of two hemophilia treatment centers between July 2017-December 2019. HRDq scores can range from 0-120, and higher scores indicate higher distress. Self-reported race/ethnicity was grouped as Hispanic, non-Hispanic White (NHW) and non-Hispanic Black (NHB). Unadjusted and multivariable linear regression models were used to examine mediators of race/ethnicity and HRDq scores. Among 149 participants enrolled, 143 completed the HRDq and were included in analyses. Approximately 17.5% of participants were NHB, 9.1% were Hispanic and 72.0% were NHW. HRDq scores ranged from 2 to 83, with a mean of 35.1 [standard deviation (SD) = 16.5]. Average HRDq scores were significantly higher among NHB participants (mean = 42.6,SD = 20.6; p-value = .038) and similar in Hispanic participants (mean = 33.8,SD = 16.7, p-value = .89) compared to NHW (mean = 33.2,SD = 14.9) participants. In multivariable models, differences between NHB vs NHW participants persisted when adjusting for inhibitor status, severity, and target joint. However, after household income was adjusted for, differences in HRDq scores were no longer statistically significant (β = 6.0 SD = 3.7; p-value = .10). NHB participants reported higher HRD than NHW participants. Household income mediated higher distress scores in NHB compared to NHW participants, highlighting the urgent need to understand social determinants of health and financial hardship in persons with hemophilia."

Congenital hemorrhagic diseases (CHDs) are a group of rare disorders caused by quantitative or qualitative deficiency of one or more coagulation factors. Haemophilia A, Haemophilia B, and von Willebrand disease are the most common congenital bleeding disorders. Over the past decades, the evolution of CHDs treatments has resulted in an increase in the average life expectancy of patients and in an improvement in their quality of life; it has also enabled the prevention of bleeding complications much more effectively than in the past. This has been possible, especially for haemophilia, mainly because of earlier diagnosis, introduction of recombinant factors, especially long-acting factors, and availability of new non-substitutive therapies. In 2021, there was an increase in the overall expenditure and consumption of coagulation factors in Italy; the increase concerned especially the long-acting recombinant factors used in the treatment of Haemophilia A and B and the monoclonal antibody emicizumab. Waiting for innovative therapies that can enable individually tailored therapies, special attention must be paid to prescriptive appropriateness and to identify the best diagnostic and therapeutic care pathways for patients."

A 27-year-old hemophiliac male was found to have a lateral chest wall hematoma after presenting with back pain associated with localized chest wall swelling. Even more unusual than the location of his hematoma was the absence of any preceding triggers such as a fall or trauma to the area. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of its kind in a patient with inherited hemophilia B. We believe the reporting of such rare presentations increases awareness of these possibilities and thus aids in the prompt diagnosis and treatment of other similar cases when they are encountered."

    "abstract": "This systematic scoping review aimed to map available evidence regarding endodontic therapy in patients with inherited bleeding disorders (IBDs). Studies in medicine or dentistry were selected if they reported on endodontic therapy in individuals with IBDs such as hemophilia A, hemophilia B, or von Willebrand disease. Two independent researchers performed searches and screening in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The search initially yielded 676 potentially relevant studies, 14 of which were included in the final analysis. Of these 14 studies, 3 were classified as consensus statements or guidelines, 3 as observational studies, 2 as reviews, 5 as case reports, and 1 as an editorial. Most of the evidence regarding prophylactic treatment (eg, blood transfusion, replacement therapy, or medication administration) prior to endodontic therapy was derived from observational studies. The most frequently reported procedure was endodontic therapy, while 1 case report described a surgical endodontic procedure. Most studies included in the analysis reported that these procedures could be performed under local anesthesia. Two case reports and 1 observational study described complications after endodontic therapy in patients with IBDs. This scoping review revealed a lack of well-designed studies related to the topic of endodontic therapy in patients with IBDs. The available evidence suggests that endodontic therapy in patients with IBDs can be considered a low-risk procedure; local anesthesia should be used in most cases when patients with IBDs are treated, but the use of prophylactic measures is preferred when nerve block anesthesia is required; endodontic therapy can be conducted in a clinical setting without the need for hospital admittance; and, although the number of reported complications is small, the risk should not be ignored."

In multinational, phase III trials, rFIXFc was effective for the prophylaxis, perioperative management or on-demand treatment of bleeding in male patients with severe haemophilia B regardless of age and irrespective of whether or not they had been previously treated with FIX replacement products. Prophylactic efficacy was maintained over the longer term (up to 5 years) in previously treated patients. rFIXFc effectiveness in the real-world setting is supported by results of prospective studies, as well as the outcomes of several retrospective trials. rFIXFc was well tolerated in clinical trials in previously treated and untreated children, adolescents and/or adults with severe haemophilia B. Thus, rFIXFc continues to represent a useful treatment option among the haemophilia B patient population."

    "abstract": "Base editing via CRISPR-Cas9 has garnered attention as a method for correcting disease-specific mutations without causing double-strand breaks, thereby avoiding large deletions and translocations in the host chromosome. However, its reliance on the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) can limit its use. We aimed to restore a disease mutation in a patient with severe hemophilia B using base editing with SpCas9-NG, a modified Cas9 with the board PAM flexibility. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a patient with hemophilia B (c.947T>C; I316T) and established HEK293 cells and knock-in mice expressing the patient's F9 cDNA. We transduced the cytidine base editor (C>T), including the nickase version of Cas9 (wild-type SpCas9 or SpCas9-NG), into the HEK293 cells and knock-in mice through plasmid transfection and an adeno-associated virus vector, respectively. Here we demonstrate the broad PAM flexibility of SpCas9-NG near the mutation site. The base-editing approach using SpCas9-NG but not wild-type SpCas9 successfully converts C to T at the mutation in the iPSCs. Gene-corrected iPSCs differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells in vitro and express substantial levels of F9 mRNA after subrenal capsule transplantation into immunodeficient mice. Additionally, SpCas9-NG-mediated base editing corrects the mutation in both HEK293 cells and knock-in mice, thereby restoring the production of the coagulation factor. A base-editing approach utilizing the broad PAM flexibility of SpCas9-NG can provide a solution for the treatment of genetic diseases, including hemophilia B."

    "abstract": "The Canadian Bleeding Disorders Registry (CBDR) is a source of real-world data for Canadian patients with hemophilia B. Nonacog beta pegol (N9-GP), an extended half-life (EHL) recombinant factor IX (FIX) concentrate, was awarded a Canadian Blood Services contract in 2018 and subsequently made available across Canada (except Québec) to adult patients. For most patients already on another EHL FIX treatment, a switch to N9-GP occurred. This study estimates the impact on treatment costs of a switch from a prior FIX to N9-GP based on annualized bleed rates and FIX consumption volumes before and after N9-GP switch from the CBDR. Real-world data from the CBDR for total FIX consumption and annualized bleed rates were used to inform a deterministic 1-year cost-consequence model. The model considered that the EHL to N9-GP switches were from eftrenonacog alfa and the standard half-life switches were from nonacog alfa. Because FIX prices are confidential in Canada, the model assumed cost parity for annual prophylaxis with each FIX based on the product monograph recommended dosing regimen to calculate an estimated price per international unit for each product. The switch to N9-GP resulted in improvements in real-world annualized bleed rates and therefore reductions in annual breakthrough bleed treatment costs. Switching to N9-GP also resulted in reduced real-world annual FIX consumption for prophylaxis. Overall, annual treatment costs were 9.4% and 10.5% lower after the switch to N9-GP from nonacog alfa and eftrenonacog alfa, respectively. N9-GP improves clinical outcomes and may be cost-saving vs nonacog alfa and eftrenonacog alfa."

    "abstract": "Recent therapeutic strategies for hemophilia include long-term therapeutic gene expression using adeno-associated virus (AAV) and rebalancing therapy via the downregulation of anticoagulant pathways. However, these approaches have limitations in immune responses or insufficiency to control acute bleeding. Thus, we developed a therapeutic strategy for hemophilia B by a combined rebalancing and human factor 9 (h<i>F9</i>) gene knockin (KI) using a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) and AAV. Antithrombin (AT; Serpin Family C Member 1 [<i>Serpinc1</i>]) was selected as the target anticoagulation pathway for the gene KI. First, the combined use of LNP-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and AAV donor resulted in 20% insertions or deletions (indels) in <i>Serpinc1</i> and 67% reduction of blood mouse AT concentration. Second, h<i>F9</i> coding sequences were integrated into approximately 3% of the target locus. h<i>F9</i> KI yielded approximately 1,000 ng/mL human factor IX (hFIX) and restored coagulation activity to a normal level. LNP-CRISPR injection caused sustained AT downregulation and hFIX production up to 63 weeks. AT inhibition and hFIX protein-production ability could be maintained by the proliferation of genetically edited hepatocytes in the case of partial hepatectomy. The co-administration of AAV and LNP showed no severe side effects except random integrations. Our results demonstrate hemophilia B therapy by a combination of rebalancing and h<i>F9</i> KI using LNP and AAV."

Primarily to quantify the structural changes after AJD in patients with HAA by the use of 3D joint space width (JSW) measurements and biochemical markers and secondarily to correlate these findings with clinical pain/function. Patients with haemophilia A/B who underwent AJD were included for this study. Bone contours on MRI (performed before and 12 and 36 months after AJD) were drawn manually and percentage change in JSW was calculated. Blood/urine (before and 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after AJD) was collected for biomarker measurement (COMP, CS846, C10C, CALC2, PRO-C2, CTX-II) and combined indexes of markers were calculated. Mixed effects models were used for analyses on group level. Structural changes were compared with clinical parameters. Eight patients were evaluated. On group level, percentage changes in JSW showed a slight decrease after 12 months followed by a non-statistically significant increase in JSW after 36 months compared to baseline. Biochemical marker collagen/cartilage formation also showed an initial decrease, followed by a trend towards net formation 12, 24 and 36 months after AJD. On individual patient level, no clear correlations between structural changes and clinical parameters were observed. Cartilage restoration activity on group level in patients with HAA after AJD was in concordance with clinical improvements. Correlating structural modifications with clinical parameters in the individual patient remains difficult."

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of fitusiran prophylaxis in people with haemophilia A or haemophilia B with inhibitors. This multicentre, randomised, open-label phase 3 study was done at 26 sites (primarily secondary or tertiary centres) in 12 countries. Men, boys, and young adults aged 12 years or older with severe haemophilia A or haemophilia B with inhibitors previously treated with on-demand bypassing agents were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive once-a-month 80 mg subcutaneous fitusiran prophylaxis (fitusiran prophylaxis group) or to continue with bypassing agents on-demand (bypassing agents on-demand group) for 9 months. The primary endpoint was mean annualised bleeding rate during the efficacy period in the intention-to-treat population estimated by negative binomial model. Safety was assessed as a secondary endpoint in the safety population. This trial is complete and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03417102. Between Feb 14, 2018, and June 23, 2021, 85 participants were screened for inclusion, of whom 57 (67%; 57 [100%] men; median age 27·0 years [IQR 19·5-33·5]) were randomly assigned: 19 (33%) participants to the bypassing agent on-demand group and 38 (67%) participants to the fitusiran prophylaxis. Negative binomial model-based mean annualised bleeding rate was significantly lower in the fitusiran prophylaxis group (1·7 [95% CI 1·0-2·7]) than in the bypassing agents on-demand group (18·1 [10·6-30·8]), corresponding to a 90·8% (95% CI 80·8-95·6) reduction in annualised bleeding rate in favour of fitusiran prophylaxis (p<0·0001). 25 (66%) participants had zero treated bleeds in the fitusiran prophylaxis group versus one (5%) in the bypassing agents on-demand group. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse event in the fitusiran prophylaxis group was increased alanine aminotransferase in 13 (32%) of 41 participants in the safety population; there were no increased alanine aminotransferase treatment-emergent adverse events in the bypassing agents on-demand group. Suspected or confirmed thromboembolic events were reported in two (5%) participants in the fitusiran prophylaxis group. No deaths were reported. Subcutaneous fitusiran prophylaxis resulted in statistically significant reductions in annualised bleeding rate in participants with haemophilia A or haemophilia B with inhibitors, with two-thirds of participants having zero bleeds. Fitusiran prophylaxis might show haemostatic efficacy in participants with haemophilia A or haemophilia B with inhibitors; therefore, the therapeutic might have the potential to improve the management of people with haemophilia.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fitusiran prophylaxis in people with severe haemophilia without inhibitors. This multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 3 study was conducted at 45 sites in 17 countries. Male participants aged at least 12 years with severe haemophilia A or B without inhibitors, who had previously been treated on-demand with clotting factor concentrates, were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 80 mg subcutaneous fitusiran prophylaxis once per month or to continue on-demand clotting factor concentrates for a total of 9 months. Randomisation was stratified by the number of bleeding events in the 6 months before screening (≤10 bleeds and >10 bleeds) and by haemophilia type (haemophilia A or B). The primary endpoint was annualised bleeding rate, analysed in the intention-to-treat analysis set. Safety and tolerability were assessed in the safety analysis set. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03417245, and is complete. Between March 1, 2018, and July 14, 2021, 177 male participants were screened for eligibility and 120 were randomly assigned to receive fitusiran prophylaxis (n=80) or on-demand clotting factor concentrates (n=40). Median follow-up was 7·8 months (IQR 7·8-7·8) in the fitusiran group and 7·8 months (7·8-7·8) in the on-demand clotting factor concentrates group. The median annualised bleeding rate was 0·0 (0·0-3·4) in the fitusiran group and 21·8 (8·4-41·0) in the on-demand clotting factor concentrates group. The estimated mean annualised bleeding rate was significantly lower in the fitusiran prophylaxis group (3·1 [95% CI 2·3-4·3]) than in the on-demand clotting factor concentrates group (31·0 [21·1-45·5]; rate ratio 0·101 [95% CI 0·064-0·159]; p<0·0001). In the fitusiran group, 40 (51%) of 79 treated participants had no treated bleeds compared with two (5%) of 40 participants in the on-demand clotting factor concentrates group. Increased alanine aminotransferase concentration (18 [23%] of 79 participants in the safety analysis set) was the most common treatment-emergent adverse event in the fitusiran group and hypertension (four (10%) of 40 participants) was the most common in the on-demand clotting factor concentrates group. Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported in five (6%) participants in the fitusiran group (cholelithiasis [n=2, 3%], cholecystitis [n=1, 1%], lower respiratory tract infection [n=1, 1%], and asthma [n=1, 1%]) and five (13%) participants in the on-demand clotting factor concentrates group (gastroenteritis, pneumonia, suicidal ideation, diplopia, osteoarthritis, epidural haemorrhage, humerus fracture, subdural haemorrhage, and tibia fracture [all n=1, 3%]). No treatment-related thrombosis or deaths were reported. In participants with haemophilia A or B without inhibitors, fitusiran prophylaxis resulted in significant reductions in annualised bleeding rate compared with on-demand clotting factor concentrates and no bleeding events in approximately half of participants. Fitusiran prophylaxis shows haemostatic efficacy in both haemophilia A and haemophilia B, and therefore has the potential to be transformative in the management of all people with haemophilia.

This enables clinicians to detect changes early and enable adjustments in personalized healthcare when needed. However, data on the course of physical functioning and occurrence of decline is lacking. The aim of this study is to describe changes in perceived limitations in activities of PWH and to identify factors associated with a change. Data were collected from medical health records of regular check-up visits of adults with moderate and severe haemophilia in two time periods. Perceived limitations in activities was measured with the Haemophilia Activities List (HAL). Association between variables (e.g., age, body mass index, bleeding rate and synovitis) and change in perceived limitations was assessed using a generalized linear model. A total of 104 PWH were included. At T0, the median HAL sum score was 79.5 (IQR 62.1-93.6) and at T1 the median HAL sum score was 74.2 (IQR 57.5-88.3). A functional decline was found in 35.6% of PWH, 55.8% remained stable and 8.7% improved. Among other variables, a BMI > 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> appeared to be an important factor that negatively influenced the change in perceived functioning in adult PWH. With the included factors we could only explain a small part of this decline (R<sup>2</sup> <sub>adj</sub> : .12).

The use of these products is well established and permit patients a relatively normal life. To further improve treatment efficacy, recombinant FIX products with a prolonged half-life have been developed, allowing relaxed prophylactic dosing and reducing treatment burden. In this review, we explore the current FIX replacement options for hemophilia B patients by analyzing the outcomes of their main clinical trials. We cover advances in the FIX molecules with extended half-life (EHL). Published literature on products for replacement of hemophilia B was retrieved using PubMed with no temporal limits. The recent introduction of recombinant EHL FIX products has represented a major advance in the therapeutic management of hemophilia B patients, permitting both a reduction of treatment burden and improving patients' compliance to prophylaxis and, ultimately, quality of life."

To analyse the genotype/phenotype correlations in two unrelated boys with severe early childhood obesity (SCO), global developmental delay (GDD) and similar bleeding phenotype associated with comparable Xq27 deletions spanning the entire F9 and proximate genes, and characterise the pathogenic events estimating the most likely mutational mechanism involved. Entire F9-deletions were detected in three hemizygous unrelated probands with HB: two cases, C#1/C#2, presented SCO and GDD and a control patient (Co), who only had severe bleeding symptoms. Dense SNP-array and case-specific STS walking scan allowed characterisation of the deletion breakpoints. Extensive use of bioinformatics, statistics and clinical databases allowed the investigation of genotype-phenotype associations. Patients C#1/C#2 and Co resulted in a complete F9 and additional gene deletions of variable extensions on Xq26.3-Xq27.2 (C#1/C#2/Co: 4.3Mb/3.9Mb/160Kb). C#1/C#2 common deleted gene SOX3 is directly associated with SCO, GDD and pituitary hypothyroidism (PH) whilst C#2 extra-deleted gene MAGEC2 indirectly relates to anal atresia (AA). Breakpoint analysis revealed the involvement of the mechanisms of Alu/Alu recombination for the first time in HB and non-homologous or alternative end-joining. Our results represent the first report of unrelated patients with HB, SCO and GDD. This study and the literature update expand the spectrum of clinical findings and molecular insights observed in patients with HB caused by complete F9 and nearby SOX3 and MAGEC2 gene deletions, which may configure a contiguous gene syndrome."

The objective of this study is to describe trends in clinician prescribing practices for the management of haemophilia in the United States (US). We administered surveys to members of the Hemostasis and Thrombosis Research Society via paper surveys at its in-person annual symposia in 1999 and 2015, and an online survey in 2021. The surveys collected information on haemophilia treatments including factor dosing, inhibitor therapy and gene therapy. Clinicians treating haemophilia for more than 50% of their practice time have increased from 37.5% of respondents in 1999 to 46.3% in 2021. Clinicians prescribing factor concentrates at >40 units/kg for routine bleeding events increased from 0% in 1999 to 29.3% in 2021 in haemophilia A (HA) and from 22.5% to 87.8% in haemophilia B (HB). In 2021, the clinicians reported prescribing emicizumab to treat HA patients (>89.5% paediatric, >85.7% adult) with or without inhibitors at least some of the time. Approximately 78.0% of respondents reported that they expected to recommend gene therapy at least some of time. These data indicate changing trends in prescribing practices among US haemophilia specialists during the past 22 years. Preference for high doses of factor (>40 units/kg) has increased during this period. Emicizumab prophylaxis has been prescribed for patients with and without HA inhibitors. Clinicians expect gene therapy to have value for some haemophilia patients."

Three subgroups were defined by the use of factor concentrates and sex (moderate-to-high factor consumption (factor VIII [FVIII] use of ≥40 IU/kg/week or FIX use of ≥10 IU/kg/week), low factor consumption, and women including carriers). Data of 3246 PwH, representing 30,184 person-years, were analyzed. PwH (including children and adults) used more pain, depression, and anxiety medications compared with controls. This was most accentuated in the moderate-to-high factor consumption group and notably also observed in men with low factor consumption and women including carriers, usually representing a milder phenotype. A higher opioid use was observed across all age groups: 4- to 6-fold higher in the moderate-to-high factor consumption group and 2- to 4-fold higher in the low factor consumption group. The consistent higher use of pain, depression, and anxiety medications among PwH compared with population controls, regardless of age, sex, or factor consumption, in broad national data suggests a need for improved bleed protection and hemophilia care for all severities including mild hemophilia."

    "abstract": "Successful management of surgery in severe coagulation disorders depends on adequate replacement of the deficient factors from intervention until wound healing. Extended half-life (EHL) recombinant factor IX (rFIX) has been increasingly used in hemophilia B (HB) patients. Monitoring of blood levels of EHL rFIX allows to obtain pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in order to optimize and personalize therapeutic scheme. We describe a case of a young male with severe HB who successfully underwent aortic valve repair. This is the first reported open-heart surgery in a patient with severe HB using EHL rFIX. The success was based on accurate PK evaluation and on meticulous preoperative planning and close cooperation among surgeons, hemophilia specialists, and laboratory team despite the long distance between hemophilia center and surgical clinic."

    "abstract": "The past few decades have seen a tremendous advancement in the management of hemophilia. Whether it is improved methods to attenuate critical viruses, recombinant bioengineering with decreased immunogenicity, extended half-life replacement therapies to mitigate the burden of repeated infusion treatments, novel nonreplacement products to avoid the drawback of inhibitor development with its attractive subcutaneous administration and then the introduction of gene therapy, the management has trodden a long way. This expert review describes the progress in the treatment of hemophilia over the years. We discuss, in detail, the past and current therapies, their benefits, drawbacks, along with relevant studies leading to approval, efficacy and safety profile, ongoing trials, and future prospects. The technological advances in the treatment of hemophilia with convenient modes of administration and innovative modalities offer a chance for a normal existence of the patients living with this disease. However, it is imperative for clinicians to be aware of the potential adverse effects and the need for further studies to establish causality or chance association of these events with novel agents. Thus, it is crucial for clinicians to engage patients and their families in informed decision-making and tailor individual concerns and necessities."

    "title": "Prevalence of selected bleeding and thrombotic events in persons with hemophilia versus the general population: A scoping review.",
    "abstract": "Life expectancy for persons with hemophilia has increased over recent decades due to advances in treatment practice and patient care. Those with hemophilia are now more likely to be affected by conditions associated with aging, such as myocardial infarction, hemorrhagic/ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and intracranial hemorrhage. Here, we describe the results of a literature search designed to summarize current data on the prevalence of the above selected bleeding and thrombotic events in persons with hemophilia vs the general population. A total of 912 articles published between 2005 and 2022 were identified in a search of BIOSIS Previews, Embase, and MEDLINE databases conducted in July 2022. Case studies, conference abstracts, review articles, studies focusing on hemophilia treatments or surgical outcomes, and studies examining patients with inhibitors only were excluded. After screening, 83 relevant publications were identified. The prevalence of bleeding events was consistently higher in hemophilia populations vs reference populations (hemorrhagic stroke, 1.4%-5.31% vs 0.2%-0.97%; intracranial hemorrhage, 1.1%-10.8% vs 0.04%-0.4%). Serious bleeding events showed a high rate of mortality with standardized mortality ratios for intracranial hemorrhage ranging from 3.5 to 14.88. Although 9 studies reported lower prevalence of arterial thrombosis (myocardial infarction/stroke) in hemophilia vs general populations, 5 studies reported higher or comparable prevalence in hemophilia. Prospective studies are therefore needed to understand the prevalence of bleeding and thrombotic events in hemophilia populations, particularly with the observed increases in life expectancy and availability of novel treatments."

    "abstract": "Qualitative studies have explored why people with haemophilia (PwH) might consider or forgo gene therapy, the impact it has had on those who have received it, and what support might be needed throughout the process. No studies have yet examined what withdrawal prior to transfection might mean for PwH and their families. To understand the experiences of PwH and their families of withdrawal from gene therapy and to understand what support mechanisms might be required. Qualitative interviews were conducted with people with severe haemophilia who consented to take part in a gene therapy study in the UK but either withdrew or were withdrawn before transfection. Nine PwH and a family member were invited to this sub-study. Eight participants were recruited: six PwH (five haemophilia A and one haemophilia B) and two family members. Four participants were excluded from a study after consenting but before transfection, having failed to meet all the inclusion criteria; two withdrew after consenting but before transfection due to concerns including duration of factor expression and the time commitment involved in follow-up. The mean age of participants was 40.5 years (range 25-63 years). Two major themes emerged during the interviews: Expectation and loss. PwH have many expectations about the difference gene therapy can make to their lives. Studies show that these expectations may not be fully realised. For those who have either withdrawn or been withdrawn from gene therapy, any expectations they had may now be unachievable. The nature of these expectations and the loss expressed by the participants indicate that support needs to be provided to help them and their families manage it."

    "title": "In patients with hemophilia, a decreased thrombin generation profile is associated with a severe bleeding phenotype.",
    "abstract": "Heterogeneity in clinical bleeding phenotype has been observed in hemophilia patients with similar FVIII or FIX activity levels. Thrombin generation and plasmin generation, as a global hemostasis assay, may contribute to a better prediction of which patients are at an increased risk of bleeding. The objective of this study was to describe the association between clinical bleeding phenotype and thrombin generation and plasmin generation profiles in patients with hemophilia. The Nijmegen Hemostasis Assay, which simultaneously measures thrombin and plasmin generation, was performed in plasma samples of patients with hemophilia participating in the sixth Hemophilia in the Netherlands study (HiN6). Patients receiving prophylaxis underwent a washout period. A severe clinical bleeding phenotype was defined as a self-reported annual bleeding rate of ≥5, a self-reported annual joint bleeding rate of ≥3, or the use of secondary/tertiary prophylaxis. In total, 446 patients, with a median age of 44 years, were included in this substudy. Thrombin generation and plasmin generation parameters differed between patients with hemophilia and healthy individuals. The median thrombin peak height was 1.0 nM, 25.9 nM, 47.1 nM, and 143.9 nM in patients with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia and healthy individuals, respectively. A severe bleeding phenotype was observed in patients with a thrombin peak height of <49% and a thrombin potential of <72% compared to healthy individuals, and was independent of the hemophilia severity. The median thrombin peak height was 0.70% in patients with a severe clinical bleeding phenotype and 30.3% in patients with a mild clinical bleeding phenotype. The median thrombin potentials for these patients were 0.06% and 59.3%, respectively. A decreased thrombin generation profile is associated with a severe clinical bleeding phenotype in patients with hemophilia. Thrombin generation in combination with bleeding severity may be a better tool to personalize prophylactic replacement therapy irrespective of hemophilia severity."

In this study, we report post hoc analyses of pooled longitudinal data for up to 6.5 years for rFIXFc prophylaxis. In the B-LONG study, subjects ≥12 years received weekly dose-adjusted prophylaxis (WP; starting dose, 50 IU/kg), individualized interval-adjusted prophylaxis (IP; initially, 100 IU/kg every 10 days), or on-demand dosing. In the Kids B-LONG study, subjects <12 years received 50 to 60 IU/kg every 7 days, adjusted as needed. In the B-YOND study, subjects received WP (20-100 IU/kg every 7 days), IP (100 IU/kg every 8-16 days), modified prophylaxis, or on-demand dosing; switching between treatment groups was permitted. A total of 123 subjects from B-LONG and 30 from Kids B-LONG study were included, of whom 93 and 27, respectively, enrolled in the B-YOND study.

Annualized bleed rates (ABRs) remained low, annualized factor consumption remained stable, and adherence remained high throughout treatment. Low ABRs were also maintained in subjects with dosing intervals ≥14 days or with target joints at baseline. Complete resolution of evaluable target joints and no recurrence in 90.2% of baseline target joints during follow-up were observed. rFIXFc prophylaxis was associated with sustained clinical benefits, including long-term bleed prevention and target joint resolution, for severe hemophilia B."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) and recombinant factor IX (rFIX) for the treatment of hemophilia B (HB) in China. We developed a decision-analytic Markov model including three health states: alive, requiring surgery, and dead. This model estimated the lifetime cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of prophylaxis in childhood, followed by on-demand treatment in adulthood for moderate-severe to severe HB patients from China's healthcare system perspective. Efficacy data derived from pivotal clinical trials, clinical guideline recommendations, and expert consultation were applied to two scenarios (full dose and low dose). One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were performed to assess the robustness of the model. Lifetime cost, QALYs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated, and the results were compared with willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of one to three times the gross domestic product per capita of China in 2021 ($12,551-$37,653). RFIXFc was associated with lower cost and more QALYs than rFIX in both scenarios, which suggested that it is a dominant strategy (more effective and cheaper) for moderate-severe to severe HB in China. In the full-dose scenario, rFIXFc saved more money and yielded more QALYs than in the low-dose scenario (low doses are the typical clinical reality in China). PSA demonstrated that rFIXFc had an over 90% probability of being cost-effective with full-dose and low-dose treatment at WTP thresholds of $12,551-$37,653. Compared with rFIX, rFIXFc appears to be a cost-effective option for the lifetime management of moderate-severe to severe HB patients in China."

    "abstract": "Moderate-to-severe hemophilia B is treated with lifelong, continuous coagulation factor IX replacement to prevent bleeding. Gene therapy for hemophilia B aims to establish sustained factor IX activity, thereby protecting against bleeding without burdensome factor IX replacement. In this open-label, phase 3 study, after a lead-in period (≥6 months) of factor IX prophylaxis, we administered one infusion of adeno-associated virus 5 (AAV5) vector expressing the Padua factor IX variant (etranacogene dezaparvovec; 2×10<sup>13</sup> genome copies per kilogram of body weight) to 54 men with hemophilia B (factor IX activity ≤2% of the normal value) regardless of preexisting AAV5 neutralizing antibodies. The primary end point was the annualized bleeding rate, evaluated in a noninferiority analysis comparing the rate during months 7 through 18 after etranacogene dezaparvovec treatment with the rate during the lead-in period. Noninferiority of etranacogene dezaparvovec was defined as an upper limit of the two-sided 95% Wald confidence interval of the annualized bleeding rate ratio that was less than the noninferiority margin of 1.8. Superiority, additional efficacy measures, and safety were also assessed. The annualized bleeding rate decreased from 4.19 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.22 to 5.45) during the lead-in period to 1.51 (95% CI, 0.81 to 2.82) during months 7 through 18 after treatment, for a rate ratio of 0.36 (95% Wald CI, 0.20 to 0.64; P<0.001), demonstrating noninferiority and superiority of etranacogene dezaparvovec as compared with factor IX prophylaxis. Factor IX activity had increased from baseline by a least-squares mean of 36.2 percentage points (95% CI, 31.4 to 41.0) at 6 months and 34.3 percentage points (95% CI, 29.5 to 39.1) at 18 months after treatment, and usage of factor IX concentrate decreased by a mean of 248,825 IU per year per participant in the post-treatment period (P<0.001 for all three comparisons). Benefits and safety were observed in participants with predose AAV5 neutralizing antibody titers of less than 700. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred. Etranacogene dezaparvovec gene therapy was superior to prophylactic factor IX with respect to the annualized bleeding rate, and it had a favorable safety profile.

The most frequent variants in severe hemophilia B were missense (48%). In nonsevere disease, most variants were missense variants (moderate hemophilia A: 91%; mild hemophilia A: 95%, moderate and mild hemophilia B: 86% each). Comparison with the databases demonstrated a higher proportion of missense variants associated with severe hemophilia B in EAHAD (68%) than in PedNet (48%) and CHBMP (46%).

This study aimed to investigate the molecular pathogenesis of a novel Met394Thr variant causing HB. We used Sanger sequencing to analyze F9 sequence variants in members of a Chinese family with moderate HB. Subsequently, we performed in vitro experiments on the identified novel FIX-Met394Thr variant. In addition, we performed bioinformatics analysis of the novel variant. We identified a novel missense variant (c.1181T>C, p.Met394Thr) in a Chinese family with moderate HB in the proband. The proband's mother and grandmother were carriers for the variant. The identified FIX-Met394Thr variant did not affect the transcription of F9 and the synthesis and secretion of FIX protein. The variant may, therefore, affect the physiological function of FIX protein by disrupting its spatial conformation. In addition, another variant (c.88+75A>G) in intron 1 of F9 was identified in the grandmother, which may also affect FIX protein function. We identified FIX-Met394Thr as a novel causative variant of HB. Further understanding of the molecular pathogenesis underlying FIX deficiency may guide novel strategies for precision HB therapy."

We aimed to rationalize the molecular basis for 598 new F9 variants and 1645 new clinical cases, totaling 1692 F9 variants and 5358 related patient cases. New F9 variants were identified from publications and online resources, and compiled into a MySQL database for comparison with the human FIXa protein structure. The new total of 1692 F9 variants correspond to 406 (88%) of the 461 FIX residues and now include 70 additional residues. They comprise 945 unique point variants, 281 deletions, 352 polymorphisms, 63 insertions, and 51 others. Most FIX variants were point variants, although their proportion (56%) has reduced compared to 2013 (73%); at the same time, the proportion of polymorphisms has increased from 5% to 21%. The 764 unique mild severity variants in the mature protein with known phenotypes include 74 (9.7%) quantitative type I variants and 116 (15.2%) predominantly qualitative type II variants. The remaining 574 variants types are unspecified. Inhibitors are associated with 152 hemophilia B cases out of 5358 patients (2.8%), an increase of 93 from the previous database. The even distribution of the F9 variants revealed few mutational hotspots, and most variants were associated with small perturbations in the FIX protein structure.

    "abstract": "Currently, the mainstay of disease management for hemophilia B, a hemorrhagic disease caused by a congenital deficiency or molecular abnormalities of blood coagulation factor IX (FIX), is prophylaxis using FIX concentrate. On-demand injections of FIX concentrate may also be required, even during prophylaxis, when a patient with hemophilia B is bleeding. Albutrepenonacog alfa (rFIX-FP) is a human albumin fusion gene recombinant FIX, which is administered once every seven, 14, or 21 days, depending on patient preferences and symptoms. Studies have demonstrated its efficacy and safety in a range of patients; however, to date, reports of real-world experiences of the use of rFIX-FP in Japan are limited. We present a case series of three Japanese individuals with moderately severe (FIX activity 1 to <2%) or severe (FIX activity <1%) hemophilia B who benefited from prophylaxis using rFIX-FP in our clinical practice setting. We highlighted the good effectiveness of rFIX-FP in a patient with moderately severe hemophilia B who required prophylaxis due to joint bleeding, which was causing deterioration of his left ankle joint, as well as in a patient with severe hemophilia B and atherothrombotic cerebral infarction, whose trough level had to be ≥5% for concomitant use of an antiplatelet drug, and in a patient with severe hemophilia B who was working in nursing care, which involved heavy labor and night shifts, and who had previously been treated with on-demand FIX concentrate. In all three cases, rFIX-FP improved disease symptoms, and the patients were able to maintain steady states of therapy due to the treatment characteristics of rFIX-FP, which stabilizes FIX at high trough levels."

    "abstract": "Factor IXa (FIXa) plays a pivotal role in coagulation by contributing to FX activation via the intrinsic pathway. Although antithrombin (AT) and other plasma inhibitors are thought to regulate FIXa procoagulant function, the impact of FIXa inhibition on thrombin generation and clot formation in vivo remains unclear. Here, we generated FIXa variants with altered reactivity to plasma inhibitors that target the FIXa active site but maintain procoagulant function when bound to its cofactor, FVIIIa. We found that selected FIXa variants (eg, FIXa-V16L) have a prolonged activity half-life in the plasma due, in part, to AT resistance. Studies using hemophilia B mice have shown that delayed FIXa inhibition has a major impact on reducing the bleeding phenotype and promoting thrombus formation following administration of FIX protein. Overall, these results demonstrate that the regulation of FIXa inhibition contributes in a major way to the spatial and temporal control of coagulation at the site of vascular injury. Our findings provide novel insights into the physiological regulation of FIXa, enhance our understanding of thrombus formation in vivo via the intrinsic pathway, and suggest that altering FIXa inhibition could have therapeutic benefits."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a congenital bleeding disorder with a deficiency of coagulation factor 8 or 9 (hemophilia A or B, respectively) and a tendency for recurrent bleeding, especially into muscles and joints, which may cause orthopedic damage and necessitate joint replacement surgeries at a young age. In recent years, there has been a huge breakthrough in the treatment of hemophilia. Until recently, the only available therapy was based on repeated intravenous injection of factor concentrates (replacement therapy). Nowadays, new therapeutic options are being developed, some already registered and approved and others are still in clinical studies. The new molecules either enhance the coagulation system or inhibit coagulation inhibitors, promoting faster and improved clot formation, and are administered subcutaneously. These developments have had an enormous impact on the patients' quality of life. In the last decade, the option of complete (genetic) cure of the disease has been explored for both hemophilia A and hemophilia B, and multiple clinical gene therapy trials are currently being conducted. In this review, we discuss the novel therapies currently available for hemophilia. We will elaborate on extended half-life long acting factor concentrates, subcutaneous non-replacement therapies and gene therapy."

Increase in alanine aminotransferease is a common adverse event that requires rapid evaluation and an immunosuppressive approach. It is therefore important that hemophilia treaters and hepatologists collaborate at all stages of gene therapy to assess potential safety issues and ensure the long-term success of gene therapy.

Persons with previously diagnosed nonsevere hemophilia A and B with a factor level of 2 to 35 IU/dL were included from the international DYNAMO cohort study. Central measurements of the factor VIII and IX activity levels were performed by the one-stage and chromogenic assay. Relative and absolute discrepancy definitions were used, with the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis-Scientific and Standardization Committee proposed ratio of >2.0 or <0.5 being the primary outcome. Discrepancy was also evaluated in a subgroup of 13 persons with mutations previously associated with discrepancy (≥3 cases reported in literature). A total of 220 persons were included, of whom 3 (1%) showed assay discrepancy: 2/175 hemophilia A and 1/45 hemophilia B. Six persons (3%) exhibited an absolute difference >10 IU/dL between the assay results. In addition, with more lenient definitions, over 90% of participants (n = 197) had no discrepant results. Only 1 out of 13 persons with a mutation previously associated with discrepancy had significant assay discrepancy. Little assay discrepancy was observed despite the presence of mutations previously associated with discrepancy, suggesting that the presence and magnitude of assay discrepancy are largely determined by laboratory variables."

The most frequent variants found were c.278-1806A>C and the association of c.278-1244A>G and c.392-864T>G, identified in 4 and 6 unrelated individuals, respectively. In silico analysis predicted splicing impact for 4 substitutions (c.278-1806A>C, c.392-864T>G, c.724-2385G>T, c.723+4297T>A). Minigene assay showed a deleterious splicing impact for these 4 substitutions and also for the c.278-1786_278-1785insLINE. In the end, 5 variants were classified as likely pathogenic using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines, and 4 as of unknown significance. Thus, the hemophilia B-causing variant was identified in 13/17 (76%) families. We elucidated the causing defect in three-quarters of the families included in this study, and we reported new F9 deep intronic variants that can cause hemophilia B."

    "title": "Colorectal cancer screening in patients with inherited bleeding disorders: high cancer detection rate in hemophilia patients.",
    "abstract": "The population-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening program in individuals aged 55 to 75 years in the Netherlands uses fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), to detect hemoglobin in feces, followed by colonoscopy in individuals with a positive FIT. The objectives of this study are to assess the false-positive rate, detection rate, and positive predictive value of FIT for CRC and advanced adenoma (AA) in patients with Von Willebrand disease (VWD) or hemophilia. We performed a multicenter, nationwide cross-sectional study embedded in 2 nationwide studies on VWD and hemophilia in the Netherlands. In total, 493 patients with hemophilia (n = 329) or VWD (n = 164) were included, of whom 351 patients participated in the CRC screening program (71.2%). FIT positivity and false-positive rate in patients with hemophilia and VWD were significantly higher than those in the general population (14.8% vs. 4.3%, p < .001 and 10.3% vs. 2.3%, p <.001, respectively). In patients with hemophilia, the detection rate of CRC/AA was significantly higher than that in the general male population (4.5% vs. 1.8%, p = .02), and the positive predictive value of FIT for CRC/AA was comparable (32.3% vs. 39.7%, n.s.). In patients with VWD, the detection rate was similar to that of the general population (0.8% vs. 1.4%, n.s.), whereas the positive predictive value was significantly lower than that in the general population (6.3% vs. 36.8%, p = .02). This study indicates that despite a high false-positive rate of FIT in patients with inherited bleeding disorders, the detection rate of CRC and/or AA in hemophilia patients is high. FIT performs different in patients with hemophilia or VWD compared with the general population."

    "title": "The ethics of gene therapy for hemophilia: a narrative review.",
    "abstract": "Gene therapy is expected to become a promising treatment, and potentially even a cure, for hemophilia. After several years of research, the first gene therapy product has been granted conditional market authorization by the European Union in August 2022. The recent progress in the field also has implications on the ethical aspects of hemophilia gene therapy. Reviews conducted in the 2000s mainly identified questions on the ethics of conducting early-phase clinical trials. However, since then, the knowledge on safety and efficacy has improved, and the field has moved toward clinical application, a phase that has its own ethical aspects. Therefore, we conducted a narrative review to take stock of the ethical aspects of hemophilia gene therapy. Based on our analysis of the literature, we identified 3 ethical themes. The theme Living up to expectations describes the existing hopes for gene therapy and the unlikelihood of the currently approved product becoming a permanent cure. In the theme Psychosocial impacts, we discuss the fear that gene therapy will impact the identity of people with hemophilia and their need for psychosocial support. The theme Costs and access discusses the expected cost-effectiveness of gene therapy and its implications on accessibility worldwide. We conclude that it may be necessary to change the narratives surrounding gene therapy, from describing it as a cure to describing it as one of the many treatments that temporarily relieve symptoms and that there is a need to reevaluate the desirability of gene therapy for hemophilia, given the availability of other treatments."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (factor VIII [FVIII] deficiency) and hemophilia B (factor IX [FIX] deficiency) are the X-linked recessive bleeding disorders that clinically manifest with recurrent bleeding, predominantly into muscles and joints. In its severe presentation, when factor activity is less than 1% of normal, hemophilia presents with spontaneous musculoskeletal bleeds and may progress to debilitating chronic arthropathy. Management of hemophilia has changed profoundly in the past decades. From on-demand to prophylactic factor concentrate replacement, the treatment goal shifted from controlling bleeds to preventing bleeds and improving quality of life. In this new scenario, gene therapy has arisen as a paradigm-changing therapeutic option, a one-time treatment with the potential to achieve sustained coagulation FVIII or FIX expression even within the normal range. This review discusses the critical impact of adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene transfer in hemophilia care, including the recent clinical outcomes, changes in disease perceptions, and its treatment burden. We also discuss the challenging scenario of the AAV-directed immune response in the clinical setting and potential strategies to improve the long-lasting efficacy of hemophilia gene therapy efficacy."

    "abstract": "The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of people with hemophilia (PWH) is an important issue, especially considering people suffering from chronic diseases beyond hemophilia. The principal aim of this study was to investigate the presence and relevance of psychological symptoms, both internalizing and externalizing, lifestyle, and HRQoL in a group of Italian PWH with chronic bloodborne co-infections and comorbidities. Furthermore, the research describes the association between psychological aspects and the impact of disease-related characteristics (type of hemophilia, presence of co-infections, and comorbidities) on them. Seventy patients (mean age 46.77±11.3), 64 with severe hemophilia A (Factor VIII: C < 1 IU/dL) and 6 with severe hemophilia B (Factor IX <1 IU/dL), were consecutively recruited from seven Hemophilia Centers in Italy of Italian Association of Hemophilia Centers (AICE). In order to assess psychological symptoms, HRQoL, and lifestyle, three psychological questionnaires were administered (the SCL-90-R, SF-36, and PSQ, respectively). A general decline in the quality of life and an increase in the tendency to adopt a lifestyle characterized by hyperactivity emerged. Inverse correlations were found between HRQoL and psychological distress. Although the SCL-90-R did not reveal symptoms above the clinical cut-off, co-infections significantly increased anxiety, depression, somatizations, paranoia, and social withdrawal. Lastly, HRQoL is impaired by co-infections as well as comorbidities. Our preliminary results must be confirmed to deepen the findings between mental health and hemophilia."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia B (HB) is a rare disease which may lead to chronic disabling arthropathy, resulting in a significant clinical, social and economic impact. In recent years, new extended half-life (EHL) factor IX concentrates produced by recombinant technology (rFIX) have been developed. They have shown significantly prolonged half-life as compared to other rFIX products and improved bleeding control when used as prophylaxis. To date, EHL rFIX products reimbursed in Italy are a recombinant coagulation factor IX produced with Fc technology (rFIXFc) and a recombinant fusion protein containing rFIX fused with recombinant albumin (rIX-FP). The results of extension studies with injection intervals with a median of almost every 14 days for the complete individualized interval prophylaxis (IP) group on rFIXFc and 21 days for a selected subgroup of patients on rIX-FP have recently been published. The aim of this analysis was to estimate the cost of prophylactic treatment with rFIXFc and rIX-FP in adult patients, in the light of new clinical evidence and current average prices in Italy. The cost of therapy was estimated on the basis of the results of extension studies, the average prices reported in regional drug tenders and assuming an average patient weight of 70 kg. The analysis estimated a cost per patient/year between €224,407 and €230,355 for rFIXFc and between €242,259 and €368,587 for rIX-FP. The sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. The use of rFIXFc over rIX-FP proves to be the least expensive choice for the treatment of HB in Italy."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy has demonstrated enormous potential for changing how we combat disease. By directly engineering the genetic composition of cells, it provides a broad range of options for improving human health. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) represent a leading gene therapy vector and are expected to address a wide range of conditions in the coming decade. Three AAV therapies have already been approved by the FDA to treat Leber's congenital amaurosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and hemophilia B. Yet these therapies cost around $850,000, $2,100,000, and $3,500,000, respectively. Such prices limit the broad applicability of AAV gene therapy and make it inaccessible to most patients. Much of this problem arises from the high manufacturing costs of AAVs. At the same time, the field of synthetic biology has grown rapidly and has displayed a special aptitude for addressing biomanufacturing problems. Here, we discuss emerging efforts to apply synthetic biology design to decrease the price of AAV production, and we propose that such efforts could play a major role in making gene therapy much more widely accessible."

PWH may experience disease-specific barriers to access dental care due to their bleeding tendency, which may lead to delays in oral care and severe dental problems. To determine the current subjective and objective oral health status in adult PWH. Randomly selected PWH of the Erasmus MC Haemophilia Treatment Center (HTC), Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were invited to participate. Data was collected using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14NL) and personal interviews. A dentist used the DMFT index, the Dutch Periodontal Screening index (DPSI), plaque and bleeding index to score the dental status. Forty-eight adult PWH were included in this study, 20 mild, 15 moderate-severe and 13 severe haemophilia with a mean age of 44.7. PWH scored low on the OHIP-14 questionnaire (median total score 1.0; IQR .0-3.0), indicating a high self-rating oral health status. The number of bleeding events, bleeding- and plaque index score was not statistically significant between patients with mild, moderate or severe haemophilia. The mean number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT-score) was significantly lower in the group of patients with severe haemophilia (median 2.0) compared to mild haemophilia (median 16.0) (p = .04). Twenty-five patients (52.1%) reported to have encountered bleeding problems during or after dental interventions during their lifetime. Dutch adult PWH A/B have good dental status and oral health status."

The present study aimed to characterize the spectrum of alpha-globin gene mutations in patients who were followed up in a genetic diseases center in Thi-Qar province. A total of 30 subjects were collected from thalassemia patients and 15 cases as the control group. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing were performed for functionally regions of the gene (exon 1 and exon 2). The fragment size amplified was 442 bp in the Exon 1 region and 324 bp in the Exon 2 region of α-globin. The molecular analysis of the sequence of PCR products revealed that 13 point mutation within the α-thalassemia gene included deletion and substitution mutation, while the rest of the mutations were in the intron site of the gene. These results indicated that mutations may constitute a risk of developing hemophilia B disease. Molecular mechanisms in the expression of globin genes are used to help manage patients with thalassemia."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia is a rare genetic disorder, that results from various degrees of deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (haemophilia A), or factor IX (haemophilia B), with an X-linked transmission. The patients affected are in the majority of cases males (who inherit the affected X-chromosome from the maternal side), with rare cases of females with haemophilia (FVIII or FIX < 40 IU/dL), situations in which both X-chromosomes are affected, or one is affected, and the other one is inactive (known as carrier). The hypocoagulable state due to the deficiency of clotting factors, manifests as an excessive, recurrent tendency to bleeding, which positively correlates with plasmatic levels. Severe haemophilia results in hemarthrosis, although recent data have shown that moderate or even mild disease can lead to joint bleeding. Recurrent episodes of haemorrhages, usually affecting large joints such as knees, elbows, or ankles, lead to joint remodelling and subsequent haemophilic arthropathy, which may require arthroplasty as a last therapeutic option. Orthopaedic patients have the highest risk among all for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) with morbid and potentially fatal consequences. While for the rest of the population thromboprophylaxis in orthopaedic surgery is efficient, relatively safe, and widely used, for patients with haemophilia who are considered to have a low thromboembolic risk, there is great controversy. The great heterogeneity of this particular population, and the lack of clinical trials, with only case reports or observational studies, makes thromboprophylaxis in major orthopaedic surgery a tool to be used by every clinician based on experience and case particularities. This review aims to briefly summarise the latest clinical data and to offer an insight into the current recommendations that readers would find useful in daily practice."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a rare X-linked recessive inherited bleeding disorder caused by mutations of the genes encoding coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) or IX (FIX). Patients with hemophilia (PWH) often have a high risk of osteoporosis and fractures that is usually ignored. Herein, we review the underlying mechanisms of osteoporosis and the increased risk of fractures and their treatment in patients with FVIII or FIX deficiency. The PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify original research articles, meta-analyses, and scientific reviews on the mechanisms or treatment of osteoporosis in PWH. The pathogenic mechanisms of osteoporosis in PWH are multifactorial and remain unclear. The available evidence shows that FVIII and FIX deficiency may directly affect bone metabolism by interfering with the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway. Other potential mechanisms of osteoporosis in PWH include thrombin deficiency and the unloading and immobilization of bone, which will affect osteoblast and osteoclast activity by changing the cytokine profiles. The treatment of osteoporosis in PWH includes antiresorptive, anabolic, and dual-action drugs; weight-bearing exercise; fall prevention; and prophylactic coagulation factor replacement therapy. However, clinical studies of the efficacy of anti-osteoporotic agents in osteoporosis of PWH are urgently needed. This review summarizes recent progress in research on the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in PWH and provides insights into potential treatment for osteoporosis in PWH."

To investigate the implementation of primary prophylaxis based on real-life data from PedNet during the last 20 years. All children from the PedNet cohort (n = 1260) with severe haemophilia A (SHA) or severe haemophilia B (SHB), FVIII/IX < .01 IU/mL, born between 2000 and 2009 (Cohort I; SHA n = 662; SHB n = 88) and 2010-2019 (Cohort II; SHA n = 598; SHB n = 94) were included. In SHA, the median age at start of prophylaxis was 17.3 months (IQR; 12.5-26.1) in Cohort I which decreased to 13.1 months (IQR; 10.4-19.1) in Cohort II (p < .000). \"Once-a-week\" prophylaxis at start increased from 49% to 68% (SHA) and 38% to 70% (SHB). FVIII doses were reduced from median 43.5 (IQR; 34.6-49.0) to 30.9 IU/kg (IQR; 26.3-46.3), while dosing with FIX did not change. After 2010 approximately 60% of the patients with SHA and SHB started prophylaxis before any joint bleed. The number of CVADs needed in both cohorts was around 30%. Incidences of inhibitors were unchanged: SHA (∼31%) and SHB (∼10%). Sporadic cases were diagnosed significantly later (median 8.3 months; IQR; 3.7-11.9) and they had more joint bleeds before start of prophylaxis. Primary prophylaxis nowadays starts at an earlier age: before any joint bleed (60% of patients with SHA and SHB). Approximately 70% started on a once-weekly schedule with significantly reduced doses in SHA but unchanged in SHB."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are rare congenital, recessive X-linked disorders caused by lack or deficiency of clotting factor VIII (FVIII) or IX (FIX), respectively. The severity of the disease depends on the reduction of coagulation FVIII or FIX activity levels, which is determined by the type of the pathogenic variants in the genes encoding the two factors (<i>F8</i> and <i>F9</i>, respectively). Molecular genetic analysis is widely applied in inherited bleeding disorders. The outcome of genetic analysis allows genetic counseling of affected families and helps find a link between the genotype and the phenotype. Genetic analysis in hemophilia has tremendously improved in the last decades. Many new techniques and modifications as well as analysis softwares became available, which made the genetic analysis and interpretation of the data faster and more accurate. Advances in genetic variant detection strategies facilitate identification of the causal variants in up to 97% of patients. In this review, we discuss the milestones in genetic analysis of hemophilia and highlight the importance of identification of the causative genetic variants for genetic counseling and particularly for the interpretation of the clinical presentation of hemophilia patients."

Retrospective chart review was conducted on 8 consecutive patients with HB and 7 consecutive patients with HA who underwent major surgery between 2014 and 2018 and received continuous infusions of standard half-life factor concentrate. Median initial bolus dose per kilogram was higher for HB compared to HA patients [90.8 (IQR 78.0-98.7) vs. 52.1 (IQR 48.6-55.6) IU/kg], while initial CI dose-rates were similar [4.3 (IQR 3.8-4.6) vs. 4.2 (IQR 3.8-4.4) IU/kg/h]. Median post-bolus recovery was higher for FVIII compared to FIX [1.70 (IQR 1.23-1.75) vs. 0.88 (IQR 0.75-1.00) IU/mL]. Median factor levels also were higher for FVIII on post-operative days 1 to 3. HB patients had greater mean intraoperative estimated blood loss [285.7 (range 0-1000) vs. 142.8 (range 0-400) mL] and longer median length of hospital stay [9 (IQR 8-12) vs. 5 (IQR 4-6.5) days]. Our initial evidence suggests greater in vivo yield of rFVIII compared to rFIX in the perioperative setting. We identified poorer clinical outcomes in this small cohort of perioperative HB patients indicating that they may benefit from a higher CI rate for adequate surgical hemostatic coverage."

We enrolled haemophilia patients who had received episodic or prophylactic treatment with bypassing agents up to that time. The participants continued their conventional therapy for 24 weeks and then MC710 was prophylactically infused intravenously every 2 or 3 days at 60 to 120 μg as FVIIa per kilogram of body weight for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the annual bleeding rate (ABR) requiring bypassing agents, which was compared intraindividually between the conventional therapy period and the MC710 prophylaxis period. A total of 11 male haemophilia B patients were enrolled. The median ABR ratio for each participant (the prophylaxis period ABR divided by the conventional therapy period ABR) was .33 (2.1/6.5), range from .00 to 3.77. ABR ratios for 9 of the 11 patients ranged from .00 to .60, and 3 of the 9 patients had zero bleeding events during the prophylaxis period. Meanwhile, ABR ratios for the remaining two patients were 2.53 and 3.77, respectively. Although a fibrinogen decrease recovered by the dose reduction was reported for only one participant as the sole adverse drug reaction in this study, no thrombotic events or other safety concerns were reported. MC710 prophylaxis is considered to be decrease the bleeding rate in haemophilia B patients with inhibitors without safety concerns."

Reports of liver tumor development in certain mouse models due to AAV treatment and genomic integration of the rAAV vector has raised concerns about the long-term safety and efficacy of this gene therapy. To investigate whether rAAV treatment causes cancer, we utilized two mouse models, inbred C57BL/6 and hemophilia B Balb/C mice (HemB), to test if injecting a high dose of various rAAV8 vectors containing or lacking hFIX transgene, a Poly-A sequence, or the CB or TTR promoter triggered liver fibrosis and/or cancer development over the course of the 6.5-month study. We observed no liver tumors in either mouse cohort regardless of rAAV treatment through ultrasound imaging, gross anatomical assessment at sacrifice, and histology. We did, however, detect differences in collagen deposition in C57BL/6 livers and HemB spleens of rAAV-injected mice. Pathology reports of the HemB mice revealed many pathological phenomena, including fibrosis and inflammation in the livers and spleens across different AAV-injected HemB mice. Mice from both cohorts injected with the TTR-hFIX vector demonstrated minimal adverse events. While not tumorigenic, high dose of rAAVs, especially those with incomplete genomes, can influence liver and spleen health negatively that could be problematic for cementing AAVs as a broad therapeutic option in the clinic."

The aPTT-CWA was generated by an optical detection system (ACL-TOP™ 500 coagulation analyzer) and the other tests were performed as per instructions from the manufacturer in the kit. A total of 75 samples (47-HA, 16-HAWI, and 12-HB) with prolonged aPTT were recruited. On analyzing the quantitative aPTT-CWA data of HA (non-inhibitors) and HB samples, the width of acceleration 1 [+] peak was the differentiating finding. Among the significant parameters, the second derivative [+] peak was lower in both mild and moderate HA, equating to HB. The time for the height of 1/2 fibrin formation and width of velocity was significantly higher in mild, moderate and severe HA. The study did not show any significant differentiating finding while comparing HAWI and hemophilia A non-inhibitors (HANI). In the subgroups of HAWI and HANI with aPTT <70 s and 70-100 s, the second derivative [+] peak (2A) was higher and the time for the height of 1/2 fibrin formation (1C) was lesser in HAWI. The aPTT-CWA parameters may be supportive for the differentiation of hemophilia including its severity and the existence of inhibitors."

Bleeding was completely eliminated in 2 out of 3 participants. One participant required on-demand FIX replacement therapy per protocol because of elective surgical procedures, for 2 reported bleeding episodes, and twice for a single self-administered infusion because of an unreported reason. One participant experienced 2 mild, self-limiting AEs shortly after dosing. During the 3-year study period, there were no clinically significant elevations in liver enzymes, no requirement for steroids, no FIX inhibitor development, and no late-emergent safety events in any participant. Etranacogene dezaparvovec was safe and effective in adults with hemophilia B over 3 years after administration. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03489291."

    "abstract": "The cloning of the factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX) genes in the 1980s has led to a succession of clinical advances starting with the advent of molecular diagnostic for hemophilia, followed by the development of recombinant clotting factor replacement therapy. Now gene therapy beckons on the back of decades of research that has brought us to the final stages of the approval of 2 products in Europe and United States, thus heralding a new era in the treatment of the hemophilias. Valoctocogene roxaparvovec, the first gene therapy for treatment of hemophilia A, has been granted conditional marketing authorization in Europe. Another approach (etranacogene dezaparvovec, AMT-061) for hemophilia B is also under review by regulators. There are several other gene therapy approaches in earlier stages of development. These approaches entail a one-off infusion of a genetically modified adeno-associated virus (AAV) engineered to deliver either the FVIII or FIX gene to the liver, leading to the continuous endogenous synthesis and secretion of the missing coagulation factor into the circulation by the hepatocytes, thus preventing or reducing bleeding episodes. Ongoing observations show sustained clinical benefit of gene therapy for >5 years following a single administration of an AAV vector without long-lasting or late toxicities. An asymptomatic, self-limiting, immune-mediated rise in alanine aminotransferase is commonly observed within the first 12 months after gene transfer that has the potential to eliminate the transduced hepatocytes in the absence of treatment with immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids. The current state of this exciting and rapidly evolving field, as well as the challenges that need to be overcome for the widespread adaptation of this new treatment paradigm, is the subject of this review."

    "title": "Factor VIII and Factor IX Activity Measurements for Hemophilia Diagnosis and Related Treatments.",
    "abstract": "Accurate measurement of clotting factors VIII (FVIII) or IX (FIX) is vital for comprehensive diagnosis and management of patients with hemophilia A or B. The one-stage activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based clotting assay is the most commonly used method worldwide for testing FVIII or FIX activities. Alternatively, FVIII and FIX chromogenic substrate assays, which assess the activation of factor X, are available in some specialized laboratories. The choice of reagent or methodology can strongly influence the resulting activity. Variation between one-stage FVIII or FIX activities has been reported in the measurement of some standard and extended half-life factor replacement therapies and gene therapy for hemophilia B using different aPTT reagents. Discrepancy between one-stage and chromogenic reagents has been demonstrated in some patients with mild hemophilia A or B, the measurement of some standard and extended half-life factor replacement therapies, and the transgene expression of hemophilia A and B patients who have received gene therapy. Finally, the measurement of bispecific antibody therapy in patients with hemophilia A has highlighted differences between chromogenic assays. It is imperative that hemostasis laboratories evaluate how suitable their routine assays are for the accurate measurement of the various hemophilia treatment therapies."

    "abstract": "Sweden has been a pioneer in the prophylactic treatment of haemophilia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect small changes in joints and can therefore give an indication of a risk of developing arthropathy. To use MRI to evaluate the outcome of the Swedish 'high-dose regimen' and correlate the findings to age, bleeds, joint score and physical activity. The study group comprised 48 Swedish male patients, mean age 25 years (range 12-33 years), with severe or moderate haemophilia A or B. Data on the Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) were available and physical activity was evaluated by a self-reported questionnaire. MRI score was recorded in 188 joints. Twenty out of 48 patients had a score of ≥1 (range 1-13) in 31 joints of which 3/31 scores were in the knees and 28/31 in the ankles. No correlation was found between the number of recorded bleeds and the MRI score or between HJHS and MRI score. There was no correlation between the physical activity and the number of joint bleeds per se, but a trend (OR 3.0) that those most physically active (19/48; 39.6%), more frequently had an MRI score of ≥1 with an overweight for the right ankle. The Swedish prophylactic model offers protection against haemophilia joint arthropathy but will still not prevent osteochondral changes in some patients at young age. MRI of the ankles can signal risk of future arthropathy and indicate need to modify the prophylactic regimen."

    "title": "Gene Therapy for Hemophilia-Opportunities and Risks.",
    "abstract": "AAV (adeno-associated virus)-based gene therapy is a new treatment for hemophilia and has recently received approval for the treatment of severe hemophilia A. It does not suffer from the limitations of the current standard treatment (regular prophylactic intravenous injections of the missing clotting factor; subcutaneous injection of a bispecific antibody in hemophilia A) and can, it is hoped, raise the concentration of the missing clotting factor over the long term. AAV-based gene therapy can only be performed once, however, because of the generation of antibodies to AAV. This review is based on publications retrieved by a selective search in the MEDLINE/PubMed database employing the relevant key words, supplemented by expert opinions and the recommendations of the relevant medical societies. Data from non-randomized phase 1 to phase 3 trials reveal an adequate expression of factors VIII and IX in patients with mostly severe hemophilia A or B. Even though they were no longer receiving prophylactic treatment, most patients experienced a considerable reduction, by 53% to 96%, in the number of bleedings compared to previous therapy. Persistently elevated factor levels have been described for up to six years in hemophilia A and up to eight years in hemophilia B. The most common side effect of gene therapy is an inflammatory response with elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (17% to 89%, depending on the study), which may be associated with a reduced clotting factor level and requires treatment with transient immunosuppression. Gene therapy for hemophilia holds out the prospect of freedom from hemorrhage without the need for regular treatment with drugs. The various steps that need to be carried out in gene therapy should be coordinated in a graded and partly overlapping integrated care model (a so-called hub-and-spoke model). Electronic platforms should be used for data acquisition and transmission."

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is an example of gene engineering-based cellular therapy, which combines immunotherapy, gene therapy, and cellular therapy. Historically, the second clinical trial of gene therapy for patients with haemophilia B was conducted by Chinese scientists in 1991, and China became the first country to approve a commercial gene therapy product in 2003. However, China almost lost its lead in this field, partly due to an early scarcity of clear and cohesive policies regarding cellular therapy. Cellular therapy is not only a novel medical practice but also a medicinal product. The increasing commercialisation of globally approved cell therapy products made the Chinese Government issue a series of relevant policies to promote the canonical development of cell therapy and its standardisation in China. Encouraged by flexible regulatory frameworks that have facilitated the development of cellular therapy since 2017, remarkable progress has been achieved, thereby putting China back at the forefront of the field worldwide. Some policies on cellular therapy launched by the Chinese government in 2019 have contributed to the growth of cellular therapy in China; however, the regulation, governance, and management of commercialised products remain challenging. This Series paper aims to provide an overview of the current regulatory reforms on clinical cellular therapy in China with a historical perspective. We also highlight several important contributors that could promote innovation and industrialisation of cellular therapy in China. Further efforts are needed to establish a legislative system with clear and cohesive policies for the increasing use of cellular therapy in China, enabling a more prescriptive, diligent, and informed process."

However, the AAV input doses required were prohibitively high and posed serious risk of toxicity. Here, we performed AAV-CRISPR mediated homology-independent knock-in at a new target site in mAlb 3'UTR and demonstrated that single dose of AAVs enabled long-term integration and expression of hF9 transgene in both adult and neonatal hemophilia B mice (mF9 -/-), yielding high levels of circulating human Factor IX (hFIX) and stable hemostasis restoration during entire 48-week observation period. Furthermore, we achieved hemostasis correction with a significantly lower AAV dose (2 × 10<sup>9</sup> vg/neonate and 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> vg/adult mouse) through liver-specific gene knock-in using hyperactive hF9<sup>R338L</sup> variant. The plasma antibodies against Cas9 and AAV in the neonatal mice receiving low-dose AAV-CRISPR were negligible, which lent support to the development of AAV-CRISPR mediated somatic knock-in for treating inherited diseases."

To describe dosing frequency and consumption (primary endpoint), efficacy and safety of rIX-FP treatment during routine clinical practice in Italy. Patients with moderate/severe haemophilia B on prophylaxis with rIX-FP for ≥6 months, were enrolled in this observational study from October 2017 to February 2019 and followed-up for 2 years. Descriptive analysis included prospective and retrospective data (12 months prior to switching to rIX-FP). Data were collected from 59 male patients (median age 30.1 years) enrolled by 23 Italian centres. Of them, 50 were on prophylaxis during the entire observation period and completed the study. The infusion frequency changed from 2-3 times/week in 86.0% of patients with previous treatment, to less than once a week in 84.0% of patients treated with rIX-FP at the 2nd-year follow-up. The annual number of infusions decreased by about 70%, whereas the mean FIX activity trough level increased from 3.8% to 14.4% (mean > 10% in all the infusion regimens). Median Annualised Bleeding Rate of .0 was achieved across all prophylaxis regimens. Subjects with zero bleedings increased from 66.0% to 78.0% with rIX-FP. Treatment with rIX-FP reduced infusion frequency, while providing higher FIX trough levels with substantial benefit in terms of annualised bleeding rate and a good safety profile."

The aim was to investigate the frequency and clinical characteristics of FMF in patients with severe haemophilia. Our study included 30 patients with severe haemophilia (26 haemophilia A and four haemophilia B). All 30 patients are screened for MEFV genotypes in FMF according to the new Eurofever/PRINTO diagnostic criteria. All cohorts were genetically tested for FMF and thrombophilia. Eight (26%) of 30 haemophilic patients were diagnosed with FMF. Six different heterozygous FMF mutations including M694V (n = 2), E148Q (n = 2), V726A(n = 1), P369S (n = 1), E148Q/K695R (n = 1) and E148Q/M694I (n = 1) were identified. Seven had haemophilia A and only one had haemophilia B. Four (50%) patients had a positive family history and three of them had extraarticular findings specific to FMF. Only one haemophilia B patient received colchicine. Target joints in the knee, ankle, and elbow were identified in three FMF patients. The number of target joints in eight patients with FMF was significantly lower than in twenty-two patients without FMF (p < .05). The annual number of suspected joint bleedings in FMF patients admitted to the hospital was 40; however, 15 (37.5%) were documented bleedings in ultrasounds. Hereditary thrombophilia was detected in seven of eight patients. Our data indicate that screening for FMF may be useful in patients with haemophilia who develop arthritis without prominent bleeding and have a positive family history in many Mediterranean countries, including Turkey."

We highlight the limitations in maintaining FVIII levels using factor replacement alone and the need for escalating treatment such as rituximab and prednisone in patients with acquired hemophilia A. This case demonstrates the importance of continuing to pursue alternative diagnoses when existing ones do not explain the full clinical picture and laboratory data is inconclusive."

The link between FELs and bleeding risk in people with haemophilia B (PwHB) is not well understood. We evaluated the association between FEL and ABR in PwHB. This cross-sectional study extended the CHESS burden of illness studies in Europe and the United States. Recruitment of additional adult males with haemophilia B supplemented the existing CHESS sample size of PwHB and FELs. PwHB receiving prophylaxis were excluded, as fluctuating FELs may have confounded the analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics were reported descriptively. Any recorded baseline FEL was reported by the haemophilia-treating physicians according to the medical records. Generalised linear models with log link explored the association between changes in FEL and ABR. The study included 407 PwHB and no inhibitors receiving on-demand treatment. Mean age was 36.7 years; 56% from the EU, 44% from the United States. Mean baseline FEL was 9.95 IU/dl (SD, 10.47); mean ABR was 2.4 bleeds/year (SD, 2.64). After adjusting for covariates, the model showed that for every 1% increase in FEL the average ABR decreased by .08 (p < .001). Predicted number of bleeding events according to FEL showed a significant non-linear relationship between FEL and ABR (p < .05). This analysis showed a significant relationship between FEL and ABR, where increases in FEL were associated with decreases in ABR among men with HB in Europe and the US."

Early diagnosis and a comprehensive approach to management is mandatory. This study aimed to describe the profile of patients with haemophilia (PWH) managed at Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital (DGMAH) with the view to identify potential areas to improve haemophilia care. A cross-sectional, descriptive study that retrospectively reviewed clinical and laboratory records of PWH managed at DGMAH haemophilia treatment centre from 01 January 2003 to 31 December 2017. Forty-four males were identified, with the majority being adults (~61%). Haemophilia A patients (~82%) outnumbered those with haemophilia B (~18%). Spontaneous mucocutaneous bleeding was the most frequent presenting feature followed by haemarthrosis. Disease-related complications included joint complications and life-threatening bleeds. There was a delay in diagnosis in 11% PWH. Management included episodic plasma-derived factor replacement and bypassing agents for patients with inhibitors. Only 13% of PWH were on home therapy. Prevalence of inhibitor development was 18%. There was a paucity of recorded data regarding prophylaxis, genetic counselling, psychological and physiotherapy support. The majority of PWH were adults, and haemophilia A was more prevalent than haemophilia B. A delay in haemophilia diagnosis could be addressed by increasing the awareness of haemophilia in health facilities. Expanding home therapy and introducing prophylaxis will likely improve the quality of life in PWH. Study outputs have included compilation of diagnostic and management algorithms to optimise haemophilia care at DGMAH."

    "abstract": "Blood coagulation is a vital physiological mechanism to stop blood loss following an injury to a blood vessel. This process starts immediately upon damage to the endothelium lining a blood vessel, and results in the formation of a platelet plug that closes the site of injury. In this repair operation, an essential component is the coagulation factor IX (FIX), a serine protease encoded by the F9 gene and whose deficiency causes hemophilia B. If not treated by prophylaxis or gene therapy, patients with this condition are at risk of life-threatening bleeding episodes. In this sense, a deep understanding of the FIX protein and its activated form (FIXa) is essential to develop efficient therapeutics. In this study, we used well-studied structural analysis techniques to create a residue interaction network of the FIXa protein. Here, the nodes are the amino acids of FIXa, and two nodes are connected by an edge if the two residues are in close proximity in the FIXa 3D structure. This representation accurately captured fundamental properties of each amino acid of the FIXa structure, as we found by validating our findings against hundreds of clinical reports about the severity of HB. Finally, we established a machine learning framework named HemB-Class to predict the effect of mutations of all FIXa residues to all other amino acids and used it to disambiguate several conflicting medical reports. Together, these methods provide a comprehensive map of the FIXa protein architecture and establish a robust platform for the rational design of FIX therapeutics."

At the 1e13 vg/kg dose, evidence of genome editing was detected through albumin-transgene fusion transcripts in liver for MPS II (n = 2) and MPS I (n = 1) subjects. The MPS I subject also had a transient increase in leukocyte iduronidase activity to the lower normal range. At the 5e13 vg/kg dose, one MPS II subject had a transient increase in plasma iduronate-2-sulfatase approaching normal levels and one MPS I subject approached mid-normal levels of leukocyte iduronidase activity with no evidence of genome editing. The hemophilia B subject was not able to decrease use of factor IX concentrate; genome editing could not be assessed. Overall, ZFN in vivo editing therapy had a favorable safety profile with evidence of targeted genome editing in liver, but no long-term enzyme expression in blood."

In this paper we evaluated the separation of FVIII and PCC by directly loading raw thawed plasma to an anion exchange resin (AEX). Under this relatively high ionic strength, most of the plasma proteins such as albumin, immunoglobulins and others were not adsorbed. Five resins commonly used in protein purification (plasma fractionation) were tested. With all resins, PCC was eluted by pseudoaffinity in a calcium gradient step. Afterwards, FVIII could be recovered with a good yield and high purification factor in the salt gradient step with 400-500 mM NaCl. Using ANX Sepharose FF and Q Sepharose FF, the CaCl<sub>2</sub> elution step was introduced after the intermediate wash with 200 mM NaCl, whereas using DEAE Sepharose FF, Fractogel EMD TMAE and Fractogel EMD DEAD, PCC eluted after the wash of the unbound proteins. Our results indicate that three important fractions: (1) albumin, immunoglobulin etc.; (2) PCC; and (3) FVIII can be separated in one chromatographic AEX column and the delicate and troublesome cryoprecipitation can be eliminated, making the purification of blood products faster and cheaper."

Apart from the bispecific monoclonal antibody emicizumab, already approved for patients with severe hemophilia A with and without inhibitors, novel non-replacement drugs designed to reduce the treatment burden of patients with hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors are undergoing evaluation in clinical trials. Thanks to their innovative mechanism of action and subcutaneous administration, these drugs promise to provide effective bleeding protection together with improved adherence and improve health-related quality of life for patients with hemophilia. On the other hand, rare thromboembolic events have been reported with some of these drugs and warrant continuous post-marketing surveillance and investigation of predisposing factors, although the overall safety profile of most of these drugs is good. Finally, new challenges need to be faced in the clinical and laboratory monitoring of the hemostatic status in patients treated with these innovative therapies.

Participants from Phase 2 b (<i>N</i> = 3; NCT03489291) and 3 studies (<i>N</i> = 52; NCT03569891) were included. Two participants who did not respond to treatment were excluded. FIX activity was assessed by one-stage activated partial thromboplastin time assay. FIX activity levels at Month 6 post-treatment were considered baseline. Bayesian and Frequentist linear mixed models predicted FIX activity levels up to 25.5 years at an individual and population level with pre-treatment adeno-associated virus 5 (AAV5) neutralizing antibody (NAb) status as primary covariate. Bayesian and Frequentist linear mixed models predicted no more than 6/55 (10.91%) observed participants would have FIX activity levels <2% up to 25.5 years post-infusion. Bayesian model-based predictions of future participants suggest >80% would be free from prophylactic FIX replacement products 25.5 years post-infusion. Both models predicted FIX activity levels were not significantly influenced by pre-treatment AAV5 NAb status. People with hemophilia B receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec would likely achieve durable FIX activity levels and remain free of prophylactic FIX replacement products for up to 25.5 years following single administration. The long-term factor IX durability predictions are based on statistical methods and results <i>in vivo</i> may differ."

To evaluate the prevalence of age-related comorbidities, mortality, health service utilisation and predictors of hospitalisation in PWH compared to the general population. We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using linked administrative data. Men with haemophilia were identified in Alberta, Canada (2012-2019) with a validated case definition and were age-matched with male population controls. We calculated the prevalence of major comorbidities, all-cause mortality, and examined health service utilisation including Emergency Department visits and hospitalisations. Logistic regression was applied to identify predictors of hospitalisation. We identified 198 and 329 persons with moderately severe haemophilia and mild/moderate, respectively. Moderately severe haemophilia had a higher risk of death (standardised mortality ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-6.3) compared to the general population. PWH had a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension, liver diseases and malignancies than controls. Moderately severe haemophilia was associated with significantly higher rates of hospitalisations (52.5% vs. 14.5%), Emergency Department visits (89.1% vs. 62.7%) and intensive care admissions (8.9% vs. 2.3%). Age > 65 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.8) and presence of multiple comorbidities (aOR 3.9) were significant predictors of hospitalisations among PWH. Despite advanced care, haemophilia is associated with higher acute care utilisation than the general population, highlighting the substantial burden of illness on patients and the health care system."

In patients on intermediate dose nadroparin (5700 IU once daily) we assessed the incidence of bioaccumulation (trough anti-Xa level > 0.2 IU/mL) stratified according to presence of AKI. We quantified this association using multilevel analyses. To assess robustness of our observations, we explored the association between AKI and anti-Xa activity in patients receiving high dose nadroparin (> 5700 IU). 108 patients received intermediate dose nadroparin, of whom 24 had AKI during 36 anti-Xa measurements. One patient with AKI (4.2% [95%CI 0.1-21%]) and 1 without (1.2% [95%CI 0.03-6.5%]) developed bioaccumulation (p = 0.39). Development of AKI was associated with a mean increase of 0.04 (95%CI 0.02-0.05) IU/ml anti-Xa activity. There was no statistically significant association between anti-Xa activity and AKI in 51 patients on high dose nadroparin. There were four major bleeding events, all in patients on high dose nadroparin. In conclusion, Bioaccumulation of an intermediate dose nadroparin did not occur to a significant extent in critically ill patients with COVID-19 complicated by AKI.

    "abstract": "People with non-severe haemophilia appear to be under-treated in many countries, and this may lead to joint damage and worsen quality of life. To review literature for clotting factor replacement prophylaxis in people with non-severe haemophilia A and B (HA/HB) in relation to long-term outcomes to support clinical decision-making. A targeted literature search was performed to identify studies published between 2000 and 2021 that included prophylaxis in people with non-severe HA/HB and long-term outcomes, including annualized bleeding rates, joint health and quality of life. Although eligible articles included 2737 and 2272 people with mild or moderate HA, respectively, only 22% (n = 609) and 29% (n = 668) reported treatment regimens. A total of 549 people with moderate HA were treated with factor replacement prophylaxis and were from high-income countries. On the contrary, nearly all people with mild HA received desmopressin (n = 599). Details of treatment regimens for women with haemophilia and people with HB were sparse. Three studies provided long-term outcomes for people with moderate haemophilia who received prophylaxis with factor concentrate, supporting early prophylaxis in people with a frequent bleeding phenotype regardless of their endogenous clotting factor level to preserve joint health. There remain large knowledge gaps when considering how to provide optimal treatment for people with non-severe haemophilia. Nonetheless, there is a strong rationale that prophylaxis should be considered early in life according to similar strategies as for severe haemophilia for those with a frequent severe bleeding phenotype."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia is characterized by bleeding complications resulting from clotting factor VIII (FVIII) or IX (FIX) deficiency. Identifying the causal pathogenic genetic variant denotes a vital aspect of haemophilia management. This study evaluated the accessibility and performances of genetic testing for haemophilia across Europe. The types of genetic analyses, techniques used, turn-around time (TAT) and costs were collected and analysed, as were data updating and quality control. Reported data were retrieved from open access resources, including international databases, Google, laboratory websites, PubMed and government organizations. Overall, 51 genetic laboratories across 15 European countries providing recently updated molecular haemophilia testing were identified. Gene sequencing for small variants of both F8 and F9 genes was provided in most surveyed laboratories. Almost two-thirds of them offer analysis for inversions using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and detection of copy number variation (CNV) using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Cost and TAT were found to vary considerably. In total, 74% of laboratories exhibited a last modified date or change history. The same percentage of laboratories was in possession of an ISO 15189 standard accreditation, whereas only few of them recently performed external quality assessment schemes (EQA) for haemophilia. Despite several initiatives to improve access to genetic testing for haemophilia, such access must still be improved. Our study similarly revealed the large heterogeneity of the variants tested, techniques employed, TAT, cost and quality among the surveyed laboratories."

This multicentre, open-label study investigated safety, tolerability, and efficacy of long-term weekly prophylactic marstacimab treatment in participants with severe haemophilia A and B, with or without inhibitors. Adult participants were enrolled from a previous phase Ib/II study or de novo and assigned to one of two subcutaneous (SC) marstacimab doses: once-weekly 300 mg or a 300-mg loading dose followed by once-weekly 150-mg doses, for up to 365 days. Study end-points included safety assessments and annualised bleeding rates (ABRs). Of 20 enrolled participants, 18 completed the study. Overall, 70% of participants had treatment-emergent adverse events, including injection site reactions, injection site haematoma, and haemarthrosis. No treatment-related serious adverse events or thrombotic events occurred. Across all dose cohorts, mean and median on-study ABRs ranged from 0 to 3.6 and 0 to 2.5 bleeding episodes/participant/year respectively, demonstrating comparable efficacy to that observed in the short-term parent study. No treatment-induced anti-drug antibodies were detected. Once-weekly SC marstacimab prophylaxis was well tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile, and maintained long-term efficacy up to 365 days. (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier, NCT03363321)."

    "abstract": "Marzeptacog alfa (activated) (MarzAA) is an activated recombinant human FVII (rFVIIa) variant developed as subcutaneous (s.c.) administration for the treatment or prevention of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A (HA) or hemophilia B (HB) with inhibitors and other rare bleeding disorders. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling was applied for dose selection for a pivotal phase III clinical trial evaluating s.c. MarzAA for episodic treatment of spontaneous or traumatic bleeding episodes. The population PK model used MarzAA intravenous and s.c. data from previously completed clinical trials in patients with HA/HB with or without inhibitors. Based on the model, clinical trial simulations were performed to predict MarzAA exposure after different dosing regimens. The exposure target was identified using an exposure-matching strategy with a wild-type rFVIIa but adjusting for the difference in potency between the two compounds. Simulations demonstrated a sufficient absorption rate and prolonged exposure following a single 60 μg/kg dose leading to 51% and 70% of the population reaching levels above the target after 3 and 6 h, respectively. According to the phase III protocol, if a second dose was required after 3 h because of a lack of efficacy, 90% of the population was observed to be above target 6 h after the initial dose. The model-informed drug development approach integrated information from several trials and guided dose selection in the pivotal phase III clinical trial for episodic treatment of an acute bleeding event in individuals with HA or HB with inhibitors without the execution of a phase II trial for that indication."

    "abstract": "Prophylaxis treatment is the current standard of care for patients with severe hemophilia. Factor concentrates with improved pharmacokinetics have offered more options for individualizing treatment. The treatment focus may be on increased protection, aiming for higher trough factor levels or longer dosing intervals to reduce the burden of hemophilia. Both aspects can have long-term effects on joint health. Products, such as rVIII‑SingleChain and rIX-FP have been developed to reduce the treatment burden for patients with hemophilia and optimize prophylactic efficacy. The objective of this report is to provide a summary of the clinical experience of different Hemophilia Treatment Centers in managing the switch to rVIII-SingleChain or rIX-FP in patients with hemophilia. This report summarizes a selection of patient cases presented at the 3rd Alliance for Coagulation Academy Meeting in October 2020. The cases from the participating centers provide examples of the clinical experience in managing patients' switch to rVIII-SingleChain and rIX‑FP, including which types of patients are suitable for switching, and practical steps in managing a switch. It is important to take into consideration the physical and social fulfillment of the patient when deciding to switch to rVIII-SingleChain or rIX-FP. The physician plays an important role in the motivation of patients as they understand not only the patient's needs but the potential benefits of the new treatment. The selected patient cases reported here demonstrate that patients may wish to switch factor products for a variety of reasons; therefore, it is critical to understand why patients switch and what they expect from switching."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is seldom reported in the hemophilia population. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of NAFLD and associated factors in PWH. Data of this cross-sectional study were obtained from a multicenter collaborative registry database. A total of 163 moderate or severe PWH with a complete data of liver examination were analyzed. There were 77 (47.2%) PWH diagnosed with NAFLD. The multivariate analysis showed that overweight/obesity was associated with NAFLD (OR, 4.31, <i>P</i> < .001). In comparison with hemophilia B patients, hemophilia A patients showed a weaker correlation with NAFLD, (OR, 0.30, <i>P</i> = .009). A total of 17 (25.8%) PWH with NAFLD had an elevated level of alanine transaminase (ALT). Both overweight/obesity and presence of inhibitor to clotting factor were independently associated with elevated ALT in PWH with NAFLD. The study indicated that a high prevalence of NAFLD existed in the hemophilia population. Overweight/obesity was an independent factor for NAFLD and elevated ALT."

    "abstract": "The development of inhibitors against factor FIX (FIX) is the most serious complication of FIX replacement therapy in haemophilia B (HB) patients. Currently, only few cohorts of HB inhibitor patients have been reported worldwide. This Chinese nationwide study of HB inhibitor patients explored their risk factors for FIX inhibitor development and experience on their management. We retrospectively analysed patient characteristics, F9 genotypes, treatment strategies and outcomes of HB inhibitor patients registered to the Chinese National Registry and Patient Organization Registry. Forty-four unique HB inhibitor patients were identified in 4485 unique HB patients registered by year 2021 to the two Registries. Inhibitor diagnosis were usually delayed and the low prevalence (.98%) may suggest some inhibitor patients were not identified. Their median age at inhibitor diagnosis was 7.5 (IQR, 3.0-14.8) years. Most patients (95.5%) had high-titre inhibitors. Allergic/Anaphylactic reactions occurred in 59.1% patients. Large deletions and nonsense mutations were the most common F9 mutation types in our FIX inhibitor patients. Patients with large F9 gene deletions were more likely to develop inhibitors (p = .0002), while those with missense mutations had a low risk (p < .0001). Thirteen (29.5%) patients received immune tolerance induction (ITI) therapy using low-dose prothrombin complex concentrate regimens. Twelve completed ITI with three (25.0%) achieving success. Nephrotic syndrome developed in two (16.7%) patients during ITI. This study reports the largest Chinese cohort of HB inhibitor patients. Large deletions were most significantly associated with inhibitor development. Low-dose ITI might be feasible for FIX inhibitor eradication."

    "abstract": "The challenge of pregnancy can be significant to the point of being life-threatening in a woman with a bleeding disorder. Additionally there can be a risk to the fetus and the neonate. A hemostatic defect can affect the course of the pregnancy, but the impact is most feared around delivery in the immediate and the extended post partum period, requiring rapid identification and prompt referral to a hematologist for assistance in management. Identifying the type of congenital bleeding disorder and knowing its inheritance pattern is crucial during counseling prior to conception and in preparation for delivery. A comprehensive approach by a specialized and experienced team in a tertiary care center with access to adequate laboratory monitoring and therapies can facilitate the process. The multidisciplinary team should include a hematologist, an obstetrician, a pediatric hematologist, an anesthesiologist, and in select cases a clinical geneticist and a maternal fetal medicine specialist. In this review article, we will detail the diagnostic path and management of pregnancy and delivery in women with some inherited bleeding disorders, in particular those affected by hemophilia A (HA), hemophilia B (HB), and von Willebrand disease (VWD)."

The present study is to determine the prevalence and clinical profile of hereditary coagulation disorder, particularly hemophilia B, in Karnataka. The study comprised 150 HB patients with a mean age of 25, n<sub>male</sub> = 148 and n<sub>female</sub> = 2. The samples were collected from hemophilia societies across Karnataka. The detailed history of HB patients was recorded in a predesigned Performa regarding family history, age, time of first bleed, site of the bleed, and bleeding history. In our study cohort, the majority of the 58 (38.7%) cases belong to 21-30 years of age. The mean age of onset was 2.0 ± 1.0 years in severe, 7.5 ± 2.8 0 years in moderate, and 10.0 ± 3.5 years in mild HB patients. Out of 150 HB cases, 102 (68%) cases were diagnosed as severe, 30 (20%) as moderate, and 18 (12%) as mild. Mean factor IX levels were 0.6 ± 0.2, 2.5 ± 1.3, and 8.0 ± 2.6 in the severe, moderate, and mild group, respectively. A family history of bleeding was observed in 97 [64.7%] HB patients. Forty-seven (32.3%) HB patients had a history of consanguinity. The most common initial site of bleed was in joints in 86 [57.3%]. The present study is one of the fewer studies from Karnataka studying the demographic and clinicopathological features of hemophilia B. Early diagnosis can be only helpful with knowledge of spectral presentation of hemophilia B in a local population."

    "abstract": "The session on the hemostatic system focused on new developments in coagulation and platelet biology as well as how therapeutic agents may affect hemostasis. The classic cascade model of coagulation was compared with the more recent models of cell-based and vascular-based coagulation, which may provide better insight on how the coagulation cascade works in vivo. A review of platelet biology highlighted that, as platelets age, desialylated platelets form and are recognized by Ashwell-Morell receptor (AMR), leading to hepatic uptake and subsequent increase in thrombopoietin (TPO) production. Administration of therapeutics that induce thrombocytopenia was also discussed, including Mylotarg, which is an antibody-drug conjugate that was shown to decrease human megakaryocyte development but had no effect on platelet aggregation. An acetyl co-A carboxylase inhibitor was shown to cause thrombocytopenia by inhibiting de novo lipogenesis, which is critical for the formation of the megakaryocyte demarcation membrane system responsible for platelet production. It was also illustrated how preclinical translation models have been very helpful in the development of adeno-associated virus (AAV) hemophilia B gene therapy and what old and new preclinical tools we have that can predict the risk of a prothrombotic state in people."

    "abstract": "Recently, clinical trials of adeno-associated virus-mediated replacement therapy have suggested long-term therapeutic effects for several genetic diseases of the liver, including hemophilia. However, there remain concerns regarding decreased therapeutic effects when the liver is regenerated or when physiological proliferation occurs. Although genome editing using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 system provides an opportunity to solve this problem, low knock-in efficiency may limit its application for therapeutically relevant expression. Here, we identified a novel gene, <i>APOC3</i>, in which a strong promoter facilitated the expression of knocked-in genes in hepatocytes. We also investigated the effects of <i>APOC3</i> editing using a small Cas9 protein derived from <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> (CjCas9) in a hemophilic model. We demonstrated that adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery of CjCas9 and donor led to moderate levels of human factor 9 expression in APOC3-humanized mice. Moreover, knock-in-driven expression induced substantial recovery of clotting function in mice with hemophilia B. There was no evidence of off-target editing <i>in vitro</i> or <i>in vivo</i>. Collectively, our findings demonstrated therapeutically relevant expression using a precise and efficient <i>APOC3</i>-editing platform, providing insights into the development of further long-term therapeutics for diverse monogenic liver diseases."

    "abstract": "The coagulation factor 9 gene (FIX) point mutation contributes to most hemophilia B cases, providing ideal gene correction models. Here we identified the frequent mutation G20519A (R226Q) in FIX, which resulted in many severe and moderate hemophilia B patients. This study aimed to investigate the effect of HDR and base editing in correcting FIX mutant. We first constructed HEK293 and liver-derived cell lines Huh7 cells stabling carrying mutated FIX containing G20519A (HEK293-FIXmut and Huh7-FIXmut). Then, CRISPR/Cas9-based homology-directed repair (HDR) and base editing were used for the correction of this mutated point. We used Cas9 nickase (nCas9) mediated HDR and the advanced base editor ABE8e to correct G20519A and then measured the concentration and activity of FIX. Furthermore, we used the star-shaped poly(lysine) gene nanocarriers to deliver the ABE8e correction systems into HEK293-FIXmut and Huh7-FIXmut stem cells to correct mutated FIX. As a result, we found that gRNAs directed inefficient HDR in correcting G20519A. The ABE8e corrected the mutation efficiently in both HEK293-FIXmut and Huh7-FIXmut stem cells. In addition, the star-shaped poly(lysine) carriers delivered non-viral vectors into stem cells efficiently. The nanocarriers-delivered ABE8e system corrected mutated FIX in stem cells, and the stem cells secreted active FIX in high concentration. In conclusion, our study provides a potential alternative for correcting mutated FIX in hemophilia B patients."

Once weekly/twice monthly infusions of EHL Factor IX (FIX) products achieve the same target in severe hemophilia B (HB). Gene therapy, which is likely to be licensed for clinical use within 1-2 years, embodies a shift beyond these standards. At an individual patient level, a single functional gene transfer leads to a > 10-yr almost full correction of the hemostatic defect in HB and to a sustained (3-6-yrs) expression of FVIII sufficient to discontinue exogenous clotting factor administrations. At the doses employed, the limited liver toxicity of systemically infused recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors is documented by long-term (12-15 yrs) follow-ups, and pre-existing high-titer neutralizing antibodies to the AAV5 vector are no longer an exclusion criterion for effective transgene expression with this vector. A safe durable treatment that converts a challenging illness to a phenotypically curable disease, allows persons to feel virtually free from the fears and the obligations of hemophilia for years/decades. Along with patient organizations and health care professionals, communicating to government authorities and reimbursement agencies the liberating potential of this substantial innovation, and disseminating across the Centers updated information on benefits and risks of this strategy, will align expectations of different stakeholders and establish the notion of a potentially lifelong cure of hemophilia."

A human FVa (hFVa) expression cassette was constructed, and AAV8 vectors encoding hFVa (AAV8/TTR-hFVa) were intravenously administrated into mice with hemophilia A and B with or without FVIII inhibitors. Hemostasis, including hFVa level, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), tail clip, and the saphenous vein bleeding assay (SVBA), was evaluated. In hemophilia B mice, a dose of 4 × 10<sup>13</sup> vg/kg AAV8/TTR-hFVa vectors achieved a complete phenotypic correction over 28 weeks. In hemophilia A mice, hemostasis improvement was also achieved, regardless of FVIII inhibitor development. <i>In vivo</i> hemostasis efficacy was confirmed by tail clip and SVBA. Interestingly, while minimal shortening of aPTT was observed at a lower dose of AAV8 vectors, hemostasis improvement was still achieved via <i>in vivo</i> bleeding assays.

    "abstract": "Patient adherence to a prophylactic regimen is important for optimal benefit of hemophilia treatment. Despite a growing number of adults with hemophilia in Poland receiving secondary prophylaxis, data on adherence to the regimen are limited. The aim of the study was to assess adherence to secondary prophylaxis in Polish adults with severe hemophilia. Patients were recruited in 18 hemophilia treatment centers in Poland. Adherence to prophylaxis was assessed with the Validated Hemophilia Regimen Treatment Adherence Scale Prophylaxis (VERITAS‑Pro) questionnaire. Data on 270 men on the prophylactic regimen (median [interquartile range, IQR] age, 37 [18-75] years; mean [SD], 38.2 [13.3] years) were analyzed. Median (IQR) VERITAS‑Pro score for the study population was 36 (24-76) years; mean (SD), 37.7 (9.9) years, indicating general adherence to the prophylactic regimen. The median subscale scores ranged from 4 for Dosing to 8 for Planning (means, 5.6 and 7.7, respectively). The most pronounced difference in the subscale scores between adherent and nonadherent patients was recorded for Dosing (median, 4 vs 10; mean, 5.3 vs 9.3) and Remembering (median, 5 vs 11; mean, 5.7 vs 10.7). The overall adherence rate was 94%. Our results show a high rate of adherence to hemophilia prophylaxis by Polish adults. Problems with the management of clotting factor stocks and remembering about the injection of the clotting factor were identified as potential barriers to adherence in adults with hemophilia in Poland."

    "abstract": "The introduction of extended factor IX (FIX) products has significantly facilitated the treatment of hemophilia B patients. However, optimal perioperative management remains a topic of hot debate, particularly in surgeries with high bleeding risk. For the first time, we report here a patient with mild hemophilia B and degenerative aneurysms of aortic root and ascending aorta undergoing elective Bentall's operation with full cardiopulmonary bypass, who was successfully managed with eftrenonacog alfa (Alprolix<sup>®</sup>), a recombinant FIX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc). rFIXFc could safely be monitored using the Pathromtin SL aPTT-reagent. No significant bleeding was noted intraoperatively despite systemic heparinization as well as postoperatively. Higher doses of rFIXFc were inevitable to reach target FIX levels intraoperatively, whereas in the post-surgery setting stable FIX concentrations were maintained with only few rFIXFc injections facilitating fast wound healing and remobilization of the patient."

    "abstract": "Surgical procedures impose hemostatic risk to people with hemophilia, which may be minimized by optimal factor (F) replacement therapy. This analysis evaluates the efficacy and safety of extended half-life factor replacement recombinant FVIII and FIX Fc fusion proteins (rFVIIIFc and rFIXFc) during surgery in phase 3 pivotal (A-LONG/Kids A-LONG and B-LONG/Kids B-LONG) and extension (ASPIRE and B-YOND) studies. Dosing regimens were determined by investigators. Injection frequency, dosing, blood loss, transfusions, and hemostatic response were assessed. Forty-five major (<i>n</i> = 31 subjects) and 90 minor (<i>n</i> = 70 subjects) procedures were performed in hemophilia A; 35 major (<i>n</i> = 22) and 62 minor (<i>n</i> = 37) procedures were performed in hemophilia B. Unilateral knee arthroplasty was the most common major orthopedic procedure (hemophilia A: <i>n</i> = 15/34; hemophilia B: <i>n</i> = 8/24). On the day of surgery, median total dose in adults/adolescents was 81 IU/kg for rFVIIIFc and 144 IU/kg for rFIXFc; most major procedures required ≤2 injections (including loading dose). Through days 1-14, most major procedures had ≤1 injection/day. Hemostasis was rated excellent (rFVIIIFc: <i>n</i> = 39/42; rFIXFc: <i>n</i> = 29/33) or good (<i>n</i> = 3/42; <i>n</i> = 4/33) in evaluable major surgeries, with blood loss comparable with subjects without hemophilia. Most minor procedures in adults/adolescents required one injection on the day of surgery, including median loading dose of 51 IU/kg (rFVIIIFc) and 80 IU/kg (rFIXFc). No major treatment-related safety concerns were identified. No subjects developed inhibitors or serious vascular thromboembolic events. rFVIIIFc and rFIXFc were efficacious and well tolerated for the management of perioperative hemostasis across a wide spectrum of major and minor surgeries in hemophilia."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia is an X-linked lifelong congenital bleeding disorder that is caused by insufficient levels of factor VIII (FVIII; haemophilia A) or factor IX (FIX; haemophilia B) and characterized by spontaneous and trauma-related bleeding episodes. The cornerstone of the treatment, factor replacement, constitutes several difficulties, including frequent injections due to the short half-life of recombinant factors, intravenous administration and the risk of inhibitor development. While extended half-life factors and subcutaneous novel molecules enhanced the quality of life, initial successes with gene therapy offer a significant hope for cure. Although adeno-associated viral (AAV)-based gene therapy is one of the most emerging approaches for treatment of haemophilia, there are still challenges in vector immunogenicity, potency and efficacy, genotoxicity and persistence. As the approval for the first gene therapy product is coming closer, eligibility criteria for patient selection, multidisciplinary approach for optimal delivery and follow-up and development of new pricing policies and reimbursement models should be concerned. Therefore, this review addresses the unmet needs of current haemophilia treatment and explains the rationale and principles of gene therapy. Limitations and challenges are discussed from a global and national perspective and recommendations are provided to adopt the gene therapies faster and more sufficient for the haemophilia patients in developing countries like Turkey."

    "title": "[Dental management of patients with haemophilia].",
    "abstract": "Haemophilia A and B are one of the most common inherited bleeding disorders. Nevertheless, people with congenital haemorrhagic diatheses comprise a small proportion of the total population. Therefore, treating such patients can be a challenge for dentists, as most of them have no experience in the dental management of these cases. As a result, dental care is often neglected in this cohort of patients. Despite the potential bleeding risk of the dental procedures, the most routine, non-surgical interventions can be performed in a general dental practice after consultation with a haematologist and in adherence to protocols. A guideline on the possibilities of comprehensive dental treatment of patients with congenital bleeding disorders has not been published in Hungary. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to review the literature on dental management of patients with haemophilia and to summarize treatment options in all fields of dentistry. This systematic review of the literature may be useful for dentists to treat patients with haemophilia more confidently and to overcome the difficulties in dental care. The article also provides professionals involved in the management of haemophilia with a practical summary of dental interventions."

    "title": "Generation of an mESC model with a human hemophilia B nonsense mutation via CRISPR/Cas9 technology.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia B is a rare inherited genetic bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or lack of coagulation factor IX, the gene for which (F9) is located on the X chromosome. Hemophilia B is currently incurable and the standard treatment is coagulation factor replacement therapy. Although gene therapy has the potential to cure hemophilia, significant barriers are still needed to be overcome, e.g., off-target effects and immunoreactivity, so new approaches must be explored. Nonsense mutations account for 8% of all the hemophilia B mutation types and can result in the development of coagulation factor inhibitors. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to construct a mouse embryonic stem cell model with a hemophilia B nonsense mutation (F9 c.223C > T) in humans to investigate the pathogenesis and treatment of nonsense mutations in hemophilia B. First, a donor plasmid with a mutation (F9 c.223 C > T) and sgRNAs were constructed. Second, both the donor plasmid and the px330-sgRNA were electroporated into mouse embryonic stem cell, and the mutant cells were then screened using puromycin and red fluorescence. Third, the mutant cell lines were tested for pluripotency and the ability to differentiate into three layers. Finally, the effect of mutation on gene function was studied in the differentiation system. The mutant vector and effective sgRNA were constructed, and the mutant cell line was screened. This mutant cell line exhibited pluripotency and the ability to differentiate into three layers. This point mutation affects F9 expression at both the RNA and protein levels in the differentiation system. The mutant cell line obtained in the current study had a single-base mutation rather than a base deletion or insertion in the exon, which is more similar to clinical cases. In addition, the mutant has the characteristics of mouse embryonic stem cells, and this point mutation affects F9 gene transcription and translation, which can be used as a disease model for studying the pathogenesis and treatment of hemophilia at the stem cell level."

    "abstract": "To what extent hospital use and medical resources are used on hemophilia care in China's health care system is unknown. This study was based on a single center in China and was conducted to comprehensively assess the resource use for hospitalization of people with hemophilia. We analyzed clinical characteristics, diagnosis, inhibitor status, reasons, length of stay, and hospital costs of 323 hospitalizations in which hemophilia must be considered as the main factor for hospitalization from January 2009 to December 2020 at the Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital in Tianjin, China. There were 265 hospitalizations for people with hemophilia A (HA) and 58 with hemophilia B (HB). Seventy-eight hospitalizations (24%) were for patients with inhibitor (INH+). Minor bleeding (eg, hemarthrosis, hematuria) was the most common reason for hospitalization. The cost of clotting factor concentrates was the major burden of inpatients with hemophilia. Total cost in a single hospitalization of a person with HA (median, 21,281 Chinese yuan [¥]) was about twice that for HB (median, ¥11,060). Expenditure of drugs in HA (median ¥14,157) was two to three times more than that in HB (median, ¥5707). Total cost and drug cost in hospitalizations of people with inhibitors were about two times more than these without (INH-) (median cost in INH+ hospitalizations: total cost, ¥27,303; drug cost, ¥20,445. Median cost in INH- hospitalizations: total cost, ¥17,743; drug cost, ¥11,973.). For hemophilia, the most dominant cost during hospitalization was on clotting factor concentrates. Diagnosed HA and inhibitor positivity increased the global cost."

A retrospective study was conducted on patients with hemophilia at the Hemophilia Treatment Center of Southern Tunisia in Sfax over 38 years (from January 1982 to December 2020). Data were collected in a regional hemophilia registry of the South Tunisian center. We collected 141 cases of hemophilia, 85% of whom had hemophilia A and 15% had hemophilia B. The severe form represented 65%, followed by the moderate form at 25%. The prevalence of hemophilia was 4.4 in 100 000 population. Family history of hemophilia was found in 70%. The mean age of patients at diagnosis was 28 months. Hemophilia was detected in 87% of cases after hemorrhagic syndrome. Bleeding occurred mainly in hemarthrosis (73%), hematoma (70%), and visceral bleeding (28%). Intracranial bleeding occurred in 6% of cases. Thirty-six percent of patients were on prophylactic therapy. Hemophilic arthropathy was the most important orthopedic complication in our patients (38%). Inhibitory antibodies occurred in 16% of PWH. Transfusion-transmitted infections with HIV and hepatitis C were in 2 and 31% of cases, respectively. The prevalence of hemophilia is still underestimated in our center. The severe form of hemophilia is the most frequent. Hemophilic arthropathy was the most important complication in our patients. This showed that hemophilia is still a disabling disease in our country."

    "abstract": "The precise measurement of very low levels of factor IX activity (FIX:C < 1 IU/dL) is essential for understanding clinical severity and risk of inhibitor development in patients with severe hemophilia B (Pw-SHB). However, such measurement sensitivity has not yet been achieved. We aimed to establish a measurement method using clot waveform analysis (CWA). Residual FIX:C by adding anti-FIX monoclonal antibody, FIX:C by adding recombinant (r)FIX to the commercial Pw-SHB plasmas, and FIX:C in our Pw-SHB were determined by CS-2000i<sup>™</sup>/CS-2400<sup>™</sup>, followed by analysis of CWA parameters. The presence of anti-FIX antibody in the commercial Pw-SHB plasmas significantly decreased coagulation potential compared to its absence. The addition of rFIX to these innate plasma samples produced significant changes in three parameters upon adding FIX:C at 0.1-1 IU/dL, supporting the presence of trace FIX:C in Pw-SHB. Therefore, appropriate FIX-depleted plasma containing minimum residual FIX:C was chosen from reference curves of FIX:C (0.01-1 IU/dL). Among patients with untreated Pw-SHB, two had FIX:C 0.6-0.7 IU/dL and two had lower than detectable levels using FIX-depleted plasma. One of the latter had detectable trough levels post-rFIX administration. In conclusion, CWA enabled measurement of very low levels of FIX:C using appropriate FIX-deficient plasma."

However, there is little literature on the occupational integration of PwSH. The main objective of our study was to assess the occupational integration of PwSH and to compare it with that of the general population. The secondary objective was to study the association between individual characteristics (sociodemographic, clinical and psycho-behavioural) and occupational integration of PwSH. A multicentre, non-interventional, cross-sectional study was conducted in 2018-2020 on PwSH, aged over 18 and under 65 years and included in the FranceCoag registry. Measurements included indicators of occupational integration, sociodemographic, clinical and psycho-behavioural characteristics. The indicators of occupational integration were compared with those of the general population, using indirect standardization. The data of the general population were available from the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE). Determinants of occupational integration were explored using structural equation modelling. Of 1262 eligible people, 588 were included. PwSH had a lower employment rate than the general population (standardized ratio, .85; 95% CI, .77-.94). There were more PwSH at tertiary education level than expected (standardized ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.17-1.61). HIV infection, poor physical health and mental health concerns were associated with a higher risk of unemployment in PwSH. Employment rate of PwSH is lower than that of the general population despite their higher education level. Target interventions focusing on determinants of difficult occupational integration could be helpful for PwSH."

In this multicenter, open-label, phase 1-2 trial, we assessed the safety and efficacy of varying doses of FLT180a in patients with severe or moderately severe hemophilia B (factor IX level, ≤2% of normal value). All the patients received glucocorticoids with or without tacrolimus for immunosuppression to decrease the risk of vector-related immune responses. After 26 weeks, patients were enrolled in a long-term follow-up study. The primary end points were safety and efficacy, as assessed by factor IX levels at week 26. Ten patients received one of four FLT180a doses of vector genomes (vg) per kilogram of body weight: 3.84×10<sup>11</sup> vg, 6.40×10<sup>11</sup> vg, 8.32×10<sup>11</sup> vg, or 1.28×10<sup>12</sup> vg. After receiving the infusion, all the patients had dose-dependent increases in factor IX levels. At a median follow-up of 27.2 months (range, 19.1 to 42.4), sustained factor IX activity was observed in all the patients except one, who resumed factor IX prophylaxis. As of the data-cutoff date (September 20, 2021), five patients had normal factor IX levels (range, 51 to 78%), three patients had levels from 23 to 43%, and one had a level of 260%. Of the reported adverse events, approximately 10% were related to FLT180a and 24% to immunosuppression. Increases in liver aminotransferase levels were the most common FLT180a-related adverse events. Late increases in aminotransferase levels occurred in patients who had received prolonged tacrolimus beyond the glucocorticoid taper. A serious adverse event of arteriovenous fistula thrombosis occurred in the patient with high factor IX levels. Sustained factor IX levels in the normal range were observed with low doses of FLT180a but necessitated immunosuppression with glucocorticoids with or without tacrolimus.

Data on the impact of the F9 variant and immune tolerance induction (ITI) outcome are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies (NNA) in severe hemophilia B (HB) and to evaluate ITI outcome and complications in relation to the pathogenic F9 variant. Persons with severe HB in the Nordic countries were enrolled and information on F9 variants, inhibitors, ITI and complications were collected. Analyses of anti-FIX antibodies with a fluorescence-immunoassay (xFLI) and an ELISA method were conducted. Seventy-nine PwHB were enrolled. Null variants were seen in 33 (42 %) PwHB and 12 (15 %) had a current or former inhibitor. Eleven (92 %) of the inhibitor patients had experienced allergic manifestations and three (25 %) nephrotic syndrome. Of 10 PwHB with at least one ITI attempt, eight (80 %) were considered tolerant at enrolment. Immunosuppression was included in seven of eight successful or partially successful attempts. Five PwHB had at least one ITI failure before a successful or partially successful ITI. No NNA could be identified. A high proportion of severe F9 gene defects among persons with severe HB in the Nordic countries may explain the observed relatively high prevalence of inhibitors. ITI success was independent of the F9 variant and attained despite allergic manifestations and previous ITI failures. Inclusion of immunosuppression tentatively enhances the chances of ITI success. No NNA were observed."

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy has the potential to functionally cure hemophilia B by restoring factor (F)IX concentrations into the normal range. Next-generation AAV therapies express a naturally occurring gain-of-function FIX variant, FIX-Padua (R338L-FIX), that increases FIX activity (FIX:C) by approximately eightfold compared with wild-type FIX (FIX-WT). Previous studies have shown that R338L-FIX activity varies dramatically across different clinical FIX:C assays, which complicates the monitoring and management of patients. To better understand mechanisms that contribute to R338L-FIX assay discrepancies, we characterized the performance of R338L-FIX in 13 1-stage clotting assays (OSAs) and 2 chromogenic substrate assays (CSAs) in a global field study. This study produced the largest R338L-FIX assay dataset to date and confirmed that clinical FIX:C assay results vary over threefold. Both phospholipid and activating reagents play a role in OSA discrepancies. CSA generated the most divergent FIX:C results. Manipulation of FIX:C CSA kits demonstrated that specific activity gains for R338L-FIX were most profound at lower FIX:C concentrations and that these effects were enhanced during the early phases of FXa generation. Supplementing FX into CSA had the effect of dampening FIX-WT activity relative to R338L-FIX activity, suggesting that FX impairs WT tenase formation to a greater extent than R338L-FIX tenase. Our data describe the scale of R338L-FIX assay discrepancies and provide insights into the causative mechanisms that will help establish best practices for the measurement of R338L-FIX activity in patients after gene therapy."

    "abstract": "Hepatic adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene transfer has the potential to cure the X-linked bleeding disorder hemophilia A. However, declining therapeutic coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) expression has plagued clinical trials. To assess the mechanistic underpinnings of this loss of FVIII expression, we developed a hemophilia A mouse model that shares key features observed in clinical trials. Following liver-directed AAV8 gene transfer in the presence of rapamycin, initial FVIII protein expression declines over time in the absence of antibody formation. Surprisingly, loss of FVIII protein production occurs despite persistence of transgene and mRNA, suggesting a translational shutdown rather than a loss of transduced hepatocytes. Some of the animals develop ER stress, which may be linked to hepatic inflammatory cytokine expression. FVIII protein expression is preserved by interleukin-15/interleukin-15 receptor blockade, which suppresses CD8<sup>+</sup> T and natural killer cell responses. Interestingly, mice with initial FVIII levels >100% of normal had diminishing expression while still under immune suppression. Taken together, our findings of interanimal variability of the response, and the ability of the immune system to shut down transgene expression without utilizing cytolytic or antibody-mediated mechanisms, illustrate the challenges associated with FVIII gene transfer. Our protocols based upon cytokine blockade should help to maintain efficient FVIII expression."

Knowing the pattern of the disease aids in the prevention of disability and improvement of quality of life in hemophilia. However, there is a dearth of literature on the issue in Bangladesh. So, this study was designed to explore the frequency and site of spontaneous bleeding in moderate and severe hemophilia patients visiting in a tertiary level hospital. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at the department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) Center in Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Dhaka between February 2020 and August 2020. A total of 44 diagnosed cases of moderate to severe hemophilia were included in the study according to inclusion criteria. A detailed inquiry of history, thorough physical examination and relevant investigations were done and were recorded in case-record form. Informed written consent was taken from patients or their guardians where appropriate. All procedures were done according to Declaration of Helsinki. After entry and checking, data was analysed using SPSS version 26. Out of 44 participants, 25 (56.8%) and 19 (43.2%) had moderate and severe hemophilia. Mean age of the study population was 21.31 (± 9.78) years with the majority aged between 11 and 20 years (45.5%). All sociodemographic features were similar across severity.

Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials that evaluated low or intermediate dose low-molecular-weight heparin, low or intermediate dose unfractionated heparin, direct oral anticoagulants, pentasaccharides, placebo, or no intervention for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill adult patients in hospital. Random effects, bayesian network meta-analyses used four co-primary outcomes: all cause mortality, symptomatic venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and serious adverse events at or closest timing to 90 days. Risk of bias was also assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias 2.0 tool. The quality of evidence was graded using the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis framework. 44 randomised controlled trials that randomly assigned 90 095 participants were included in the main analysis. Evidence of low to moderate quality suggested none of the interventions reduced all cause mortality compared with placebo. Pentasaccharides (odds ratio 0.32, 95% credible interval 0.08 to 1.07), intermediate dose low-molecular-weight heparin (0.66, 0.46 to 0.93), direct oral anticoagulants (0.68, 0.33 to 1.34), and intermediate dose unfractionated heparin (0.71, 0.43 to 1.19) were most likely to reduce symptomatic venous thromboembolism (very low to low quality evidence). Intermediate dose unfractionated heparin (2.63, 1.00 to 6.21) and direct oral anticoagulants (2.31, 0.82 to 6.47) were most likely to increase major bleeding (low to moderate quality evidence). No conclusive differences were noted between interventions regarding serious adverse events (very low to low quality evidence). When compared with no intervention instead of placebo, all active interventions did more favourably with regard to risk of venous thromboembolism and mortality, and less favourably with regard to risk of major bleeding. The results were robust in prespecified sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Low-molecular-weight heparin in an intermediate dose appears to confer the best balance of benefits and harms for prevention of venous thromboembolism. Unfractionated heparin, in particular the intermediate dose, and direct oral anticoagulants had the least favourable profile. A systematic discrepancy was noted in intervention effects that depended on whether placebo or no intervention was the reference treatment. Main limitations of this study include the quality of the evidence, which was generally low to moderate due to imprecision and within-study bias, and statistical inconsistency, which was addressed post hoc.

Usually, females are carriers of the trait, while males are affected. FIX deficiency leads to uncontrollable bleeding events, and the severity is dependent on the levels of the clotting factor. The objective of this research was to measure the prevalence of bleeding tendency in Sudanese carriers of HB. In this cross-sectional study, 88 Sudanese carriers of HB participated. The activated partial thromboplastin time test (APTT) and FIX test were performed for each carrier. The frequencies of DNA polymorphism and FIX-linked restriction fragments BamHI, HhaI, and MnII were also assessed. The study was conducted in Khartoum, Sudan, during the period from 2015 to 2017. The study showed that 55 (62.5%) HB carriers were from the Laban village in the White Nile State, and all of them were members of the Shinkheb tribe. The mean age of the study population was 26.3 years. Among the carriers, 57 (64.7%) had abnormal coagulation profiles. The mean value of the APTT level among carriers was significantly increased (<i>P</i> value: 0.000), while the mean concentration of the FIX levels among the carriers was significantly decreased (<i>P</i> value: 0.000). The study also showed a negative correlation between PTT and F assay with <i>P</i> value of 0.000 and <i>R</i> value of 0.578. The APTT is high in most carriers and the FIX assay level is low in most carriers. Most carriers had no symptoms and were not bleeding. The Shinkheb tribe is the most ethnic tribe carrying HB (62.5%). HhaII is more informative for carrier detection than others, but it is of significant value if both (MnII and HhaII) were performed in parallel. In Sudanese, BamHI was informative but MnII and HhaII were best in the mutation detection and for prenatal diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene transfer has successfully raised, and in some cases transiently normalized, FVIII or FIX activity levels in adults with severe hemophilia. Raising FVIII/IX levels, particularly greater than ∼15 IU/dL (mild deficiency), corresponds to a marked decrease in spontaneous and provoked bleeding, dramatic reduction in factor concentrate use, and improved quality of life (QoL). Limited understanding of innate and adaptive immune system responses and hepatocyte transgene expression and stress responses to AAV-mediated gene transfer contribute to the variability in initial and long-term factor protein expression. Lentiviral (LV) and CRISPR/Cas-9 gene therapy approaches may further bolster the range of eligible participants and improve transgene expression and durability."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) are rare inherited bleeding disorders. Although causative genetic variants are clinically relevant, in 2012 only 20% of US patients had been genotyped. My Life, Our Future (MLOF) was a multisector cross-sectional US initiative to improve our understanding of hemophilia through widespread genotyping. Subjects and potential genetic carriers were enrolled at US hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs). Bloodworks performed genotyping and returned results to providers. Clinical data were abstracted from the American Thrombosis and Hemostasis Network dataset. Community education was provided by the National Hemophilia Foundation. From 2013 to 2017, 107 HTCs enrolled 11 341 subjects (68.8% male, 31.2% female) for testing for HA (n = 8976), HB (n = 2358), HA/HB (n = 3), and hemophilia not otherwise specified (n = 4). Variants were detected in most male patients (98.2%% HA, 98.1% HB). 1914 unique variants were found (1482 F8, 431 F9); 744 were novel (610 F8, 134 F9). Inhibitor data were available for 6986 subjects (5583 HA; 1403 HB). In severe HA, genotypes with the highest inhibitor rates were large deletions (77/80), complex intron 22 inversions (9/17), and no variant found (7/14). In severe HB, the highest rates were large deletions (24/42). Inhibitors were reported in 27.3% of Black versus 16.2% of White patients. The findings of MLOF are reported, the largest hemophilia genotyping project performed to date. The results support the need for comprehensive genetic approaches in hemophilia. This effort has contributed significantly towards better understanding variation in the F8 and F9 genes in hemophilia and risks of inhibitor formation."

    "abstract": "Persons with haemophilia (PWH) have a higher prevalence of hypertension compared to the general population, which cannot be explained entirely by the usual cardiovascular risk factors. Neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against clotting factors might have some relation to cardiovascular disease in PWH. However, whether inhibitors facilitate hypertension is unknown. We investigated the relationship between hypertension/blood pressure and inhibitors in PWH. Additional goals were to determine the relationships with haemophilia type, race, and viral status. Records were extracted retrospectively for PWH (age ≥18 years) between 2003 and 2014 from four Hemophilia Treatment Centers in North America and included demographics, weight, height, haemophilia type/severity, HCV and HIV infection status, hypertension, use of anti-hypertensive medications, and inhibitor status. We fitted semiparametric generalized additive models (GAMs) to describe adjusted curves of blood pressure (BP) against age. Among 691 PWH, 534 had haemophilia A and 157 had haemophilia B, with a median age of 39 years (range 18 to 79). Forty-four PWH (6.5%) had a history of inhibitors, without evidence for a higher prevalence of hypertension or higher BP. A higher prevalence of hypertension and higher BP were noted for haemophilia A (vs. haemophilia B), coinfection with HCV/HIV (vs. uninfected), or moderate haemophilia (vs. severe haemophilia). While there was no signal to suggest that a history of inhibitors is associated with hypertension, differences based on haemophilia type, severity, and viral infection status were identified, encouraging prospective investigations to better delineate haemophilia-specific risk factors for hypertension."

    "abstract": "Background: The study aimed to evaluate radiomorphometric indices derived from panoramic X-rays and selected blood markers of bone turnover and neutrophil extracellular traps, with a view to identifying hemophilic patients at risk of developing osteoporosis. Methods: The study consisted of 50 adult men with hemophilia A and B (mild, moderate, and severe). The control group consisted of 25 healthy adult men. In both groups, blood samples were collected to determine concentrations of citrullinated histone H3 (CH3) and osteocalcin (BGLAP) with ELISA tests, and panoramic X-rays were obtained. Images were imported into AudaXCeph software to calculate two radiomorphometric indices: mental index (MI) and panoramic mandibular index (PMI). Concentrations of BGLAP and CH3 were compared with MI and PMI values in patients with and without hemophilia. Results: There were statistically significant differences in BGLAP, CH3, and PMI between the study and the control group (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a predictive value for PMI, BGLAP, and CH3.The ROC curve with cutoff point (Youden index) at 0.40—PMI was calculated. No correlation was observed for the PMI index in any particular subgroup of patients. No correlation between MI and BGLAP/CH3 was observed. Conclusions: Simultaneous use of PMI value and BGLAP and CH3 levels may allow the identification of patients with hemophilia who requirea detailed diagnosis of osteoporosis with DXA."

Abnormalities of the genitourinary tract are a rare manifestation of the disease. Here, we report a case of undiagnosed hemophilia B in a teenage boy presenting with worsening testicular pain and a dumbbell-shaped testis. Scrotal ultrasound identified the presence of a hypoechogenic band constricting the left testicle. Surgical exploration of the left testis was performed with release and sampling of the fibrous tunica vaginalis tissue responsible for the testicular deformity. Histopathological analysis revealed evidence of chronic interstitial inflammation with hypocellular keloid-like fiber formation suggestive of old hemorrhage. The procedure was complicated by a delayed scrotal hematoma. Coagulation studies confirmed a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and factor IX assay of 5%. Scrotal evacuation with the administration of intraoperative tranexamic acid achieved effective hemostasis. The patient is doing well with ongoing hematology review and prophylactic recombinant factor IX administration."

Guidelines exist for the evaluation and management of pediatric head trauma, including the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) protocol, but limited evidence exists for when hemophilia patients present to the emergency department (ED), specifically with head trauma. Literature is limited regarding ICH and hemophilia, which further supports the culture of uncertainty among providers. The objective of this study is to conduct a retrospective chart review to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of ICH, and to describe computed tomography (CT) scan use in hemophilia patients who present to Phoenix Children's Hospital (PCH) ED with head trauma from January 1, 2007 to June 1, 2019. A total of 89 ED visits and 43 patients met inclusion criteria, and prevalence of ICH was determined to be 4% with the patients presenting with varied clinical characteristics and few commonalities. Using these data, we propose a new algorithm to aid clinicians in determining the need for CT scan in pediatric hemophilia patients who present to the ED with head trauma."

Nowadays, the medication exposure of older patients with bleeding disorders has been poorly explored. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of polypharmacy and the medication regimen complexity in older community-dwelling patients with hemophilia or von Willebrand Disease (VWD). The M'HEMORRH-AGE study (Medication in AGEd patients with HEMORRHagic disease) is a multicenter prospective observational study. Community-dwelling patients over 65 years with hemophilia or VWD were included in the study. The rate of polypharmacy (use of 5 to 9 drugs daily) and excessive polypharmacy (use of 10 or more medications daily) was assessed. The complexity of prescribed medication regimens was assessed using the Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). Overall, 142 older community-dwelling patients with hemophilia (n = 89) or VWD (n = 53) were included (mean age: 72.8 (5.8) years). Prevalence of polypharmacy and excessive polypharmacy were 40.8% and 17.6%, respectively. The mean MRCI score was 16.9 (6.1). The mean MRCI score related to bleeding disorders medications was 6.9 (1.1). There was no significant difference between older hemophilia patients and VWD patients. The M'HEMORRH-AGE study showed that more than half of older community-dwelling patients were affected by polypharmacy. In addition, the high medication regimen complexity in this older population suggests that interventions focusing on medication review and deprescribing should be conducted to reduce polypharmacy with its negative health-related outcomes."

However, it is still infeasible because homologous recombination (HR) is inefficient, especially for non-dividing cells. To overcome the challenge, we report that a homology-independent targeted integration (HITI) strategy is used for permanent integration of high-specificity-activity Factor IX variant (F9 Padua, R338L) at the albumin (Alb) locus in a novel hemophilia B (HB) rat model. The knock-in efficiency reaches 3.66%, as determined by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The clotting time is reduced to a normal level four weeks after treatment, and the circulating factor IX (FIX) level is gradually increased up to 52% of the normal level over nine months even after partial hepatectomy, demonstrating the amelioration of hemophilia. Through primer-extension-mediated sequencing (PEM-seq), no significant off-target effect is detected. This study not only provides a novel model for HB but also identifies a promising therapeutic approach for rare inherited diseases."

To analyse a nation-wide Japanese registry for PwH, and to examine risk factors for inhibitor-development. Newly diagnosed patients with haemophilia A (PwHA) or haemophilia B (PwHB) without inhibitors after 2007, and with treatment records traceable from 0 to 75 exposure days (ED), were enrolled in the Japan Hemophilia Inhibitor Study 2 (J-HIS2) initiated in 2008. Of 417 patients (340 PwHA, 77 PwHB) from 46 facilities, 83 (76 PwHA, 7 PwHB) were recorded with inhibitors by July 2020. Inhibitors were observed in 31.0% of severe PwHA, 8.0% moderate and 1.6% mild and in 17.1% of severe PwHB. The majority of inhibitors (89.7% in severe PwHA and 71.4% in severe PwHB) were detected on or before 25ED (median 12ED in PwHA and 19ED in PwHB). Genotyping in these severe patients identified an association between inhibitor-development and null variants of F8 (P < .01) or F9 (P < .05). A lower incidence of inhibitors was recorded in severe PwHA treated with prophylaxis than in those treated on-demand (P < .01). A past-history of intracranial-haemorrhage appeared to be associated with inhibitor-development, while FVIII-concentrates infusion and routine vaccination on the same day was not related to inhibitor-development. The J-HIS2 study has identified significant clinical variables associated with inhibitor-development in Japanese PwH, consistent with other global studies."

Currently, direct-acting antiviral drugs used for the treatment of hepatitis C have become an effective and a reliable option for people with inherited bleeding disorders. The aim of this study is to report the efficacy and safety of ombitasvir + paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir combination in the treatment of hepatitis C in patients with inherited bleeding disorders. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination of ombitasvir + paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir in 10 adult patients with hemophilia A, 4 patients with hemophilia B, and 1 patient with von Willebrand disease who were infected with hepatitis C genotype 1. Five patients had genotype 1a and 10 patients had genotype 1b chronic hepatitis C. One patient had Child A cirrhosis, 14 patients had chronic hepatitis C without cirrhosis. Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid was negative in all patients at week 4 and at the end of the treatment. Sustained virologic response was obtained in all patients. Serious side effects were detected in 3 patients, which were intra- muscular bleeding, erosive gastritis-related gastrointestinal bleeding, and pneumonia. Ombitasvir + paritaprevir combined with ritonavir and dasabuvir ± ribavirin is an effective treatment for patients infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C who have coagulation disorders.

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are the leading platform to deliver modified genetic code of factor VIII or IX to the liver effecting endogenous production. Patient exposure to wild-type AAV leads to the formation of neutralizing factors, which can prevent successful transduction. It is thus important to establish the seroprevalence of the AAV serotypes in people with hemophilia to aid prediction of successful gene transfer. The seroprevalence of AAV6 in UK people with hemophilia B is not yet reported. We studied the prevalence of anti-AAV6 neutralizing factors in UK people with hemophilia B (<i>n</i> = 49). We collected data on people's hepatitis C exposure and treatment with plasma-derived factor IX (FIX) to identify if there was correlation with AAV6 exposure. Serum samples and patient data were collected from 49 people with hemophilia B registered at UK hemophilia comprehensive care centers. The samples were tested for neutralizing factors to AAV6 using a cell-based transduction inhibition assay. Thirty-one percent of patients had serum neutralization against AAV6. There was no correlation between AAV6 seropositivity and previous treatment with plasma-derived FIX products or hepatitis C exposure. Based on limited data, there is no evidence of association between the presence of AAV6 neutralizing factors in people with hemophilia B and exposure to contaminated plasma derivatives. The frequency of AAV6 neutralizing factors in our hemophilia B cohort is similar to UK people with hemophilia A and non-hemophilia populations."

To assess the safety of multiple escalating doses of befovacimab in individuals with severe haemophilia A/B with or without inhibitors. In this non-randomised, open-label Phase 2 study (NCT03597022), adult males with <1% factor VIII or <2% factor IX and ≥4 bleeds in the previous six months were enrolled in three dose cohorts (100/225/400 mg). Participants received befovacimab subcutaneously once weekly. The primary endpoint was safety; secondary endpoints included annualised bleeding rate (ABR) and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of befovacimab. A total of 24 participants (n = 8 in each dose cohort) were treated for 2-47 weeks. Patients treated with 100 mg and 225 mg doses of befovacimab demonstrated improved bleeding control compared with pre-study bleeding rates, with a dose-dependent effect. Dosing was suspended and the study prematurely terminated following three drug-related thrombotic serious adverse events (SAEs): two at the 225 mg dose and one at the 400 mg dose. These occurred in the absence of bleeding episodes or concomitant use of replacement/bypass therapies. No laboratory abnormalities were observed, and PK/PD data did not show correlation between SAE occurrence and levels of circulating befovacimab or free TFPI. Despite favourable initial results from preclinical and clinical studies, a positive safety profile of befovacimab was not confirmed. The lack of SAE-related laboratory abnormalities or differentiating PK/PD characteristics in participants experiencing SAEs raises concerns about the predictability of thrombosis following befovacimab treatment and emphasises the need for further investigation into the therapeutic window of anti-TFPI treatment."

So far, a total of around 800 orphan medicinal products have been approved by the European Medicines Agency, however the utilization profile of orphan drugs has yet to be explored. This study aimed at assessing the utilization profile of orphan drugs authorized for marketing by the Italian Medicines Agency using population-based data. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 21 orphan drugs used in outpatient settings, approved in the European Union before or during the 2008-2018 period and involving 15 rare diseases, were included in the study. The monitored population included patients with one of the conditions surveilled by the population-based Tuscany Registry of Rare Diseases and diagnosed between 2000-2018. A multi-database approach was applied, by linking data from the registry with information collected in drug prescriptions databases. The prevalence and intensity of use were estimated for the selected orphan drugs and other non-orphan medications, used to treat the same rare disease and for which a change in the prevalence of use was hypothesized after authorization of the orphan drug. <b>Results:</b> For some diseases (acquired aplastic anemia, tuberous sclerosis complex, most metabolic diseases) a low prevalence of orphan drugs use was observed (range between 1.1-12.5%). Conversely, orphan drugs were frequently used in hemophilia B, Wilson disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (maximum of 78.3, 47.6 and 41.8%, respectively). For hemophilia B and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, there are currently no other medications used in clinical practice in addition to orphan drugs. Six orphan drugs were used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, appearing the elective therapy for this disease, albeit with different utilization profiles (range of prevalence 1.7-55.6%). <b>Conclusion:</b> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the utilization profile of orphan drugs prescribed in a defined geographical area, and providing relevant information to monitor over time potential changes in the prevalence of these medications as well as in the health care decision making."

We did a single-centre, single-arm, phase 1, pilot trial evaluating the safety and activity of a single intravenous infusion of BBM-H901 at the Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College (Tianjin, China). We enrolled adult patients with haemophilia B (aged >18 years) with baseline FIX coagulation activity (FIX:C) of less than 2 IU/dL, no FIX inhibitor, and low titre of neutralising antibodies (≤1:4) against vector capsid. Eligible participants were intravenously infused with a single dose of 5 × 10<sup>12</sup> vector genomes (vg)/kg of BBM-H901 after 1 week of prophylactic prednisone treatment (1 mg/kg per day). Primary endpoints were the incidence of treatment-related adverse events, change in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST), and development of antibodies against vector capsid within 1 year of infusion. We report the results of the prespecified 1-year analysis following complete enrolment. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04135300, and is complete. Between Oct 16, 2019, and Jan 13, 2021, 12 male participants were assessed, and ten Chinese participants were enrolled and infused with BBM-H901. After a median follow-up of 58 weeks (IQR 51·5-99·5), mean FIX:C reached mean 36·9 IU/dL (SD 20·5). No serious adverse events, no grade 3-4 adverse events were observed. Grade 1-2 adverse events related to BBM-H901 include pyrexia (1 [10%]) and elevation of aminotransferase(1 [10%]). No FIX inhibitors were observed. All participants developed antibodies against vector capsid after infusion. Eight (80%) participants had ALT and AST concentrations below the upper limit of normal throughout the follow-up period. Two (20%) participants had elevation of ALT and AST accompanied with decrease of FIX:C, which remained at 7 IU/dL and 11.8 IU/dL, respectively. This pilot study suggests that liver-tropic BBM-H901 is safe 1 year after infusion. Vector derived FIX:C concentration is sufficiently high to prevent bleeding events and minimise the need for replacement therapy in small populations with haemophilia B.

The HUGS VII study recruited persons with hemophilia A or B age ≥40 years. Participants completed surveys to collect data on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, hemophilia treatment regimen, pain, joint problems, comorbidities, HRQoL, depression and anxiety, at baseline and 6-months later. Clinical chart reviews documented hemophilic severity and treatment. The sample includes 69 males, 65.2% aged ≥50 years, 75.4% with hemophilia A. Individuals ≥50 years were more likely to have mild or moderate hemophilia (68.9% vs 41.7%, P = 0.03) than those 40-49 years old. Among persons with mild/moderate hemophilia, those ≥50 years old reported a higher rate of joint pain (83.9% vs 70.0%, P = 0.34 at baseline, 91.3% vs 57.1%, P = 0.06 at follow up) or range of motion limitation (73.3% vs 60.0%, P = 0.43 at baseline, 73.9% vs 28.6%, P = 0.04 at follow up) than the younger group. Compared to the younger group, the older group reported fewer emergency room visits (4.5% vs 21.7%, P = 0.03), and physical therapy visits (15.9% vs 43.5%, P = 0.01) at baseline. The sample depression rate was 85.7%, but the differences among the age groups were not significant. The mean covariate-adjusted EQ-5D index score was lower in older persons (0.77 vs 0.89, P = 0.02). Older persons with hemophilia in this sample are over-represented by individuals with mild/moderate disease, potentially due to premature death among those with severe disease. Although this group included a larger proportion of individuals with mild disease than the younger group, they experienced lower quality of life, more comorbidities both of aging and of hemophilic arthropathy, and lower rates of health-care utilization."

To summarise Nordic real-world surgical experiences with EHL recombinant factor VIII/IX Fc (rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc) fusion proteins using retrospective data from clinical records at four HTCs in Finland, Sweden and Norway. Factor dosing and surgical outcomes were recorded from HA/HB patients who underwent surgery and were treated with rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc. Perioperative factor dosing regimens were clinician-determined based on local practises. Twenty five surgeries were performed on 20 patients, all covered by bolus injections except one minor HA surgery; eight minor surgeries were in paediatric patients. Median preoperative rFVIIIFc dose for major HA surgeries (n = 8) was 48 IU/kg (range: 35-57), with total consumption up to Day 14 of 427 IU/kg (196-568). For the two major HB surgeries (in one patient), preoperative rFIXFc doses were 50 IU/kg and 20 IU/kg; total consumption up to Day 14 was 130 IU/kg and 40 IU/kg. Median preoperative rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc bolus doses for minor HA (n = 10) and HB (n = 4) surgeries were 50 IU/kg (24-79) and 47 IU/kg (40-71), with total consumption up to Day 5 of 138 IU/kg (49-404) and 100 IU/kg (43-125), respectively. Intraoperative and postoperative haemostatic responses were rated as at least good/excellent for 24/25 surgeries, with bleeding episodes reported in only three surgeries. Nordic real-world experiences suggest that EHL products can be used safely and effectively for peri-operative haemostasis.

Significant covariates were generally consistent across models, with number of target joints, number of hospital admissions, and any haemophilia treatment regimen other than PX all independently negatively impacting estimated EQ-5D score. Higher level of treatment adherence (high vs. low/medium) and use of a prophylaxis treatment regimen had positive effects on estimated EQ-5D scores. Target joints were associated with a 0.04 decrement in EQ-5D score, and high versus low/medium adherence was associated with a 0.06 increment. PXOD, POD, and SOD treatment regimens were associated with decrements in predicted scores of 0.07, 0.09, and 0.08, respectively, versus PX. This study provides a model to estimate the impact of haemophilia interventions on HRQoL, to help assess the relative impact on patient-centric outcomes for this lifelong condition."

    "title": "Molecular therapeutics of hemophilia A and B.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) or B (HB) is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a defect in the factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX) gene which leads to the dysfunction of blood coagulation. Protein replacement therapy (PRT) uses recombinant proteins and plasma-derived products, which incurs high cost and inconvenience requiring routine intravenous infusions and life-time treatment. Understanding of detailed molecular mechanisms on FVIII gene function could provide innovative solutions to amend this disorder. In recent decades, gene therapeutics have advanced rapidly and a one-time cure solution has been proposed. This review summarizes current understanding of molecular pathways involved in blood coagulation, with emphasis on FVIII's functional role. The existing knowledge and challenges on FVIII gene expression, from transcription, translation, post-translational modification including glycosylation to protein processing and secretion, and co-factor interactions are deciphered and potential molecular interventions discussed. This article reviews the potential treatment targets for HA and HB, including antibodies, small molecules and gene therapeutics, based on molecular mechanisms of FVIII biosynthesis, and further, assessing the pros and cons of these various treatment strategies. Understanding detailed FVIII protein synthesis and secretory pathways could provide exciting opportunities in identifying novel therapeutics to ameliorate hemophilia state."

    "abstract": "Factor (F) VIII inhibitors develop in around 30% of previously untreated patients (PUPs) with severe haemophilia, to a lesser extend in moderate and mild haemophilia A and in up to 10% in severe haemophilia B. Diagnostic challenges and questions remain including access to high quality testing, the role for functional inhibitor testing and binding antibody testing, and the adaptations needed in the presence of non-factor replacement therapy. Despite significant gains in knowledge there are still many unanswered questions underlying the immunologic mechanisms of inhibitor development and tolerance. Therapeutic options include eradication of inhibitors using immune tolerance induction therapy (ITI), prophylaxis with bypassing agents (i.e., recombinant activated factor VII /rFVIIa or activated prothrombin complex concentrate/aPCC) or non-factor replacement therapies (e.g., emicizumab) and treatment of bleeds or coverage of surgeries/invasive procedure. Recently a haemophilia centre capacity building program was launched in China to further develop the infrastructure and support needed to improve the diagnosis of haemophilia, detection of inhibitors, and continue to improve the care of patients with haemophilia and inhibitors."

    "abstract": "Management of symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the ankle in patients with haemophilia can be challenging. Arthroscopic ankle arthrodesis has been shown in non-haemophiliac patients to provide similar or superior rates of fusion to open ankle fusion. However, the literature regarding ankle arthrodesis in patients with haemophilia is limited. Our aim was to compare the rate of successful fusion between open and arthroscopic assisted ankle arthrodesis in patients with haemophilia. A retrospective study was performed. All patients with haemophilia who underwent ankle arthrodesis at our centre were included. Outcomes including peri- and post-operative complications, and lengths of stay were extracted from patients' records. Radiographs were reviewed for signs of successful arthrodesis. Seventeen arthrodesis procedures were performed in 13 patients between 1980 and 2017. Nine procedures were performed arthroscopically and eight were open. Ten patients were diagnosed with haemophilia A and three with haemophilia B. The success rates of arthroscopic and open tibiotalar arthrodesis were 100% and 87.5% respectively. Four complications occurred. In the open technique group, there was one non-union. The same patient also developed subsequent haematoma after revision surgery. One patient developed a superficial wound infection which resolved with antibiotics. In the arthroscopic group, one patient developed a pseudoarthrosis of the distal tibiofibular joint which required a revision procedure. The results of this study suggest that arthroscopic ankle fusion for haemophilia- associated arthropathy is a viable option, with the rate of successful fusion being comparable to open procedures."

    "abstract": "Development of haemophilia B inhibitors (HBI) results in the ineffectiveness of FIX replacement therapy. Inhibitor eradication by immune tolerance induction (ITI) is therefore necessary. In HBI, ITI even at high FIX dose is less effective and has a higher risk of severe complications. To characterize clinical features and outcome of ITI on HBI. This retrospective study was conducted in Haemophilia Paediatric Comprehensive Care Centre of China. We used low-dose ITI (25-50 FIX IU/kg/three-times-weekly to every-other-day) with domestic prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), combined with two successive immunosuppressive (IS) regimens. Sixteen HBI children, representing 5.7% of all and 14.4% of our severe registered HB patients, were enroled. Seven cases reported allergic reactions (ARs) proximal to inhibitor development. The historic peak inhibitor titre was median 54.2 (range 4.7-512) BU, and 15 (93.8%) had high-titre inhibitors. Twelve patients adherent to ITI were analysable. Of the nine ITI patients who received rituximab/prednisone (IS Regimen-1), four achieved tolerization in 1.4-43.3 months. Two subsequently relapsed but re-tolerized after a second course of IS Regimen-1. During ITI, the median treated bleed was .39/month (82.7% reduction from before ITI), and the incidence of AR and nephrotic syndrome (NS) complications was each at 22% (2/9). Three ITI patients received modified 'Beutel' protocol (IS Regimen-2) using multiple-IS-drugs, and two had rapid tolerization (.8 and 1.8 months). Inhibitor eradication could be achieved by low-dose ITI protocol using PCC combined with IS. Larger studies are needed to confirm if ITI with IS Regimen-2 is more effective with less complications."

To obtain the perspective of PwH and treaters from Sweden, Finland and Denmark on the management of haemophilia-related pain, depression and anxiety using cross-sectional survey data from the MIND study (NCT03276130). PwH or their caregivers completed a survey about experiences of pain, depression and anxiety related to haemophilia, and the standard EQ-5D-5L instrument. Five investigators at haemophilia treatment centres (HTC) were sent a complementary survey containing questions about the management of pain and depression/anxiety. There were 343 PwH (mild: 103; moderate: 53; severe: 180; seven lacking severity information) and 71 caregiver responses. Experience of pain in the last 6 months was reported by 50% of PwH respondents and 46% of caregiver respondents. Anxiety/depression was reported by 28% of PwH respondents. Reporting of pain and anxiety/depression was associated with disease severity. Whilst 62% of PwH who had experienced pain at any time point (n = 242) felt this was adequately addressed and treated at their HTC, only 24% of those who had experienced depression/anxiety (n = 127) felt this was adequately addressed. Disease severity was negatively associated with EQ-5D-5L utility value (p < .001). In the HTC survey, 4/5 and 2/5 agreed that pain and depression/anxiety, respectively, are adequately addressed. Pain and depression/anxiety occur more frequently with increasing haemophilia severity, with negative impacts on health-related quality of life. PwH with depression/anxiety or unaddressed pain could benefit from improved management strategies."

    "abstract": "Appropriate treatment of Hemophilia B is vital for patients' quality of life. Historically, the treatment used was the administration of coagulation Factor IX derived from human plasma. Advancements in recombinant technologies allowed Factor IX to be produced recombinantly. Successful recombinant production has triggered a gradual shift from the plasma derived origins of Factor IX, as it provides extended half-life and expanded production capacity. However, the complex post-translational modifications of Factor IX have made recombinant production at scale difficult. Considerable research has therefore been invested into understanding and optimizing the recombinant production of Factor IX. Here, we review the evolution of recombinant Factor IX production, focusing on recent developments in bioprocessing and cell engineering to control its post-translational modifications in its expression from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells."

    "abstract": "Nonacog alfa, a standard half-life recombinant factor IX (FIX), is used as a prophylactic treatment in severe haemophilia B (SHB) patients. Its half-life determined in clinical studies involving a limited sampling (72 h) was shown to be rather short. In our clinical practice, we suspected that its half-life could have been underestimated. We aimed to evaluate nonacog alfa pharmacokinetics in real world clinical practice based on FIX levels in patients receiving prophylaxis. We retrospectively collected data on patients with SHB receiving prophylaxis from eight centres across France. The terminal half-life (THL), time to reach 5-2 IU/dl and FIX activity at 48, 72 and 96 h were derived by Bayesian estimations using NONMEM analysis. Infusion data (n = 455) were collected from 64 patients with SHB. The median THL measured in 92 pharmacokinetic (PK) studies was 43.4 h. In 26 patients ≤12 years of age, 51 PK studies showed a median time to reach 5 IU/dl of FIX of 70.5 h and a median time to reach 2 IU/dl of 121.5 h. In 38 patients 13-75 years of age, 41 PK studies showed a median time to reach 5 IU/dl of FIX of 92.0 h and a median time to reach 2 IU/dl of 167.5 h. Extending the sampling beyond 72 h makes it possible to observe a plateau, with FIX remaining between 2 and 5 IU/dl for several days and shows that the THL of nonacog alfa might be longer than previously described. Nonacog alfa terminal half-life (THL) in patients receiving regular prophylaxis was evaluated in clinical practice. The median THL was estimated to be 36.9 h for patients aged .8-12 years. The median THL was estimated to be 49.9 h for patients aged 13-75 years. For patients aged ≤12 and >12 years, the median times to reach 5 IU/dl were 70.5 and 92 h, respectively; to reach 3 IU/dl, 95.5 and 131.5 h, respectively; to reach 2 IU/dl, 121.5 and 167.5 h, respectively. We suggest that the half-life of nonacog alfa might be longer than previously described in both younger and older patients."

To describe the management and outcomes of mild hemophiliacs and hemophilia carriers during assisted conception, pregnancy, peripartum and post-partum period at our hemophilia treatment center (HTC). Retrospective review of electronic medical records of pregnant women with mild hemophilia A or B (Factor VIII [FVIII] or Factor IX [FIX] level <0.4 IU/mL) and hemophilia A and B carriers followed at our HTC from January 2008 to October 2020. Demographics, the reason for diagnosis, FVIII and FIX levels at baseline and third trimester, bleeding phenotype and genotype were obtained. Method of conception, factor replacement, iron supplementation, mode of delivery, type of anesthesia, peripartum complications, and offspring outcomes was recorded. There was a total of 18 pregnancies in 12 women (2 with mild hemophilia A, 2 mild hemophilia B, 6 hemophilia A carriers, and 2 hemophilia B carriers). Eleven pregnancies (61%) were conceived naturally and 7 (39%) <i>via</i> in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Eight (44.4%) and 10 (55.6%) pregnancies were vaginal and C-section deliveries, respectively.

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B is a blood clotting disorder caused by deficient activity of coagulation factor IX (FIX). Multiple recombinant FIX proteins are currently approved to treat hemophilia B, and several gene therapy products are currently being developed. Codon optimization is a frequently used technique in the pharmaceutical industry to improve recombinant protein expression by recoding a coding sequence using multiple synonymous codon substitutions. The underlying assumption of this gene recoding is that synonymous substitutions do not alter protein characteristics because the primary sequence of the protein remains unchanged. However, a critical body of evidence shows that synonymous variants can affect cotranslational folding and protein function. Gene recoding could potentially alter the structure, function, and in vivo immunogenicity of recoded therapeutic proteins. Here, we evaluated multiple recoded variants of F9 designed to further explore the effects of codon usage bias on protein properties. The detailed evaluation of these constructs showed altered conformations, and assessment of translation kinetics by ribosome profiling revealed differences in local translation kinetics. Assessment of wild-type and recoded constructs using a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-associated peptide proteomics assay showed distinct presentation of FIX-derived peptides bound to MHC class II molecules, suggesting that despite identical amino acid sequence, recoded proteins could exhibit different immunogenicity risks. Posttranslational modification analysis indicated that overexpression from gene recoding results in suboptimal posttranslational processing. Overall, our results highlight potential functional and immunogenicity concerns associated with gene-recoded F9 products. These findings have general applicability and implications for other gene-recoded recombinant proteins."

    "abstract": "Knowledge about the risk for bleeding in patients with hemophilia (PWH) would be relevant for patients, stakeholders, and policy makers. To perform a systematic review of the literature on risk assessment models (RAMs) and risk factors for bleeding in PWH on regular prophylaxis. We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception through August 2019. In duplicate, reviewers screened the articles for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk for bias using the Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) tool. A qualitative synthesis of the results was not performed due to high heterogeneity in risk factors, outcomes definition and measurement, and statistical analysis of the results. From 1843 search results, 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. No RAM for the risk for bleeding in PWH was found. Most studies included only PWH A or both PWH A and B and were conducted in North America or Europe. Only one study had a low risk for bias in all the domains. Eight categories of risk factors were identified. The risk for bleeding was increased when factor levels were lower and in people with a significant history of bleeding or who engaged in physical activities involving contact. Our findings suggest that plasma factor levels, history of bleeds, and physical activity should be considered for the derivation analysis when building a RAM for bleeding in PWH, and the role of other risk factors, including antithrombotic treatment and obesity, should be explored."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia B is a rare X-linked genetic deficiency of coagulation factor IX (FIX) that, if untreated, can cause recurrent and disabling bleeding, potentially leading to severe arthropathy and/or life-threatening haemorrhage. Recent decades have brought significant improvements in haemophilia B management, including the advent of recombinant FIX and extended half-life FIX. This therapeutic landscape continues to evolve with several non-factor replacement therapies and gene therapies under investigation. Given the rarity of haemophilia B, the evidence base and clinical experience on which to establish clinical guidelines are relatively sparse and are further challenged by features that are distinct from haemophilia A, precluding extrapolation of existing haemophilia A guidelines. Due to the paucity of formal haemophilia B-specific clinical guidance, an international Author Group was convened to develop a clinical practice framework. The group comprised 15 haematology specialists from Europe, Australia, Japan, Latin America and North America, covering adult and paediatric haematology, laboratory medicine and biomedical science. A hybrid approach combining a systematic review of haemophilia B literature with discussion of clinical experience utilized a modified Delphi format to develop a comprehensive set of clinical recommendations. This approach resulted in 29 recommendations for the clinical management of haemophilia B across five topics, including product treatment choice, therapeutic agent laboratory monitoring, pharmacokinetics considerations, inhibitor management and preparing for gene therapy. It is anticipated that this clinical practice framework will complement existing guidelines in the management of people with haemophilia B in routine clinical practice and could be adapted and applied across different regions and countries."

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that synonymous codon variants (SCVs) can cause disease through the disruption of different processes of protein production. The aim of the study is to investigate whether the 14 SCVs reported in the F9 variant database were the pathogenic causes of hemophilia B. The impacts of SCVs on splicing and protein expression were detected using a combination of in silico prediction, in vitro minigene splicing assay and cell expression detection. The splicing transcripts were identified and quantified by co-amplification fluorescent PCR. The mechanism of splicing was verified by a modified pU1snRNA and pU7snRNA approach. Aberrant splicing patterns were found in eight SCVs. Five of the 8 SCVs produced almost all aberrant splicing isoforms, which were expected to truncate protein, three of them presented a partial defect on both splicing and protein secretion, the overall effects were consistent with the residual Factor IX activity of the affected cases. Neither the pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing process nor the protein function was impaired in the rest six SCVs. In conclusion, our study firstly revealed the pathogenic mechanism of the 14 F9 SCVs and highlighted the importance of performing mRNA splicing analysis and protein expression studies of SCVs in inherited disorders."

CBDR data for Canadian male patients (aged 7-72 years) with hemophilia B receiving prophylactic N9-GP for ≥6 months as of March 31, 2021, were included. To allow comparison with the previously used products, only patients for whom data were available in the CBDR for at least 6 months before the switch to N9-GP were included in this retrospective analysis. Forty-two patients were included in the analysis (total observation period: 148.0 patient-years). The distribution of disease severity was 62% severe, 36% moderate, 2% mild, with 62% of patients previously receiving recombinant factor IX-Fc-fusion protein (rFIXFc) and 38% previously receiving standard half-life (SHL) recombinant factor IX (rFIX). During a median follow-up period of 2.3 years on N9-GP prophylaxis, 232 bleeds were reported in 30 patients, 29% of patients reported zero bleeds. The median overall annualized bleeding rate on N9-GP was 0.73 for patients switching from rFIXFc (previously 1.44) and 2.10 for patients switching from SHL rFIX (previously 6.06). Median total annualized factor consumption (IU/kg) was lower with N9-GP than with previous SHL rFIX (2152 vs 3018) and previous rFIXFc (1766 vs 2278). Results from this first real-world study of N9-GP in patients with hemophilia B suggest optimal bleeding control with low factor consumption after switching to N9-GP, irrespective of the previous product."

Participants in the CHESS II study reported their HRQoL, non-medical costs, and work impairment; physicians provided costs and consultation history from the medical chart. Descriptive statistics summarized patient characteristics, costs, and HRQoL scores. Regression models estimated differences in outcomes for moderate and severe versus mild disease, adjusting for age, body mass index, country, comorbidities, weight-adjusted factor consumption and education.

Societal costs were higher for patients with severe and moderate disease by €11,115 and €2825, respectively (all P < 0.01). HRQoL scores were also significantly worse for severe and moderate patients versus those with mild disease. Severity of haemophilia is predictive of increasing economic and humanistic burden. The burden of moderate disease, as measured by direct costs and HRQoL, did not appear to be substantially different than that observed among patients with severe haemophilia."

The aim of this study was to capture real-life experiences of gene therapy in People with haemophilia and their families. Sixteen participants with severe haemophilia (11 haemophilia A, five haemophilia B), mean age 41.4 years (range 23-75 years), took part in a single qualitative interview; ten were accompanied by a family member. Mean time since transfection was 3.56 years (range 1-10 years). Participants saw their involvement in gene therapy as a positive experience, freeing them from the personal burden of haemophilia and furthering treatment options for the wider haemophilia community. However, participants reported being unprepared for the side effects of immunosuppression. Some also reported feeling unsupported and having little control over what was happening as their factor levels became the focus of the process. The results suggest that strategies need to be put into place to enable PwH fully to understand the process of gene therapy, and thereby make an informed choice as to whether it is a treatment they might wish for themselves.

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a recessive hemorrhagic disease relevant to X chromosome. In mild hemophilia cases, spontaneous bleeding is rare and the blood clotting function is normal, but severe bleeding may occur after trauma or surgery. Therefore, missed diagnosis of hemophilia before operation may contribute to bleeding after hemorrhoid operation. A 21-year-old male was hospitalized in the anorectal department because of repeated bleeding after hemorrhoid surgery. Despite several suture hemostasis procedures, the patient still suffered from recurrent bleeding. He had no family history of hemophilia or bleeding tendency, and had not been diagnosed with hemophilia before this admission. The diagnosis of mild hemophilia B was made after further examination of coagulation indexes. By using frozen plasma and coagulation factor complex to supplement coagulation factors, the patient's bleeding was stopped and he was discharged after 23 days in hospital. During the follow-up, lower-than-normal coagulation factors were still found in him, but no bleeding occurred again. The undiagnosed patient with mild hemophilia B has an increased risk of bleeding after hemorrhoid surgery because of the consumption of coagulation factors. This case report aims to address the importance of hemophilia screening before operation and reduce the risk of postoperative bleeding. For patients with recurrent bleeding after hemorrhoid surgery, hemophilia should be further excluded. Wound bleeding may recur in hemophilia patients after suture hemostasis. Therefore, prompt supplementation of coagulation factors is needed to help stop bleeding once the diagnosis of hemophilia is made."

    "abstract": "Many inborn errors of metabolism require life-long treatments and, in severe conditions involving the liver, organ transplantation remains the only curative treatment. Non-integrative AAV-mediated gene therapy has shown efficacy in adult patients. However, treatment in pediatric or juvenile settings, or in conditions associated with hepatocyte proliferation, may result in rapid loss of episomal viral DNA and thus therapeutic efficacy. Re-administration of the therapeutic vector later in time may not be possible due to the presence of anti-AAV neutralizing antibodies. We have previously shown the permanent rescue of the neonatal lethality of a Crigler-Najjar mouse model by applying an integrative gene-therapy based approach. Here, we targeted the human coagulation factor IX (hFIX) cDNA into a hemophilia B mouse model. Two AAV8 vectors were used: a promoterless vector with two arms of homology for the albumin locus, and a vector carrying the CRISPR/SaCas9 and the sgRNA. Treatment of neonatal P2 wild-type mice resulted in supraphysiological levels of hFIX being stable 10 months after dosing. A single injection of the AAV vectors into neonatal FIX KO mice also resulted in the stable expression of above-normal levels of hFIX, reaching up to 150% of the human levels. Mice subjected to tail clip analysis showed a clotting capacity comparable to wild-type animals, thus demonstrating the rescue of the disease phenotype. Immunohistological analysis revealed clusters of hFIX-positive hepatocytes. When we tested the approach in adult FIX KO mice, we detected hFIX in plasma by ELISA and in the liver by western blot. However, the hFIX levels were not sufficient to significantly ameliorate the bleeding phenotype upon tail clip assay. Experiments conducted using a AAV donor vectors containing the eGFP or the hFIX cDNAs showed a higher recombination rate in P2 mice compared to adult animals. With this study, we demonstrate an alternative gene targeting strategy exploiting the use of the CRISPR/SaCas9 platform that can be potentially applied in the treatment of pediatric patients suffering from hemophilia, also supporting its application to other liver monogenic diseases. For the treatment of adult patients, further studies for the improvement of targeting efficiency are still required."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder due to coagulation pathway factor deficiency that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of the emergency department (ED) evaluation of hemophilia, including diagnostic procedures, imaging, and management based on current evidence. Hemophilia is marked by deficiency in factor VIII (in hemophilia A) or IX (in hemophilia B), which may result in severe bleeding. The severity of the disease depends upon factor levels. Patients with severe deficiency most commonly present in the first two years of life. Severe bleeding may include intracranial hemorrhage, retroperitoneal bleeding, large hematomas, bleeding within the chest or abdomen/pelvis, and subacute or delayed postpartum bleeding. ED management is the immediate replacement of clotting factors based on the suspicion of bleed rather than the confirmation of one. The doses for factor concentrate replacement to achieve factor levels of 100% are 50 U/kg for FVIII and 100 U/kg for FIX. The development of inhibitors can complicate the clinical picture and treatment possibilities. Consultation with the hematology specialist is recommended to assist with evaluation and management. Emergency physician knowledge of hemophilia, including the presentation, evaluation, and management, can improve the care of these patients."

    "title": "A preliminary application of a haemophilia value framework to emerging therapies in haemophilia.",
    "abstract": "Emergence of new therapies are anticipated to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life of persons with haemophilia. Challenges in conducting randomized clinical trials in rare diseases have resulted in a lack of direct head-to-head comparisons to support value-based decision-making between different treatments. We conducted a literature review for new and emerging haemophilia A and B therapies (extended half-life [EHL] replacement factor, non-replacement therapies [NRT], and gene therapies [GT]) to identify differentiating patient-centred outcomes defined previously in a haemophilia value framework. Since the literature included all publication types (e.g., surveys, modelling studies, commentaries/reviews), collected data were assigned level of evidence scores. Across different classes of therapies, bleeding was determined as the most frequently reported differentiating outcome, with EHL, NRT, and GT each demonstrating an advantage over comparator replacement therapies. EHL therapies for haemophilia A and B and NRT for haemophilia A showed good representation across Tier 1 outcomes (health status achieved/retained), while more publications were identified with Tier 2 (process of recovery) outcomes for NRT than EHL or GT. In Tier 3 (sustainability of health), frequency of breakthrough bleeds represented a differentiating outcome for EHL (both haemophilia A and B), NRT (haemophilia A only), and GT (haemophilia B only), whereas sustained good health was differentiating for most comparisons. We demonstrate the utility of the haemophilia value framework as a common core outcome set for effectively comparing therapies. Application of this framework will serve as a useful decision-making tool for patients, clinicians, and within health technology assessments. With the emergence of high-cost, paradigm changing treatments across multiple areas of medicine, we, the haemophilia community, need to be equipped to meet the growing demands for more rigorous evidence-based value assessments using the tools expected by assessors. The traditional access toolbox needs to evolve to meet the paradigm shift in treatment options. Value can no longer be defined by annualized bleed rates alone. To realize the full impact of new therapies, we need to utilize tools, such as a value framework, to organize evidence, identify data gaps, and assess patient-defined, meaningful outcomes across a multi-faceted dimension. The haemophilia value framework is an effective tool for organizing the available evidence and identifying gaps in the evidence. This can be used for assessing the value of emerging therapies in haemophilia utilizing data generated through randomized clinical trials and real world evidence generation. This is a call for incorporating the Value Framework into official submissions to authorities, as it captures a broader range of outcomes, including patient meaningful outcomes, in ways that better assess the potential benefits of new therapies."

    "abstract": "Patients with hemophilia have deficiencies in intrinsic coagulation factors and can develop inhibitors that limit the effectiveness of replacement coagulation factors. Marstacimab, a human monoclonal antibody, binds and inhibits the human tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Marstacimab is currently under development as a potential prophylactic treatment to prevent bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A and B. To assess the effects of marstacimab alone or in combination with the bypassing agent recombinant factor FVIIa (rFVIIa) or activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) on thrombin generation and bleeding. Marstacimab and/or rFVIIa or aPCC were added to hemophilic A or B plasma or nonhemophilic plasma in vitro. Hemostatic activity was measured using the thrombin generation assay. In vivo effects were assessed using a mouse acute bleeding model. Male hemophilia A mice were dosed with marstacimab plus aPCC before tail clip; blood loss was quantified by measuring hemoglobin. Marstacimab plus rFVIIa or aPCC slightly increased peak thrombin levels compared with either agent alone. This increase was within the reported range for nonhemophilic plasma and did not exceed levels observed in nonhemophilic plasma treated with marstacimab alone. Hemophilia A mice that received 200 U/kg aPCC had significantly reduced bleeding (62%) compared with vehicle-treated mice (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and marstacimab plus aPCC reduced bleeding by 83.3% compared with vehicle (<i>p</i>= 0.0009). Marstacimab alone or with bypassing agents increased hemostasis in hemophilia plasma without generating excessive thrombin. The hemostatic activity of marstacimab plus aPCC was confirmed in hemophilia A mice."

    "abstract": "Since the middle of the last century, there have been amazing therapeutic advances for hemophilia such as the development of plasma-derived products and bioengineered recombinant factors VIII and IX (for hemophilia A and B, respectively) with improved stability, higher activity, and extended half-life. The recent use of a monoclonal antibody that mimics factor VIII activity (which is an efficient treatment for all hemophilia A phenotypes with or without inhibitors) has shown the great possibilities of non-factor therapies for improving the quality of life of hemophilia A patients, with a safer application and long-lasting effects. Gene therapy offers the promise of a \"true cure\" for hemophilia based on the permanent effect that a gene edition may render. Clinical trials developed in the last decade based on adenoviral vectors show modest but consistent results; now, CRISPR/Cas technology (which is considered the most efficient tool for gene edition) is being developed on different hemophilia models. Once the off-target risks are solved and an efficient switch on/off for Cas activity is developed, this strategy might become the most feasible option for gene therapy in hemophilia and other monogenic diseases."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B (HB) is a hereditary bleeding disorder caused by the genetic variation of the coagulation factor IX (FIX) gene (F9). Several F9 structural abnormalities, including large deletion and/or insertion, have been observed to cause HB development. However, there is limited information available on F9 deep intronic variations. In this study, we report about a novel large deletion/insertion observed in a deep region of F9 intron 1 that causes mRNA splicing abnormalities. The patient was a Japanese male diagnosed with moderate HB (FIX:C = 3.0 IU/dL). The genomic DNA of the patient was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes. DNA sequences of F9 exons and splice donor/acceptor sites were analyzed via polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. Variant-affected F9 mRNA aberration and FIX protein production, secretion, and coagulant activity were analyzed by cell-based exon trap and splicing-competent FIX expression vector systems. A 28-bp deletion/476-bp insertion was identified in the F9 intron 1 of a patient with moderate HB. A DNA sequence identical to a part of the inverted HNRNPA1 exon 12 was inserted. Cell-based transcript analysis revealed that this large intronic deletion/insertion disrupted F9 mRNA splicing pattern, resulting in reduction of protein-coding F9 mRNA. A novel deep intronic F9 rearrangement was identified in a Japanese patient with moderate HB. Abnormal F9 mRNA splicing pattern due to this deep intronic structural variation resulted in a reduction of protein-coding F9 mRNA, which probably caused the moderate HB phenotype."

The main parts of two phase 2 trials established clinical proof-of-concept for once-daily, subcutaneous concizumab prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A/B with inhibitors (HAwI/HBwI; explorer4) and severe hemophilia A without inhibitors (HA; explorer5). Here, we present results from extension parts of these trials, included to evaluate longer term safety and efficacy. Both trials included main (≥24 weeks) and extension (52-102 weeks) parts, with patients receiving concizumab 0.15 mg/kg with potential dose escalation to concizumab 0.20 or 0.25 mg/kg if they experienced ≥3 treated spontaneous bleeding episodes within 12 weeks. Endpoints included annualized bleeding rate (ABR), adverse events (AEs), and occurrence of antidrug antibodies. Thromboembolic events were AEs of special interest. Thirty-six patients with HA, 15 with HAwI, and 10 with HBwI were exposed to concizumab. Estimated ABRs during the main + extension parts at last dose level were 4.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2-7.2) and 6.4 (95% CI, 4.1-9.9) in explorer4 and explorer5, respectively (spontaneous ABRs were 1.8 [95% CI, 1.2-2.6] and 2.1 [95% CI, 1.3-3.3]). Most AEs were mild, with no deaths, events leading to withdrawal, or thromboembolic events. Anti-drug antibodies developed in 25% of patients and were low titer and transient, with no observed clinical effect in most cases. Results of the main + extension parts of these trials were consistent with results of the main parts. Ongoing phase 3 trials will further evaluate concizumab as a once-daily, subcutaneous treatment across hemophilia subtypes. These trials were registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03196284 and #NCT03196297."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A and B are X-linked hereditary bleeding disorders due to factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX) deficiency, respectively. Major advancements have been made in the care of patients with hemophilia, yet the development of inhibitors to infused FVIII or FIX continues to be a formidable challenge. The current first-line therapy for acute bleeding episodes in patients diagnosed with inhibitors are bypassing agents including activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCCs) and recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa). Eptacog beta (SevenFact; LFB Biotechnologies, Hema Biologics) is a new rFVIIa product produced via expression in the milk of transgenic rabbits. This emerging platform has demonstrated numerous cost advantages to traditional cell culture systems including a better ability to scale up production and better protein yields. Eptacog beta is currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the on-demand control of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia aged 12 to 75 with inhibitors. A potential future expansion of its current label could occur given the recent completion of two major phase III clinical trials evaluating its efficacy in children as well as its use for perioperative management. In this paper, we describe the preclinical and clinical literature documenting the development of eptacog beta and discuss its current and future application for the management of patients with hemophilia and inhibitors."

    "abstract": "Coagulation factor IX (FIX) is a vitamin K dependent protein and its deficiency causes hemophilia B, an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder. More than 1000 mutations in the <i>F9</i> gene have been identified in hemophilia B patients. Here, we systematically summarize the structural and functional characteristics of FIX and the pathogenic mechanisms of the mutations that have been identified to date. The mechanisms of FIX deficiency are diverse in these mutations. Deletions, insertions, duplications, and indels generally lead to severe hemophilia B. Those in the exon regions generate either frame shift or inframe mutations, and those in the introns usually cause aberrant splicing. Regarding point mutations, the bleeding phenotypes vary from severe to mild in hemophilia B patients. Generally speaking, point mutations in the <i>F9</i> promoter region result in hemophilia B Leyden, and those in the introns cause aberrant splicing. Point mutations in the coding sequence can be missense, nonsense, or silent mutations. Nonsense mutations generate truncated FIX that usually loses function, causing severe hemophilia B. Silent mutations may lead to aberrant splicing or affect FIX translation. The mechanisms of missense mutation, however, have not been fully understood. They lead to FIX deficiency, often by affecting FIX's translation, protein folding, protein stability, posttranslational modifications, activation to FIXa, or the ability to form functional Xase complex. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of FIX deficiency will provide significant insight for patient diagnosis and treatment."

Twenty-nine participants had inhibitors or a history of inhibitors. Three versions of the EQ-5D instrument were used as a measure of QoL: proxy (ages 4-7), youth (ages 8-15) and self (age 16+). Each instrument included a visual analogue scale ranging from 100 (best health) to 0 (worst health) to assess current day's health (EQ VAS). Range-of-motion (ROM) for elbows, knees and ankles was assessed using a four-point scale, from which a composite score was calculated. In all severity groups, a proportion of subjects showed less than optimal QoL. The majority of the mild and moderate severe participants reported a normal EQ-5D health profile (79% and 72%, respectively), whereas about half (47%) of the severe participants and only 13% of the inhibitor participants reported this profile.

Those with moderate haemophilia (Factor VIII = 5; Factor IX = 1) treated on demand (12%). Acute (72%) and chronic pain (71%), functional difficulties (58%), and analgesic requirements (92%) were prevalent.

Adults who reported chronic pain commenced prophylaxis significantly later in life [32 (20, 51) vs. 8 (1, 23) years; p = .004]. Physical activity was significantly lower in those with functional difficulties (p < .05). A disparity between self-perceived 'target joints' and clinically defined target joints was also identified (76% vs. 23%). Haemophilic arthropathy, pain and functional disability were prevalent amongst Irish adults with moderate and severe haemophilia.

Physicians recruited consecutive patients and extracted information from the medical records; patients completed questionnaires between 2014 and 2015 (CHESS-I), 2018-2019 (CHESS-II) and 2019 (CHESS US). Patients with inhibitors were excluded. HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L. Twelve-month haemophilia-related direct medical costs included office visits and hospitalizations based on country-level unit costs. A Tobit model was used to analyze FELs and HRQoL and generalized linear models for direct medical costs.

Furthermore, no studies have analysed coagulation factor levels that affect PBL. To identify the risk factors for increased PBL by incorporating coagulation factor levels following TKA in patients with haemophilic arthropathy. A total of 92 TKA (78 haemophilia A and 14 haemophilia B) were performed for haemophilic arthropathy. PBL was calculated using the haemoglobin (Hb) balance method, and patients were categorised into two groups: group H (higher blood loss than the mean PBL, n = 36) and group L (lower blood loss than the mean PBL, n = 56). Body mass index (BMI), operation day Hb, haematocrit and coagulation factor level (VIII or IX) were analysed, including demographic and laboratory data. The mean PBL volume during TKA for haemophilic arthropathy of the knee was 542.3 ± 361.7 mL. Multivariate analysis revealed that lower haematocrit on the operation day (odds ratio [OR], .633; 95% confidence interval [CI], .511-.786; p < .001) and coagulation factor level (OR .970, CI .941-.999; p = .046) were independent risk factors for increased PBL. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis identified these cutoff values for predicting increased PBL: operation day coagulation factor level 93.5% (sensitivity, 70.4%; specificity, 67.6%) and haematocrit level of 38.2% (sensitivity, 85.7%; specificity, 80.6%). The PBL increased as haematocrit and coagulation factor levels decreased on the operation day. A coagulation factor level <93.5% or haematocrit level of <38.2% may be a significant risk factor for increasing PBL. Level IV, Case Series, Treatment Study."

Treatment with FIX replacement products can increase FIX activity levels to minimize or prevent bleeding events. However, frequent dosing with standard-acting FIX products can create a high treatment burden. Long-acting products have been developed to maintain bleed protection with extended dosing intervals. Recombinant factor IX-albumin fusion protein (rIX-FP) is a long-acting product indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding events and perioperative management in adult and pediatric patients. This review outlines data from all previously treated patients in the Prophylaxis and On-Demand Treatment using Longer Half-Life rIX-FP (PROLONG-9FP) clinical trial program and summarizes real-world data evaluating the use of rIX-FP in routine clinical practice. In the PROLONG-9FP program, rIX-FP demonstrated effective hemostasis in all patients at dose regimens of up to 21 days in patients aged ≥ 18 years and up to 14 days in patients aged < 12 years. rIX-FP has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and an excellent safety and tolerability profile. Extended dosing intervals with rIX-FP led to high levels of adherence and reduced consumption compared with other FIX therapies. Data from real-world practice are encouraging and reflect the results of the clinical trials."

We conducted a retrospective nationwide analysis based on a 5% random sample from claims data of China Urban Employees' Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) and Urban Residents' Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) schemes from 2010 to 2016. Univariate analysis and multiple regression analysis based on a generalized linear model were conducted. A total of 487 urban inpatients who had hemophilia were identified, including 407 inpatients with hemophilia A and 80 inpatients with hemophilia B. Total medical cost for hemophilia B inpatients was significantly higher than for hemophilia A inpatients (USD 2912.81 versus USD 1225.60, P < 0.05), and hemophilia B inpatients had a significantly longer length of hospital stay than hemophilia A inpatients (9.00 versus 7.00, P < 0.05). Total medical costs were mostly allocated to coagulation factor products (76.86-86.68%), with coagulation factor cost of hemophilia B significantly higher than hemophilia A (P < 0.05). Both hemophilia cohorts utilized greatest amount of plasma-derived Factor VIII, followed by recombinant Factor VIII and prothrombin complex concentrates. Patients with hemophilia B experienced significantly higher inpatient cost, coagulation factor cost and longer length of hospital stay than patients with hemophilia A. Our findings revealed the suboptimal use of coagulation factor concentrate drugs and a higher drug cost burden incurred by hemophilia B than hemophilia A inpatients.

Novel AAV vectors have been developed with enhanced transduction and specific tissue tropism. Considering the difference in efficacy of AAV transduction between animal models and patients, the chimeric xenograft mouse model with human hepatocytes has unique advantages of studying AAV transduction efficiency in human hepatocytes. However, it is unclear whether the results in humanized mice can predict AAV transduction efficiency in human hepatocytes. To address this issue, we studied the AAV transduction efficacy in canine hepatocytes in both canine hepatocyte xenografted mice and real dogs. After administration of AAV vectors from different serotypes into canine hepatocyte xenograft mice, AAV8 induced the best canine hepatocyte transduction followed by AAV9, then AAV3, 7, 5 and 2. After administration of AAV/cFIX (cFIX-opt-R338L) vectors in hemophilia B dogs, consistent with the result in chimeric mice, AAV8 induced the highest cFIX protein expression and function, followed by AAV9 and then AAV2. These results suggest that mice xenografted with hepatocytes from different species could be used to predict the AAV liver transduction in real species and highlight this potential platform to explore novel AAV variants for future clinical applications."

A total of 18 Idelvion and 22 Alprolix patient samples were assayed in a single centre. Two chromogenic and two one-stage assays were compared. The pattern of results obtained for NEQAS samples and patient samples was similar. In all cases, the NEQAS sample data point was within the scatter of patient sample data in plots of patient sample results showing one-stage assay results using Synthasil or Actin FS plotted against chromogenic assay results with Biophen or Rox chromogenic FIX kits.

Congenital bleeding disorders such as hemophilia are rare coagulation disorders that have been known to present in the early neonatal period with an increased tendency for bleeding after blood draws, circumcision, surgical interventions, intracranial hemorrhage, oral or mucosal bleeding, and very rarely as gastrointestinal hemorrhage. There are no reports so far in the published literature of hemophilia presenting as pulmonary hemorrhage in early life. We report an unusual primary presentation of hemophilia B in a premature, monochorionic-diamniotic twin with acute life-threatening pulmonary hemorrhage with no family history of bleeding disorders."

    "abstract": "Congenital red and green color blindness is the most X-linked recessive disorder in humans caused by deletions or gross structural rearrangements of the visual pigment gene array that lead to altered the functions of visual pigments in their retina differ from normal. The incidence is about 7-10% in male and close association of X-linked recessive disorders (such as: hemophilia A, hemophilia B, duchenne muscular dystrophy). However, the traditional genetic analysis methods are time-consuming and low-efficiencies. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to develop a rapid method for genotyping of red and green pigment genes. We describe herein the first method for simultaneous evaluation of ten exons in the red and green pigment genes for genetic analysis. A forward specific primers with identifiable universal fluorescent multiplex PCR (FSIUFM-PCR) method utilized one universal primer (containing two universal non-human sequences) and forward specific primers in the multiplex PCR reaction system for simultaneously fluorescent labeling of eleven gene fragments (ten exons in red and green pigment genes and one internal standard). All the PCR products were analyzed on capillary electrophoresis with short-end injection, which had the advantage of high resolution and rapid separation. Of all 80 detected individuals, 7 subjects with color vision deficiencies (including 3 subjects only had red exons 1-5, 4 subjects had a specific red-green or green-red hybrid gene and 73 subjects with normal color vision). All genotyping results showed good agreement with DNA sequencing data. This method provided a better potential technique for genotyping and identifying of red and green pigment genes. In addition, FSIUFM-PCR method will be useful in many fields, such as diagnosis of diseases, analysis of polymorphisms and quantitative assay."

    "abstract": "Different prophylactic and episodic clotting factor treatments are used in the management of hemophilia. A summarize of the evidence is needed inform decision-making. To compare the effects of factor replacement therapies in patients with hemophilia. We performed a systematic search in PubMed, Central Cochrane Library, and Scopus. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to December 2020, which compared different factor replacement therapies in patients with hemophilia. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed whenever possible. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021225857). Nine RCTs were included in this review, of which six compared episodic with prophylactic treatment, all of them performed in patients with hemophilia A. Pooled results showed that, compared to the episodic treatment group, the annualized bleeding rate was lower in the low-dose prophylactic group (ratio of means [RM]: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.43), intermediate-dose prophylactic group (RM: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.36), and high-dose prophylactic group (RM: 0.07, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.13). With significant difference between these subgroups (p = 0.003, I2 = 82.9%). In addition, compared to the episodic treatment group, the annualized joint bleeding rate was lower in the low-dose prophylactic group (RM: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.43), intermediate-dose prophylactic group (RM of 0.14, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.27), and high-dose prophylactic group (RM of 0.08, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.16). Without significant subgroup differences. The certainty of the evidence was very low for all outcomes according to GRADE methodology. The other studies compared different types of clotting factor concentrates (CFCs), assessed pharmacokinetic prophylaxis, or compared different frequencies of medication administration. Our results suggest that prophylactic treatment (at either low, intermediate, or high doses) is superior to episodic treatment for bleeding prevention. In patients with hemophilia A, the bleeding rate seems to have a dose-response effect. However, no study compared different doses of prophylactic treatment, and all results had a very low certainty of the evidence. Thus, future studies are needed to confirm these results and inform decision making."

Subjects with haemophilia (n = 120) underwent bone-density measurement and clinical data was collected. BMD in subjects with severe haemophilia on high-dose prophylaxis (n = 41) was compared to BMD in subjects with mild haemophilia (n = 33) and to severe haemophilia treated with intermediate-dose prophylaxis (n = 32) or on-demand replacement therapy (n = 14). Subjects with severe haemophilia on high-dose prophylaxis showed BMD at total hip comparable to subjects with mild haemophilia (median BMD 955.8 and 977.4 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> (P = .17), respectively). No difference in BMD was found related to type of prophylactic regimen (median BMD 955.8 and 942.4 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> , in high-dose and intermediate dose groups, respectively; P = .70). Subjects with severe disease treated on-demand had significantly lower BMD compared to subjects on a high-dose prophylactic regimen (median BMD 771.8 and 955.8 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> (P = .001), respectively). BMD decreased significantly with age, regardless of severity of haemophilia disease. In a multivariate analysis, adjusted for disease status and age, type of prophylactic regimen was not significantly associated with osteoporosis development. We show that BMD differs in persons with severe haemophilia on propylaxis as compared to those treated on-demand, but that type of prophylactic regimen does not reflect on BMD. The difference between treatment groups was mainly explained by an age difference between groups. However, patients on prophylaxis displayed a high degree of normal BMD not far from mild haemophilia at comparative age."

We analysed data from the recent CHESS II study to better understand the clinical, humanistic, and economic burden of severe haemophilia B in Europe. Data from male adults with severe haemophilia B receiving prophylaxis were analysed from the retrospective cross-sectional CHESS II study conducted in Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Inhibitors were exclusionary. Patients and physicians completed questionnaires on bleeding, joint status, quality of life, and haemophilia-related direct and indirect costs (2019-2020). All outcomes were summarised using descriptive statistics. A total of 75 CHESS II patients were eligible and included; 40 patients (53%) provided self-reported outcomes. Mean age was 36.2 years. Approximately half the patients were receiving EHL versus standard half-life (SHL) prophylaxis (44% vs 56%). Most patients reported mild or moderate chronic pain (76%) and had ≥ 2 bleeding events per year (70%), with a mean annualised bleed rate of 2.4. Mean annual total haemophilia-related direct medical cost per patient was €235,723, driven by FIX costs (€232,328 overall, n = 40; €186,528 for SHL, €290,620 for EHL). Mean annual indirect costs (€8,973) were driven by early retirement or work stoppage due to haemophilia. Mean quality of life (EQ-5D) score was 0.67. These data document a substantial, persistent real-world burden of severe haemophilia B in Europe. Unmet needs persist for these patients, their caregivers, and society."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia is a recessive congenital hereditary haemorrhagic disorder characterised by the decrease in, or absence of, the functional activity of factor VIII (Haemophilia A) or factor IX (Haemophilia B). The haematological medical treatment for these patients is systemic replacement therapy with factor VIII or factor IX concentrates. Dental implants are considered the gold standard for the replacement of missing teeth. There is no evidence or safe protocol for their use in patients with haemophilia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical osseointegration and the incidence of postoperative bleeding in patients with haemophilia. The patients included in this study were over 18 years old with a diagnosis of haemophilia. A surgical implant protocol was implemented, supported by systemic and local haemostatic measures. Age, type of haemophilia, pre- and post-factor levels, gingival index, surgical duration, oedema, and pain were recorded for each case. In the event of haemorrhage, the bleeding index was determined. At four months, the success of the implant was evaluated using the absence of pain, suppuration, and clinical mobility as parameters. Fifteen surgeries were performed and 21 implants were placed in 10 patients. All the implants were successful in terms of the evaluated parameters. Among the 15 surgeries performed, bleeding was detected in three. The preliminary results found in this study seem to establish that the proposed surgical implant and haemostatic protocol is a predictable treatment for the placement of dental implants in patients with haemophilia."

    "abstract": "The current mainstay of therapy for hemophilia is to replace the deficient clotting factor with the intravenous administration of exogenous clotting factor concentrates. Prophylaxis factor replacement therapy is now considered the standard of care in both pediatric and adult patients with hemophilia with a severe phenotype to protect musculoskeletal health and improve quality of life. Heterogeneity in bleeding presentation among patients with hemophilia due to genetic, environmental, and treatment-related factors has been well described. Accordingly, the World Federation of Hemophilia recommends an individualized prophylaxis regimen that considers the factors mentioned above to meet the clinical needs of the patient, which can vary over time. This review focuses on the practical points of choosing the type of factor concentrate, dose, and interval while evaluating appropriate target trough factor levels and bleeding triggers such as level of physical activity and joint status. We also discuss the use of a pharmacokinetics assessment and its incorporation in the clinic for a tailored approach toward individualized management. Overall, adopting an individualized prophylaxis regimen leads to an optimal utilization of factor concentrates with maximum efficacy and minimum waste."

Current clinical hemophilia gene therapy efforts are largely focused on the use of systemically administered recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors for F8 or F9 gene addition. With multiple ongoing trials, including licensing studies in hemophilia A and B, many are cautiously optimistic that the first AAV vectors will obtain regulatory approval within approximately 1 year. While supported optimism suggests that the goal of gene therapy to alter the paradigm of hemophilia care may soon be realized, a number of outstanding questions have emerged from clinical trial that are in need of answers to harness the full potential of gene therapy for hemophilia patients. This article reviews the use of AAV vector gene addition approaches for hemophilia A and B, focusing specifically on information to review in the process of obtaining informed consent for hemophilia patients prior to clinical trial enrollment or administering a licensed AAV vector."

The current standard of care is the administration of recombinant or purified factor. However, this treatment strategy still results in a high economic and personal burden to patients, which is further exacerbated by the development of inhibitors-alloantibodies to factor. The treatment landscape is changing, with nonfactor therapeutics playing an increasing role in what we consider to be the standard of care. Emicizumab, a bispecific antibody that mimics the function of factor VIIIa, is the first such nonfactor therapy to gain US Food and Drug Administration approval and is rapidly changing the paradigm for HA treatment. Other therapies on the horizon seek to target anticoagulant proteins in the coagulation cascade, thus \"rebalancing\" a hemorrhagic tendency by introducing a thrombotic tendency. This intricate hemostatic balancing act promises great things for patients in need of more treatment options, but are these other therapies going to replace factor therapy? In light of the many challenges facing these therapies, should they be viewed as a replacement of our current standard of care? This review discusses the background, rationale, and potential of nonfactor therapies as well as the anticipated pitfalls and limitations. This is done in the context of a review of our current understanding of the many aspects of the coagulation system."

Over 3,000 pathogenic, HB-associated mutations in the <i>F9</i> gene have been identified. We aimed to investigate the role of <i>F9</i> variants in 150 HB patients using sequencing technology. <i>F9</i> gene sequences were amplified from peripheral blood-derived DNA and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 3500 Sanger sequencing platform. Functional and structural predictions of mutant FIX were analyzed. Among 150 HB patients, 102 (68%), 30 (20%), and 18 (12%) suffered from severe, moderate, and mild HB, respectively. Genetic analysis identified 16 mutations, including 3 novel mutations. Nine mutations (7 missense and 2 stop-gain) were found to be pathogenic. Only 3 mutations (c.127C＞T, c.470G＞A, and c.1070G＞A) were associated with different severities. While 2 mutations were associated with mild HB cases (c.304C＞T and c.580A＞G), 2 (c.195G＞A and c.1385A＞G) and 3 mutations (c.223C＞T, c.1187G＞A, and c.1232G＞A) resulted in moderate and severe disease, respectively. Additionally, 1 mutation each was associated with mild-moderate (c.*1110A＞G) and mild-severe HB disease (c.197A＞T), 4 mutations were associated with moderate-severe HB cases (c.314A＞G, c.198A＞T, c.676C＞T, and c.1094C＞A). FIX concentrations were lower in the mutated group (5.5±2.5% vs. 8.0±2.5%). Novel p.E66D and p.S365 mutations were predicted to be pathogenic based on changes in FIX structure and function. Novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) largely contributed to the pathogenesis of HB. Our study strongly suggests that population-based genetic screening will be particularly helpful to identify risk prediction and carrier detection tools for Indian HB patients."

Perioperative hemostasis, complications, and surgical plan deviations were compared by bleeding disorder diagnosis and data collection period. Within the 21-year period, 3246 procedures were conducted in 1413 patients with a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (vWD), hemophilia A (HA), hemophilia B (HB), and other bleeding disorders. Majority of the procedures were minor (63.3%), and median number of surgeries per patient was 1 (range: 1-22). Adequate perioperative hemostasis was achieved in 90.9%, complications occurred in 13.6%, and surgical plan deviations occurred in 31.3% of procedures. Inadequate perioperative hemostasis and surgical plan deviations occurred more frequently in procedures involving HB compared with other bleeding disorders.

All persons with hemophilia in the Netherlands were invited for a nationwide study conducted in 2018-2019. For the current analysis, participants born before 1992 with data on HRQoL and HCV status were included. HCV status was collected from medical records. HRQoL was measured by RAND-36 questionnaire, with a minimally important difference set at 4.0 points. Multivariable linear regression was used to adjust for age, hemophilia severity, HIV status, and self-reported joint impairment. In total, 486 persons were eligible; 180 were HCV cured and 306 never chronically HCV infected. Compared with those never HCV infected, HCV-cured individuals were older (57 vs. 53 years), more often had severe hemophilia (67% vs. 21%), and reported more impaired joints (median 3 vs. 0). Compared with those never HCV infected, adjusted RAND-36 domain scores of HCV-cured individuals cured were lower on all RAND-36 domains except Pain, ranging from a difference of 4.5 (95% CI, -8.8 to -0.3) for Physical functioning to 11.3 (95% CI, -19.4 to -3.1) for Role limitations due to physical problems. Despite effective HCV treatment, HRQoL of HCV-cured persons with hemophilia is still lower than HRQoL of those never chronically HCV-infected on all RAND-36 domains.

Disease-causing variations were used as positive controls for validation of the high-resolution melting (HRM) variant-scanning technique. This approach is a low-cost genetic diagnostic method proposed to be incorporated in developing countries. For the data analysis, we developed an accessible open-source code in Python that improves HRM data analysis with better sensitivity of 95% and without bias when using different HRM equipment and software.

The disorder affects mainly males and leads to chronic pain, joint deformity, reduced mobility, and increased mortality. Current therapies require frequent administration of replacement clotting factors, but the emergence of alloantibodies (inhibitors) diminishes their efficacy. New therapies are being developed to produce the deficient clotting factors and prevent the emergence of inhibitors. This article provides an update on the characteristics and disease pathophysiology of hemophilia A, as well as current treatments, with a special focus on ongoing clinical trials related to gene replacement therapies. Gene replacement therapies provide safe, durable, and stable transgene expression while avoiding the challenges of clotting factor replacement therapies in patients with hemophilia. Improving the specificity of the viral construct and decreasing the therapeutic dose are critical toward minimizing cellular stress, induction of the unfolded protein response, and the resulting loss of protein production in liver cells. Next-generation gene therapies incorporating chimeric DNA sequences in the transgene can increase clotting factor synthesis and secretion, and advance the efficacy, safety, and durability of gene replacement therapy for hemophilia A as well as other blood clotting disorders."

Rat superficial inferior epigastric artery flap transfection using minicircle DNA human coagulation factor IX resulted in systemic transgene detection, suggesting that selective flap or angiosome-based tissue transfection may be explored as a treatment for systemic protein deficiency disorders such as hemophilia B."

    "abstract": "In several countries, molecular diagnosis of haemophilia A (HA) and B (HB) is hampered by a lack of resources for DNA analysis. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled gene analysis at a reasonable cost. Describe a collaboration between Cuban and Spanish researchers to identify candidate variants and investigate the molecular epidemiology of 106 Cuban haemophilia patients using NGS. The molecular analysis protocol included well-established LR-PCR procedures to detect F8 inversions, NGS with a 30-gene panel to sequence F8 and F9, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to identify large structural variants. One-hundred and thirty-one candidate variants were identified along F8, F9, and VWF; 72 were unique and 28 (39%) had not been previously recorded. Putative variants were identified in 105/106 patients. Molecular characterization enabled confirmation and reclassification of: 90 HA (85%), 15 HB (14%), and one type 2N VWD (1%). Null variants leading to non-production of FVIII or FIX were common in severe HA (64%), moderate HA (74%), and severe HB (60%), whereas missense variants were frequent in mild HA (57%) and moderate or mild HB (83%). Additional variants in VWF were identified in 16 patients. This is the first description of the molecular epidemiology of HA and HB in Cuba. Variants identified in index cases will be of value for local implementation of familial studies and prenatal diagnosis using the molecular approaches available in Cuba. The results of this protocolled genetic study improved the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis and will facilitate management of these patients."

    "abstract": "Guidelines of the World Federation of Hemophilia support the provision of equitable, optimal care for people with hemophilia (PWH). However, limited research exists examining the lived experiences of PWH or the barriers to care they may encounter. The primary objective of this exploratory study was to describe the experiences of men with hemophilia in Canada. We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using a semistructured interview guide and analyzed transcribed interviews using inductive thematic content analysis. Inclusion criteria were: age ≥18 years, English-speaking, and confirmed diagnosis of inherited hemophilia A or B. A total of 11 participants were interviewed. Median age was 39 years old (29-73 years old), and diagnoses included severe hemophilia A (n = 5), mild hemophilia A (n = 2), and severe hemophilia B (n = 4). Three primary themes arose: (1) impact on identity and daily life; (2) dynamic changes in treatment; and (3) barriers to care and identified needs. Major subthemes included chronic pain and activity limitation, psychosocial burden, and symptom normalization. Multidisciplinary care, coordinated surgical care, improved emergency care, and clear care plans were identified as ongoing needs. Men with hemophilia described significant symptom burden and areas of ongoing need. Collaborative efforts between hematologists, emergency room physicians, and surgeons to establish hospital-specific testing, treatment and referral guidelines, and regular hemophilia treatment center audits may help address these care gaps, providing more person-centered, equitable care. Future work is required to implement these strategies and monitor their effects."

    "abstract": "Pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes differentiated in monolayer culture are known to have more fetal than adult hepatocyte characteristics. If numerous studies tend to show that this immature phenotype might not necessarily be an obstacle to their use in transplantation, other applications such as drug screening, toxicological studies, or bioartificial livers are reliant on hepatocyte functionality and require full differentiation of hepatocytes. New technologies have been used to improve the differentiation process in recent years, usually evaluated by measuring the albumin production and CYP450 activity. Here we used the complex production and most importantly the activity of the coagulation factor IX (FIX) produced by mature hepatocytes to assess the differentiation of hemophilia B (HB) patient's induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in both monolayer culture and organoids. Indeed, HB is an X-linked monogenic disease due to an impaired activity of FIX synthesized by hepatocytes in the liver. We have developed an in vitro model of HB hepatocytes using iPSCs generated from fibroblasts of a severe HB patient. We used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to target the genomic insertion of a coagulation factor 9 minigene bearing the Padua mutation to enhance FIX activity. Noncorrected and corrected iPSCs were differentiated into hepatocytes under both two-dimensional and three-dimensional differentiation protocols and deciphered the production of active FIX in vitro. Finally, we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of this approach in vivo using a mouse model of HB. Functional FIX, whose post-translational modifications only occur in fully mature hepatocytes, was only produced in corrected iPSCs differentiated in organoids. Immunohistochemistry analyses of mouse livers indicated a good cell engraftment, and the FIX activity detected in the plasma of transplanted animals confirmed rescue of the bleeding phenotype."

    "abstract": "Blood disorders that can contribute to abnormal bleeding can have a detrimental effect during cardiac surgery. Patients who are known to have such pathologies should be investigated thoroughly and cautious measures would need to be taken when cardiac surgery is needed in this cohort. The majority of current literature for cardiac surgery in patients with von Willebrand Disease and haemophilia are case reports. Nevertheless, evidence shows that optimising factor levels pre, intra and postoperatively offers outcomes similar to that of patients without these disorders. Preoperative screening followed by appropriate iron therapy reduces mortality for patients with anaemia. In this group, haemoglobin levels can be improved postoperatively through iron supplementation. The management strategy of cardiac surgery for people with blood disorders requires a multidisciplinary approach that is highly individualised for each patient. It is essential to adequately adjust preoperative, perioperative and postoperative care to the patient's blood disorder in order to achieve outcomes similar to that of patients without blood disorders."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B is an x-linked recessive hereditary coagulopathy that has been reported in various species. We describe a male Newfoundland-Parti Standard Poodle hybrid puppy and its family with hemophilia B from clinical manifestations to the molecular genetic defect. The index case presented for dyspnea was found to have a mediastinal hematoma, while surgical removal and transfusion support brought some relief, progressive hematoma formations led to humane euthanasia. Sequencing the <i>F9</i> exons revealed a single nucleotide insertion resulting in a frameshift in the last exon (NM_001003323.2:c.821_822insA), predicted to result in a premature stop codon (NP_001003323.1:p.Asn274LysfsTer23) with a loss of 178 of 459 amino acids. The unexpected high residual plasma factor IX activity (3% to 11% of control) was likely erroneous, but no further studies were performed. Both the purebred Newfoundland dam and her sister were heterozygous for the insertion. Five additional male offspring developed severe hemorrhage and were hemizygous for the <i>F9</i> variant and/or had a prolonged aPTT. In contrast, other male littermates had normal aPTTs and no evidence of bleeding. While they are related to a common Newfoundland granddam, the prevalence of the pathogenic variant in the Newfoundland breed is currently unknown. These clinical to molecular genetic studies illustrate that precision medicine is achievable in clinical companion animal practice."

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are important to evaluate with new treatments. To assess HRQoL in people with severe hemophilia B and their experience after switching to rFIXFc prophylaxis. Participants completed a Patient Reported Outcomes Burden and Experience (PROBE) questionnaire on initiation and following two years of rFIXFc prophylaxis. The PROBE questionnaire has four domains: demographics, general health, haemophilia-specific, and European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire. Twenty-three participants completed the questionnaire at both time points. The number of activities where chronic pain occurred and interfered with the activity was reduced by 25% and 33%, respectively (<i>P </i>< .001), following two years of rFIXFc prophylaxis. There was a 9% decrease in chronic pain during the second year of rFIXFc prophylaxis compared to baseline, but the rate remained high, at 74%. A 25% reduction in the number of affected activities of daily living (ADLs) was reported following 2 years of rFIXFc prophylaxis (<i>P </i>= .007). The most common health problems were arthritis, hypertension, anxiety/depression, and gingivitis. The median EQ-5D-5L score was similar following two years of rFIXFc prophylaxis, 0.76 (range, -0.01 to 0.95), compared to 0.77 (range, 0.36-1) at baseline. This study of real-world patient experience using PROs demonstrates a reduction in chronic pain and improvement in ADLs in participants after switching to rFIXFc prophylaxis. It provides important insights into patient-identified health care needs and living with severe hemophilia B."

To evaluate if patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) improved in Canadian persons with hemophilia who switched from standard half-life (SHL) to EHL products (rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc). This prospective cohort study enrolled persons with moderate or severe hemophilia aged ≥6 years who switched to rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc (2016-2018) and those who remained on SHL. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using the Haemophilia-specific Quality of Life (Haem-A-QoL) and 36-item Short-Form Survey (SF-36) at baseline, 3-months, 12 months, and 24 months. Other PROMs included the Work Productivity and Impairment Questionnaire, chronic pain scale, partner/parent ratings of mood, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication. We identified meaningful changes using minimally important difference for SF-36 and responder definition for Haem-A-QoL. We enrolled 25 switchers (16 rFVIIIFc, 9 rFIXFc) and 33 nonswitchers. Those switched to rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc had improved overall HRQoL, and improved subscale physical activity, mental health, and social functioning at 3 months. The rFIXFc switchers had improved chronic pain and ability to engage in normal activities while the rFVIIIFc switchers had improved treatment satisfaction. There was no change in work impairment after the switch. Observed improvement disappeared by 24 months in most domains. Switching from SHL to rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc resulted in short-term meaningful improvement in overall HRQoL and other PROMs in a small proportion. Longitudinal changes on PROMs are affected by ceiling effects and response shift, warranting further studies in instrument optimization in the era of EHL and nonfactor products."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B is a bleeding disorder, caused by a factor IX (FIX) deficiency. Recently, FIX concentrates with extended half-life (EHL) have become available. Prophylactic dosing of EHL-FIX concentrates can be optimized by assessment of individual pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. To determine these parameters, limited sampling strategies (LSSs) may be applied. The study aims to establish adequate LSSs for estimating individual PK parameters of EHL-FIX concentrates using in silico evaluation. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to obtain FIX activity versus time profiles using published population PK models for N9-GP (Refixia), rFIXFc (Alprolix), and rIX-FP (Idelvion). Fourteen LSSs, containing three or four samples taken within 8 days after administration, were formulated. Bayesian analysis was applied to obtain estimates for clearance (CL), half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>), time to 1% (Time<sub>1%</sub>), and calculated weekly dose (Dose<sub>1%</sub>). Bias and precision of these estimates were assessed to determine which LSS was adequate. For all PK parameters of N9-GP, rFIXFc and rIX-FP bias was generally acceptable (range: -5% to 5%). For N9-GP, precision of all parameters for all LSSs was acceptable (< 25%). For rFIXFc, precision was acceptable for CL and Time<sub>1%</sub>, except for t<sub>1/2</sub> (range: 27.1% to 44.7%) and Dose<sub>1%</sub> (range: 12% to 29.4%). For rIX-FP, all LSSs showed acceptable bias and precision, except for Dose<sub>1%</sub> using LSS with the last sample taken on day 3 (LSS 6 and 10). Best performing LSSs were LSS with samples taken at days 1, 5, 7, and 8 (N9-GP and rFIXFc) and at days 1, 4, 6, and 8 (rIX-FP), respectively."

    "abstract": "Infusing CRISPR/donor-loaded adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV/CRISPR) could enable in vivo hepatic gene editing to remedy hemophilia B (HB) with inherited deficiency of clotting factor IX (FIX). Yet, current regimens focus on correcting HB with simple mutations in the coding region of the <i>F9</i>, overlooking those carrying complicated mutations involving the regulatory region. Moreover, a possible adverse effect of treatment-related inflammation remains unaddressed. Here we report that a single DNA cutting-mediated long-range replacement restored the FIX-encoding function of a mutant <i>F9</i> (<i>mF9</i>) carrying both regulatory and coding defects in a severe mouse HB model, wherein incorporation of a synthetic <i>Alb</i> enhancer/promoter-mimic (P2) ensured FIX elevation to clinically meaningful levels. Through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of liver tissues, we revealed that a subclinical hepatic inflammation post-AAV/CRISPR administration regulated the vulnerability of the edited <i>mF9</i>-harboring host cells to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and the P2 activity in a hepatocytic subset-dependent manner via modulating specific sets of liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs). Collectively, our study establishes an AAV/CRISPR-mediated gene-editing protocol applicable to complicated monogenetic disorders, underscoring the potentiality of improving therapeutic benefits through managing inflammation."

In an effort to further innovate this approach and to introduce alternative vector designs with potentially superior features into clinical development, we recently built a vector platform based on AAV serotype 3 because of its superior tropism for human hepatocytes. A vector genome with serotype-matched inverted terminal repeats expressing hyperactive human coagulation factor IX (FIX)-Padua was designed for clinical use that is optimized for translation using hepatocyte-specific codon-usage bias and is depleted of immune stimulatory CpG motifs. Here, this vector genome was packaged into AAV3 (T492V + S663V) capsid for hepatic gene transfer in non-human primates. FIX activity within or near the normal range was obtained at a low vector dose of 5 × 10<sup>11</sup> vector genomes/kg. Pre-existing neutralizing antibodies, however, completely or partially blocked hepatic gene transfer at that dose. No CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response against capsid was observed. Antibodies against the human FIX transgene product formed at a 10-fold higher vector dose, albeit hepatic gene transfer was remarkably consistent, and sustained FIX activity in the normal range was nonetheless achieved in two of three animals for the 3-month duration of the study. These results support the use of this vector at low vector doses for gene therapy of hemophilia B in humans."

To investigate the (1) expression of a complete panel of missense mutations at FIX activation sites and (2) contribution of F9 genotypes on the FIX pharmacokinetics (PK). We checked FIX activity and antigen and activity assays in plasma and after recombinant expression of FIX variants and performed an analysis of infused FIX PK parameters in patients (n = 30), mostly enrolled in the F9 Genotype and PK HB Italian Study (GePKHIS; EudraCT ID2017-003902-42). The variable FIXag amounts and good relation between biosynthesis and activity of multiple R191 variants results in graded moderate-to-mild severity of the R191C>L>P>H substitutions. Recombinant expression may predict the absence in the HB mutation database of the benign R191Q/W/K and R226K substitutions. Equivalent changes at R191/R226 produced higher FIXag levels for R226Q/W/P substitutions, as also observed in p.R226W female carrier plasma. Pharmacokinetics analysis in patients suggested that infused FIX Alpha distribution and Beta elimination phases positively correlated with endogenous FIXag levels. Mean residence time was particularly prolonged (79.4 h, 95% confidence interval 44.3-114.5) in patients (n = 7) with the R191/R226 substitutions, which in regression analysis were independent predictors (β coefficient 0.699, P = .004) of Beta half-life, potentially prolonged by the increasing over time ratio between endogenous and infused FIX. FIX activity and antigen levels and specific features of the dysfunctional R191/R226 variants may exert pleiotropic effects both on HB patients' phenotypes and substitutive treatment."

    "abstract": "Glucocorticoids have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive functions and have commonly been used for preventing liver toxicity after the systemic application of a high dose of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector for gene therapy. Clinical studies have reported that glucocorticoids have rescued factor IX (FIX) expression in patients with hemophilia B who showed a reduced FIX expression at 6 to 10 weeks post-AAV vector administration. In this study, we explored whether glucocorticoids could affect transgene expression in AAV targeted livers in animal models. When dexamethasone was applied before AAV9/FIX vector administration in the wild-type C57BL/6 mice, FIX expression was much higher than that of the control mice at any time point. More importantly, FIX expression transiently increased after dexamethasone was administered at week 6 or later post-AAV injection regardless of the various dexamethasone treatments applied. The transient enhancement in transgene expression was observed once there were one to several consecutive dexamethasone treatments completed. A similar result was also achieved in other wild-type BALB/c and hemophilia B mice that were treated with AAV9/FIX and dexamethasone. This mechanism study demonstrated that the administration of dexamethasone did not change either AAV genome copy number or transgene expression at the transcription level but transiently decreased interferon beta (IFN-β) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) expression in the livers of mice at a later time after AAV injection. Next, we studied the effect of dexamethasone on late transgene expression in hemophilia B dogs. Dexamethasone was administered 1 year after AAV9/FIX injection. Inconsistent with the results in mice, no significant change of FIX expression was observed in hemophilia B dogs. In summary, the results from this study indicate that dexamethasone may have various effects on transgene expression in AAV-transduced livers in different species, which provides valuable information about the rational application of dexamethasone in future clinical studies."

Outcomes were evaluated at one week and three months post-intervention and included pain, joint status, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), emotional state and inflammatory profile (leukocytes, C-reactive protein, cytokines). The randomization sequence was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed until enrolment.

All relevant published articles and prescribing information on eptacog beta for the treatment of congenital hemophilia with inhibitors were reviewed. Eptacog beta is a novel recombinant activated factor VII (rVIIa) product that demonstrated efficacy in controlling bleeding and associated pain in patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. Eptacog beta has limited Food and Drug Administration-approved and off-label indications compared with other bypassing agents (BPAs; activated prothrombin complex concentrates [aPCC; eptacog alfa]). Eptacog beta costs less than eptacog alfa, but still more than aPCCs. This review provides insight into the role of eptacog beta for treatment of congenital hemophilia with inhibitors and reviews important health system formulary considerations for available BPAs. Eptacog beta is more cost-effective than eptacog alfa and, as such, may become the preferred rVIIa formulary product. However, eptacog alfa availability remains necessary for the treatment of disorders where eptacog beta has limited data. aPCC should remain the first-line BPA for the treatment of bleeding in patients with inhibitors with no contraindications to use because of its equivocal efficacy and safety and in light of the magnitude of cost savings associated with this strategy."

Collected data included demographics, ISTH-BAT score, factor activity level, type of haemophilia (A or B), genotype and geographic residence. Nine hundred twenty-two haemophilia carriers in the ATHNdataset reported a BLS. When adjusted for age, 74% reported a normal score. Logistic regression identified age, factor activity level, ethnicity and region of residence as risk factors for an abnormal score. The majority of haemophilia carriers (74%) in the ATHNdataset had a normal BLS, including the majority (59%) with factor activity levels < 40 IU/dl. Conversely, 24% of haemophilia carriers with a factor activity level <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo>></mo></math> 40 IU/dl reported an abnormal BLS. These results are consistent with previous studies of haemophilia carriers. Additional investigation is needed to determine why a majority of haemophilia carriers with low factor activity levels report normal BLSs while a significant minority of haemophilia carriers with normal activity levels report abnormal BLSs."

    "title": "Perioperative haematological outcomes following total knee arthroplasty in haemophiliacs.",
    "abstract": "Patients with haemophilia suffer from recurrent joint haemarthrosis. This can progress to symptomatic arthropathy commonly affecting the knee. While modern coagulation strategies have reduced those proceeding to end-stage arthropathy, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains the optimal treatment for some patients. Despite innovation in perioperative haematological management, concerns about the potential for excessive haemorrhage still exist. The aim of this study is to quantify immediate postoperative blood loss and haematological complications in haemophiliacs following TKA. A retrospective study of patients with haemophilia types A or B who underwent a TKA over a 12-year period at a single institution was conducted. These patients were compared to both a non-haemophiliac control group and to published standards in non-haemophiliacs undergoing TKA. Twenty-one TKA procedures in 18 patients (72% haemophilia A, 28% haemophilia B) were suitable for inclusion with a mean age of 44 years. The mean haemoglobin drops at 24 and 48 h postoperatively were 2.7 g/dl and 3.8 g/dl respectively. There was no significant difference in haemoglobin drop at 48 h postoperatively when compared to the non-haemophiliac control group (<i>P</i> = 0.2644). There were no immediate perioperative complications and two patients (9.6%) required postoperative transfusion. Haemophiliacs undergoing a unilateral primary TKA in a specialised tertiary referral centre appear to have comparable rates of perioperative blood loss when compared to both a non-haemophiliac control group as and published haemostatic standards in non-haemophiliac patients following TKA. Perioperative management with expert orthopaedic and haematological input is recommended to optimise outcomes in this complex patient group."

    "abstract": "Platelets are important in hemostasis and participate widely in metabolism. Glycoproteins (GPs) on the surface of platelets can fold into different spatial structures caused by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and perform as antigens. Human platelet antigen (HPAs) immunology has been reported to have a close relationship with many clinical issues, suggesting the importance of HPA genotyping and platelet antibody detection. In this study, we aimed to detect human platelet antigen (HPA) and HPA antibody characters of hemophilia patients in Hanchuan, China. Totally, 127 hemophilia A (HA) and 33 hemophilia B (HB) patients were included in this study. We examined the HPA genotypes of hemophilia patients by PCR with specific primers (PCR-SP). Then we calculated the frequencies of HPA alleles in hemophilia patients using the gene-counting method and compared them with data from normal people in China. The results showed no significant differences except that the prevalence of HPA-2b was significantly higher in HA patients when compared to healthy people (0.0827 vs. 0.0485, P=0.0212) and the prevalence of HPA-4b was significantly higher in HB patients when compared to both HA patients (0.0758 vs. 0.0079, P=0.0008) and healthy people (0.0758 vs. 0.0045, P<0.0001). Finally, using Luminex assay, we detected the features of HPA antibody in hemophilia patients and found ratios of anti-HPA-3a (7.87% in HA patients, 9.09% in HB patients, and 1.26% in healthy people), anti-HPA-5b (3.15% in HA patients, 3.03% in HB patients, and 0.42% in healthy people), and anti-HPA-2b (3.15% in HA patients, 3.03% in HB patients, and 0.21% in healthy people) were all higher in hemophilia patients. To conclude, our data indicate that the detection and identification of clinically relevant platelet antibodies are important for patients with hemophilia to prevent immune-mediated thrombocytopenia."

The objectives were to determine the prevalence of sexual difficulty in people living with hemophilia (PWH) compared to people with no bleeding disorders (PWNoBD), and to determine factors associated with it. This was an analysis of the PROBE study. We recruited individuals who had hemophilia A or B (PWH) and PWNoBD who were 18 years old or older. We calculated proportions of participants with sexual difficulty and odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for sex and age with 95% confidence intervals. There were 2007 PWH and 1972 PWNoBD. Mean (standard deviation) age was 41 (15) years in PWH and 42 (13) years in PWNoBD. Sexual difficulty was reported in 302 (15.1%) PWH and 79 (4.0%) PWNoBD. The odds of sexual difficulty were significantly higher in PWH (OR 3.82, 95% CI 2.85, 5.11). Among PWH, older age, experiencing acute or chronic pain in the past 12 months, bleeds within the past two weeks, ≥3 spontaneous joint bleeds (past six months), limitation of range of motion of any joints, and any life- or limb-threatening bleeds in the past 12 months were associated with sexual difficulty. Sexual difficulty is more prevalent in people living with hemophilia and associated with markers of disease severity. Sexual health issues should be incorporated in comprehensive hemophilia care, future research, and hemophilia related health policy."

    "title": "Advances in the management of haemophilia: emerging treatments and their mechanisms.",
    "abstract": "Mainstay haemophilia treatment, namely intravenous factor replacement, poses several clinical challenges including frequent injections due to the short half-life of recombinant factors, intravenous administration (which is particularly challenging in those with difficult venous access), and the risk of inhibitor development. These impact negatively upon quality of life and treatment compliance, highlighting the need for improved therapies. Several novel pharmacological therapies developed for haemophilia aim to rebalance the clotting cascade and potentially circumvent the aforementioned challenges. These therapies utilise a range of different mechanisms, namely: the extension of the circulating half-life of standard recombinant factors; the mimicking of factor VIII cofactor activity; rebalancing of coagulation through targeting of natural anticoagulants such as antithrombin and tissue factor pathway inhibitor; and inducing the production of endogenous factors with gene therapy. These therapies carry the potential of revolutionising haemophilia treatment by alleviating the current challenges presented by mainstay factor replacement. This review will provide an overview of the key trial findings related to novel therapies based on the mechanisms described above."

    "abstract": "A second peak of inhibitors has been reported in patients with severe hemophilia A (HA) aged >50 years in the United Kingdom. The reason for this suggested breakdown of tolerance in the aging population is unclear, as is the potential impact of regular exposure to the deficient factor by prophylaxis at higher age. No data on hemophilia B (HB) have ever been reported. The ADVANCE Working Group investigated the incidence of late-onset inhibitors and the use of prophylaxis in patients with HA and HB aged ≥40 years. A retrospective, observational, cohort, survey-based study of all patients aged ≥40 years with HA or HB treated at an ADVANCE hemophilia treatment center. Information on 3,095 people aged ≥40 years with HA or HB was collected. Of the 2,562 patients with severe HA, the majority (73% across all age groups) received prophylaxis. In patients with severe HA, the inhibitor incidence per 1,000 treatment years was 2.37 (age 40-49), 1.25 (age 50-59), and 1.45 (age 60 + ). Overall, the inhibitor incidence was greatest in those with moderate HA (5.77 [age 40-49], 6.59 [age 50-59], and 4.69 [age 60 + ]) and the majority of inhibitor cases were preceded by a potential immune system challenge. No inhibitors in patients with HB were reported. Our data do not identify a second peak of inhibitor development in older patients with hemophilia. Prophylaxis may be beneficial in older patients with severe, and possibly moderate HA, to retain a tolerant state at a higher age."

Shortening the questionnaire may facilitate use of the HAL. The aim of this study was to determine which items of the HAL are redundant, to construct a shorter version of the HAL, and to determine the construct validity of the HAL<sub>short</sub> . A secondary analysis was performed on pooled data of two published studies using the HAL (seven domains, 42 items, optimum score: 100) in adults with haemophilia A/B. Data were divided into a derivation (62%) and a validation set (38%). Redundant items were identified by evaluation of: floor and ceiling effects, proportions of missing and 'not applicable' responses, inter-item correlations, component loadings in an exploratory factor analysis, internal consistency, and item-total correlations. Correlations with the SF-36 and EQ-5D-5L were used to determine construct validity of the HAL<sub>short</sub> . Data on 680 PWH were evaluated. In the derivation dataset (n = 420), median age was 30 years (range 18-80), 43% had severe haemophilia and 61% received prophylaxis. Median (IQR) HAL sum score was 65.0 (55.7-88.8). The stepwise procedure resulted in a HAL<sub>short</sub> of 18 items with a median sum score of 63.3 (54.4-86.7). Construct validity was similar for the HAL and HAL<sub>short</sub> in the validation dataset (n = 260). This clinimetric study resulted in a >50% shortening of the HAL. The 18-item HAL<sub>short</sub> reduces patient burden and is expected to capture the information on activities and participation. The HAL<sub>short</sub> needs further validation."

To estimate the number of females with haemophilia receiving care at HTCs in the United States and compare their characteristics with those of males with haemophilia. HTC PP data collected on people receiving care at an HTC from January 2012 through September 2020 with haemophilia A and B were evaluated by sex for demographic and clinical characteristics. A factor level < 40% was reported for 23,196 males (97.8%) and 1667 females (47.6%) attending HTCs; 51 (.48%) severe, 79 (1.4%) moderate, and 1537 (17.9%) mild haemophilia patients were female. Females were older, more often White, and less often non-Hispanic than males. Females were less likely to have history of HIV or HCV infection, even among those with severe disease, but twice as likely to have infection status unknown. Females with mild haemophilia were more often uninsured than males. Females with severe or moderate haemophilia are uncommon, even in specialized care centres; however, almost one in five patients with mild haemophilia was female, indicating needs for specialized care based on factor level and history for affected females."

    "abstract": "Orthologous proteins contain sequence disparity guided by natural selection. In certain cases, species-specific protein functionality predicts pharmacological enhancement, such as greater specific activity or stability. However, immunological barriers generally preclude use of nonhuman proteins as therapeutics, and difficulty exists in the identification of individual sequence determinants among the overall sequence disparity. Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) represents a platform for the prediction and resurrection of ancient gene and protein sequences. Recently, we demonstrated that ASR can be used as a platform to facilitate the identification of therapeutic protein variants with enhanced properties. Specifically, we identified coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) variants with improved specific activity, biosynthesis, stability, and resistance to anti-human FVIII antibody-based inhibition. In the current study, we resurrected a panel of ancient mammalian coagulation factor IX (FIX) variants with the goal of identifying improved pharmaceutical candidates. One variant (An96) demonstrated 12-fold greater FIX activity production than human FIX. Addition of the R338L Padua substitution further increased An96 activity, suggesting independent but additive mechanisms. after adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2)/8-FIX gene therapy, 10-fold greater plasma FIX activity was observed in hemophilia B mice administered AAV2/8-An96-Padua as compared with AAV2/8-human FIX-Padua. Furthermore, phenotypic correction conferred by the ancestral variant was confirmed using a saphenous vein bleeding challenge and thromboelastography. Collectively, these findings validate the ASR drug discovery platform as well as identify an ancient FIX candidate for pharmaceutical development."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) are rare disorders, being caused by the total lack or under-expression of two factors from the coagulation cascade coded by genes of the X chromosome. Thus, in hemophilic patients, the blood does not clot properly. This results in spontaneous bleeding episodes after an injury or surgical intervention. A patient-centered regimen is considered optimal. Age, pharmacokinetics, bleeding phenotype, joint status, adherence, physical activity, personal goals are all factors that should be considered when individualizing therapy. In the past 10 years, many innovations in the diagnostic and treatment options were presented as being either approved or in development, thus helping clinicians to improve the standard-of-care for patients with hemophilia. Recombinant factors still remain the standard of care in hemophilia, however they pose a challenge to treatment adherence because they have short half-life, which where the extended half-life (EHL) factors come with the solution, increasing the half-life to 96 hours. Gene therapies have a promising future with proven beneficial effects in clinical trials. We present and critically analyze in the current manuscript the pros and cons of all the major discoveries in the diagnosis and treatment of HA and HB, as well as identify key areas of hemophilia research where improvements are needed."

    "abstract": "The hallmark of severe hemophilia (A or B) is recurrent bleeding into joints and soft tissues with progressive joint damage, despite on-demand treatment. Prophylaxis has long been used, but not universally adopted, because of medical, psychosocial, and cost controversies. To determine the effectiveness of clotting factor concentrate prophylaxis in managing previously-treated individuals with hemophilia A or B. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. In addition, we searched MEDLINE and Embase and online trial registries. Most recent search of Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register: 24 February 2021. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating people with hemophilia A or hemophilia B, who were previously treated with clotting factor concentrates to manage their hemophilia. Two authors independently reviewed trials for eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. Ten trials (including 608 participants) were eligible for inclusion. Eight of the trials (477 participants) had arms comparing two or more prophylactic regimens to one another and four of the trials (n = 258) compared prophylaxis to on-demand treatment (two trials had multiple arms and were included in both comparisons). Comparison of two or more prophylactic regimens For trials comparing one prophylaxis regimen to another, given the heterogeneity of the data, none of the data were pooled for this comparison. Considering the individual trials, three trials reported the primary outcome of joint bleeding, and none showed a dfference between dosing regimens (low-certainty evidence). For the secondary outcome of total bleeding events, prophylaxis with a twice-weekly regimen of FIX likely results in reduced total bleeds compared to a once-a-week regimen of the same dose, mean difference (MD) 11.2 (5.81 to 16.59) (one trial, 10 participants, low-certainty evidence). Transient low-titer anti-FVIII inhibitors were reported in one of the trials. Blood-transmitted infections were not identified. Other adverse events reported include hypersensitivity, oedema, and weight gain. These were, however, rare and unrelated to study drugs (very low-certainty evidence). Comparison of prophylactic and on-demand regimens Four of the trials (258 participants) had arms that compared prophylaxis to on-demand treatment. Prophylaxis may result in a large decrease in the number of joint bleeds compared to on-demand treatment, MD -30.34 (95% CI -46.95 to -13.73) (two trials, 164 participants, low-certainty evidence). One of these trials (84 participants) also reported the long-term effects of prophylaxis versus on-demand therapy showing improved joint function, quality of life, and pain; but no differences between groups in joint structure when assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In one trial (84 participants) validated measures for joint health and pain assessment showed that prophylaxis likely improves joint health compared to an on-demand regimen with an estimated change difference of 0.94 points (95% CI 0.23 to 1.65) and improves total pain scores, MD -17.20 (95% CI -27.48 to -6.92 (moderate-certainty evidence). Two trials (131 participants) reported that prophylaxis likely results in a slight increase in adverse events, risk ratio 1.71 (1.24 to 2.37) (moderate-certainty evidence). No inhibitor development and blood-transmitted infections were identified. Overall, the certainty of the body of evidence was judged to be low because of different types of bias that could have altered the effect. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence from RCTs that prophylaxis, as compared to on-demand treatment, may reduce bleeding frequency in previously-treated people with hemophilia. Prophylaxis may also improve joint function, pain and quality of life, even though this does not translate into a detectable improvement of articular damage when assessed by MRI. When comparing two different prophylaxis regimens, no significant differences in terms of protection from bleeding were found. Dose optimization could, however, result in improved efficacy. Given the heterogeneity of the data, pooled estimates were not obtained for most comparisons. Well-designed RCTs and prospective observational controlled studies with standardised definitions and measurements are needed to establish the optimal and most cost-effective treatment regimens."

Two cases were lost for follow-up and 12 patient,all boys, were finally followed up and included in the study. The patients aged from 13 months to 10 years old. The medical history, clinic manefestitions and the features of the radiology examination were recorded. The patients were treated by using replacement treatment first. If the conservative treatment was not effective, the patients then received operation combined with pereoperation replacement thearapy. The patients were followed up for 13 months to 10 years.There were 11 cases of hemophilia A, and 1 case of hemophilia B. Two cases were severe type, the others (10/12) were mild and moderate types. Only 1 case was diagnosed as hemophilia initially. Nine cases (9/12) were misdiagnosed as malignant tumors, 1 case was misdiagnosed as osteomyelitis and 1 case was misdiagnosed as hemangioma. Only 3 cases had identified history of trauma before. <b>Results:</b> All cases were treated with replacement therapy first, among which 10 cases were effective, 8 cases were cured by conservative therapy, 1 case had residual soft tissue fistula after conservative treatment and 1 case recurrented after conservative treatment for 8 months. Two patients with poor efficacy to the replacement treatment were performed operations and finally were cured. <b>Conclusions:</b> The misdiagnosis rate of HPT in maxillofacial region was high. The conservative factor replacement therapy could achieve good results in most children and could be used as the preferred treatment.

    "abstract": "The bleeding risk in individuals with inherited bleeding disorders (IBDs) during exodontia is traditionally managed with perioperative coagulation factors and/or desmopressin, in conjunction with systemic and topical perioperative tranexamic acid and meticulous primary closure. Factor replacement is costly, requires specialist input, and carries a risk of developing factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitors. This prospective study was performed to determine whether the use of a standardized Floseal and anti-fibrinolytic protocol could reduce postoperative bleeding in patients with IBDs undergoing dental extraction, as compared to factor replacement. All patients >18 years old attending Queensland Haemophilia Centre between November 2014 and July 2019 who required dental extractions were referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Unit. Patients were consented for intraoperative Floseal administration instead of factor replacement. All other operative measures remained the same. The bleed rate was assessed against a historical control cohort. There were 34 extraction events in 32 patients. Four of the patients reported postoperative bleeding requiring factor supplementation or desmopressin; the bleeding rate was 11.8%. While not statistically significant, this was a reduction in the bleed rate compared to the traditional protocol (P = 0.35). Third molar extractions were 10.33 times more likely to cause postoperative bleeding (P = 0.018). The Floseal protocol was equipotent to the traditional perioperative factor replacement protocol. Floseal use is more economical, eliminates the risk of peri-procedural FVIII inhibitor development, and provides a haemostatic option for patients with very rare factor deficiencies, pre-existing clotting factor inhibitors, and those with anaphylaxis to clotting concentrates."

    "title": "Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Prophylaxis Versus On-demand Treatment for Children With Hemophilia B Without Inhibitors in China.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia B (HB) is a hereditary bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of coagulation factor IX (FIX), which represents 15% to 20% of all patients with hemophilia. Clinical studies have found significant benefits of prophylaxis treatment with FIX versus on-demand (OD) treatment. However, these benefits are associated with an increase in FIX consumption and a considerable increase in cost. Most Chinese children with HB receive OD treatment. Only a small proportion of patients with HB receive prophylaxis treatment in China. The patients with inhibitors could result in more complicated bleeding events, joint status, or treatment patterns. The objective of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis compared with OD treatment in children with HB without inhibitors from the Chinese health care perspective. A Markov model was used to analyze cost-effectiveness by comparing prophylaxis with OD treatment. The model uses a 17-year time horizon with a yearly cycle. Transition probabilities and utility weights were estimated using published studies. The cost data for patients with HB were collected from Beijing Children's Hospital and Capital Medical University. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results. The model projects that prophylaxis has an incremental 1.23 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost per QALY gained for individuals with HB receiving prophylaxis was ¥155,709.80 ($23,530.36) compared with the OD group, which is under the willingness-to-pay threshold (3 times the gross domestic product per capital according to the World Health Organization recommendations) in China of ¥193,932 ($29,306.37). Moreover, 1-way sensitivity analysis found that the results were sensitive to the utility of nonarticular bleeding. The lower this parameter is, the higher the probability is of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for prophylaxis not being cost-effective. This finding infers that when the patients have a better QALY (higher utility) at the beginning, the cost for benefit from prophylaxis treatment is lower. The results of the probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicate that the probability of prophylaxis being cost-effective is 89.3%. Although prophylaxis is a costly treatment, the results of this study indicate that it is cost-effective compared with OD treatment for children with HB in China."

Previous international studies have reported some therapeutic and genetic factors associated with inhibitor development. However, actual situations, such as genetic-background, treatment, and inhibitor development, have remained unclear in PwH in Japan. The Japan Hemophilia Inhibitor Study 2 (J-HIS2) was organized in 2008 to establish a nation-wide registry system for PwH in Japan and prospectively investigate the risk factors for inhibitor development. Patients who were newly diagnosed after 2007 without inhibitor and whose treatment was traceable from 0 to 75 exposure days were enrolled in J-HIS2. Of the 386 patients (hemophilia A [HA]: 315, hemophilia B [HB]: 71) from 46 facilities, inhibitor development was observed in 77 (HA: 71, HB: 6) by November 2018. Inhibitor development was observed in 31.6% of patients with severe hemophilia A, 6.5% with moderate hemophilia A, and 1.8% with mild hemophilia A. However, it was observed in 15.4% of those with severe hemophilia B. The relative-risk of the F8 null genotype for inhibitor development was higher than that of the non-null one (p<0.01). In patients with severe hemophilia A with 25 exposure days of infusions or inhibitor development, prophylaxis was more protective for inhibitor development than non-prophylaxis (p<0.01). A simultaneous infusion of FVIII-concentrates and vaccination seemed to exert a limited effect on inhibitor development. History of intracranial hemorrhage appears to be associated with inhibitor development."

To assess the post-operative morbidity of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) surgeries and of oncological prostate interventions in patients with mild haemophilia A or B. We performed a monocentre, epidemiological, in real life study. Data were collected between 1 January, 1997 and 1 September, 2020 and focused on prostate biopsy, radical prostatectomy, prostate radiotherapy, simple prostatectomy, transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) and laser-vaporisation in patients with mild haemophilia A or B.

For prostate biopsies (n = 24), median length of hospitalisation was 4 days and only one patient needed a blood transfusion. No patient needed re-admission. For prostatectomy (n = 10), one patient presented with intra-operative and post-operative bleeding. Two patients required re-admission. The other patients did not present any significant haemorrhagic symptoms. For radiotherapy (n = 4), two patients presented a grade II complication (radiocystitis and radiorectitis).

    "abstract": "To investigate the current experience and expertise for haemophilia inhibitor patient management in haemophilia treatment centres (HTCs) in mainland China. Questionnaires were distributed to 'tertiary tier A' hospital HTCs across China to collect information on treatment preferences for bleeding control, prophylaxis and inhibitor eradication, as well as their regimens in real-world clinical practice. Of 40 questionnaires distributed, 39 were returned. In all, 38 were analysable for treatment preferences and 34 for actual clinical practice. For haemostatic treatment, 76·3% (29/38) HTCs preferred activated recombinant human Factor VII (rFVIIa). In clinical practice, the most widely used by-pass agent was prothrombin complex concentrate (26 HTCs). Although 65·8% (25/38) of HTCs believed prophylaxis treatment was necessary, it was prescribed in only 12. Similarly, 65·8% (25/38) of HTCs believed immune tolerance induction (ITI) therapy was necessary but only 14·8% (92/622) of patients in 19 HTCs received low-dose ITI treatment. HTCs in relatively economically developed cities (with higher-than-average per-capita gross domestic product) had better access to haemostatic treatment, coagulation testing and were more likely to provide prophylaxis and ITI in practice. The present survey showed there were gaps in haemophilia inhibitor care between the HTC physicians' preferences and their actual clinical practice. More specific care guidelines, education and clinical decision support tools are needed to guide clinical practice."

    "title": "Tailoring the effect of antithrombin-targeting therapy in haemophilia A using in silico thrombin generation.",
    "abstract": "Factor (F) VIII deficiency causes bleeding in haemophilia A patients because of the reduced formation of procoagulant enzyme thrombin, which is needed to make the blood clot. We measured the dynamics of coagulation in haemophilia A patients by measuring thrombin generation (TG). Additionally, we quantified the procoagulant process of prothrombin conversion and anticoagulant process of thrombin inhibitor complex formation. In haemophilia A, prothrombin conversion is severely reduced, causing TG to be low. Nevertheless, the thrombin inactivation capacity of these patients is comparable to that in healthy subjects, leading to a severe imbalance between procoagulant and anticoagulant processes and a subsequent increased bleeding risk. A novel therapy in haemophilia A is the targeting of anticoagulant pathway, e.g. thrombin inhibitor antithrombin (AT), to restore the haemostatic balance. We simulated the effect of AT reduction on TG in silico. Lowering AT levels restored TG dose-dependently and an AT reduction of 90-95% led to almost normal TG in most patients . However, the variation in response to AT reduction was large between patients, indicating that this approach should be tailored to each individual patients. Ideally, TG and thrombin dynamics simulation could in the future contribute to the management of patients undergoing AT targeting therapy."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder in which the haemostatic defect results from deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in haemophilia A or factor IX (FIX) in haemophilia B. Traditional treatments for haemophilia have largely worked by directly replacing the missing coagulation factor, but face challenges due to the short half-life of FVIII and FIX, the need for frequent intravenous access and development of neutralising antibodies to coagulation factors (inhibitors). Recent advances in haemophilia therapy have worked to eliminate these challenges. Half-life extension of factor concentrates has lengthened the time needed between infusions, enhancing quality of life. Subcutaneous administration of therapeutics utilising alternative mechanisms to overcome inhibitors have expanded the options to prevent bleeding. Finally, initial successes with gene therapy offer a cautious hope for durable cure. In the present review, we will discuss currently available treatments, as well as highlight therapeutics in various stages of clinical development for the treatment of haemophilia A and B. In this review, we present therapies that are currently clinically available and highlight therapeutics that are in various stages of clinical development for the treatment of haemophilia A and B."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy has shown promise in clinical trials for patients with haemophilia, but patient preference studies have focused on factor replacement treatments. We conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to investigate the relative importance and differential preferences patients provide for gene therapy attributes. We surveyed male adults with haemophilia in the United States recruited from patient panels including the National Hemophilia Foundation Community Voices in Research platform using an online survey over 4 months in 2020/21. Participants indicated preferences for gene therapy attributes including dosing frequency/durability, effect on annual bleeding, uncertainty related to side effects, impact on daily activities, impact on mental health, and post-treatment requirements. The relative importance of each attribute was analysed overall and for subgroups based on haemophilia type and severity. A total of 183 males with haemophilia A (n = 120) or B (n = 63) were included. Half (47%) had severe haemophilia; most (75%) were White. Overall, participants gave effect on bleeding rate the greatest relative importance (31%), followed by dose frequency/durability (26%), uncertainty regarding safety issues (17%), and impact on daily activities (11%). Dose frequency/durability had the greatest importance for those with haemophilia B (35%). People with haemophilia prioritised reduced bleeding and treatment burden; the former was more important in haemophilia A and the latter in haemophilia B, followed by safety and impact on daily life in this DCE of gene therapy attributes. These findings and differences can inform clinical and health policy decisions to improve health equity for people with haemophilia."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a monogenic mutational disease affecting coagulation factor VIII or factor IX genes. The palliative treatment of choice is based on the use of safe and effective recombinant clotting factors. Advanced therapies will be curative, ensuring stable and durable concentrations of the defective circulating factor. Results have so far been encouraging in terms of levels and times of expression using mainly adeno-associated vectors. However, these therapies are associated with immunogenicity and hepatotoxicity. Optimizing the vector serotypes and the transgene (variants) will boost clotting efficacy, thus increasing the viability of these protocols. It is essential that both physicians and patients be informed about the potential benefits and risks of the new therapies, and a register of gene therapy patients be kept with information of the efficacy and long-term adverse events associated with the treatments administered. In the context of hemophilia, gene therapy may result in (particularly indirect) cost savings and in a more equitable allocation of treatments. In the case of hemophilia A, further research is needed into how to effectively package the large factor VIII gene into the vector; and in the case of hemophilia B, the priority should be to optimize both the vector serotype, reducing its immunogenicity and hepatotoxicity, and the transgene, boosting its clotting efficacy so as to minimize the amount of vector administered and decrease the incidence of adverse events without compromising the efficacy of the protein expressed."

    "abstract": "Since the cloning and characterization of the factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX genes in the mid-1980s, gene therapy has been perceived as having significant potential for the treatment of severe hemophilia. Now, some 35 years later, these proposals are close to being realized through the licensing of the first clinical gene therapy product. Adeno-associated viral vector-mediated gene therapy for hemophilia A and B has been extensively investigated in preclinical models over the past 20 years, and since 2011, there has been increasing evidence in early phase clinical trials that this therapeutic strategy can provide safe and effective rescue of the hemostatic phenotype in severe hemophilia. As the uptake of hemophilia gene therapy progresses, it is clear that many aspects of the gene therapy process require crucial laboratory support to ensure safe and effective outcomes from his new therapeutic paradigm. These laboratory contributions extend from evaluations of the gene therapy vehicle, assessments of the patient immune status for the vector, and ultimately the performance of assays to determine the hemostatic benefit of the gene therapy and potentially of its long-term safety on the host genome. As with many aspects of past hemophilia care, the safe and effective delivery of gene therapy will require an informed and coordinated contribution from laboratory science."

    "abstract": "In patients with hemophilia B, treatment with extended half-life (EHL) recombinant factor IX allows for longer dosing intervals while providing equal or superior bleeding protection compared with standard half-life products. This enables flexible, individualized treatment schedules, which reduce the burden of prophylaxis and improve patient outcomes. This analysis compared the efficacy of recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) and recombinant factor IX albumin fusion protein (rIX-FP), two EHL therapies approved for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding in hemophilia B. Matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison (MAIC) was used to adjust the between-treatment differences in baseline characteristics. Individual patient data for rFIXFc (B-LONG) were matched to aggregated data for rIX-FP (PROLONG-9FP) followed by statistical comparison for estimated annualized bleeding rate (ABR) using a Poisson regression model with adjustment for over dispersion. Data were analyzed according to treatment regimen prior to study entry: prior prophylaxis (rFIXFc, n=48; rIX-FP, n=40) or prior episodic treatment (n=43 and n=19, respectively). Relative treatment effects are presented as incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, estimated ABR observed for rFIXFc and rIX-FP was not significantly different in patients on prior prophylaxis (1.87 versus 1.58; IRR 1.18, 95% CI 0.67-2.10) or prior episodic (2.25 versus 2.22; IRR 1.01 95% CI 0.40-2.57) regimens. This MAIC analysis shows that the estimated ABR for rFIXFc-treated patients from B-LONG was similar to that of rIX-FP-treated patients from PROLONG-9FP and, therefore, indicates that the two EHL therapies provide similar efficacy when used as prophylaxis for patients with hemophilia B. Trough levels differ between the two products (1-3% [targeted] versus 20% [observed], respectively), suggesting that trough level is not a surrogate indicator when ABR is used as a criterion for clinical efficacy when comparing these FIX products in hemophilia B."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a high cost low volume disease. Resource limited nations (RLN) usually spend very little on health budget and most of it is spent in dealing with common ailments. Clotting products constitute more than 90% of the total cost of hemophilia care. The manner in which these products can be made accessible for persons with hemophilia (PWH) and how its continuous supply and distribution can be maintained and improved is described in this review. Number of PWH in the Resource Limited Nations (RLN); minimum amount of concentrate required to keep a PWH relatively free of bleeds; the different products available for management of PWH; means and ways to minimize and optimize the concentrate usage and purchase on a budget; nonfactor therapy; ways and means to improve the management and allow better quality concentrates in higher quantities for PWH in those countries; adherence as a challenge for RLN country and ways to manage them. The time covered is from 1980s till date. Pubmed was searched mainly for review articles with the key words hemophilia, RLN, concentrate access, alternative therapy. Cross references from these reviews as well as some of the abstracts from international conferences were read. Developing a patient's society and a bleeding disorder registry are the two most important actions toward ensuring adequate treatment material for PWH in RLN. Government should allocate a budget for hemophilia care depending on the number of PWH diagnosed and future projection of increased numbers of PWH. Population based product requirement may not work initially as only 10-20% of PWH in such a country has been diagnosed hence initial requirement of concentrates should be directed to these patients. Meanwhile efforts should be made to diagnose new cases. Antenatal diagnosis centers should offer antenatal diagnosis and prevent birth of severe hemophilia children. Self sufficiency in plasma based concentrates should be planned and aimed. A national tendering committee can get a good price on the concentrates on global tendering with annual rate contracts (prevents outdating). Avoiding wastage by outdating of the products in large denomination vials will help. Hoarding concentrates in unreasonable amounts should be avoided through good supply chain management. Regular physiotherapy, proper use of optimum amounts of concentrate will reduce per PWH consumption of the factor concentrates. Plasma derived intermediate purity factors, first/second generation recombinant clotting factors are safe and relatively cheaper as well as effective. Also concentrates which are close to their expiry date (>3 < 6 months) are equally effective and cheap. With proper supply chain management such products can be included in the portfolio. Primary prophylaxis with low/ intermediate dose of the concentrates is a cost-effective way to manage the patients and this also reduces inhibitor development. Adherence to therapy is not yet an important issue for RLN countries but will become one in future. With advancement and improvement the country can access alternative non factor concentrates and other newer products."

However, some have stated that they do not wish to have gene therapy either now or in the future. This sub-study, part of the larger Exigency programme, assesses the attitudes, views and understanding of those who do not wish to undergo gene therapy. Participants were approached via social media and word of mouth referral and invited to participate in a focus group or individual interview to discuss their views. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Ten adult men with severe haemophilia (eight haemophilia A and two haemophilia B), mean age 34.3 years, participated in a 1-h focus group (n = 9) or interview (n = 1). All were on prophylaxis. None reported significant treatment burden, and all had annual bleeding rates of less than five in the previous 12 months. Four major themes emerged: self-identity and its loss, lack of long-term safety and efficacy data, ongoing concerns about past viral infection, and lack of current treatment burden. There are many concerns about gene therapy, including eligibility, effectiveness and safety, which may result in individuals declining it as a therapy. These concerns may recede as more data are published. This study reveals a psychological dynamic around self-identity and belonging for PwH. The nature of this dynamic is poorly understood and needs exploration to facilitate support for those making decisions about gene therapy."

We report our single-center experience of tailored prophylaxis in children affected by hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB). This study was conducted on 55 patients, under 15 years, with HA (PWHA, n: 46) and HB (PWHB, n: 9) between 2015 and 2019. According to the phenotype, three prophylaxis regimens: 25-50 unit/kg once, twice, or three-times a week for PWHA, and two: 30-50 unit/kg once or twice a week for PWHB were administered. Following the occurrence of > 3 joint bleeding, or > 4 soft tissue bleeding, or one spontaneous major bleeding in the last 3 months, the prophylaxis regimen is changed. Annualized bleeding rate (ABR), annualized joint bleeding rate (AJBR), target joints development, inhibitor development, and hemophilia joint health score (HJHS) also were assessed. A mean ± SD of 2520 ± 1045 IU/kg/yr coagulation factor (F) VIII was used to reduce ABR and AJBR from 1.02 ± 1.11 and 0.8 ± 1.3 (in the first year of the study) to 0.27 ± 0.44 (P < 0.001) and 0.19 ± 0.38 (P = 0.004) (at the end of the study) in PWHA, respectively. Furthermore, in PWHB, in the first year of the study, with using 2168 ± 1216 IU/kg coagulation FIX, ABR and AJBR were 0.19 ± 0.39 and 0.06 ± 0.1. At the end of the study, ABR and AJBR were 0.02 ± 0.05 (p = 0.156) and 0.01 ± 0.03 (p = 0.361), respectively. During the study period, the mean number of the target joints and mean HJHS were 0.25 ± 0.57 and 7.6 ± 2.1 for PWHA and 0 and 6.3 ± 1.8 for PWHB, respectively. Finally, 5 PWHA (11 %) did not need dose-escalation in their prophylaxis regimen, whereas 31 (67 %) and 10 (21 %) PWHA needed two and three infusions a week, respectively. In PWHB, 7 (78 %) and 2 (22 %) were adjusted to receive a once and twice weekly regimen, respectively. Our results suggest that tailored prophylaxis is an effective strategy to reduce the rate of bleeding and optimize the replacement therapy in children with hemophilia."

Dutch males with hemophilia (all severities) completed questionnaires that contained sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, the PROMIS-29, RAND-36, and the Hemophilia Activities List (HAL). Structural validity of each subscale was assessed with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Internal consistency was calculated for each subscale with sufficient model fit in CFA. Construct validity was assessed by testing hypotheses about (1) correlations of each PROMIS-29 subscale with corresponding scales of RAND-36 and domains of HAL, and (2) mean differences in T-scores between subgroups with different hemophilia severities, self-reported joint impairment, and HIV infection status. We considered ≥75% of data in accordance with the hypotheses evidence for construct validity. In total, 770 persons with hemophilia participated in this cross-sectional study. CFA revealed sufficient structural validity for five subscales: Physical Function, Depression, Sleep Disturbance, Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities, and Pain Interference. Internal consistency was high and Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.79 for Sleep Disturbance to 0.96 for Pain Interference. Differences between clinical subgroups were in the expected direction. Construct validity was confirmed for Physical Function, Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, and Pain Intensity.

In this open-label, phase 3 study, male PUPs (age <18 years) with hemophilia B (≤2 IU/dL of endogenous factor IX [FIX]) were to receive treatment with rFIXFc. Primary end point was occurrence of inhibitor development, with a secondary end point of annualized bleed rate (ABR). Of 33 patients who received ≥1 dose of rFIXFc, 26 (79%) were age <1 year at study entry and 6 (18%) had a family history of inhibitors. Twenty-eight patients (85%) received prophylaxis; median dosing interval was 7 days, with an average weekly dose of 58 IU/kg. Twenty-seven patients (82%) completed the study. Twenty-one (64%), 26 (79%), and 28 patients (85%) had ≥50, ≥20, and ≥10 exposure days (EDs) to rFIXFc, respectively. One patient (3.03%; 95% confidence interval, 0.08% to 15.76%) developed a low-titer inhibitor after 11 EDs; no high-titer inhibitors were detected. Twenty-three patients (70%) had 58 treatment-emergent serious adverse events; 2 were assessed as related (FIX inhibition and hypersensitivity in 1 patient, resulting in withdrawal). Median ABR was 1.24 (interquartile range, 0.00-2.49) for patients receiving prophylaxis. Most (>85%) bleeding episodes required only 1 infusion for bleed resolution. In this first study reporting results with rFIXFc in pediatric PUPs with hemophilia B, rFIXFc was well tolerated, with the adverse event profile as expected in a pediatric hemophilia population. rFIXFc was effective, both as prophylaxis and in the treatment of bleeding episodes.

Most of these studies, using AAV vectors with various gene constructs, showed sufficient factor VIII and IX expression in patients to significantly reduce the number of bleeds and the need for prophylaxis in most patients with severe hemophilia. This resulted in great clinical benefit for nearly all patients. In this review, we will summarize the most recent findings of reported and ongoing gene therapy trials. We will highlight the successful outcome of trials with focus on the results of recently reported phase 1 trials and preliminary results of phase 2b/3 trials for hemophilia A and B. These new reports also reveal the impact of side effects and drawbacks associated with gene therapy.

Clinical trials have largely focused on adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) for liver gene delivery. These vectors, however, are limited by small packaging size, capsid immune responses, and inability to redose. As an alternative, nonviral, hydrodynamic injection through vascular routes can successfully deliver plasmid DNA (pDNA) into mouse liver but has achieved limited success in large animal models. We explored hydrodynamic delivery of pDNA through the biliary system into the liver of pigs using ERCP and a power injector to supply hydrodynamic force. Human factor IX (hFIX), deficient in hemophilia B, was used as a model gene therapy. Biliary hydrodynamic injection was well tolerated without significant changes in vital signs, liver enzymes, hematology, or histology. No off-target pDNA delivery to other organs was detected by polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry revealed that 50.19% of the liver stained positive for hFIX after hydrodynamic injection at 5.5 mg pDNA, with every hepatic lobule in all liver lobes demonstrating hFIX expression. hFIX-positive hepatocytes were concentrated around the central vein, radiating outward across all 3 metabolic zones. Biliary hydrodynamic injection in pigs resulted in significantly higher transfection efficiency than mouse vascular hydrodynamic injection at matched pDNA per liver weight dose (32.7%-51.9% vs 18.9%, P < .0001). Biliary hydrodynamic injection using ERCP can achieve higher transfection efficiency into hepatocytes compared with AAVs at magnitudes of less cost in a clinically relevant human-sized large animal.

    "abstract": "For several decades, the treatment of haemophilia has relied on factor replacement therapy, which restores haemostasis by replacing the missing coagulation factor. In recent years, novel alternative therapies for the treatment of haemophilia in patients with and without inhibitors have been developed. These emergent therapies promote haemostasis by mimicking coagulation factors or inhibiting natural anticoagulants. They provide a less invasive route of administration (i.e. subcutaneous) and some offer reduced frequency of dosing (i.e. every 2 weeks, monthly) compared with the majority of factor replacement therapies, and thus have the potential to simplify treatment, increase adherence and subsequently improve outcomes for patients. Their introduction has transformed the care of haemophilia patients with inhibitors to factor VIII, with similar expectation for haemophilia B patients with inhibitors. However, these therapies also come with several new challenges including their limitation to prophylactic treatment, the observed increased incidence of thrombosis, or their impact on the natural history of the disease and potential disruption of existing treatment guidelines like the use of immune tolerance induction. Moreover, questions remain regarding the long-term impact of non-replacement therapies on joint health as well as the optimal strategy to manage breakthrough bleeds in patients with inhibitors."

In this study, the examination of five human X-chromosomally encoded proteins (FIX, GLA, HPRT1, NDP and OTC) allowed us to identify several candidate compensated variants. Strong evidence for a compensated/compensatory pair of amino acids in the coagulation FIXa protein (involving residues 270 and 271) was found in a variety of mammalian species. Both amino acid residues are located within the 60-loop, spatially close to the 39-loop that performs a key role in coagulation serine proteases. To understand the nature of the underlying interactions, molecular dynamics simulations were performed. The predicted conformational change in the 39-loop consequent to the Glu270Lys substitution (associated with hemophilia B) appears to impair the protein's interaction with its substrate but, importantly, such steric hindrance is largely mitigated in those proteins that carry the compensatory residue (Pro271) at the neighboring amino acid position."

    "title": "Recent Advances in the Treatment of Hemophilia: A Review.",
    "abstract": "Progress in hemophilia therapy has been remarkable in the first 20 years of the third millennium, but the innovation began with the description the fractionation of plasma in 1946. The first concentrates followed the discovery of FVIII in the cryoprecipitate of frozen plasma and FIX in the supernatant in the early 1960s, which led to the initial attempts at replacement therapy. Unfortunately, the lack of screening methods for viral pathogens resulted in people with hemophilia (PWH) receiving concentrates contaminated by hepatitis A virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus, as these concentrates were made from large industrial pools of plasma derived from thousands of donors. Fortunately, by 1985, viral screening methods and proper virucidal techniques were developed that made concentrates safe. Increasingly pure products followed the introduction of chromatography steps with monoclonal antibodies in the production process. The problem of immunogenicity of exogenously administered concentrates has not yet had a complete solution. The development of alloantibodies against FVIII in about 25-35% of PWH is the most serious adverse effect of replacement therapy. The next major advance followed the cloning of the <i>F8</i> gene and later the <i>F9</i> genes, which paved the way to produce concentrates of factors obtained by the recombinant DNA technology. The injected FVIII and FIX molecules had a relatively short circulating half-life in the plasma of people with hemophilia A and B, approximately 12 and 18 hours, respectively. The ability to prolong the plasma half-life and extend the interval between injections followed the application of methods to conjugate the factor molecule with the fragment crystallizable of IgG1 or albumin or by adding polyethylene glycol, which has led to an increase in the half-life of concentrates, especially for rFIX. The next frontier in hemophilia therapy is the application of durable and potentially curative therapies such as with gene addition therapy. Experiments in hemophilia B have demonstrated durable responses. Unfortunately, the results with gene therapy for hemophilia A have not been as remarkable and the durability must still be demonstrated. Nonetheless, the long-term safety, predictability, durability, and efficacy of gene therapy for hemophilia A and B remain an open question. At present, only healthy adult PWH have been enrolled in gene therapy clinical trials. The application of gene therapy to children and those with pre-existing antibodies against the delivery vector must also be studied before this therapy becomes widespread."

    "abstract": "Recombinant factors VIII and IX Fc (rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc) became available in Canada in 2016 and were the only extended half-life (EHL) factor concentrates available in Canada until 2018. We aim to describe the change in product utilization in Canadians who switched to rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc. This prospective and retrospective cohort study enrolled males aged ≥6 years with moderate or severe haemophilia who switched to rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc and those who remained on standard half-life (SHL) between 2016 and 2018. Factor utilization and annualized bleeding rates (ABR) were collected at baseline, 1-year and 2-years. Due to low prospective enrolment (n = 25 switchers), prospective and retrospective data were pooled. 125 switchers (93 rFVIIIFc, 32 rFIXFc) and 33 non-switchers were included. The median age was 17 (rFVIIIFc) and 38 years (rFIXFc). Prior to switch, over 80% were on prophylaxis. There was a statistically significant reduction in the prescribed weekly prophylactic dose after the switch to rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc for all age groups, with a corresponding reduction (15-16%) in actual annualized FIX utilization in switchers (combined adults and children) to rFIXFc, and a smaller non-significant reduction in actual annualized FVIIII utilization (7%) in children who switched to rFVIIIFc. A significant reduction in the median ABR was only observed in children who switched to rFVIIIFc, but not in adults who switched to rFVIIIFc or rFIXFc. Switching from SHL to EHL products led to a small reduction in factor utilization, while preserving a low ABR in children and adults with haemophilia. Further patient-reported outcomes data will further elucidate the role of EHL in the haemophilia landscape."

    "title": "Considerations on activity assay discrepancies in factor VIII and factor IX products.",
    "abstract": "New modified coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX) products have been designed to improve the treatment of individuals with hemophilia A and B by increasing the interval between dosing. Although these FVIII and FIX molecules have been structurally modified to improve the circulation time, the changes have also influenced their behavior in functional assays in comparison with traditional plasma-derived or recombinant coagulation factors. The assignment of potencies for these products can be problematic because discordance in factor activity values between the commonly used one-stage clotting and chromogenic substrate assays is often observed. Discrepancies in potency assay values also exist when different assay kits and reagents are used in the same assay type. Ideally, all FVIII and FIX products should be calibrated against the World Health Organization (WHO) International Standards (IS) because the assignment of potencies in international units (IU) helps maintain treatment tradition and meaningful references for manufacturers, patients, and clinicians. The discrepant measurements, attributed to the modified structural and functional properties of these products, are manifested in their lack of commutability with the WHO IS for FVIII or FIX. Herein, we discuss the considerations upon which an assay is chosen for potency assignment and postadministration monitoring of a new factor product, which include the validity of the assay calibrated with the IS, the meaning of the potency values in IU, standards of care for patients, clinical relevance between the assigned potency value and recovery value from clinical laboratories, and patient safety."

A retrospective analysis was performed between 2000 and 2018 to describe patient characteristics, surgical details, factor provision and outcomes. Univariate analysis was used to determine variables associated with guideline adherence. Covariates with p < 0.1 were included in the multivariate analysis. A total of 1065 surgeries were performed on 571 patients. Diagnoses included Haemophilia A (43.5%), Haemophilia B (9.7%), von Willebrand disease (VWD) (45.3%) and rare bleeding disorders (RBDs) (1.6%). Bleeding complications were reported in 14 surgeries and 19 patients received factor replacement beyond standard duration of prophylaxis. Approximately 50% of all surgeries were performed in a HTC. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that diagnosis, surgical specialty, sex and year (p < 0.001) were associated with non-compliance with variable pattern within each category. Factor replacement was as expected except for plasma-derived Factor VIII/VWF usage in patients with VWD undergoing major bleeding risk surgery. VWD classification (p < 0.001) was associated with this deviation. Low complication rates demonstrate that elective surgery in Australia is being safely performed in patients with inherited bleeding disorders however non-compliance with published guidelines exists highlighting areas of practice and policy discrepancies that warrant further exploration."

    "title": "Effect of CpG Depletion of Vector Genome on CD8<sup>+</sup> T Cell Responses in AAV Gene Therapy.",
    "abstract": "Adeno associated viral (AAV) vectors have emerged as a preferred platform for <i>in vivo</i> gene replacement therapy and represent one of the most promising strategies to treat monogenetic disorders such as hemophilia. However, immune responses to gene transfer have hampered human gene therapy in clinical trials. Over the past decade, it has become clear that innate immune recognition provides signals for the induction of antigen-specific responses against vector or transgene product. In particular, TLR9 recognition of the vector's DNA genome in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) has been identified as a key factor. Data from clinical trials and pre-clinical studies implement CpG motifs in the vector genome as drivers of immune responses, especially of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. Here, we demonstrate that cross-priming of AAV capsid-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells depends on XCR1<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (which are likely the main cross-presenting cell that cooperates with pDCs to activate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) and can be minimized by the elimination of CpG motifs in the vector genome. Further, a CpG-depleted vector expressing human coagulation factor IX showed markedly reduced (albeit not entirely eliminated) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration upon intramuscular gene transfer in hemophilia B mice when compared to conventional CpG<sup>+</sup> vector (comprised of native sequences), resulting in better preservation of transduced muscle fibers. Therefore, this deimmunization strategy is helpful in reducing the potential for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to capsid or transgene product. However, CpG depletion had minimal effects on antibody responses against capsid or transgene product, which appear to be largely independent of CpG motifs."

    "abstract": "Up to 35% of patients with hemophilia A and 5% with hemophilia B develop neutralizing antibodies which can inhibit the therapeutic activity of factor replacement (inhibitors). Despite the clinical relevance of antifactor VIII and IX neutralizing antibodies, there is still a major gap on the knowledge of risk factors for their development. Furthermore, most of the studies on risk factors for inhibitor development come from Caucasian and Afro-American populations. The HEMFIL is a Brazilian prospective cohort study of previously untreated children with hemophilia, which primary aim is to identify new risk factors related to inhibitor development. This manuscript aims at describing the study design and its methodology. After the diagnosis, children are followed up to 75 exposure days or to inhibitor development. Standardized forms and blood samples are collected to describe clinical characteristics and to perform the measurement of immunological and genetic biomarkers at three time points; Inclusion time (T0), at inhibitor development or at 75 exposure days without inhibitors (T1) and after immune tolerance induction for patients in whom it is indicated and performed (T2). Currently, 120 children have been included, of whom, 95 have completed the follow-up. For severe/moderately severe hemophilia A, the cumulative incidence of inhibitors at 75 exposure days was 35% (95% confidence interval, 26-46%). The inclusion of additional patients and a longer follow-up will allow the analysis of risk factors for inhibitor development."

This study was conducted at the Haematology/Pathology Department of Fauji Foundation Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from August 2014 to August 2018. Children who were diagnosed with an inherited bleeding disorder but did not respond to initial therapy were reevaluated. In total, 62 children were diagnosed with a bleeding disorder. Of these, 27 were diagnosed with an inherited bleeding disorder and 35 with an acquired bleeding disorder. Of the 27 children with inherited bleeding disorders, 18% (n = 5) were misdiagnosed and treated inappropriately. The median age of the misdiagnosed patients was 9 years (range, 5-13 years). Three patients with Bernard-Soulier syndrome had been misdiagnosed as having immune thrombocytopenic purpura, 1 patient with von Willebrand disease had been misdiagnosed as having hemophilia A, and 1 patient with haemophilia B had been misdiagnosed as having hemophilia A. There are chances of misdiagnosis and improper or invasive management if comprehensive laboratory evaluation and a thorough clinical evaluation are not performed in children with congenital bleeding disorders."

To evaluate the use and outcome of ITI in patients with HB and inhibitors. Subjects include singletons or siblings with a current/history of inhibitors enrolled in B-Natural-an observational study designed to increase understanding of clinical management of patients with HB. Patients were followed for 6 months and information on demographics, medical and social history, and treatment were recorded. Twenty-nine patients with severe HB and inhibitors were enrolled in 24 centres. Twenty-two underwent one or more courses of ITI with or without immune suppression. Eight patients (36.4%) were successfully tolerized after the first course of ITI. One of these successes (12.5%) experienced allergic manifestations, whereas the corresponding number for the 10 treatment failures was five (50%). One of seven (14.2%) patients with large deletions and three of eight (37.5%) with nonsense mutations were tolerized at the first attempt, and all patients experiencing nephrosis either failed or were on-going. At study end, 11 (50%) were considered successfully tolerized after one or more ITI courses, three were unsuccessful, and eight were still undergoing treatment. Our data underscore the possibilities and difficulties of achieving tolerization in patients with HB with inhibitors. The type of mutation and complications appear to correlate with ITI outcome, but more accurate definitions of successful ITI are warranted."

    "abstract": "Osteopenia and osteoporosis have increasingly become a recognized morbidity in those persons with hemophilia (PwH) receiving inadequate prophylactic clotting factor replacement. Animal models can control or eliminate genetic and environmental factors and allow for invasive testing not clinically permissible. Here, we describe the skeletal phenotype of juvenile and adult male mice with a genetically engineered deficiency in coagulation factor IX (FIX KO). Although the somatic growth of FIX KO mice matched that of their wild-type (WT) littermates at 10 and 20 weeks of age, the FIX KO mice displayed reduced bone mineral density (BMD), reduced cortical and cancellous bone mass, and diminished whole bone fracture resistance. These findings coupled with parallel observations in a murine model of hemophilia A (FVIII deficiency) point to an effector downstream of the coagulation cascade that is necessary for normal skeletal development. Further study of potential mechanisms underlying the bone disease observed in rare clotting factor deficiency syndromes may lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic insights for metabolic bone diseases in general."

We validated the accuracy of a case definition using a combination of International Classification of Diseases diagnostic codes and coagulation factor level for identifying hemophilia in administrative data. This is a retrospective population-based study of all residents of Alberta, Canada, who underwent testing for coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX) activity between 2009 and 2017 using linked administrative data. Our predefined algorithm was a combination of the relevant ICD codes and FVIII/FIX activity <0.4 IU/ml. Medical charts of 2114 randomly selected patients tested for FVIII and 528 patients tested for FIX were reviewed to identify physician diagnoses of hemophilia. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. With our algorithm, 72 (3.4%) patients tested for FVIII and 21 (4.0%) tested for FIX met the combined ICD code and laboratory criteria for hemophilia A and hemophilia B, respectively, whereas 63 (3.0%) and 22 (4.2%) had confirmed hemophilia A and hemophilia B upon chart review. Our algorithm had a sensitivity of 93.7% and specificity of 99.4% for identifying hemophilia A, and a sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 99.8% for identifying hemophilia B. This study showed that using a case definition of ICD codes and coagulation factor activities can identify hemophilia in administrative data with very high accuracy and can be used for future research."

    "abstract": "The short half-life of coagulation factor IX (FIX) for haemophilia B (HB) therapy has been prolonged through fusion with human serum albumin (HSA), which drives the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated recycling of the chimera. However, patients would greatly benefit from further FIX-HSA half-life extension. In the present study, we designed a FIX-HSA variant through the engineering of both fusion partners. First, we developed a novel cleavable linker combining the two FIX activation sites, which resulted in improved HSA release. Second, insertion of the FIX R338L (Padua) substitution conferred hyperactive features (sevenfold higher specific activity) as for FIX Padua alone. Furthermore, we exploited an engineered HSA (QMP), which conferred enhanced human (h)FcRn binding [dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub> ) 0·5 nM] over wild-type FIX-HSA (K<sub>D</sub> 164·4 nM). In hFcRn transgenic mice, Padua-QMP displayed a significantly prolonged half-life (2·7 days, P < 0·0001) versus FIX-HSA (1 day). Overall, we developed a novel FIX-HSA protein with improved activity and extended half-life. These combined properties may result in a prolonged functional profile above the therapeutic threshold, and thus in a potentially widened therapeutic window able to improve HB therapy. This rational engineering of both partners may pave the way for new fusion strategies for the design of engineered biotherapeutics."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy by integrating vectors is promising for monogenic liver diseases, especially in children where episomal vectors remain transient. However, reaching the therapeutic threshold with genome-integrating vectors is challenging. Therefore, we developed a method to expand hepatocytes bearing therapeutic transgenes. The common fever medicine acetaminophen becomes hepatotoxic via cytochrome p450 metabolism. Lentiviral vectors with transgenes linked in cis to a <i>Cypor</i> shRNA were administered to neonatal mice. Hepatocytes lacking the essential cofactor of Cyp enzymes, NADPH-cytochrome p450 reductase (Cypor), were selected in vivo by acetaminophen administration, replacing up to 50% of the hepatic mass. Acetaminophen treatment of the mice resulted in over 30-fold expansion of transgene-bearing hepatocytes and achieved therapeutic thresholds in hemophilia B and phenylketonuria. We conclude that therapeutically modified hepatocytes can be selected safely and efficiently in preclinical models with a transient regimen of moderately hepatotoxic acetaminophen."

We report on 61 patients from Oslo and Helsinki: 24 MHA and 37 MHB. By TG (2.5 pM TF), patients who had been without replacement therapy during the previous 12 months depicted higher endogenous thrombin potential (P = .03). In contrast, those who had low ETP (< median) captured higher HJHS (P = .02). Patients who had undergone orthopaedic surgery generated least thrombin (P = .02). By thromboelastometry, those without the need of factor consumption had short clotting times, and quick times to maximum velocity (< median values) (P = .03). Factor VIII/factor IX activity (FVIII/FIX:C) did not align with the bleeding phenotype, but FIX:C ≤ 3 IU/dL was associated with lower peak thrombin (P = .03). TG differentiated patients with moderate haemophilia according to HJHS, annual factor consumption, and whether orthopaedic surgery had been performed. Thromboelastometry differentiated according to factor consumption only. Global coagulation assays may assist predicting the bleeding phenotype in moderate haemophilia."

This is a crosssectional study by compiling the data of PWH visiting the tertiary care centre for Haemophilia in Uttarakhand. We collected data from the patients with bleeding disorder reporting to the Haemophilia centre from July 2017 to December 2018. In this manuscript, we try to describe the pattern of Haemophilia and the degree of severity and incidence of inhibitors among the sample population of PWH who represent the population of Uttarakhand. The magnitude of problems faced by PWH from this hilly terrain to assess basic treatment in case of emergency is also being depicted. We reported Haemophilia A contributing about 80% of the PWH in our centre. Average distance a PWH has to travel to obtain treatment was about 131.5 km (SD ± 83.7 km). Incidence of inhibitors was about 5%. We infer from our study that Hemophilia A is more common than Hemophilia B.

In this open-label, multicenter study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02336178), patients received on-demand or prophylactic treatment with intravenous nonacog alfa for approximately 6 months or 50 exposure days, whichever occurred first. The primary safety outcome was medically important events (i.e., development of FIX inhibitors, allergic reactions, and thrombotic events). Key secondary efficacy outcomes included the annualized bleeding rate for on-demand treatment and prophylaxis, response to on-demand treatment, the number of infusions per bleeding event, and the number of breakthrough bleeding events within 48 hours of prophylaxis. Seventy male patients (mean [standard deviation] age 7.8 [7.2] years) were enrolled (on-demand, n = 37; prophylaxis, n = 57 [24 patients were included in both groups]). Thirty-eight (54%) patients had up to 50 FIX exposure days before the study. The only medically important event was a transient low-titer FIX inhibitor (incidence 1.4%, 95% confidence interval, 0-7.7). The mean annualized bleeding rate was 26.3 for on-demand treatment and 6.5 for prophylaxis. A mean (standard deviation) of 1.5 (1.7) nonacog alfa infusions were given per bleeding episode; 78.8% of episodes resolved with 1 infusion. Response was \"excellent\" or \"good\" for 88% of the on-demand infusions. Twenty-three bleeding events (n = 11 patients) occurred within 48 hours of 2032 prophylaxis doses (1.13%).

Hemophilia A (HA) was diagnosed in 151 patients (63.7%), Hemophilia B (HB) in 31 (13%). Mean age was 10 years in HA and 11 years in HB patients. Clinical features of hemophilia varied according to Factor VIII levels. Coagulation type of bleeding such as hemarthrosis and hematoma were much more frequent than mucosal type bleeding. The present study is one of the very few studies from the north-eastern part of India estimating the prevalence and clinicopathological features of hemophilia, highlighting the need of specialized diagnostic facilities in this part of India."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B (HB) (also known as Christmas disease) is a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterized by spontaneous or prolonged hemorrhages caused by mutations in Factor 9 (F9) gene leading to deficient or defective coagulation F9. Our study aimed at identifying the causative mutations within a sample of HB Egyptian patients. The present study comprised clinical data of eleven HB patients descending from six unrelated families and a seventh family including a carrier mother with a history of deceased HB sibling. Sequencing of F9 gene was performed. The study revealed four mutations; two missense NM_000133.3:c.676C>G, (P.Arg226Gly) and NM_000133.3:c.1305T>G, (p.Cys435Trp), and two nonsense mutations NM_000133.3:c.880C>T, (p.Arg294*) and NM_000133.3:c.1150C>T, (p.Arg384*), identified mutations spanned exons 6 and 8 of which a total of three mutations are located in hotspot exon 8 of F9 gene. Reviewing the literature, this is the first molecular analysis of F9 gene in HB Egyptian patients. Consistent genotype/phenotypic severity correlation could be concluded, helping proper genetic counseling and prenatal decision taking."

The success, along with the feasibility of gene therapy, is undeniable when considering the benefits recorded for patients with different classes of diseases or disorders needing treatment, including SCID-X1 and ADA-SCID, within the last two decades. β-Thalassemia and sickle cell anemia are two prominent monogenic blood hemoglobin disorders for which a solution has been sought using gene therapy. For instance, transduced autologous CD34+ HSCs via a self-inactivating (SIN)-Lentivirus (LV) coding for a functional copy of the β-globin gene has become a feasible procedure. adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have found application in ocular gene transfer in retinal disease gene therapy (e.g., Leber's congenital amaurosis type 2), where no prior treatment existed. In neurodegenerative disorders, successes are now reported for cases involving metachromatic leukodystrophy causing severe cognitive and motor damage. Gene therapy for hemophilia also remains a viable option because of the amount of cell types that are capable of synthesizing biologically active FVIII and FIX following gene transfer using AAV vectors <i>in vivo</i> to correct hemophilia B (FIX deficiency), and it is considered an ideal target, as proven in preclinical studies. Recently, the clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 gene-editing tool has taken a center stage in gene therapy research and is reported to be efficient and highly precise. The application of gene therapy to these areas has pushed forward the therapeutic clinical application."

    "abstract": "Coagulation factor IX (FIX) is a serine protease zymogen involved in the intrinsic blood coagulation pathway, and its deficiency causes hemophilia B. Zebrafish has three f9 genes, and the ortholog to human F9 is unknown. To identify the zebrafish ortholog to F9 using sequence analysis and piggyback knockdown technology. Gene and protein sequence analysis for three f9 genes, f9a, f9b, and f9l, present in the zebrafish genome was performed. In vivo and in vitro assays after knockdown of each gene and immunodepletion using specific antibodies were carried out. Sequence analysis revealed that f9a and f9b are similar to human F9, whereas f9l is similar to human F10. RNA analysis showed an age-dependent increase in expression of all three genes. Zebrafish f9a gene knockdown and Fixa immunodepletion prolonged kinetic partial thromboplastin time (kPTT), whereas f9l knockdown and Fixl immunodepletion prolonged kPTT, kinetic prothrombin time, and kinetic Russell viper venom activation time. Laser-assisted venous thrombosis increased time to occlusion after f9a and f9l knockdown and antibody inhibition of Fixa and Fixl. Further, analysis of plasma proteins by mass spectrometry and immunohistochemistry detected all three proteins. Our findings suggest that zebrafish f9a has functional activity similar to human F9. Fixl is functionally similar to Fx. The age-dependent increases of these factors are comparable to those observed in mice and humans. Thus, the zebrafish model could be used to study factors involved in increasing f9a expression during aging. It could also be used to test whether normal human Factor IX and Factor IX Leyden promoter work in zebrafish background."

    "title": "Identification of a modified coagulation factor X with enhanced activation properties as potential hemostatic agent.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are X-linked inherited bleeding disorders caused by a deficiency of coagulation factor VIII and IX, respectively. Standard of care is prophylactic factor replacement therapy; however, the development of neutralizing antibodies against these factors represents serious complications underlining the need for alternative treatment approaches. Human coagulation factor X has a central role within the blood coagulation system making it an attractive target for the development of alternative treatment strategies for patients with hemophilia. This study focuses on a modified variant of the human coagulation factor X with enhanced hemostatic bypass activity due to insertion of a factor IX derived activation sequence. This molecule design leads to the direct activation of the modified factor X protein by factor XIa allowing it to bypass the need for coagulation factor VIIIa/factor IXa. The modified variant was able to correct in-vitro activated partial prothrombin time of human and murine factor VIII/factor IX deficient plasma. Furthermore, reduced blood loss in factor VIII knock-out mice was observed after intravenous application of the modified factor X variant. In conclusion, these data suggest that the factor X variant described here could potentially serve as a bypassing agent independent of the inhibitor status of hemophilia patients. However, more research is needed to further investigate the potential of this molecule."

    "abstract": "Phase 2b study to assess efficacy, safety, thrombogenicity, immunogenicity and tolerability with 28 days of daily dosing of subcutaneous (SQ) dalcinonacog alfa as prophylaxis for haemophilia B (HB). Adult males with a confirmed diagnosis of congenital HB (factor IX [FIX] activity <2%) received daily dalcinonacog alfa 100 IU/kg SQ until day 28. The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of participants who achieved a steady-state FIX activity level ≥12%. Tolerability, thrombogenicity and immunogenicity were study safety endpoints. Of 6 participants who received study drug, one discontinued the study on day 7 due to injection-site reactions (ISR). Of the 5 participants completing the study, FIX activity level exceeded 12% in 3 participants at day 7, increasing to 4 participants on days 14, 21 and 28 and all 5 at day 29. Pharmacokinetic findings (including mean alpha and beta half-life of 5.3 days and 3.9 days, respectively, and mean residence time of 6.2 days) supported prolonged effects. Thrombogenicity markers remained normal throughout prophylactic injections or showed some initial increases followed by decreases with continued dosing. Two participants had anti-drug antibodies to dalcinonacog alfa at study end, none had neutralizing antibody. Two participants had ISR, both resolved. Reports of redness, swelling, tenderness or pain among the first 3 participants prompted dose-splitting for the last 3 participants, leading to fewer ISR. Subcutaneous dalcinonacog alfa is effective in raising FIX levels into the mild haemophilia range, comparable to intravenous extended half-life FIX clotting factors."

    "abstract": "Anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation is a major complication in treatment of the X-linked bleeding disorder haemophilia B (deficiency in coagulation factor IX, FIX). Current clinical immune tolerance protocols are often not effective due to complications such as anaphylactic reactions against FIX. Plant-based oral tolerance induction may address this problem, as illustrated by the recent first regulatory approval of orally delivered plant cells to treat peanut allergy. Our previous studies showed that oral delivery of plant cells expressing FIX fused to the transmucosal carrier CTB (cholera toxin subunit B) in chloroplasts suppressed ADA in animals with haemophilia B. We report here creation of the first lettuce transplastomic lines expressing a coagulation factor, in the absence of antibiotic resistance gene. Stable integration of the CTB-FIX gene and homoplasmy (transformation of ˜10 000 copies in each cell) were maintained in both T1 and T2 generation marker-free plants. CTB-FIX expression in lyophilized leaves of T1 and T2 marker-free plants was 1.0-1.5 mg/g dry weight, confirming that the marker excision did not affect antigen levels. Oral administration of CTB-FIX to Sprague Dawley rats at 0.25, 1 or 2.5 mg/kg did not produce overt adverse effects or toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) is at least 2.5 mg/kg for a single oral administration in rats. Oral administration of CTB-FIX at 0.3 or 1.47 mg/kg either mixed in food or as an oral suspension to Beagle dogs did not produce any observable toxicity. These toxicology studies should facilitate filing of regulatory approval documents and evaluation in haemophilia B patients."

    "abstract": "In 2017, all people with severe haemophilia B (PWSHB) in Ireland switched from standard half-life (SHL) recombinant FIX (rFIX) to rFIX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) prophylaxis. To evaluate prophylaxis regimens, bleeding rates and factor usage for two years of rFIXFc prophylaxis in a real-world setting. Data collected retrospectively from electronic diaries and medical records of PWSHB for a two-year period on rFIXFc prophylaxis were compared with paired baseline data on SHL rFIX treatment. 28 PWSHB (≥18 years) were enrolled, and at switchover 79% were receiving prophylaxis and 21% episodic treatment with SHL rFIX. At 24 months following switchover, all remained on rFIXFc prophylaxis with reduced infusion frequency; median dose per infusion once weekly (55 IU/kg, 20/28), every 10 days (63 IU/kg, 2/28) or every 14 days (98 IU/kg, 6/28). Median annualised bleed rate improved significantly on rFIXFc prophylaxis (2.0 versus 3.3 on SHL FIX) (p = 0.01). Median FIX trough level with once-weekly infusions was 0.09 IU/ml (0.06-0.14 IU/ml). Management of bleeding episodes was similar with rFIXFc and SHL rFIX; one infusion was sufficient to treat 74% and 77% of bleeds, respectively, with similar total median treatment per bleeding episode. Factor consumption reduced by 28% with rFIXFc prophylaxis (57 IU/kg/week, range 40-86 IU/kg/week) compared with SHL rFIX (79 IU/kg/week, range 44-210 IU/kg/week) (p = 0.002). This study provides important insights into real-world experience of switching to rFIXFc prophylaxis in an adult population, demonstrating high rates of prophylaxis, with reduced infusion frequency, bleeding and FIX consumption."

Identified IIC were grouped according to disease characteristics into nonprogressive, progressive, irregular, or symmetrical conditions. Evaluation of IIC by Institut für Qualität und Wirschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen (IQWIG) and acceptance of IIC by G-BA were determined, and criteria for the usage and quality of IIC were developed. A total of 483 appraisals finalized between January 2011 and April 2020 were reviewed. Eleven appraisals included IIC: nonacog beta (hemophilia B), turoctocog alpha (hemophilia A), emicizumab (2 appraisals: hemophilia A), pasireotide (unresectable pituitary tumor), lomitapid (homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia), glycerol phenylbutyrate (2 appraisals: urea cycle disorders), asfotase alfa (hypophosphatasia), lumacaftor (cystic fibrosis), and larotrectinib (NTRK<sup>+</sup> solid tumors). All those appraisals related to rare genetic conditions with hemophilia and its bleeding rate are considered mainly a nonprogressive condition. All the other diseases show progressive disease characteristics. None of the identified IIC has been accepted by G-BA. Inconsistencies of before/after study design, lack of clarity on treatments prior to the switch, and different time intervals were among the most commonly cited methodological concerns. IICs provide a rare opportunity to determine comparative effectiveness in distinct clinical settings that are not suitable or difficult to randomize into parallel groups. While manufacturers and researchers should aim for highest methodological standards when running an IIC, HTA bodies should accept IIC in distinct settings when determining relative effectiveness."

Poor medication adherence to long-term therapies limits the potential of effective treatments to improve patients' health-related quality of life. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the association of reported medication adherence and health-related quality of life in patients with haemophilia. Setting Data were collected from patients at University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Croatia and at University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Slovenia. Method Adult male patients with severe or moderate haemophilia receiving prophylactic treatment were eligible for the study. Main outcome measure Implementation phase of medication adherence was assessed with the self-reported VERITAS-Pro instrument and health-related quality of life with SF-36v2. Results A total of 82 participants were included in the study (median age was 44.50, range 18-73 years). The majority of our participants reported being adherent to medication (83%). Participants showed better health in the mental health domains and Mental Component Summary than in the physical health domains and Physical Component Summary. After controlling for demographic, socioeconomic and clinical predictors, better reported medication adherence explained an additional 4-6% of better health variance in Bodily Pain and Social Functioning domains and Mental Component Summary. Conclusion We found that reported medication adherence can contribute to better health-related quality of life in patients with haemophilia. Since life with a chronic condition is demanding, it is an important finding that medication adherence to replacement therapy can improve life conditions for patients with haemophilia."

Nevertheless, challenges remain due to rejection of AAV-transduced cells, which in some, but not all, patients can be prevented by immunosuppression. It is assumed that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells induced by natural infections with AAVs are recalled by the AAV vector's capsid and upon activation eliminate cells expressing the degraded capsid antigens. Alternatively, it is feasible that AAV vectors, especially if given at high doses, induce <i>de novo</i> capsid- or transgene product-specific T cell responses. This chapter discusses CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to AAV infections and AAV gene transfer and avenues to prevent their activation or block their effector functions."

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy is a novel treatment promising to reduce morbidity associated with hemophilia. Although multiple clinical trials continue to evaluate efficacy and safety, limited cost-effectiveness data have been published. This study compared the potential cost-effectiveness of AAV-mediated factor IX (FIX)-Padua gene therapy for patients with severe hemophilia B in the United States vs on-demand FIX replacement and primary FIX prophylaxis, using either standard or extended half-life FIX products. A microsimulation Markov model was constructed, and transition probabilities between health states and utilities were informed by using published data. Costs were aggregated by using a microcosting approach. A time horizon from 18 years old until death, from the perspective of a third-party payer in the United States, was conducted. Gene therapy was more cost-effective than both alternatives considering a $150 000/quality-adjusted life-year threshold. The price for gene therapy was assumed to be $2 000 000 in the base case scenario; however, one of the 1-way sensitivity analyses was conducted by using observed manufacturing, administration, and 5-year follow-up costs of $87 198 for AAV-mediated gene therapy vector as derived from the manufacturing facility and clinical practice at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. One-way sensitivity analyses revealed 10 of 102 scenarios in which gene therapy was not cost-effective compared with alternative treatments. Notably, gene therapy remained cost-effective in a hypothetical scenario in which we estimated that the discounted factor concentrate price was 20% of the wholesale acquisition cost in the United States. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis estimated gene therapy to be cost-effective at 92% of simulations considering a $150 000/quality-adjusted life-year threshold. In conclusion, based on detailed simulation inputs and assumptions, gene therapy was more cost-effective than on-demand treatment and prophylaxis for patients with severe hemophilia B."

    "abstract": "One of the challenges in translational medicine is to select first-in-human doses of investigational drugs based on findings in preclinical studies. Despite substantial progress in the optimization of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors of in vivo gene therapy for treating various diseases, there remain significant limitations to the use of preclinical data to guide dose selection in clinical trials. Here we introduce a novel concept of gene efficiency factor (GEF) to describe the efficiency of the gene transfer system and describe and apply the concept of GEF in AAV-mediated in vivo gene transfer systems. We explore the utility of allometric scaling to translate GEF across species using AAV-mediated in vivo factor IX (FIX) gene therapy for hemophilia B and to demonstrate the use of GEF in predicting efficacious AAV vector doses in humans. We show for the first time that an allometric relationship exists for GEF of AAV-mediated in vivo gene therapy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of using the allometric relationship of GEF to select efficacious first-in-human doses of virus-mediated invivo gene therapy. Based on our findings, allometry of GEF can be used to translate biological efficiency from animal studies to clinical studies and provide a rational basis of setting first-in-human doses for new virus-mediated invivo gene therapy products."

We conducted an eligibility assessment of all people with severe hemophilia for gene therapy trials in one large Belgian hemophilia treatment center based on patient selection criteria of gene therapy trials and patients' profiling. Among 87 adult patients with severe hemophilia A and B, 11 aged ≥65 years and two women were excluded from analysis. Six patients were excluded because of inhibitor development. One patient exhibited active hepatitis C infection, one had insufficient exposure to factor VIII, and five had uncontrolled comorbidities, while two were enrolled in other trials and two abused alcohol. Overall, 43 patients were not screened owing to psychosocial factors. Among 14 patients accepting gene therapy, six had adeno-associated virus type 5 neutralizing antibodies and one had liver fibrosis. The number of patients who would accept gene therapy in the absence of strict clinical trial requirements was estimated at 36 (41.4%), irrespective of any exclusion criteria. The majority of individuals with severe hemophilia could not be enrolled in gene therapy trials, almost half of them because of partly modifiable psychosocial reasons (49.4%). The proportion of candidates should substantially increase in the future, as eligibility criteria are likely to change and as more data on long-term efficacy and safety of gene therapy will become available."

For years, subcutaneous vaccination was recommended in patients with hemophilia to avoid intramuscular bleeds. Therefore, recommendations for the application of COVID-19 vaccines are needed. The Delphi methodology was used to develop consensus recommendations. An initial list of recommendations was prepared by a steering committee and evaluated by 39 hemophilia experts. Consensus was defined as ≥75% agreement and strong consensus as ≥95% agreement, and agreement as a score ≥7 on a scale of 1 to 9. After four rounds, a final list of statements was compiled. Consensus was achieved that COVID-19 vaccines licensed only for intramuscular injection should be administered intramuscularly in hemophilia patients. Prophylactic factor replacement, given on the day of vaccination with a maximum interval between prophylaxis and vaccination of 24 hours (factor VIII and conventional factor IX concentrates) or 48 hours (half-life extended factor IX), should be provided in patients with moderate or severe hemophilia. Strong consensus was achieved that patients with mild hemophilia and residual factor activity greater than 10% with mild bleeding phenotype or patients on emicizumab usually do not need factor replacement before vaccination. Swelling, erythema, and hyperthermia after vaccination are not always signs of bleeding but should prompt consultation of a hemophilia care center. In case of injection-site hematoma, patients should receive replacement therapy until symptoms disappear. Consensus was achieved on recommendations for intramuscular COVID-19 vaccination after replacement therapy for hemophilia patients depending on disease severity."

The objective of this study was to characterize the economic burden associated with differing clinical profiles of hemophilia B from a US health system perspective. Using the IBM MarketScan database (June 2011-February 2019), a claims-based algorithm was developed to identify 4 distinct profiles (mild, moderate, moderate-severe, and severe) in adult males with hemophilia B based on the frequency of hemorrhage events and factor IX replacement claims. Mean annual health care resource use (HRU) and costs were statistically compared between patients with hemophilia B (N = 454) and 1:1 demographic-matched controls (N = 454), both overall and with stratification by clinical profile. Compared with matched controls, patients with hemophilia B had a significantly higher comorbidity burden (Charlson Comorbidity Index, mean ± standard deviation [SD]: 0.9 ± 1.7 vs 0.3 ± 0.9, P < .001).

Breakthrough bleeds while on concizumab prophylaxis may be treated with bypassing agents (recombinant activated factor VIIa [rFVIIa] and activated prothrombin complex concentrate [APCC]), or with factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX). To evaluate the effect of combining concizumab with rFVIIa, APCC, rFVIII, and rFIX on thrombin generation (TG) potential. Pooled HA plasma was spiked in vitro with concizumab alone or together with rFVIIa, APCC, or rFVIII. rFVIIa, APCC, and rFVIII were added ex vivo to plasma from HA patients receiving concizumab prophylaxis. Pooled HB plasma was spiked with concizumab alone or together with rFIX. TG potential was measured after initiation with tissue factor. Concizumab increased thrombin peak in a concentration-dependent manner. Adding rFVIIa, APCC, rFVIII, or rFIX caused a further increase in thrombin peak. The effects of concizumab and rFVIIa, APCC, rFVIII, or rFIX were mainly additive, with no or up to maximally ~25% extra effect caused by drug--drug interaction. No strong synergistic effects were observed upon combining concizumab with rFVIIa, APCC, rFVIII, or rFIX. The thrombin peak obtained with 0.5 IU/ml rFVIII or rFIX in the presence of concizumab was on occasion slightly higher, but mostly comparable to the thrombin peak with 1 IU/ml rFVIII or rFIX in the absence of concizumab. rFVIIa, APCC, rFVIII, and rFIX enhanced plasma TG potential in the presence of concizumab. Dose levels of concomitant use should be adjusted accordingly to balance potential safety concerns while maintaining the necessary hemostatic effect.

Coagulation factor X plays a critical role in the downstream of blood coagulation cascade, which could serve as a bypassing agent for hemophilia therapy. Base on platelet-targeted gene therapy for hemophilia by our and other groups, we hypothesized that activated factor X (FXa) targeted stored in platelets might be effective in treating hemophilia A (HA) and B (HB) with or without inhibitors. To achieve the storage of FXa in platelets, we constructed a FXa precursor and used the integrin αIIb promoter to control the targeted expression of FXa precursor in platelets. The expression cassette (2bFXa) was carried by lentivirus and introduced into mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), which were then transplanted into HA and HB mice. FXa expression and storage in platelets was examined in vitro and in vivo. We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of platelet-stored FXa by tail bleeding assays and the thrombelastography. In addition, thrombotic risk was assessed in the recipient mice and the lipopolysaccharide induced inflammation mice. By transplanting 2bFXa lentivirus-transduced HSPCs into HA and HB mice, FXa was observed stably stored in platelet α-granules, the stored FXa is releasable and functional upon platelet activation. The platelet-stored FXa can significantly ameliorate bleeding phenotype in HA and HB mice as well as the mice with inhibitors. Meanwhile, no FXa leakage in plasma and no signs of increased risk of hypercoagulability were found in transplantation recipients and lipopolysaccharide induced septicemia recipients. Our proof-of-principle data indicated that target expression of the FXa precursor to platelets can generate a storage pool of FXa in platelet α-granules, the platelet-stored FXa is effective in treating HA and HB with inhibitors, suggesting that this could be a novel choice for hemophilia patients with inhibitors."

    "abstract": "Data on outcome in persons with haemophilia B (PwHB) are limited and mainly extrapolated from studies of haemophilia A (HA). To characterize treatment outcomes in persons with severe HB in the Nordic region, with a focus on joint health, compared with matched controls with HA. PwHB attending haemophilia centres in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden were enrolled and matched with controls with HA. Joint assessment using Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) and ultrasound according to Haemophilia Early Arthropathy Detection protocol (HEAD-US) was conducted. Adherence was evaluated using the Validated Haemophilia Regimen Treatment Adherence Scale (VERITAS). Seventy-nine males with HB, with median age of 30 years (range 1-75), were enrolled. Eleven patients (14%) had a history of or current inhibitor. Twenty-nine PwHB (37%) reported joint bleeds during the prior year, and 35% had previously undergone joint surgery. Ninety-five per cent were on prophylaxis, and 70% used recombinant concentrates, with a median factor consumption of 3,900 IU/kg/year for standard half-life products. Only two patients had a VERITAS score corresponding to 'non-adherence'. Joint health, assessed with HJHS, showed a significant lower score among PwHB compared with HA controls, explained by a difference in the 18-49 age group, without observed differences in older or younger subgroups. The HEAD-US scores were overall low. The Nordic cohort of PwHB is well treated by prophylaxis, but the goal of zero bleeds for all is not reached. Our findings suggest that patients with severe HB suffer from a milder arthropathy than patients with severe HA."

    "title": "The Function of extravascular coagulation factor IX in haemostasis.",
    "abstract": "The majority of clotting factor IX (FIX) resides extravascularly, in the subendothelial basement membrane, where it is important for haemostasis. We summarize preclinical studies demonstrating extravascular FIX and its role in haemostasis and discuss clinical observations supporting this. We compare the in vivo binding of BeneFIX<sup>®</sup> and the extended half-life FIX, Alprolix<sup>®</sup> , to extravascular type IV collagen (Col4). Three mouse models of haemophilia were used: the FIX knockout as the CRM<sup>-</sup> model and two knock-in mice, representing a CRM<sup>+</sup> model of a commonly occurring patient mutation (FIX<sub>R333Q</sub> ) or a mutation that binds poorly to Col4 (FIX<sub>K5A</sub> ). The murine saphenous vein bleeding model was used to assess haemostatic competency. Clinical publications were reviewed for relevance to extravascular FIX. CRM status affects recovery and prophylactic efficacy. Prophylactic protection decreases ~5X faster in CRM<sup>+</sup> animals. Extravascular haemostasis can explain unexpected breakthrough bleeding in patients treated with some EHL-FIX therapeutics. In mice, both Alprolix<sup>®</sup> and BeneFIX<sup>®</sup> bind Col4 with similar affinities (Kd~20-40 nM) and show dose-dependent recoveries. As expected, the concentration of binding sites in the mouse calculated for Alprolix<sup>®</sup> (574 nM) was greater than for BeneFIX<sup>®</sup> (405 nM), due to Alprolix<sup>®</sup> binding to both Col4 and the endothelial cell neonatal Fc receptor. Preclinical and clinical results support the interpretation that FIX plays a role in haemostasis from its extravascular location. We believe that knowing the CRM status of haemophilia B patients is important for optimizing prophylactic dosing with less trial and error, thereby decreasing clinical morbidity."

    "abstract": "Targeting the coagulation factor IX (FIX) expression in platelets has been shown to be effective in ameliorating bleeding in hemophilia B (HB) mice. To improve the therapeutic effects and evaluate the safety of this gene therapy strategy, we generated a transgenic mouse model on an HB background with FIX Padua target expressed in platelets. The transgenic mice exhibited stable expression and storage of FIX Padua in platelets. The platelet-stored FIX Padua could be released with the activation of platelets, and the proportion of platelet-stored FIX Padua in whole blood was the same as that of platelet-stored wild-type human FIX. The platelet-derived FIX Padua showed substantially increased specific activity compared with wild-type FIX. Reduced bleeding volume in the FIX Padua transgenic mice demonstrated that bleeding in the mice was improved. Levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex, fibrinogen, D-Dimer, and blood cell counts were normal in the transgenic mice, suggesting that thrombotic risk was not increased in this mouse model. However, the leakage and failure to overcome the presence of inhibitor to wild-type FIX is also observed with FIX Padua, as expected. Taken together, our results support the conclusion that targeting FIX Padua expression in platelets may be an effective and safe gene therapy strategy for HB, and could provide an ideal model to evaluate the safety of platelet-targeted gene therapy for treating hemophilia."

    "abstract": "Genetic characteristics and genetic carrier diagnosis in Japanese hemophilia female carriers have not been evaluated. To provide genetic information on Japanese hemophilia female carriers and demonstrate the advantages of genetic testing in carrier diagnosis. DNA sequencing combined with long polymerase chain reaction for inversion and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for large mutations. Genetic analysis was performed in 69 male hemophiliac patients (48 hemophilia A [HA] and 21 hemophilia B [HB]) and 112 female family members (FFM) (80 from 50 families with HA and 32 from 22 families with HB). In 72 hemophiliac families, the identified F8 mutations were inversion (42%), missense (26%), and other variations (32%), while 74% of F9 mutations were point mutations. Among the 112 FFM, 53/80 (66%) with HA and 21/32 (66%) with HB were diagnosed genetically as carriers based on detection of heterozygous mutations. Low factor VIII activity (FVIII:C) levels (<50 IU/dL) were detected in only 10% of gene-confirmed carriers, suggesting that FVIII:C is not suitable for HA carrier prediction. Low FVIII/von Willebrand factor ratio (<0.9) was observed in 67% of gene-confirmed carriers. Half of the gene-confirmed HB carriers had low FIX:C (<60 IU/dL). Importantly, 32 mothers of 37 sporadic cases (86%) (24/27 [89%] HA and 8/10 [80%] HB) showed the relevant mutations, suggesting low incidence of de novo mutations in males. This study is the first to provide genetic information on Japanese hemophilia female carriers. Gene analysis is the gold standard for carrier diagnosis as it well identifies undetected female carriers based on pedigree information and hemostatic measurements."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular events in patients with inherited bleeding disorders are challenging to manage. The risk of bleeding secondary to antithrombotic treatment must be balanced against the risk of thrombosis secondary to haemostatic therapy. Patients with inherited bleeding disorders with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or atrial fibrillation (AF) from a single centre (2010-2018) are included. A total of 11 patients undergoing CABG (n = 3), PCI (n = 5) or with AF (n = 3) and a diagnosis of haemophilia A (n = 8), haemophilia B (n = 1), factor XI deficiency (n = 1) and von Willebrand disease (n = 1) managed by a multidisciplinary team are reported. In patients undergoing CABG, factor levels were normalized for 7-10 days with trough levels of 70-80% with severe patients continuing high-dose factor prophylaxis (trough 20-30%) three weeks post-operatively with daily aspirin. In a patient with mild haemophilia A and an inhibitor, recombinant factor VIIa dosing was monitored with thromboelastometry. For PCI, a 3rd-generation drug-eluting stent with one month of dual antiplatelet therapy in addition to high-dose prophylaxis as needed was preferred. Patients with AF and severe haemophilia did not receive antithrombotic treatment, and a thrombin generation assay was used to guide heparin dosing in mild haemophilia. Our experience demonstrates the importance of interdisciplinary communication to identify strategies that decrease the risk of bleeding and thrombosis. The use of extended, increased intensity prophylaxis facilitated antiplatelet therapy. Global assays may help balance the intensity of haemostatic and antithrombotic treatment."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B is a rare congenital bleeding disorder that has a significant negative impact on patients' functionality and health-related quality of life. The standard of care for severe hemophilia B in the United States is prophylactic factor IX replacement therapy, which incurs substantial costs for this lifelong condition. Accurate estimates of the burden of hemophilia B are important for population health management and policy decisions, but have only recently accounted for current management strategies. The 'Cost of Severe Hemophilia across the US: a Socioeconomic Survey' (CHESS US) is a cross-sectional database of medical record abstractions and physician-reported information, completed by hematologists and care providers. CHESS US+ is a complementary database of completed questionnaires from patients with hemophilia. Together, CHESS US and CHESS US+ provide contemporary, comprehensive information on the burden of severe hemophilia from the provider and patient perspectives. We used the CHESS US and CHESS US+ data to analyze the clinical, humanistic, and economic burden of hemophilia B for patients treated with factor IX prophylaxis between 2017 and 2019 in the US. We conducted analysis to assess clinical burden and direct medical costs from 44 patient records in CHESS US, and of direct non-medical costs, indirect costs, and humanistic burden (using the EQ-5D-5L) from 57 patients in CHESS US+. The mean annual bleed rate was 1.73 (standard deviation, 1.39); approximately 9% of patients experienced a bleed-related hospitalization during the 12-month study period. Nearly all patients (85%) reported chronic pain, and the mean EQ-5D-5L utility value was 0.76 (0.24). The mean annual direct medical cost was $614,886, driven by factor IX treatment (mean annual cost, $611,971). Subgroup analyses showed mean annual costs of $397,491 and $788,491 for standard and extended half-life factor IX treatment, respectively. The mean annual non-medical direct costs and indirect costs of hemophilia B were $2,371 and $6,931. This analysis of patient records and patient-reported outcomes from CHESS US and CHESS US+ provides updated information on the considerable clinical, humanistic, and economic burden of hemophilia B in the US. Substantial unmet needs remain to improve patient care with sustainable population health strategies."

    "title": "Practical considerations for nonfactor-replacement therapies in the treatment of haemophilia with inhibitors.",
    "abstract": "New therapeutic agents for haemophilia with inhibitors that are in development or already licensed are expected to provide transformative treatment options. Many of these new therapies are not based on simply replacing the missing factor; new strategies include bispecific antibody technology that mimics factor VIII coagulation function (emicizumab), and inhibition of anticoagulant proteins such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor (eg PF-06741086) and antithrombin (eg fitusiran). These agents are administered subcutaneously and should significantly reduce treatment burden and increase the ability to deliver prophylaxis for patients. Limited real-world data and validated practical guidance on these recently licensed/upcoming treatments resulted in the authors convening to discuss recommendations on their use. Emicizumab is currently the only licenced nonfactor therapy; thus, our recommendations focus on this product. Target candidates for emicizumab prophylaxis are difficult-to-treat patients with haemophilia A and inhibitors and/or venous access issues, frequent bleeds and target joints. In case of breakthrough bleeding while receiving emicizumab, patients still require treatment with bypassing agents; the adjunct treatment of choice is recombinant activated factor VII. This treatment is also recommended to prevent bleeds in patients with inhibitors undergoing surgery. Our recommendations on suitable laboratory assays and monitoring new products, as well as the benefit of patient-reported outcomes (such as pain and physical activity levels), are included. We also briefly discuss future treatment options for patients with haemophilia B and inhibitors. Although these nonfactor treatments offer great promise, further data and real-world evidence are needed."

    "abstract": "Sustained expression of therapeutic factor IX (FIX) levels has been achieved after adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-based gene therapy in patients with hemophilia B. Nevertheless, patients are still at risk of vector dose-limiting toxicity, particularly liver inflammation, justifying the need for more efficient vectors and a lower dosing regimen. A novel increased potency FIX (designated as CB 2679d-GT), containing 3 amino acid substitutions (R318Y, R338E, T343R), significantly outperformed the R338L-Padua variant after gene therapy. CB 2679d-GT demonstrated a statistically significant approximately threefold improvement in clotting activity when compared with R338L-Padua after AAV-based gene therapy in hemophilic mice. Moreover, CB 2679d-GT gene therapy showed significantly reduced bleeding time (approximately fivefold to eightfold) and total blood loss volume (approximately fourfold) compared with mice treated with the R338L-Padua, thus achieving more rapid and robust hemostatic correction. FIX expression was sustained for at least 20 weeks with both CB 2679d-GT and R338L-Padua whereas immunogenicity was not significantly increased. This is a novel gene therapy study demonstrating the superiority of CB 2679d-GT, highlighting its potential to obtain higher FIX activity levels and superior hemostatic efficacy following AAV-directed gene therapy in hemophilia B patients than what is currently achievable with the R338L-Padua variant."

    "abstract": "Many guidelines and studies describe haemostatic management protocols for patients with haemophilia, but few have evaluated the risk factors for post-extraction bleeding. This retrospective cohort study was performed to investigate these risks among this group of patients. We used medical records to identify patients with haemophilia who underwent tooth extraction(s) between April 2006 and April 2019 in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at Nara Medical University Hospital, Nara, Japan, and conducted logistic regression analyses to identify risk or protective factors for post-extraction bleeding in procedures involving factor replacement therapy. Post-extraction bleeding was defined as bleeding that could not be stopped by biting down on gauze, and that required medical treatment between 30min and 14 days after the extraction. A total of 151 extractions (84 interventions) in 55 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (130 extractions (72 interventions) in 48 patients with haemophilia A, and 21 extractions (12 interventions) in seven patients with haemophilia B). Post-extraction bleeding was observed in nine patients (16.3%), 10 interventions (11.9%), and 12 extractions (7.9%). On average, it occurred six days after the intervention, and on the fifth postoperative day after extractions. Use of mouth splints significantly reduced the risk (odds ratio: 0.13; p=0.01) in patients on factor replacement therapy. We will conduct a prospective study to investigate the optimal type of splint and optimal splint-wearing period."

He consequently developed paraneoplastic coagulopathy with life-threatening tumor hemorrhage and intracranial hemorrhage, showing central nervous system relapse. Management consisted of factor IX replacement with extended half-life factor IX fusion protein, adjusted to bleeding risk. Additional interventions included factor XIII, fibrinogen, fresh frozen plasma, tranexamic acid, and platelet transfusions. The half-life of factor IX products was markedly reduced requiring close factor IX monitoring and adequate replacement. This intensified treatment allowed chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplantation, and GD2 antibody immune therapy without bleeding or thrombosis."

    "abstract": "Stem cell transplantation to the liver is a promising therapeutic strategy for a variety of disorders. Hepatocyte transplantation has short-term efficacy but can be problematic due to portal hypertension, inflammation, and sinusoidal thrombosis. We have previously transplanted small mouse endoderm progenitor (EP) cells to successfully reverse a murine model of hemophilia B, and labeling these cells with iron nanoparticles renders them responsive to magnetic fields, which can be used to enhance engraftment. The mechanisms mediating progenitor cell migration from the sinusoidal space to the hepatocyte compartment are unknown. Here we find human EP and hepatic progenitor (HP) cells can be produced from human embryonic stem cells with high efficiency, and they also readily uptake iron nanoparticles. This provides a simple manner through which one can readily identify transplanted cells in vivo using electron microscopy, shortly after delivery. High resolution imaging shows progenitor cell morphologies consistent with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) mediating invasion into the hepatic parenchyma. This occurs in as little as 3 h, which is considerably faster than observed when hepatocytes are transplanted. We confirmed activated EMT in transplanted cells in vitro, as well as in vivo 24 h after transplantation. We conclude that EMT naturally occurs concurrent with EP and HP cell engraftment, which may mediate the rate, safety, and efficacy of early cell engraftment in the undamaged quiescent liver."

    "abstract": "The high-specific-activity factor IX (FIX) variant Padua (R338L) is the most promising transgene for hemophilia B (HB) gene therapy. Although R338 is strongly conserved in mammalian evolution, amino acid substitutions at this position are underrepresented in HB databases. We therefore undertook a complete 20 amino acid scan and determined the specific activity of human (h) and canine (c) FIX variants with every amino acid substituted at position 338. Notably, we observe that hFIX-R338L is the most active variant and cFIX-R338L is sevenfold higher than wild-type (WT) cFIX. This is consistent with the previous identification of hFIX-R338L as a cause of a rare X-linked thrombophilia risk factor. Moreover, WT hFIX and cFIX are some of the least active variants. We confirmed the increased specific activity relative to FIX-WT in vivo of a new variant, cFIX-R338I, after gene therapy in an HB dog. Last, we screened 232 pediatric subjects with thromboembolic disease without identifying F9 R338 variants. Together these observations suggest a surprising evolutionary pressure to limit FIX activity with WT FIX rather than maximize FIX activity."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy may lead to a cure for hemophilia B (HB) if it is successful. Data from clinical trials using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated liver-targeted FIX gene therapy are very encouraging. However, this protocol can be applied only to adults who do not have liver disease or anti-AAV antibodies, which occur in 30% to 50% of individuals. Thus, developing a protocol that can be applied to all HB patients is desired. Our previous studies have demonstrated that lentivirus-mediated platelet-specific FIX (2bF9) gene therapy can rescue bleeding diathesis and induce immune tolerance in FIXnull mice, but FIX expression was only ∼2% to 3% in whole blood. To improve the efficacy, we used a codon-optimized hyperfunctional FIX-Padua (2bCoF9R338L) to replace the 2bF9 cassette, resulting in 70% to 122% (35.08-60.77 mU/108 platelets) activity levels in 2bCoF9R338L-transduced FIXnull mice. Importantly, sustained hyperfunctional platelet-FIX expression was achieved in all 2bCoF9R338L-transduced highly immunized recipients with activity levels of 18.00 ± 9.11 and 9.36 ± 12.23 mU/108 platelets in the groups treated with 11 Gy and 6.6 Gy, respectively. The anti-FIX antibody titers declined with time, and immune tolerance was established after 2bCoF9R338L gene therapy. We found that incorporating the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib into preconditioning can help eliminate anti-FIX antibodies. The bleeding phenotype in 2bCoF9R338L-transduced recipients was completely rescued in a tail bleeding test and a needle-induced knee joint injury model once inhibitors dropped to undetectable. The hemostatic efficacy in 2bCoF9R338L-transduced recipients was further confirmed by ROTEM and thrombin generation assay (TGA). Together, our studies suggest that 2bCoF9R338L gene therapy can be a promising protocol for all HB patients, including patients with inhibitors."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA), an X-linked recessive congenital bleeding disorder, affects 80%-85% of patients with hemophilia. Nearly half of severe cases of hemophilia are caused by a 0.6-Mb genomic inversion (Inv22) that disrupts <i>F8</i>. Although viral-based gene therapy has shown therapeutic effects for hemophilia B (HB), this promising approach is not applicable for HA at the present stage; this limitation is mainly due to the large size of <i>F8</i> cDNA, which far exceeds the adeno-associated virus (AAV) packaging capacity. We previously reported an <i>in situ</i> genetic correction of Inv22 in HA patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (HA-iPSCs) by using TALENs. We also investigated an alternative strategy for targeted gene addition, in which cDNA of the B-domain deleted <i>F8</i> (<i>BDDF8</i>) was targeted at the rDNA locus of HA-iPSCs using TALENickases to restore FVIII function. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have low immunogenicity and can secrete FVIII under physiological conditions; in this study, MSCs were differentiated from <i>F8</i>-corrected iPSCs, <i>BDDF8</i>-iPSCs, and HA-iPSCs. Differentiated MSCs were characterized, and FVIII expression efficacy in MSCs was verified <i>in vitro</i>. The three types of MSCs were introduced into HA mice <i>via</i> intravenous injection. Long-term engraftment with restoration of FVIII function and phenotypic rescue was observed in HA mice transplanted with <i>F8</i>-corrected iMSCs and <i>BDDF8</i>-iMSCs.

The gene therapy field has also benefited from hemophilia B clinical studies, which revealed for the first time critical safety concerns related to immune responses to the vector capsid not anticipated in preclinical models. Preclinical studies have also investigated gene transfer approaches for other rare inherited bleeding disorders, including factor VII deficiency, von Willebrand disease, and Glanzmann thrombasthenia.

Assess for the first time FIX:C in five commonly used coagulation assays in plasma samples from hemophilia B subjects receiving FIX-Padua gene transfer. FIX:C was compared between central (n = 1) and local laboratories (n = 5) in the study, and across four commonly used FIX:C one-stage assays and one FIX:C chromogenic assay. For comparison, samples of pooled congenital FIX-deficient plasma spiked with purified recombinant human FIX (rHFIX)-Padua protein or rHFIX (nonacog alfa) to obtain FIX:C concentrations from ~20% to ~40% were tested. FIX:C results at local laboratories strongly correlated with central laboratory results. However, absolute values at the central laboratory were consistently lower than those at local laboratories. Across five different FIX:C assays, a consistent pattern of FIX:C was observed for subjects receiving fidanacogene elaparvovec-expressed gene transfer. Use of Actin FSL activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) reagent in the central laboratory resulted in lower FIX:C values compared with other APTT reagents tested. The chromogenic assay determined lower FIX:C than any of the one-stage assays. The rHFIX-Padua protein-spiked samples showed similar results. In contrast, FIX:C results for rHFIX-nonacog alfa measured within 25% of expected for all one-stage assays and below 25% in the chromogenic assay. Assay-based differences in FIX:C were observed for fidanacogene elaparvovec transgene product and rHFIX-Padua protein, suggesting the variable FIX:C determined with different assay reagents is inherent to the FIX-Padua protein and is not specific to gene therapy-derived FIX-Padua."

During prophylaxis, patients had a median spontaneous annualized bleeding rate (sABR) of 1.0 and significant reductions in ABR (P < 0.0001). This post hoc analysis examined the time of onset of spontaneous bleeding events (sBEs) and spontaneous target joint bleeding events (sTJBEs). The postdosing day (D) of onset of sBEs observed during prophylaxis and steady-state FIX activity data (FIX:C) between 144 and 196 h postdose were collected at weeks 26 and 78. Twelve patients (48%) had no sBEs; the remaining 13 (52%) had the following onset of sBEs: less than 1 D (0%), 1 to less than 2D (5%), 2 to less than 3 D (22%), 3 to less than 4 D (9%), 4 to less than 5D (22%), 5 to less than 6D (23%), 6 to less than 7D (11%), and at least 7D (8%). Reductions in sBEs and sTJBEs during on-demand versus prophylaxis treatment were experienced by all 13 patients. Target joint sABR during prophylaxis was 0 for 5/13 patients. ABR reduction ranged from 66.1% (27.2→9.2) to 97.8% (46.2→1.0); sTJBE reductions ranged from 6.2% (2.1→2.0) to 100% (from 40.1, 19.1, 3.9, 9.0, 6.1--0).

Further desensitization protocol by administering rFVIII of increasing does from 0.01 IU/kg to 40 IU/kg with a pre-determined time schedule allowed patient tolerance to the normal dose and infusion time to FVIII."

    "abstract": "Pharmacokinetic (PK) differences between the extended half-life (EHL) factor IX (FIX) concentrates for hemophilia B exist, which may influence hemostatic efficacy of replacement therapy in patients. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the PK properties of three EHL-FIX concentrates and compare them to a standard half-life (SHL) recombinant FIX (rFIX) concentrate. Activity-time profiles of PEGylated FIX (N9-GP), FIX linked with human albumin (rIX-FP), FIX coupled to human IgG1 Fc-domain (rFIXFc), and SHL rFIX were simulated for 10,000 patients during steady-state dosing of 40 IU/kg once weekly (EHL-FIX) and biweekly (rFIX) using published concentrate specific population PK models. Half-lives were respectively 80, 104, and 82 h for N9-GP, rIX-FP, and rFIXFc versus 22 h for rFIX. Between the EHL concentrates, exposure was different with area under the curve (AUC) values of 78.5, 49.6, and 12.1 IU/h/mL and time above FIX target values of 0.10 IU/mL of 168, 168, and 36 h for N9-GP, rIX-FP, and rFIXFc, respectively. N9-GP produced the highest median in vivo recovery value (1.70 IU/dL per IU/kg) compared with 1.18, 1.00, and 1.05 IU/dL per IU/kg for rIX-FP, rFIXFc, and rFIX, respectively. When comparing EHL products, not only half-life but also exposure must be considered. In addition, variation in extravascular distribution of the FIX concentrates must be taken into account. This study provides insight into the different PK properties of these concentrates and may aid in determination of dosing regimens of EHL-FIX concentrates in real-life."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a rare bleeding disorder that needs plasma or clotting factor concentrate transfusion. Therefore chances of blood-borne pathogens like HCV transmission increase due to high prevalence in healthy donors. This study was aimed to determine the prevalence of HCV genotypes and associated risk factors in hemophilia patients of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Blood samples and data were collected from 672 hemophiliacs after proper consent obtained from each patient. Samples were analyzed for anti-HCV, HCV RNA and HCV genotype/s detection. Of the total, 22.32% (150) were anti-HCV positive, of which HCV RNA was detected in 18.45% (124) individuals. HCV genotype 3a was found with significantly higher prevalence (p<0.05) (19.35%) as compared to 2a (16.13%) and 1a (12.90%). HCV-3b and HCV-4 were found each in 3.22% samples. Dual infection of genotypes was found in 22.58% of individuals and 22.58% HCV RNA positive sampels were not typed. A total of 572 (85.12%) subjects had hemophilia A and 100 (14.88%) had hemophilia B. In hemophiliacs A the most dominant genotype was 3a (19.27%) while in hemophilia B, genotype 1a was prevalent (26.67%). Whole blood and plasma transfusion were observed as the main risk factors of HCV. It is concluded that HCV genotype 3a and 2a are prevalent in hemophilia patients of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pakistan and the main risk factor observed was an unscreened whole blood transfusion."

The principal inclusion factor was a focal point on surgery in hemophilia. Articles that did not concentrate on this subject were not included.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Turoctocog alfa pegol appears to be efficacious for perioperative hemostatic treatment of all kind of surgical operations (minor and major) in PWH A. Long-acting recombinant coagulation factor IX (FIX) albumin fusion protein (<i>rIX-FP</i>) seems to facilitate perioperative management in PWH B. In people suffering from von Willebrand disease (VWD), the utilization of concentrates of von Willebrand factor (VWF) is commonly used for the decrease of exaggerated bleeding during surgical operations. On-demand management with 30-60 IU/kg may keep hemostasis under control during all kind of surgical operations. Factor concentrates with extended half-life (EHL) are a good option to standard half-life (SHL) products in PWH undergoing surgery, permitting diminished number of infusions and inferior consuming, particularly for EHL factor IX (FIX). Supplementary factor VIII (FVIII) and/or bypassing management have demonstrated to be secure and efficacious in association with emicizumab for major surgical procedures."

In this study, we assessed the effects of aquatic activities performed to improve functional capacity in these patients. The interventional protocol consisted of 24 hydrotherapy sessions during three months, in comparison with 24 swimming sessions. The pre- and post-intervention assessment consisted of Functional Independence Score, haemophilia joint health score (HJHS), Pediatric Haemophilia Activities List (PedHAL), surface electromyography (SEMG) of thigh muscles to assess muscle electric activity, and load cell on extensor and flexor thigh muscles to evaluate muscular strength. Forty-seven haemophilia patients were enrolled in this study, and 32 (23 severe haemophilia A, one moderate haemophilia A and 8 severe haemophilia B), median age 12y (6 to 40y), concluded the aquatic intervention. We observed a statistically significant increase with substantial improvement in functional capacity in the pre- and post-intervention evaluation of hydrotherapy in comparison with the swimming protocol, with HJHS (p = .006 and p = .001 respectively), PedHAL (Sum score) (p = .022 and p = .001) and score FISH (p = .021). The swimming group revealed significant improvements in muscular strength, in all muscles tested (p = .005 and p = .001). SEMG signal amplitude reached significantly higher levels in all muscles evaluated after both interventions except for the vastus medialis (right) in the hydrotherapy group. Our results concluded that both swimming and hydrotherapy were associated with physical improvement in haemophilia patients; however, only hydrotherapy lead to a more significant improvement in functional capacity."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B (HB) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by bleeding-related complications which are managed by prophylactic or post-bleeding event (\"on-demand\") replacement of clotting factor IX (FIX). The standard of care for severe HB is life-long prophylaxis with standard half-life (SHL) or extended half-life (EHL) products given every 2-3 or 7-14 days, respectively. FIX treatment costs in the US have been investigated, but the lifetime costs of HB treatment have not been well characterized, particularly related to the impact of joint health deterioration and associated health resource utilization. We developed a decision-analytic model to explore outcomes, costs and underlying cost drivers associated with FIX treatment options over the lifetime of an adult with severe or moderately severe HB. With participation from clinicians, health technology assessment specialists and patient advocates, a Markov model was constructed to estimate bleeding events and costs associated with health states including \"bleed into joint\", \"bleed not into joint\", \"no bleed\" and \"death\". Sub-models of joint health were based on 0, 1, or ≥2 areas of chronic joint damage. US third-party payer and societal perspectives were considered with a lifetime horizon; sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of primary findings. Total adult lifetime costs per patient with severe and moderately severe HB were $21,086,607 for SHL FIX prophylaxis, $22,987,483 for EHL FIX prophylaxis, and $20,971,826 for on-demand FIX treatment. For FIX prophylaxis, the cost of FIX treatment accounts for >90% of the total HB treatment costs. This decision analytic model demonstrated significant economic burden associated with the current HB treatment paradigm."

Results from international studies provide an opportunity to determine which items are universally important. The aim of this study was to determine which items of the pedHAL are redundant to construct a shorter version of the pedHAL. This study is a cross-sectional multicentre secondary analysis on pooled data of published studies using the pedHAL (7 domains, 53 items, optimum score: 100) in children with haemophilia A/B aged 4-18 years. To identify redundant items, the following aspects were evaluated: floor and ceiling effects, proportions of missing and 'not applicable' responses, inter-item correlations, component loadings in an exploratory factor analysis, internal consistency and item-total correlations. Data on 315 patients with haemophilia from 6 studies were evaluated. Median age was 12.2 years) (range 4.0-18.0), 87.3% had severe haemophilia and 80.3% received prophylaxis. Median (IQR) pedHAL sum score was 96.7 (88.0-100). After a stepwise procedure, 31 items were removed, resulting in a pedHAL<sub>short</sub> of 22 items, representing all original 7 domains. Most remaining items belonged to the domains 'sitting/kneeling/standing' and 'functions of the legs'. The pedHAL<sub>short</sub> sum score was similar to the original pedHAL sum score, with small differences in 5 domains. This clinimetric study resulted in >50% reduction of the length of the pedHAL. The 22-item pedHAL<sub>short</sub> reduces patient burden and is expected to capture the information on activities and participation. The pedHAL<sub>short</sub> needs validation in other populations."

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of fitusiran treatment for people with moderate/severe hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. In this open-label phase 1, part D study, 17 males with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors received three once-monthly subcutaneous injections of fitusiran 50 mg (n = 6) or 80 mg (n = 11); followed for up to 112 days. Endpoints included safety (primary), pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (secondary), annualized bleeding rate, and patient-reported outcomes (exploratory). The most common adverse event was injection site erythema (n = 8). No thrombotic events were reported. At nadir, mean (standard error of the mean [SEM]) antithrombin activity decreased from baseline by 82.0% (2.2) and 87.4% (0.7) in the 50 mg and 80 mg groups, respectively. Antithrombin reduction was associated with increased thrombin generation. 11/17 (64.7%) participants had no bleeds during the observation period (mean [standard deviation] 69.4 [16.3] days). Mean (SEM) changes from baseline in Haemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults total (-9.2 [2.9]) and physical health (-12.3 [3.9]) domain scores suggested clinically meaningful improvement. Monthly fitusiran was generally well tolerated, lowered antithrombin levels from baseline, and resulted in improved thrombin generation. These preliminary results suggest that monthly fitusiran treatment may reduce bleeding episodes and improve quality of life in participants with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors."

    "title": "Novel treatments for hemophilia through rebalancing of the coagulation cascade.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia A and B are inherited hemorrhagic disorders that result from alterations in the coagulation cascade. Aside from spontaneous bleeding, the main complication of hemophilia is hemarthrosis. Progress over the last three decades, specifically prophylaxis using recombinant factor, has prevented hemarthrosis and lengthened patient life expectancies. However, many treatments require frequent dosing up to three times a week, and alloantibodies (inhibitors) against replacement factor continues to be an issue. These problems call for novel treatments for patients with hemophilia. Although there has been progress in extended half-life factors and mimetics of factor VIII, an alternative treatment methodology is to rebalance the activities of pro- and anticoagulant factors through inhibition of the natural anticoagulants: antithrombin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, protein C, and protein S. This review will explore the efficacy of targeting these inhibitory pathways from preclinical development through clinical trials, and delve into concerns of thrombotic risk."

    "title": "Concizumab: a novel anti-TFPI therapeutic for hemophilia.",
    "abstract": "Concizumab is a novel subcutaneous prophylactic therapy for hemophilia. It is a hemostatic rebalancing agent that binds to the Kunitz-2 domain of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), one of the molecules that contributes to downregulation of coagulation thereby preventing TFPI from binding to and blocking the factor Xa (FXa) active site. When the TFPI inhibitory activity is decreased, sufficient FXa is produced by the FVIIa-tissue factor complex to achieve hemostasis. On the basis of this mechanism of action, concizumab is expected to be equally effective in hemophilia A and B, regardless of inhibitor status. Moreover, the concizumab mechanism of action does not interfere with the regulation of coagulation downstream of TFPI. Results from 2 phase 2 trials in patients with hemophilia A or B with and without inhibitors demonstrated that concizumab had a favorable safety profile, with no deaths, no thromboembolic events, and no adverse events leading to withdrawal. Clinical proof of concept in prevention of bleeding episodes was confirmed in both concizumab phase 2 trials across all hemophilia subtypes assessed, with a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in annualized bleeding rates observed in inhibitor patients compared to those who received on-demand treatment. On the basis of phase 2 results, the US Food and Drug Administration granted concizumab Breakthrough Therapy designation for hemophilia B with inhibitor patients, a rare and vulnerable patient subgroup that currently has the highest unmet medical need. In the ongoing concizumab phase 3 trials, an optimized dosing regimen will be administered in patients with hemophilia A or B with and without inhibitors."

The mean age at study recruitment was 22.5 ± 4.5 years, 62.3% of patients aged 18 years or older, and 29 patients were receiving primary prophylaxis (38.0%). There was a positive correlation between HJHS and age and a negative correlation between FISH and age. The worsening HJHS was associated with non-primary prophylaxis and non-attendance at scheduled multidisciplinary consultations. The worsening FISH was associated with non-primary prophylaxis. The correlation between FISH and treatment adherence was significant for the delta. The older the patient with haemophilia, the higher the probability of a worsening of the HJHS. In the presence of more arthropathies, the older the patient, the worse the FISH. Patients receiving primary prophylaxis show better results in the HJHS and FISH when compared to patients receiving secondary prophylaxis and/or on-demand treatment."

A cross-sectional, multicentre study covering Nordic patients with MHA and MHB. Arthropathy was evaluated by HEAD-US and HJHS 2.1. We assessed 693 joints in 118 patients. HEAD-US scores (medians [interquartile ranges]) were as follows: elbows 0 points (0-0), knees 0 (0-0) and ankles 0 (0-1). Respectively, by HJHS: elbows 0 (0-1), knees 0 (0-1) and ankles 0 (0-1). Cartilage (14%) and bone (13%) were most commonly affected by HEAD-US. Frequent HJHS findings were crepitus on motion in knees (39%), and loss of flexion (23%) and extension (13%) in ankles. HEAD-US correlated strongly with HJHS (elbows r = .70, knees r = .60 and ankles r = .65), but 24% had discordant scores. Joints with HJHS zero points, 5% captured HEAD-US ≥1 point. Moreover, 26% had HJHS findings without HEAD-US pathology. Notably, 31% of knees had crepitus on motion and normal HEAD-US. Overall, the joints attained low scores implying good joint health. HEAD-US correlated strongly with HJHS. In 5%, HEAD-US detected subclinical pathology. Crepitus on motion was frequently reported despite normal HEAD-US, thus not necessarily reflecting arthropathy. HEAD-US therefore improves the joint assessment in moderate haemophilia."

Differences in changes in outcomes from 2014 to 2015 were compared across the treatment groups. Baseline characteristics and adherence to the prophylactic regimen were similar across the treatment groups. Greater increase in weekly PA frequency and duration were observed among all EHL groups, except for children treated with rFIXFc. The increase in PA frequency was greater among the children on rFVIIIFc group, adults on rFVIIIFc group, and adults on rFIXFc group by 1.2, 1.2, and 1.4 events/week, respectively, compared to their rFVIII/rFIX counterparts. The increases in PA duration were 44, 60, and 80 min/wk greater among the children on rFVIIIFc, adults on rFVIIIFc, and adults on rFIXFc groups, respectively. Larger reductions in total ABR were observed in children and adults treated with rFVIIIFc compared to rFVIII (0.4 and 0.7 fewer bleeds). Larger reductions were also observed in spontaneous ABR in adult rFVIIIFc and rFIXFc groups (0.8 and 0.3 fewer bleeds, respectively). This study suggests that rFVIIIFc/FIXFc agents can positively impact PA while maintaining low ABRs."

In addition, there is a significant lack of data on mild-to-moderate haemophilia, and many unmet needs remain to be identified and addressed in this group of patients. Challenges for these patients, including women with haemophilia, were identified during a roundtable meeting attended by a group of US-based experts including healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, and physical therapists) and patients who live with a bleeding disorder. Identified unmet needs included a lack of proper education on the management of their disorder and prompt treatment of bleeds, absenteeism from school and work, and challenges with personal relationships. Initiatives to assist with alleviating these unmet needs were proposed and include suggestions for healthcare professionals, haemophilia treatment centres (HTCs) and national and local organizations within the bleeding disorders community. These included HTC and community engagement programmes for patients with mild-to-moderate haemophilia, revised transition guidelines for these patients as they approach adulthood and revised diagnostic classification of mild and moderate haemophilia. Challenges unique to women with haemophilia and ways to address these issues were also discussed. This paper summarizes the challenges, initiatives and suggestions that were identified by the haemophilia experts during the roundtable meeting."

Materials and Methods - A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2019 at four major haemophilia treatment centres in Kuching, Sibu, Bintulu and Miri Hospitals, Sarawak. Demographic and clinical data were collected with consents from patients. Ninety-six haemophilia patients were identified - 79(82.3%) haemophilia A(HA) and 17(17.7%) haemophilia B(HB). Severe haemophilia patients were noted in 45.6% (36/79) of HA and 64.7% (11/17) of HB. In all 44.3% of the HA and 52.9% of the HB population had no identifiable family history of haemophilia. Two-thirds of the patients with severe HA were on prophylaxis [24/36 (66.7%)] and only onethird [4/11 (36.4%)] in severe HB. Inhibitors developed in 9/79 (11.4%) of the HA population [3/79 (3.8%) high responders]. The median inhibitor titre was not significantly different between the different treatment groups - on demand versus prophylaxis (1.0BU versus 2.0BU; z statistic -1.043, p-value 0.297, Mann-Whitney test). None of the patients developed inhibitory alloantibodies to factor IX. Four HA patients (5.1%) underwent immune tolerance induction where one case had a successful outcome. Three severe HA patients received emicizumab prophylaxis and showed remarkable reduction in bleeding events with no thromboembolic events being reported. One female moderate HA patient received PEGylated recombinant anti-haemophilic factor. Eleven patients underwent radiosynovectomy. One mild HB patient succumbed to traumatic intracranial bleeding. Our data reported a prevalence (per 100,000 males) of 5.40 cases for all severities of HA, 2.46 cases for severe HA; 1.16 cases for all severities of HB, and 0.75 cases for severe HB. The overall incidence of HA and HB was 1 in 11,500 and 1 in 46,000, respectively. This study outlines the Sarawakian haemophilia landscape and offers objective standards for forward planning. Shared responsibilities among all parties are of utmost importance to improve the care of our haemophilia population."

A total of 211 patients were diagnosed with haemophilia A (HA) (severe disease, 72.5%) and 49 patients had haemophilia B (HB) (severe disease, 65.3%). The median age was 31 (IQR;2-84) years. Majority of the patients had at least one episode of musculoskeletal bleeding since diagnosis. The mean annual bleeding event (ABE) was 4.91 (SD±6.07) in 2018. Target joints were identified in 80.4% of the patients. Chronic arthropathy and synovitis collectively accounted for more than half of the musculoskeletal complications. 30.1% of the patients had contracted hepatitis C with less than half received treatment. Thirty-one patients (16.8%) with severe haemophilia developed inhibitor and 12 patients successfully underwent immune tolerance induction. More than three-quarters of the severe haemophilia patients were treated with factor concentrate prophylaxis. The mean prophylaxis dose for HA and HB were 41.3 (SD±19.1) and 48.6 (SD±21.5) IU/kg/week, respectively. In patients with severe disease, prophylaxis significantly reduced the ABE (5.45,9.03;p=0.005). The importance of utilising a low to moderate dose regimen as prophylaxis in haemophilic patients is highlighted in our study. Future studies should include QOL assessment will further improve the management in haemophilia."

    "title": "Impact of the HEAD-US Scoring System for Observing the Protective Effect of Prophylaxis in Hemophilia Patients: A Prospective, Multicenter, Observational Study.",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to observe the preventive effect of prophylactic treatment on joint health in people with hemophilia (PwH) and to investigate the importance of integration of ultrasonographic examination into clinical and radiological evaluation of the joints. This national, multicenter, prospective, observational study included male patients aged ≥6 years with the diagnosis of moderate or severe hemophilia A or B from 8 centers across Turkey between January 2017 and March 2019. Patients were followed for 1 year with 5 visits (baseline and 3<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, and 12<sup>th</sup> month visits). The Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) was used for physical examination of joints, the Pettersson scoring system was used for radiological assessment, point-of-care (POC) ultrasonography was used for bilateral examinations of joints, and the Hemophilia Early Arthropathy Detection with Ultrasound (HEAD-US) score was used for evaluation of ultrasonography results. Seventy-three PwH, of whom 62 had hemophilia A and 11 had hemophilia B, were included and 24.7% had target joints at baseline. The HJHS and HEAD-US scores were significantly increased at the 12<sup>th</sup> month in all patients. These scores were also higher in the hemophilia A subgroup than the hemophilia B subgroup. However, in the childhood group, the increment of scores was not significant. The HEAD-US total score was significantly correlated with both the HJHS total score and Pettersson total score at baseline and at the 12<sup>th</sup> month. The HEAD-US and HJHS scoring systems are valuable tools during follow-up examinations of PwH and they complement each other. We suggest that POC ultrasonographic evaluation and the HEAD-US scoring system may be integrated into differential diagnosis of bleeding and long-term monitoring for joint health as a routine procedure."

    "abstract": "Congenital haemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and B (factor IX deficiency) are X-linked bleeding disorders. Replacement therapy has been the cornerstone of the management of haemophilia, aiming to reduce the mortality and morbidity of chronic crippling arthropathy. Frequent intravenous injections are burdensome and costly for patients, consequently with poor adherence and restricted access to therapy for many patients worldwide. Bioengineered clotting factors with enhanced pharmacokinetic profiles can reduce the burden of treatment. However, replacement therapy is associated with a risk for inhibitor development that adversely affects bleeding prevention and outcomes. Novel molecules that are subcutaneously delivered provide effective prophylaxis in the presence or absence of inhibitors, either substituting for the procoagulant function of clotting factors (eg, emicizumab) or targeting the natural inhibitors of coagulation (ie, antithrombin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, or activated protein C). The ultimate goal of haemophilia treatment would be a phenotypical cure achievable with gene therapy, currently under late phase clinical investigation."

Pre-cise assessment and follow-up of joint status are crucial for tailoring their treatment. To study the correlation between the bleeding phenotype, the functional joint status, and the magnetic resonance imaging score in pediatric patients with haemophilia. Eighty-six joints (ankles, knees, and elbows) in patients aged 10.7±0.5 (range 4 - 20) years with severe/moderate haemophilia A, severe haemophilia B and haemophilia A with inhibitors were included in the study. The joints were assessed by Haemophilia Joint Health Score 2.1 (HJHS2.1) one month after the last hemarthrosis in a non-bleeding state. The magnetic reso-nance imaging was performed on 40 (46.5%) of the examined hemophilic joints (16 ankles, 11 knees and 13 elbows). Joint bleeds were present in 37 (38.9%) of the joints with ankles being the most commonly affected. Sixty joints (69.8%) had normal HJHS2.1 score. Only the loss of flexion score differed significantly between the joints and the ankles had highest score. The cumulative number of hemarthrosis in the joint correlated moderately with hemosiderin deposition and strongly with the formation of subchondral cysts on magnetic resonance imaging. The magnetic resonance imaging scores for soft tissue and osteochondral domains correlated moderately with the cumulative number of hemarthrosis in the joint and only with the presence of pain and crepitus of mo-tion from the physical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging is more sensitive than the bleeding phenotype and physical examination in detecting early signs of haemophilic arthropathy."

Forty-six sisters who had at least one family member with hemophilia A or B were included. Laboratory parameters were tested.Bleeding tendency interrogated by a detailed questionnaire.The results were compared with 43 healthy female controls. Mean factor activity levels were significantly lower in sisters than control subjects (p = 0,004). Bleeding score was higher in sisters than controls (p = 0.001). Prolonged bleeding after minor injury was significantly higher in the sisters than control subjects (p = 0.008). Requiring further treatment due to prolonged bleeding after tooth extraction was significantly higher in sisters (p = 0.001). Sisters had postpartum hemorrhage lasting longer than 6 weeks than controls (p = 0.025). Menstrual period lasted longer in the sisters than controls (p < 0.001). Spontaneous epistaxis, oral and gingival bleeding were more frequently observed in sisters whose factor activity levels were 60 % or below (p = 0.014 and p = 0.047, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between the severity of hemophilia in the affected family member and the factor levels in the sisters (p = 0.398).Spontaneous epistaxis has found to be significantly associated with the hemophilia severity in the family (p = 0.004). Clotting factor levels were found to be lower in the sisters and associated with spontaneous epistaxis, oral and gingival bleeding.Also, regardless of clotting factor levels, sisters significantly experienced more bleeding problems.Our study demonstrated the importance of taking precautions for prolonged bleeding in cases where medical interventions are inevitable in these patients."

We conducted a cross-sectional evaluation of 92 adult PWH at University Hospital Center Zagreb. The primary objective was to investigate the frequency of urolithiasis in adult PWH, and the secondary objective was to determine associated risk factors. Urolithiasis was diagnosed by ultrasound and other patient- and hemophilia-related parameters were recorded. The prevalence of urolithiasis was significantly higher among PWH than the reported prevalence in the general Croatian population (10.9% vs 5.9%; P = 0.042). Similarly, the incidence of urolithiasis during the course of the disease was significantly higher than the estimated cumulative lifetime incidence of urolithiasis in the Croatian population (25% vs 12%; P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that arterial hypertension, the presence of inhibitors, hypercalciuria and hyperbilirubinemia were independent predictors of current urolithiasis (P < 0.05), and that hematuria (P = 0.051) and prior urinary infections (P = 0.059) were also relevant factors.Urolithiasis is a significant burden in adult PWH. Identifying associated risk factors might help in establishing strategies for earlier recognition and more successful prevention and treatment of urolithiasis."

    "abstract": "Women or girls with haemophilia (WGH) represent a group of female symptomatic carriers who experience bleeding events more frequently than non-carriers. Bleeding events include spontaneous/traumatic bleeds and prolonged bleeding related to surgery, menstruation and pregnancy. Challenges for the treatment of WGH include lack of screening, diagnosis and treatment guidelines. Evaluate clinical characteristics, haemostasis management and clinical outcomes regarding menstruation, childbirth, dental procedures, surgeries and other bleeding events in WGH. A retrospective, non-interventional review of medical records from WGH among three haemophilia treatment centres (HTCs) was conducted in the United States (2012-2018). Patients with ≥2 visits to the HTC and who had undergone intervention for haemostasis management with the outcome documented were included. Descriptive statistics were used. Of 47 women and girls included in the chart review (37 with factor VIII deficiency, 10 with factor IX deficiency), median age at diagnosis was 22.6 years. Approximately 79% (n = 37) were diagnosed with mild haemophilia. Events of interest were primarily managed by factor concentrates or antifibrinolytics. Most treatment approaches were successful across clinical scenarios, except for heavy menstrual bleeding being insufficiently controlled in 8 (57%) of the 14 patients who experienced it. Bleeding events in WGH, such as excessive and prolonged bleeding during menstruation, demonstrate a unique burden and require specific medical intervention. These results highlight the importance of assessing the need for haemostasis management in WGH and may contribute to future prospective study designs."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is caused by a lack of antihemophilic factor(s), for example, factor VIII (FVIII; hemophilia A) and factor IX (FIX; hemophilia B). Low bone mass is widely reported in epidemiological studies of hemophilia, and patients with hemophilia are at an increased risk of fracture. The detailed etiology of bone homeostasis imbalance in hemophilia is unclear. Clinical and experimental studies show that FVIII and FIX are involved in bone remodeling. However, it is likely that antihemophilic factors affect bone biology through thrombin pathways rather than via their own intrinsic properties. In addition, among patients with hemophilia, there are pathophysiological processes in several systems that might contribute to bone loss. This review summarizes studies on the association between hemophilia and bone remodeling, and might shed light on the challenges facing the care and prevention of osteoporosis and fracture in patients with hemophilia."

Prophylaxis was adopted in 92.1% of individuals with severe HA and 88.6% with severe HB. Thirty-nine children (14.8%) were on treatment for inhibitors. FVIII prescribed to children with severe HA represented 11.1% of the total consumption, of which 4.6% was extended half-life (EHL). FIX given to children with HB accounted for 7.2% of the total FIX, of which 19.1% was EHL-FIX.

    "abstract": "Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a common postoperative complication in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery of the lower limbs, such as total hip or knee replacement (THR, TKR). Routine pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or a direct oral anticoagulant agent is strongly recommended in this setting. THR and TKR as well as ankle arthrodesis are frequently performed in people with haemophilia (PWH) and chronic haemophilic arthropathy. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in this population remains controversial. We report the results of a single-centre prospective study initiated in 2002 evaluating by systematic Doppler ultrasound the incidence of subclinical DVT in consecutive PWH referred for major orthopaedic surgery and not receiving pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. We included 46 different PWH (39 Haemophilia A, 7 Haemophilia B, 27 severe, 15 moderate and 4 mild forms) undergoing 67 orthopaedic procedures. Most (89.5%) were performed with continuous infusion of clotting factor concentrates. Rehabilitation was usually started on day 1 post-op. No clinical DVT or pulmonary embolism was suspected. In total, there were 5 cases (3 severe, 1 moderate HA and 1 moderate HB) of subclinical DVT which were all distal. Two patients were treated with a short course (10-14 days) of LMWH. The overall incidence of DVT was 7.5%. These data provide imaging-based evidence that the risk of DVT following major orthopaedic surgery among PWH is low. Identified DVTs were distal and resolved spontaneously in most cases. Systematic pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in this specific population is probably for most patients not required."

    "abstract": "Against a background of a rapidly evolving treatment landscape, a contemporary, evidence-based consolidated understanding of mortality in people with congenital hemophilia A (PwcHA) is lacking. This systematic literature review examines the available data on mortality and causes of death in PwcHA to enable a better understanding of fatalities in PwcHA and evaluate the impact of new treatment paradigms on mortality. A systematic literature review of observational studies was conducted by searching Medline, Embase, and clinical trials registries for articles published from January 2010 to March 2020, using the search terms: hemophilia A (HA), mortality, cause of death. Interventional studies, studies not reporting fatalities, and those reporting only on hemophilia B, acquired HA, or mixed other coagulopathies were excluded. Overall, 7818 unique records were identified and 17 were analyzed. Of these, six reported mortality rates and five reported mortality ratios. Mortality generally decreased over time, despite a spike associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the 1980s and 1990s. Mortality was strongly correlated with age and hemophilia severity. People with hemophilia had a raised mortality risk compared with the general population, particularly in severe hemophilia, and when infected with HIV or HCV. Causes of death varied across populations, countries, and time in 15 identified studies; however, incomplete and heterogeneous reporting limits evidence. Hemorrhage, HIV, HCV, and hepatic disease were the leading causes of death. A unified approach to reporting mortality and cause of death is needed to understand mortality in PwcHA as treatments continue to advance."

    "abstract": "Women and girls reported as \"haemophilic females\" may have complex genetic causes for their haemophilia phenotype. In addition, women and girls may have excessive bleeding requiring treatment simply because they are heterozygous for haemophilia alleles. While severe and moderate haemophilia are rare in females, 16% of patients with mild haemophilia A and almost one-quarter of those with mild haemophilia B seen in U.S. haemophilia treatment centres are women and girls. A phenotypic female with a low level of factor VIII or factor IX may be classified into one of the following categories of causality: homozygosity (two identical haemophilia alleles), compound heterozygosity (two different haemophilia alleles), hemizygosity (one haemophilia allele and no normal allele), heterozygosity (one haemophilia allele and one normal allele), genetic causes other than haemophilia and non-genetic causes. Studies required for classification may include coagulation parameters, F8 or F9 sequencing, F8 inversion testing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, karyotyping and X chromosome inactivation studies performed on the patient and parents. Women and girls who are homozygous, compound heterozygous or hemizygous clearly have haemophilia, as they do not have a normal allele. Heterozygous women and girls with factor levels below the haemostatic range also meet the definitions used for haemophilia treatment."

    "abstract": "Replacement therapy is the most common treatment for reduction of bleeding and control of episodic bleeding in individuals with hemophilia. Despite the proven effectiveness of factor replacement therapy, repeated intravenous administration is a heavy burden to individuals with hemophilia. To reduce the burden, therapeutic agents that can be subcutaneously administered need to be developed, and an anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) antibody may be a suitable candidate for this purpose. MG1113 is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to Kunitz-2 domain (KD2) of TFPI. To confirm the coagulation potential of MG1113, several tests were conducted using factor VIII (FVIII)- or IX (FIX)-deficient plasma. For the ex vivo spiking test, platelet-poor plasma samples from 14 individuals with hemophilia were spiked with MG1113. The in vivo efficacy was determined using blood loss tests, modified prothrombin time (mPT), and free TFPI quantification after intravenous or subcutaneous administration of MG1113 into hemophilia A (HA)-induced rabbits. Radiographic crystallography demonstrated the specific binding site between MG1113 and KD2. In FVIII-deficient plasma and the plasma of individuals with hemophilia, peak thrombin and endogenous thrombin levels were increased by MG1113 in a concentration-dependent manner. Rotational thromboelastometry assay revealed that clotting time, clot formation time, and maximum clot firmness were normalized in MG1113-treated blood of patients. Intravenous or subcutaneous injection of MG1113 into HA-induced rabbits resulted in rebalancing of blood loss, mPT, and free TFPI levels. These results indicate that subcutaneous administration of MG1113 neutralizes the function of TFPI and regulates bleeding in individuals with hemophilia."

This prospective, observational, multicenter study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT029 22231) was conducted in hemophilia B patients between April 2015 and April 2019, who were observed for up to 6 months after the initiation of Rixubis treatment. Safety was evaluated based on the number and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs). Hemostatic effectiveness was assessed by physicians and patients by using a four-point scale and rated as excellent, good, fair, or no response based on treatment type. In all, 58 patients were enrolled from four centers by seven physicians during the study period. The safety and effectiveness analysis sets included 57 and 54 patients, respectively. Overall, 11 AEs were reported in eight patients (14.0%), of which three were SAEs and occurred in three patients (5.3%). All 11 AEs were reported as unexpected and mild in severity, with no anaphylactic reaction, and 10 AEs (90.9%) resolved. The majority of AEs (10) were unrelated to Rixubis. Of the 142 hemostatic effectiveness assessments, 123 (86.6%) were reported as good or excellent.

FIX is encoded by the <i>F9</i> gene located on Xq27.1. Diagnosis of HB is primarily suspected by prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), decreased FIX activity (FIX:C) or genetic test of the <i>F9</i> gene. We herein described a Chinese family with patients of mild HB. Sanger sequencing of the <i>F9</i> gene was applied to identify mutation. Coagulation tests were performed. The proband was a 5-year-old boy. He suffered prolonged bleeding after tonsillectomy recently and circumcision last year as well. His grandfather experienced prolonged bleeding after gastric surgery. Both patients showed normal APTT, though they had significantly decreased FIX:C. Sanger sequencing of the <i>F9</i> gene revealed a novel hemizygous <i>F9</i> c.639C > A (p.Asn213Lys) missense mutation in both patients. The proband's mother carried heterozygous mutation. This mutation was located in the activation peptide domain of FIX. In conclusion, we confirmed that APTT could be normal in mild HB patients. Highly sensitive APTT for mild HB and molecular genetic test could confirm the diagnosis of mild HB."

Demographics, medical, social history and treatment were recorded. A physical examination including joint range of motion (ROM) was performed; QoL was assessed. Samples were collected for F9 gene mutation, HLA typing, non-inhibitory antibodies and renal function testing. Twenty-four centres enrolled 224 individuals from 107 families including 29 with current/history of inhibitors.

Comparison of joint scores showed significant (P < .05) differences between those with severe (with/without inhibitors), and those with moderate/mild disease. The majority with severe disease, 80.0% with current/history of inhibitors and 64.3% of those without, were treated with prophylaxis. B-Natural provides data supporting an increased understanding of HB and its impact throughout life.

The retrospective phase comprised 37 subjects. Of these, 25 had severe haemophilia B. One subject experienced 2 ADRs; another experienced 4 ESIs of hypersensitivity. Median ABR in subjects receiving a predominantly on-demand regimen (prophylaxis <50% of time; n = 11) was 2.0; median ABR was 3.8 in those receiving predominantly prophylactic treatment (prophylaxis ≥50% of time; n = 24). Joint bleeding was infrequent (median ABR, 0.4; n = 35). The prospective phase included 26 subjects, with 17 continuing from the retrospective phase. A total of 20 subjects had severe haemophilia B. Three subjects experienced 7 treatment-related AEs; 3 experienced 4 ESIs. Median ABR was 4.5 and 1.1 in subjects who received predominantly on-demand (n = 5) or prophylactic treatment (n = 19), respectively; the overall median ABR for joint bleeding events was 0.0. Overall, nonacog alfa treatment effectively controlled bleeding events, with no new safety signals identified.

This study aims to identify compliance with a treatment protocol in adult patients with hemophilia and to evaluate the factors associated with and the impact on mortality of noncompliance with a hemophilia treatment protocol. This was a cross-sectional study that was performed between June 2015 and May 2016, followed by a cohort to evaluate mortality until July 2019 that included all adult patients with hemophilia registered in the Federal District, Brazil. Among 138 patients enrolled in the study, 35 patients were compliant with all items of the treatment protocol (25.4%). Regarding each item, compliance with the medical consultations was 71.0% (98/138); the clotting factor regimen was 65.9% (91/138); and the serological tests were 51.4% (71/138).

All deaths occurred in those who did not comply with the protocol, and the majority were due to bleeding. Patients who were noncompliant with all protocol items showed the highest mortality (50.0%, 5/10). Treatment at the hemophilia treatment center (OR: 2.388; 95% CI: 1.052-5.418, p=0.037) was positively and independently associated with compliance with the protocol in multivariate analysis. Noncompliance with the treatment protocol was high. Treatment at a hemophilia treatment center was positively and independently associated with compliance with the protocol, which reinforces the importance of comprehensive care by a multidisciplinary team."

Our goal was to maintain his FIX activity at 80%-100% for post-op days (PODs) 0-3, and at 60%-80% for PODs 4-14. Preoperatively, the patient was given recombinant FIX (rFIX) bolus using the formula:Dosage needed=%(desired FIX level-current level of FIX)×weight (kg)×1.3.This increased his activity to 100%. One IU of rFIX increased FIX activity by 0.8%; the half-life of rFIX is 18-24 hours. The rFIX infusion was started intraoperatively and continued after surgery to maintain target FIX activity. He was discharged on POD 9 on rFIX bolus dosing of 5000 IU every 12 hours for an additional 5 days. Using continuous factor infusion, we managed to decrease the amount rFIX used by >60% while maintaining steady state FIX activity level."

    "abstract": "Eftrenonacog-alfa is a recombinant factor IX-Fc fusion protein increasingly prescribed in hemophilia B patients. We aimed to assess its pharmacodynamics (PD) in real-life setting via FIX activity measurement and thrombin generation assay (TGA). Sixty samples from 15 severe hemophilia B treated patients were collected at different time points. FIX activity was measured using product-specific one-stage clotting assay (reference method) and two chromogenic assays (CSA) (Biophen FIX and Rox FIX). TGA was triggered with 1 pM tissue factor. Five parameters were analyzed: lag time (LT), time to peak (TTP), peak height (PH), endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), and velocity. PD models were built to characterize their relationships with FIX activity, using mixed effects models. Mean trough FIX level was estimated at 4.64 (±1.50) IU/dl with a recovery at 0.78 (±0.16) IU/dl per 1 IU/kg injected dose. FIX activity ranged between 1 and 86 IU/dl with 21.5 IU/dl median value. Biophen FIX and Rox FIX allowed reliable measurements except in samples with FIX <20 IU/dl in which values were underestimated (delta >30%). PD models revealed that velocity was the most sensitive TGA parameter to FIX activity followed by PH, ETP, TTP and finally LT. Following FIX activity peak after eftrenonacog-alfa injection, velocity decreased first, followed by PH then ETP. Both CSA failed to accurately measure FIX in severe hemophilia B patients receiving eftrenonacog-alfa throughout the measuring range. TGA could be an additional valuable tool to evaluate hemostasis balance in treated patients."

    "abstract": "In sub-Saharan Africa, access to clotting factor concentrates (CFCs) is often extremely limited and published data on people with haemophilia on prophylaxis are almost not existent. To assess the feasibility, barriers and outcomes of a low-dose and low-frequency prophylaxis with extended half-life (EHL) recombinant Fc fusion FVIII and FIX in Ivorian children on a two-year period in the setting of the World Federation of Hemophilia's (WFH) humanitarian aid programme. Twenty-five boys with haemophilia were included. Mean (SD) age at inclusion was 5.6 (2.5) years. The median [range] follow-up duration was 17 [11-24] months. Regimen of prophylaxis was 20 IU kg<sup>-1</sup> 1×/week in haemophilia A and every 10 days in haemophilia B. We observed a maximal reduction by 87.6% of the annual spontaneous joint bleeding rate and a slight decrease in the total HJHS scores (p = .047). Adherence problems related to parents' low education level and shortage in CFCs were the main issues to carry out the programme. Inhibitors occurred in 12.5%. This study confirms the feasibility and efficacy of low-dose and low-frequency prophylaxis in young Ivorian children with haemophilia treated with EHL CFCs donated through the WFH humanitarian aid programme. This work also highlights the crucial role of adherence and the need for appropriate education to achieve prophylaxis. Finally, it reminds the paramount objective of achieving self-sufficient, sustainable and available haemophilia replacement therapy for all worldwide."

    "abstract": "Characterisation of outcomes and costs of haemophilia care in common practice settings is essential for evaluation of new treatment options and for developing clinical practices. In Finland, haemophilia care is mostly centralised to University Hospitals, but treatment practices and costs in adult patients have not been systematically evaluated. This study was designed to characterise healthcare resource utilisation and treatment costs of adult inhibitor-negative haemophilia patients managed in Finnish University Hospitals. The study was based on a nationwide cohort, which consists of all adult haemophilia A (HA; n = 120) and B (HB; n = 35) patients treated in University Hospitals from 2012 to 2016. Patient characteristics and data on healthcare utilisation and factor replacement use were collected from medical records. Direct costs of care were evaluated based on wholesale drug prices and healthcare service utilisation with standard unit costs. Most of HA (79%, n = 96) and HB (84%, n = 31) patients received factor replacement therapy. The median annual bleeding rate (ABR) was low, at 0.8 for HA and 0.5 for HB, also among the patients with on-demand therapy. Over 94% (n = 149) of the patients had outpatient visits during the follow-up period. The mean total annual costs of treatment ranged from €2520 to €176,330. The highest individual cost was factor replacement therapy. The outcomes of centralising the management of care to University Hospital Treatment Centres show low ABR and lower treatment costs compared with earlier reports from other high-income European populations. Management strategies, including choosing the right therapy between prophylaxis and on-demand, has been successful in Finland."

Pre-existing anti-AAV antibodies significantly impact the use of AAV vectors. Even relatively low titers of AAV neutralizing antibodies (NAb) from natural AAV infections against the capsid have been shown to inhibit the transduction of intravenously administered AAV in animal models and were associated with limited efficacy in human trials. This is important for determining the primary eligibility of patients for AAV vector-based gene therapy clinical trials. Current techniques to screen AAV antibodies include AAV capsid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for total antibodies and a transduction inhibition assay (TIA) for NAb. This study developed and screened total capsid binding anti-AAV3 antibodies by using ELISA and determined NAb levels by TIA using mCherry flow cytometry in healthy individuals with hemophilia B in India. One hundred and forty-three apparently healthy controls and 92 individuals with hemophilia B were screened. The prevalence of total and NAb in healthy controls was 79.7% and 65%, respectively; the prevalence of total and NAb in patients with hemophilia B for AAV3 was 92.4% and 91.3%, respectively."

We performed a retrospective review of all patients who underwent an ACL reconstruction within Truven MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounter Database from 2010 to 2014. Hemophilia A, hemophilia B and patients were identified. Patient demographics, cost of surgery, blood product use, concomitant injuries, repeat ACL injury, complications and various operative variables were collected. Statistical tests were conducted on SAS 9.4 2013. Thirty-three hemophilia A, three hemophilia B, 63 von Willebrand factor patients, and 103,478 controls underwent ACL reconstruction. There is a statistically significant difference for hemarthrosis 1 year leading up to injury for hemophilia A compared with control (P = 0.0083). Total healthcare utilization 90 days after surgery was statistically significant for hemophilia A ($30,310 ± 52,745, P < 0.001) and von Willebrand factor ($20,355 ± 23,570, P < 0.001) compared with control ($14,564 ± 9512). Length of hospital stay, postoperative hemorrhage, concomitant injuries to the knee, additional ACL injury, infection rate, deep-vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism were not statistically significant. None of the hemophilia A or von Willebrand factor patients received blood products intraoperatively or postoperatively. Hemophilia A and von Willebrand factor patients had rates of postoperative complications and ACL re-injuries that were not statistically significant. Cost of healthcare utilization was identified as dramatically greater for hemophilia A and von Willebrand factor patients."

    "abstract": "The single most important step on the path to our modern understanding of blood coagulation and haemophilia in the 20th century was taken by British pathologist Robert Gwyn Macfarlane with his 1964 publication 'An enzyme cascade in the blood clotting mechanism, and its function as a biochemical amplifier'. In the same year, Ratnoff and Davie in the USA reached the same conclusion. Macfarlane and Rosemary Biggs had previously, in 1952, discovered factor IX as the factor deficient in haemophilia B. In 1973, Arthur Bloom defined the distinct role of Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor in haemophilia A and von Willebrand's disease respectively. This inspired the efforts of Tuddenham and his group towards the purification of Factor VIII which reached homogeneity in 1982, leading to the cloning of the Factor VIII gene in 1984 in collaboration with US scientists at Genentech, which in turn enabled development of safe recombinant factor concentrates for patients with haemophilia. Brownlee cloned the factor IX gene in 1982 at the Sir William Dunn Institute of Pathology in Oxford. This led eventually to the first successful trial of gene therapy for haemophilia B in 2011 by the Nathwani group at UCL, which built on pioneering work of US groups and was partnered with St Jude in Memphis where Nathwani started the project. This trial has fuelled the current quest for a functional cure of haemophilia A and B. The UK has, therefore, made a rich contribution to advances in haemostasis over the last 60 years, often in partnership with other groups across the world."

Several clinical trials evaluate investigational adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene transfer approaches for the treatment of hemophilia A and B. The practical application of these approaches is nuanced by differences in AAV serotypes, transgene modifications, manufacturing, dosing, administration, and approach to follow-up. This guide explores mechanisms of AAV gene transfer, identification of appropriate candidates for clinical trial participation, anticipated trial events that follow infusion of an investigational gene therapy including outcomes to be monitored, and future considerations. Patient-accessible infographic summaries of these topics are included to serve as potential visual aids that healthcare providers may choose to utilize or adapt to guide informed consultation. The fundamentals of AAV-mediated, liver-directed gene transfer for hemophilia are reviewed, to facilitate discussion between healthcare providers, patients, and their families and advocates if considering a trial of investigational gene therapy."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia is the most common X-linked bleeding disorder, affecting over 1 million individuals throughout the world. Patients are subclassified into mild, moderate and severe disease based on per cent factor activity level. Nearly, all patients with haemophilia develop haemophilic arthropathy (HA) by age 30 and HA is known to have a negative impact on physical health subscores in Haem-A-QOL, a validated quality of life scoring system for patients with haemophilia. Unfortunately, many patients progress to end-stage HA of the ankle, which is characterized by pain, contractures, decreased range of motion and muscle atrophy. Ankle arthrodesis (AAD) has been the standard of care in the definitive surgical management of end-stage HA of the ankle. While AAD is a safe surgical procedure known to improve HA-related pain, it decreases functional mobility and has been associated with secondary hindfoot arthritis as well as subtalar degeneration. In recent years, total ankle replacement (TAR) has emerged as an alternative surgical procedure that strives to improve functional mobility, pain and quality of life in end-stage HA of the ankle. However, the safety, durability, and efficacy of this procedure in these patients are unknown. In this review, we analyse the clinical studies investigating TAR in patients with end-stage HA of the ankle. We also discuss important considerations in the perioperative management of patients with haemophilia and compare the risks and benefits of AAD and TAR for patients with end-stage HA of the ankle."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A and B are hereditary coagulation disorders caused by functional and quantitative abnormalities of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in hemophilia A and coagulation factor IX (FIX) in hemophilia B. A definitive diagnosis is made through the measurement of FVIII or FIX activity and ruling out other pathological conditions or diseases with decreased FVIII or FIX activity. Severity is classified as severe, moderate, and mild according to factor activity level. Moreover, as frequency of hemorrhage and severity are usually correlated, severe patients have a high risk of intracranial hemorrhage during infancy as well as joint damage due to recurrent hemarthrosis. However, there are some non-severe patients who have symptoms like bleeding and joint damage. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the treatment strategy not only based on severity but also on bleeding symptoms. The treatment for hemophilia is mainly replacement therapy using clotting factor concentrates (standard or extended half-life), such as prophylaxis or on-demand therapy for bleeding. However, there are also clinical problems, such as venous access and development of inhibitors. Recently, a non-factor agent has emerged as a new treatment option. Thus, the management of hemophilia is on a turning point."

    "abstract": "Monitoring hemophilia treatment with extended half-life products is challenging for coagulation laboratories since factor assays may show substantial differences between results obtained with the one-stage assay (OSA) and the chromogenic substrate assay (CSA). The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare different factor assays and global coagulation methods. Factor VIII (FVIII) and IX (FIX) activities and global assay parameters were analyzed in pre- and postinfusion samples (5 patients 2 samples/product/method). Samples containing FVIII products (NovoEight, Elocta, and Nuwiq) gave higher levels when measured with CSA compared to OSA. The correlation was excellent (<i>r</i> <sup>2</sup> ≥ .97) while biases of 42%-72% of mean (CSA-OSA) were obtained. With FVIII (OSA) as independent variable, the correlations to kaolin clot time (CT) and thrombin generation assay (TGA) peak were modest (<i>r<sup>2</sup></i> = .71-.72 and .64-.65, respectively), except for Nuwiq for which there was a poor correlation to TGA peak (<i>r</i> <sup>2</sup> = .08). Samples containing Alprolix, a FIX product, gave a smaller difference between activity levels (CSA-OSA), and the correlation was excellent (<i>r</i> <sup>2</sup> = .96). With FIX (CSA) as independent variable for both Alprolix and Refixia, the correlations to Innovin CT and TGA peaks were weak (<i>r</i> <sup>2</sup> = .33-.45 and .44-.76, respectively). Our data show that factor activity assays differ between methods used and agents. These discrepancies indicate the value of having more than one type of assay available in the coagulation laboratory when monitoring hemophilia treatment with extended half-life products. Global assays gave complementary information indicated by the modest correlations to factor activities."

Paradigm 6 (Safety and Efficacy of Nonacog Beta Pegol [N9-GP] in Previously Untreated Patients With Haemophilia B) is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase 3 trial. Main inclusion criteria were males aged < 6 years, with hemophilia B with factor IX (FIX) activity ≤ 2%, who were previously untreated or with ≤ 3 exposure days (EDs) to FIX-containing products. Patients received N9-GP 40 IU/kg once weekly (prophylaxis) or individualized dosing (preprophylaxis). Bleeds were treated with N9-GP 40 IU/kg (80 IU/kg if severe). The primary end point was incidence of anti-FIX inhibitory antibodies (inhibitors). Secondary end points included safety outcomes and annualized bleeding rate (ABR). At data cutoff (August 31, 2018), 38 patients had been screened, and 37 had received N9-GP (median age, 1.0 years [range, 0-4]). Total in-trial EDs amounted to 2833, representing ~ 65 patient-years. Two (6.1%) of 33 \"at-risk\" patients (patients with ≥ 10 EDs plus patients who developed inhibitors) developed high-titer inhibitors and were withdrawn. No other safety concerns, including thromboembolic events, were identified. In the prophylaxis group (n = 28), 67.9% were bleed free; all bleeds (n = 15) were treated with one N9-GP injection; and overall, spontaneous, and traumatic ABRs were low (median ABRs of 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0, respectively; modeled mean ABRs of 0.31, 0.08, and 0.23, respectively). Estimated mean FIX trough activity was 15.0%. We report an inhibitor incidence of 6.1%, which is within the expected range for PUPs with hemophilia B.

Additionally, safety assessments for clinical adverse events and evaluations of laboratory test results were conducted. There was an increase in plasma factor IX antigen with daily subcutaneous dalcinonacog alfa. Bioavailability of subcutaneous dalcinonacog alfa was 10.3% in hemophilia B dogs. Daily subcutaneous dosing of dalcinonacog alfa demonstrated the effects of bioavailability, time to maximal concentration, and half-life by reaching a steady-state activity sufficient to correct severe hemophilia to normal, after four days.

Due to recessive inheritance, males are affected, while female carriers are usually asymptomatic with a wide range of factor VIII (FVIII) or IX (FIX) levels. Bleeding tendency in female carriers is extremely variable and may be associated with low clotting factor levels. This could be explained by F8 or F9 genetic variations, numerical or structural X chromosomal anomalies, or epigenetic variations such as irregular X chromosome inactivation (XCI). The aim of the study was to determine whether low FVIII or FIX coagulant activity in haemophilia carriers could be related to XCI and bleeding symptoms. HUMARA assay was performed on 73 symptomatic carriers with low clotting activity ≤50 IU/dL. Bleeding Assessment Tool (BAT) from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) was used to describe symptoms in the cohort of carriers. In 97% of haemophilia carriers, a specific gene variant in heterozygous state was found, which alone could not justify their low FVIII or FIX levels (≤50 IU/dL). A statistical association between XCI pattern and FVIII and FIX levels was observed. Moreover, female carriers with low coagulant activity (≤20 IU/dL) and high degree of XCI ( ≥ 80:20) had a higher ISTH-BAT score than the carriers with the opposite conditions (>20 IU/dL and <80:20). In our cohort of haemophilia carriers, XCI was significantly skewed, which may contribute to the low expression of clotting factor levels and bleeding symptoms."

This report focuses on 12-month interim analyses of safety, pharmacokinetic variables, effects on FIX activity, and immune responses for dosed participants. Eight adult male participants (aged 20-69 years; range FIX activity, 0.5% to 2.0%) received 1 of 3 BAX 335 IV doses: 2.0 × 1011; 1.0 × 1012; or 3.0 × 1012 vector genomes/kg.

No clinical thrombosis, inhibitors, or other FIX Padua-directed immunity was reported. FIX expression was measurable in 7 of 8 participants; peak FIX activity displayed dose dependence (32.0% to 58.5% in cohort 3). One participant achieved sustained therapeutic FIX activity of ∼20%, without bleeding or replacement therapy, for 4 years; in others, FIX activity was not sustained beyond 5 to 11 weeks. In contrast to some previous studies, corticosteroid treatment did not stabilize FIX activity loss. We hypothesize that the loss of transgene expression could have been caused by stimulation of innate immune responses, including CpG oligodeoxynucleotides introduced into the BAX 335 coding sequence by codon optimization.

A 7-year-old boy presented with HB with poor venous access and repetition infections using rFIX, which was switched to rFIX-FP. Prophylaxis was adjusted by PKs using WAPPS-Hemo tailoring from 100 IU/kg/week of rFIX to 80 IU/kg/3 weeks of rFIX-FP. Comparing 6 months before, rFIX-FP reduced 68.5% FIX consumption/kg and 58.3% infusion frequency, but total costs/weight showed a slight increase. Ratio of half-life between rFIX and rFIX-FP was 3.4-3.7. This case report revealed that switch to rFIX-FP decreased frequency and FIX consumption, without adverse events and bleeds."

    "abstract": "Except for data in the Korea Hemophilia Foundation Registry, little is known of the epidemiology of congenital bleeding disorders in Korea. Data were obtained from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database. From 2010 to 2015, there were 2,029 patients with congenital bleeding disorders in the Korean HIRA database: 38% (n = 775) of these patients had hemophilia A (HA), 25% (n = 517) had von Willebrand disease (vWD), 7% (n = 132) had hemophilia B (HB), and 25% (n = 513) had less common factor deficiencies. The estimated age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) of HA and HB was 1.78-3.15/100,000 and 0.31-0.51/100,000, respectively. That of vWD was 1.38-1.95/100,000. The estimated ASR of HA showed increase over time though the number of new patients did not increase. Most patients with congenital bleeding disorders were younger than 19 years old (47.8%), and most were registered in Gyeonggi (22.1%) and Seoul (19.2%). This is the first nationwide population-based study of congenital bleeding disorders in Korea. This study provides data that will enable more accurate estimations of patients with vWD. This information will help advance the comprehensive care of congenital bleeding disorders. We need to continue to obtain more detailed information on patients to improve the management of these diseases."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A and B are X-linked congenital bleeding disorders characterized by recurrent hemarthroses leading to specific changes in the synovium and cartilage, which finally result in the destruction of the joint: this process is called hemophilic arthropathy (HA). This review highlights the most prominent molecular biomarkers found in the literature to discuss their potential use in the clinical practice to monitor bleeding, to assess the progression of the HA and the effectiveness of treatments. A review of the literature was performed on PubMed and Embase, from 3 to 7 August 2020. Study selection and data extraction were achieved independently by two authors and the following inclusion criteria were determined a priori: English language, available full text and articles published in peer-reviewed journal. In addition, further articles were identified by checking the bibliography of relevant articles and searching for the studies cited in all the articles examined. Eligible studies obtained at the end of the search and screen process were seventy-three (73). Despite the surge of interest in the clinical use of biomarkers, current literature underlines the lack of their standardization and their potential use in the clinical practice preserving the role of physical examination and imaging in early diagnosis."

A cross-sectional, multicentre study covering MHA and MHB in Sweden, Finland and Norway. Arthropathy was evaluated by ultrasound (HEAD-US) and Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS). We report on 145 patients: median age 28 years (IQR 13-52) and 61% MHA. Baseline factor VIII/factor IX activity (FVIII/FIX:C) was 2 IU/dL (median) (IQR 2-4): lower for MHB (2 IU/dL, IQR 1-2) than MHA (3 IU/dL, IQR 2-4) (P < .01). Eighty-five per cent of MHA and 73% MHB had a history of haemarthrosis (P = .07). Age at first joint bleed was lower for MHA (5 years [median], IQR 3-7) than MHB (7 years, IQR 5-12) (P = .01). Thirty-eight per cent received prophylaxis, started at median 10 years of age (IQR 4-24). Median joint bleeds and serious other bleeds during the last 12 months were both zero (IQR 0-1). Total HEAD-US captured 0/48 points (median) (IQR 0-2) and HJHS 4/120 points (IQR 1-10) with strong correlation between them (r = .72). C ≤ 3 IU/dL was associated with higher HJHS (P = .04). Fifteen per cent had undergone orthopaedic surgery. The current joint health in Nordic moderate haemophilia patients was rather good, but a subgroup had severe arthropathy. C ≤ 3 IU/dL and MHA were associated with a more severe bleeding phenotype. We suggest primary prophylaxis to all patients with FVIII/FIX:C ≤ 3 IU/dL."

    "abstract": "In clinical trials, recombinant factor IX fusion protein (rFIXFc) has demonstrated safety, efficacy and prolonged activity with extended dosing intervals for treatment of haemophilia B. To assess the real-world clinical utility of rFIXFc in a variable patient population and routine clinical practice. A multicentre, retrospective chart review was conducted of patients with haemophilia B who had received rFIXFc prophylaxis or on-demand treatment for ≥6 months across six sites in the United States. Sixty-four eligible patients were identified who had a median (range) duration on rFIXFc of 2.7 (0.5-5.0) years. Of 32 patients on rFIXFc prophylaxis who switched from prophylaxis with another factor treatment (ie pre-rFIXFc) and had a known pre-rFIXFc dosing interval, the initial dosing interval was lengthened for 26 (81%) patients and maintained for the remaining 6 (19%) patients. Most (n = 48 [91%]) patients who received rFIXFc prophylaxis from the beginning to the end of the chart review period (n = 53) maintained or lengthened the dosing interval from first through last dose of rFIXFc. For patients receiving rFIXFc prophylaxis, there was an approximate 50% reduction in weekly factor consumption compared with pre-rFIXFc prophylaxis. Overall annualized bleed rates, annualized spontaneous bleed rates and annualized joint bleed rates decreased after switching to rFIXFc prophylaxis (n = 24 with bleed data). Compliance to recommended treatment improved or remained stable in most patients with available data (30/31). Recombinant factor IX fusion protein prophylaxis improved bleed control, reduced overall consumption, reduced frequency of infusion and improved compliance for patients with haemophilia B in a real-world setting."

    "title": "Serpins, New Therapeutic Targets for Hemophilia.",
    "abstract": "Hemostasis is a tightly regulated process characterized by a finely tuned balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant systems. Among inherited hemostatic conditions, hemophilia is one of the most well-known bleeding disorders. Hemophilia A (HA) and B (HB) are due to deficiencies in coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) or FIX, respectively, leading to unwanted bleeding. Until recently, hemophilia treatment has consisted of prophylactic replacement therapy using plasma-derived or recombinant FVIII in cases of HA or FIX in cases of HB. Because FVIII and FIX deficiencies lead to an imbalance between procoagulant and anticoagulant systems, a recent upcoming strategy implies blocking of endogenous anticoagulant proteins to compensate for the procoagulant factor deficit, thus restoring hemostatic equilibrium. Important physiological proteins of the anticoagulant pathways belong to the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) family and, recently, different experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that targeting natural serpins could decrease bleeding in hemophilia. Here, we aim to review the different, recent studies demonstrating that blocking serpins such as antithrombin, protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor, and protease nexin-1 or modifying a serpin like α1-antitrypsin could rebalance coagulation in hemophilia. Furthermore, we underline the potential therapeutic use of serpins for the treatment of hemophilia."

    "abstract": "Despite the many symptoms that women with inherited bleeding disorders experience, no study has specifically sought to explore and understand the lived experiences of these women, nor the barriers to care that they may encounter. The primary objective of this study was to describe the lived experiences of women with inherited bleeding disorders. Inclusion criteria for study enrollment were the following: age ≥18 years, English speaking, and confirmed diagnosis of an inherited bleeding disorder. Women were recruited across Canada through identification by treating health-care providers and study members of the Canadian Hemophilia Society. Telephone interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview style, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using descriptive thematic analysis. A total of 15 participants were interviewed. Median age was 31 years (24-70 years old). Four primary themes emerged: uncertainties surrounding diagnosis, conceptualization of experience through family bleeding, intensity of bleeding symptoms, and impact of bleeding on identity and daily life. To our knowledge, this is the first study to thoroughly describe the experiences of adult women living with inherited bleeding disorders. We found that these women experience multiple uncertainties around their diagnosis. They conceptualize their bleeding by examining family histories; experience severe symptoms irrespective of their underlying diagnosis; and create identities around their bleeding symptoms, which influence multiple aspects of their life. Next study steps will involve sharing work specifically focused on treatment plans, barriers to care, and factors affecting care access."

    "title": "A Preconditioning Strategy to Augment Retention and Engraftment Rate of Donor Cells During Hepatocyte Transplantation.",
    "abstract": "Hepatocyte transplantation has been extensively investigated as an alternative to orthotopic liver transplantation. However, its application in routine clinical practice has been restricted because of low initial engraftment and subsequent repopulation. Using mice as a model, we have developed a minimally invasive and nontoxic preconditioning strategy based on preadministration of antibodies against hepsin to increase donor hepatocyte retention and engraftment rate. Liver sinusoid diameters decreased significantly with antihepsin pretreatment, and graft cell numbers increased nearly 2-fold in the recipients' liver parenchyma for 20 days after hepatocyte transplantation. Postoperative complications such as hepatic ischemia injury or apparent immune cell accumulation were not observed in recipients. In a hemophilia B mouse model, antihepsin preconditioning enhanced the expression and clotting activity of coagulation factor IX (FIX) to nearly 2-fold that of immunoglobulin G-treated controls and maintained higher plasma FIX clotting activity relative to the prophylactic range for 50 days after hepatocyte transplantation. Antihepsin pretreatment combined with adeno-associated virus-transduced donor hepatocytes expressing human FIX-Triple, a hyperfunctional FIX variant, resulted in plasma FIX levels similar to those associated with mild hemophilia, which protected hemophilia B mice from major bleeding episodes for 50 days after transplantation. Furthermore, antihepsin pretreatment and repeated transplantation resulted in extending the therapeutic period by 30 days relative to the immunoglobulin G control. Thus, this antihepsin strategy improved the therapeutic effect of hepatocyte transplantation in mice with tremendous safety and minimal invasion. Taken together, we suggest that preconditioning with antihepsin may have clinical applications for liver cell therapy."

    "title": "Gene Therapy for Hemophilia: Facts and Quandaries in the 21st Century.",
    "abstract": "Therapy for hemophilia has evolved in the last 40 years from plasma-based concentrates to recombinant proteins and, more recently, to non-factor therapeutics. Along this same timeline, research in adeno-associated viral (AAV) based gene therapy vectors has provided the framework for early phase clinical trials initially for hemophilia B (HB) and now for hemophilia A. Successive lessons learned from early HB trials have paved the way for current advanced phase trials. Nevertheless, questions linger regarding 1) the optimal balance of vector dose to transgene expression, 2) amount and durability of transgene expression required, and 3) long-term safety. Some trials have demonstrated unique findings not seen previously regarding transient elevation of liver enzymes, immunogenicity of the vector capsid, and loss of transgene expression. This review will provide an update on the clinical AAV gene therapy trials in hemophilia and address the questions above. A thoughtful and rationally approached expansion of gene therapy to the clinics would certainly be a welcome addition to the arsenal of options for hemophilia therapy. Further, the global impact of gene therapy could be vastly improved by expanding eligibility to different patient populations and to developing nations. With the advances made to date, it is possible to envision a shift from the early goal of simply increasing life expectancy to a significant improvement in quality of life by reduction in spontaneous bleeding episodes and disease complications."

We conducted a retrospective cross section study of adult persons with hemophilia who were seen at a Utah hemophilia treatment center from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019. The electronic database PubMed was searched for studies with observation periods from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2019. The age-adjusted prevalence for overweight/obesity in the adult Utah hemophilia population was higher than the overall Utah population and the general US population. After adjusting for race and age, mild hemophilia was associated with a 7.7% higher BMI (95% confidence interval, 0.023-15.98%, P < 0.05). Review of the literature demonstrated high levels of overweight/obesity in hemophilia communities globally with considerable heterogeneity between studies. Despite increasing awareness, prevalence of overweight/obesity in the hemophilia population remains high in comparison with the general population. There is a critical need to address this issue acutely at hemophilia treatment centers due to the considerable burden of obesity."

The survey included information on demographic and clinical data, needs, concerns and experiences regarding medical care during COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 355 of the IBD-Group (200 patients, 155 caregivers) completed the survey (61.7% response rate). Most patients suffered from haemophilia A (73.8%) and were severely affected (64.7%). Eleven patients were in quarantine due to suspected COVID-19; none had symptoms. One quarter worried (very) strongly about getting the coronavirus, 71.3% asked themselves what will happen to them when they will get COVID-19, 40.1% felt unchanged, and 18.9% worried about delivery difficulties of their IBD treatment product. In 52.8%, medical appointments were postponed. Significant differences between caregivers and patients were found in most aspects. The IBD patients affected by a chronic disorder have particular thoughts and worries regarding COVID-19. Haemophilia specialists should be committed to address these concerns and guarantee treatment despite containment strategies."

    "abstract": "The current standard of care treatment for severe hemophilia A and B (SHA and SHB) is the prophylactic intravenous replacement of coagulation factor VIII or IX (FVIII/FIX) to prevent spontaneous bleeding. Persons with hemophilia without prophylactic treatment receive therapy in case of bleeding, i.e., on demand. To assess treatment patterns, utilization of products, and bleeding outcomes in a real-world cohort of persons with SHA and SHB, defined as FVIII or FIX activity < 1%, data was retrospectively collected from hemophilia-specific patient diaries used for home treatment, medical records, and entries into the Austrian Hemophilia Registry from the year 2012 to 2017. Fifty-three male persons with SHA (n = 47) and SHB (n = 6) were included; 26 with SHA and 5 with SHB were on prophylaxis, 8 and 1 switched therapy regimen, and 13 and 0 received on-demand therapy. Persons on prophylaxis used a mean factor FVIII or FIX dose of 71.7 and 40.1 IU/kg/week. Median (IQR) annualized bleeding rates (ABR) in SHA were 28.0 (23.4-31.3) in the on-demand, 4.9 (1.6-13.5) in the prophylaxis group, and 3.0 (2.0-6.8) in the prophylactic group of SHB. Three persons with SHA had zero bleeds during the observation period. On-demand therapy and hepatitis B and C were associated with higher ABR but not age, weight, and HIV positivity. Bleeding rates and the proportion of on-demand therapy in persons with hemophilia were high in our real-world cohort. Further improvement is needed, which might be facilitated with the advent of factor products with extended half-life or non-factor therapies."

The outcomes of PK parameters by TCM show that a higher number of FIX/time concentration points may not always give a better definition of the decay curve. On the other hand, the Terminal HL of NCA is deeply affected by the goodness of the last two-three points. The quite long Kedrion FIX HL may allow for a cost/effective tailoring of prophylaxis in haemophilia B patients."

Evidence suggests that primary prophylaxis (PPr) could reduce CHA incidence and its impact on quality of life. To evaluate the association between PPr and CHA in Colombian males with haemophilia B (HB) during 2015 to 2019. A panel-time analysis was performed with data provided by the National Health System to update a nationwide open cohort of people with congenital coagulopathies. The association was evaluated in a logistic random-effect regression model (LRERM), adjusted by age at diagnosis, prophylaxis dose and frequency, severity, haemarthrosis and high-titre inhibitors. During 2015-2019, a total of 362 men with HB and treated with either, primary, secondary or tertiary prophylaxis were identified. At baseline, CHA prevalence in the cohort was 36.84% (n = 133), median age was 19.0 years (IQR: 10.0-27.0), and median age at diagnosis was 1.0 year (IQR: 0.0-4.0). PPr was prescribed in 37.85% (n = 137), and median dose (IU/Kg/dose) was almost the same for primary vs. secondary/tertiary prophylaxis. Patients in PPr had a lower frequency of severe HB, CHA, haemarthrosis, infectious complications and high-titre inhibitors than those in secondary or tertiary prophylaxis (STPr). In the LRERM, PPr was associated with a significant reduction of 89.70% in the odds of CHA (aOR = 0.103, IC 95%: 0.040, 0.270; P < .001), compared with STPr. PPr decreased the odds of CHA by 89.70% in males with HB in Colombia. Our findings are consistent with previous studies and support the strategy to prescribe PPr to our patients."

    "title": "Evaluation of CDC's Hemophilia Surveillance Program - Universal Data Collection (1998-2011) and Community Counts (2011-2019), United States.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia is an X-linked genetic disorder that primarily affects males and results in deficiencies in blood-clotting proteins. Hemophilia A is a deficiency in factor VIII, and hemophilia B is a deficiency in factor IX. Approximately one in 5,000 males are born with hemophilia, and hemophilia A is about four times as common as hemophilia B. Both disorders are characterized by spontaneous internal bleeding and excessive bleeding after injuries or surgery. Hemophilia can lead to repeated bleeding into the joints and associated chronic joint disease, neurologic damage, damage to other organ systems, and death. Although no precise national U.S. prevalence estimates for hemophilia exist because of the difficulty identifying cases among persons who receive care from various types of health care providers, two previous state-based studies estimated hemophilia prevalence at 13.4 and 19.4 per 100,000 males. In addition, these studies showed that 67% and 82% of persons with hemophilia received care in a federally funded hemophilia treatment center (HTC), and 86% and 94% of those with the most severe cases of hemophilia (i.e., those with the lowest levels of clotting factor activity in the circulating blood) received care in a federally funded HTC. As of January 2020, the United States had 144 HTCs. 1998-2019. Surveillance for hemophilia, which is a complex, chronic condition, is challenging because of its low prevalence, the difficulty in ascertaining cases uniformly, and the challenges in routinely characterizing and tracking associated health complications. Over time, two systems involving many stakeholders have been used to conduct ongoing hemophilia surveillance. During 1998-2011, CDC and the HTCs collaborated to establish the Universal Data Collection (UDC) surveillance system. The purposes of the UDC surveillance system were to monitor human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and bloodborne viral hepatitis in persons with hemophilia, thereby tracking blood safety, and to track the prevalence of and trends in complications associated with hemophilia. HTC staff collected clinical data and blood specimens from UDC participants and submitted them to CDC. CDC tested specimens for viral hepatitis and HIV. In 2011, the UDC surveillance system was replaced by a new hemophilia surveillance system called Community Counts. CDC and the HTCs established Community Counts to expand laboratory testing and the collection of clinical data to better identify and track emerging health issues in persons with hemophilia. This report is the first comprehensive summary of CDC's hemophilia surveillance program, which comprises both UDC and Community Counts. Data generated from these surveillance systems have been used in the development of public health and clinical guidelines and practices to improve the safety of U.S. blood products and either prevent hemophilia-related complications or identify complications early. Several factors have played a role in the effectiveness of the UDC and Community Counts systems, including 1) a stable data collection design that was developed and is continually reviewed in close partnership with HTC regional leaders and providers to ensure surveillance activities are focused on maximizing the scientific and clinical impact; 2) flexibility to respond to emerging health priorities through periodic updates to data collection elements and special studies; 3) high data quality for many clinical indicators and state-of-the-art laboratory testing methods for hemophilia treatment product inhibitors (developed and refined in part based on CDC research); 4) timely data and specimen collection and submission, laboratory specimen testing, analysis, and reporting; and 5) the largest and most representative sample of persons with hemophilia in the United States and one of the largest and most comprehensive data collection systems on hemophilia worldwide. CDC has successfully developed, implemented, and maintained a surveillance system for hemophilia. The program can serve as an example of how to conduct surveillance for a complex chronic disease by involving stakeholders, improving and building new infrastructure, expanding data collection (e.g., new diagnostic assays), providing testing guidance, establishing a registry with specimen collection, and integrating laboratory findings in clinical practice for the individual patient. Hemophilia is associated with substantial lifelong morbidity, excess premature deaths, and extensive health care needs throughout life. Through monitoring data from Community Counts, CDC will continue to characterize the benefits and adverse events associated with existing or new hemophilia treatment products, thereby contributing to maximizing the health and longevity of persons with hemophilia."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B (HB) is an X-linked recessive inherited bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the F9 gene that lead to plasma factor IX deficiency. To identify the causative mutations in HB, a molecular analysis of HB pedigrees in China was performed. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and an in-house bioinformatics pipeline, 76 unrelated HB pedigrees were analyzed. The mutations identified were validated by comparison with the results of Sanger sequencing or Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification assays. The pathogenicity of the causative mutations was classified following the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. The mutation detection rate was 94.74% (72/76) using NGS. Of the 76 HB pedigrees analyzed, 59 causative variants were found in 72 pedigrees, with 38 (64.41%) missense mutations, 9 (15.25%) nonsense mutations, 2 (3.39%) splicing mutations, 5 (8.47%) small deletions, 4 (6.78%) large deletions, and 1 intronic mutation (1.69%). Of the 59 different F9 mutations, 10 were novel: c.190T>G, c.199G>T, c.290G>C, c.322T>A, c.350_351insACAATAATTCCTA, c.391+5delG, c.416G>T, c.618_627delAGCTGAAACC, c.863delA, and c.1024_1027delACGA. Of these 10 novel mutations, a mosaic mutation, c.199G>T(p.Glu67Ter), was identified in a sporadic HB pedigree. Using in-silico analysis, these novel variants were predicted to be disease-causing. However, no potentially causative mutations were found in the F9 coding sequences of the four remaining HB pedigrees. In addition, two HB pedigrees carrying additional F8/F9 mutations were discovered. The identification of these mutations enriches the spectrum of F9 mutations and provides further insights into the pathogenesis of HB in the Chinese population."

The study population included 85 patients transitioning from a phase 1/3 pivotal study (NCT01174446), a pediatric study (NCT01488994), and 30 newly recruited patients, naïve to nonacog gamma. Patients received nonacog gamma as prophylaxis treatment (standard, modified or PK-tailored) or on-demand, as determined by the investigator. Treatment was assessed for safety, immunogenicity, hemostatic efficacy and consumption. In this study, after ≥100 exposure days, nonacog gamma resulted in no treatment-related serious adverse events, and no patients developed inhibitory antibodies to FIX. Nonacog gamma was efficacious at controlling bleeding episodes, with an 89.1% overall hemostatic efficacy rating of excellent or good, and 56% of bleeds resolved with one infusion. The annualized bleeding rate was considerably lower during prophylactic treatment (median ABR of 1.3 in 108 patients) than during on-demand treatment (median ABR of 16.5 in 13 patients). These results show that in previously treated patients and nonacog gamma-naïve patients, long-term use of nonacog gamma had acceptable safety and tolerability, and was efficacious as a prophylactic treatment for the management of bleeding episodes.NCT01286779, EudraCT: 2010-022726-33."

The ECHANGE multicentre observational cohort study was conducted between January 2014 and February 2019 using the BERHLINGO database comprised of patients from seven French haemophilia centres. During the 5 years study period, a total of 104 haemophilia carriers and 119 neonates were included, representing 124 pregnancies and 117 deliveries. Thirty-five (30%) bleeding events were observed, most of them (83%) occurred during the postpartum period, and 37% were reported during the secondary postpartum. Neuraxial anaesthesia was not complicated by spinal haematoma. Three (2.5%) neonates experienced cerebral bleeding. Caesarean section was associated with an increased risk of maternal bleeding in primary and secondary postpartum periods. Basal factor level <0.4 IU/mL was also found to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding during secondary postpartum. In our cohort, bleeding events occurred in more than a third of haemophilia carriers mainly in the postpartum period, and a significant portion of this bleeding occurred during the secondary postpartum. Haemophilia carriers warrant specific attention during primary and secondary postpartum, in particular in case of caesarean section and low basal factor level. The ECHANGE study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03360149."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia (H) is frequently associated with a multifactorial reduction in bone mineral density (BDM), but little is known about possible differences between HA and HB according to their severity. To evaluate the association between low bone mineral density (BMD), 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and bone turnover markers in patients with HA and HB younger or older than 50 years. In 78 patients <50 years and 33 patients >50 years with severe (S) or moderate (M) HA and HB, BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine and then correlated to annual bleeding rate (ABR), World Federation of Haemophilia orthopaedic joint scale (WFH score), 25(OH)D concentrations, parathyroid hormone (PTH), amino-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (NTx), urinary pyridinolines, osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase. Overall, a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was diagnosed. In patients <50 years, low FN-BMD was significantly more frequent in HA than in HB, while PTH, pyridinolines, ABR and WFH score were associated with H type and severity. In patients >50 years, similarly low FN-BMD was observed in HA and HB, while ABR and WFH score were associated with H type and severity, being milder in HB. Low bone mass is a frequent comorbidity in haemophilic patients of all ages, apart from those with MHB. Clinical and laboratory assessments confirm a higher bone impairment and faster bone resorption in HA compared with HB. Looking at H type and severity, MHB seems to have a normal bone metabolism and a less severe disease."

We evaluated whether women with IBD have higher odds of PPH compared with those without, when controlled for mode of delivery with a control group of women without IBDs. The obstetric experiences and outcomes of all women with IBD delivering at a tertiary centre between 2008 and 2017, were compared with matched controls (1 : 1). Obstetric care was provided according to national guidelines to both women with IBD and controls. Primary PPH was defined as estimated blood loss at least 500 ml. There were 46 completed pregnancies in women with IBD: 16 haemophilia A carriers, eight haemophilia B carriers, eight factor XI deficiency patients and 14 von Willebrand disease patients (type 1 = 6; type 2 = 8). No peripartum haemostatic treatment was received by carriers of haemophilia A or B. There were 74 control pregnancies. Women with IBD had higher odds of primary PPH, in a model controlling for mode of anaesthesia (adjusted odds ratio 5.30, 95% confidence interval 1.02-27.59, P = 0.048). Carriers of haemophilia A had a higher, statistically nonsignificant, odds for primary PPH than controls (adjusted odds ratio 6.85, confidence interval 0.77-60.73, P = 0.084). An increase in primary PPH was observed in women with IBD, particularly in haemophilia A, despite management according to guidelines. These results warrant further investigation and consideration should be given as to which factor levels to target."

The prevention of early vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) of newborn by oral or parenteral administration of vitamin K has been well established. However, rarely, a newborn can present with bleeding manifestations even after routine vitamin K prophylaxis at birth. A 2-day-old healthy male baby presented with catastrophic pulmonary haemorrhage with severely deranged coagulation profile even after receiving vitamin K prophylaxis at birth. His presentation, initial laboratory findings and course in the hospital were very much in favour of haemophilia B, but follow-up factor IX level and clinical exome sequencing did not confirm it. However, protein induced in vitamin K absence-II was found to be raised just before the discharge, and we concluded this case as a rare presentation of classical VKDB."

To complete and confirm the QWBA study data by directly measuring rIX-FP protein and activity levels in tissues following intravenous (i.v.) administration to normal rats and FIX-deficient (hemophilia B) mice. After i.v. administration of rIX-FP at a dose of 2000 IU/kg, animals were euthanized at specific time points up to 72 hours postdosing. Subsequently, plasma and various tissues, which were selected based on the previous QWBA results, were harvested and analyzed for FIX antigen levels using an ELISA (both species) or an immunohistochemistry method (mice only), as well as for FIX activity levels (mice only) using a chromogenic assay. In rats, rIX-FP distributed extravascularly into all tissues analyzed (ie, liver, kidney, skin and knee) with peak antigen levels reached between 1 and 7 hours postdosing. In hemophilia B mice, rIX-FP tissue distribution was comparable to rats. FIX antigen levels correlated well with FIX activity readouts. Our results confirm QWBA data showing that rIX-FP distributes into relevant target tissues. Importantly, it was demonstrated that rIX-FP available in tissues retains its functional activity and can thus facilitate its therapeutic activity at sites of potential injury."

    "abstract": "The treatment of hemophilia, which has undergone many transformative changes over the past 60 years, is poised for yet another disruptive change: the use of gene therapy to produce functional cures in some persons with hemophilia A or B. The path toward achieving subnormal to normal levels of factor VIII and factor IX activity has not been straightforward and is littered with failures over these past 25 years. Through setbacks and iteration, adeno-associated virus (AAV) proved to be a useful vector to carry the factor VIII and IX transgenes; once cassettes were optimized and dose escalation proceeded, therapeutic levels of clotting factors were achieved by several groups. Because these transgenes produce fully active proteins, breakthrough bleeding and the use of exogenous clotting factors have nearly been eliminated for most clinical trial participants when they express a sufficient amount of protein. These first-generation gene therapies, which have initiated regulatory review, will decrease or eliminate the burden of hemophilia for many of the patients who are eligible to receive them. However, many are ineligible, including those who are seropositive or cross-reactive to multiple AAV serotypes, children, those with comorbid conditions, and those who live in countries where even the most basic plasma-derived clotting factors are not reliably available. Thus, although the first-generation gene therapies will have an important impact on the burden of hemophilia, many questions remain to be answered regarding safety, durability, and reliability as this technology advance progresses toward individuals worldwide with hemophilia."

    "abstract": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 loaded by vectors could induce high rates of specific site genome editing and correct disease-causing mutations. However, most monogenic genetic diseases such as hemophilia are caused by different mutations dispersed in one gene, instead of an accordant mutation. Vectors developed for correcting specific mutations may not be suited to different mutations at other positions. Site-specific gene addition provides an ideal solution for long-term, stable gene therapy. We have demonstrated SaCas9-mediated homology-directed factor IX (FIX) <i>in situ</i> targeting for sustained treatment of hemophilia B. In this study, we tested a more efficient dual adeno-associated virus (AAV) strategy with lower vector dose for liver-directed genome editing that enables CRISPR-Cas9-mediated site-specific integration of therapeutic transgene within the albumin gene, and we aimed to develop a more universal gene-targeting approach. We successfully achieved coagulation function in newborn and adult hemophilia B mice by a single injection of dual AAV vectors. FIX levels in treated mice persisted even after a two-thirds partial hepatectomy, indicating stable gene integration. Our results suggest that this CRISPR-Cas9-mediated site-specific gene integration in hepatocytes could transform into a common clinical therapeutic method for hemophilia B and other genetic diseases."

A FIX variants database reports 28 unique missense mutations in these regions that lead to FIX deficiency, but the underlying mechanism is known only for the mutations on R43 that interfere with propeptide cleavage. It remains unclear how other mutations result in FIX deficiency and why patients carrying the same mutation have different bleeding tendencies. Here, we modify a cell-based reporter assay to characterize the missense mutations in the signal peptide and propeptide of FIX. The results show that the level of secreted conformation-specific reporter (SCSR), which has a functional γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla) domain of FIX, decreases significantly in most mutations. The decreased SCSR level is consistent with FIX deficiency in hemophilia B patients. Moreover, we find that the decrease in the SCSR level is caused by several distinct mechanisms, including interfering with cotranslational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum, protein secretion, γ-carboxylation of the Gla domain, and cleavage of the signal peptide or propeptide. Importantly, our results also show that the SCSR levels of most signal peptide and propeptide mutations increase with vitamin K concentration, suggesting that the heterogeneity of bleeding tendencies may be related to vitamin K levels in the body. Thus, oral administration of vitamin K may alleviate the severity of bleeding tendencies in patients with missense mutations in the FIX signal peptide and propeptide regions."

The severe form is characterized by a factor level less than 0.01 international units (IU) per milliliter. The development of inhibitors in hemophilia is the main complication of treatment, because the presence of these antibodies, reduces or even nullifies the efficacy of replacement therapy, making it very difficult to control the bleeding. People with inhibitors continue to have significantly higher risks of morbidity and mortality, with considerable treatment costs. Given the wide 'off-label' use of rituximab for treating people with hemophilia and inhibitors, its efficacy and safety need to be evaluated. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. To assess the efficacy and safety of rituximab for treating inhibitors in people with inherited severe hemophilia A or B. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, complied from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books.

The research evidence available is from case reports and case series. Randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab for this condition. However, prior to the publication of any possible future randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis of case reports and case series may provide some evidence."

Circumcision is the most common procedure performed in the neonatal period, and guidelines to prevent bleeding complications from circumcision are lacking. Treatment protocols vary widely, and many centres treat patients with factor products for up to two weeks after circumcision. There is an unmet need for studies evaluating optimal factor replacement therapy around the time of circumcision in neonates with severe haemophilia. To determine the efficacy of a single dose of factor replacement before circumcision to prevent bleeding complications in neonates with severe haemophilia. We conducted a retrospective chart review of male infants born between January 2000 and June 2019. Male neonates with severe haemophilia diagnosed at the Iowa Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center (n = 22) and healthy newborn controls who underwent circumcision at the University of Iowa Hospitals were included. Data were collected from the electronic medical record. Neonates with severe haemophilia were separated into two groups-those pretreated with one dose of factor replacement before circumcision and those without pretreatment. We observed that neonates with severe haemophilia pretreated with a single dose of factor VIII or factor IX replacement had significantly reduced bleeding complications, shorter hospital stay and required less therapeutic intervention compared with untreated patients. Importantly, pretreated patients had outcomes similar to healthy controls. Our results demonstrate that a single dose of factor replacement before circumcision is effective to prevent bleeding in neonates with severe haemophilia."

However, the proportion of haemophilia population likely to benefit from gene therapy remains to be established. Achieving a phenotypic curative goal is presently hampered by: 1) availability of effective treatments (e.g. extended half-life products, non-factor therapies) that address major unmet needs in haemophilia; 2) key differences between hope and reality that patients undergoing gene therapy face (e.g. unknown risks and long-term follow-up, durability of the therapeutic effect, possibility of re-administering the vector), 3) lack of expertise of health care professionals (HCP) in managing/monitoring unexpected side effects in patients, and 4) lack of expertise of HCP in advising payers on key issues for cost-effectiveness analyses of gene therapy (e.g., eligibility criteria, predictability of response, unknown risks, long-term complications). There is also uncertainty about the possibility to absorb the cost of the \"one-time, one-dose cure\" by payers that are used to different payment models. An active partnership between regulators, payers, patients and health care professionals is key to identify patient sub-populations that might benefit the most from gene therapy, and to align the interests of patients (needing effective disease correction and improved quality of life) and pharma companies (reluctant to lose the profitability of lifelong repeated treatments). Educational programs will provide the healthcare chain with information on the strategy that is expected to transform morbidity and mortality patterns and how it should be regarded as part of the future therapeutic options in haemophilia."

The severity of bleeding and related complications is proportional to the amount of residual circulating functional factor. The development of a safe and effective hemophilia treatment lasted several decades and has been mainly based on clotting factor replacement. Advances in the engineering and manufacturing of clotting concentrates have led to the widespread availability of extended half-life products that reduced the number of intravenous infusions needed to achieve adequate trough levels. The recent development of new nonfactor replacement treatments and biotechnology techniques has offered therapeutic alternatives for hemophilia patients with and without inhibitors. These are characterized by an easier route of administration, low immunogenicity, and, regarding gene therapy and cell-based treatments, potential long-term protection from bleeding after a single treatment course.

At enrolment, 14 underwent the first PK assessment (PK I), and the second PK (PK II) assessment was performed after six months of treatment (5 on-demand and nine prophylaxis) at the end of the study. PK parameters were evaluated by Non-Compartmental Analysis (NCA), One-Compartment model (OCM), and Two-Compartment Model (TCM). Efficacy of Kedrion FIX in all 16 patients was evaluated by the number of bleeding events, and clinical response following the infusions. Periodic FIX inhibitor assays and thrombogenicity tests were scheduled throughout the study to assess the safety of the drug. As compared to the published data on PK of pdFIX, Kedrion FIX displayed a longer half-life (22.37-55.73 hrs), reduced clearance, and regular volume of distribution at PK I by both NCA and OCM. The comparison of outcomes of PK II with those of PK I by OCM, also showed significant changes, particularly in patients on prophylaxis, who showed some improved parameters of PK. Due to two outlier values at the end of the trial, the NCA parameters of PK I were not compared to those of PK II. Breakthrough bleeds were successfully treated with 1 or 2 infusions. No significant adverse events were observed during the study. During the six-month clinical study period, the use of Kedrion FIX resulted in a safe and effective pd-FIX concentrate with excellent PK characteristics."

    "abstract": "Treating patients with hemophilia and inhibitors is often problematic. The presence of inhibitors negatively impacts the effectiveness of treatment to achieve hemostasis especially in patients with hemophilia B, owing mainly to allergic reactions to factor IX (FIX) concentrates and the low success rate of immune tolerance therapy. A 9-month-old boy had intracranial hemorrhage and was diagnosed with hemophilia B. After replacement therapy, he developed inhibitors and an allergic reaction to FIX. Prophylactic therapy was initiated with recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) and later switched to pdFVIIa/factor X (FX; 120 μg/kg as the FVII dose, every other day) because of a recurrence of intracranial hemorrhage. Since then, he remained well without life-threatening bleeding for more than 2 years. Our case suggests that pdFVIIa/FX may be useful for prophylactic therapy in hemophilia B complicated by inhibitors and allergic reaction to FIX concentrates."

    "abstract": "The assembly of the enzyme-activated factor IX (FIXa) with its cofactor, activated factor VIII (FVIIIa) is a crucial event in the coagulation cascade. The absence or dysfunction of either enzyme or cofactor severely compromises hemostasis and causes hemophilia. FIXa is a notoriously inefficient enzyme that needs FVIIIa to drive its hemostatic potential, by a mechanism that has remained largely elusive to date. In this study, we employed hydrogen-deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to investigate how FIXa responds to assembly with FVIIIa in the presence of phospholipids. This revealed a complex pattern of changes that partially overlaps with those changes that occur upon occupation of the substrate-binding site by an active site-directed inhibitor. Among the changes driven by both cofactor and substrate, HDX-MS highlighted several surface loops that have been implicated in allosteric networks in related coagulation enzymes. Inspection of FVIIIa-specific changes indicated that 3 helices are involved in FIXa-FVIIIa assembly. These are part of a basic interface that is also known as exosite II. Mutagenesis of basic residues herein, followed by functional studies, identified this interface as an extended FVIIIa-interactive patch. HDX-MS was also applied to recombinant FIXa variants that are associated with severe hemophilia B. This revealed that single amino acid substitutions can silence the extended network of FVIIIa-driven allosteric changes. We conclude that HDX-MS has the potential to visualize the functional impact of disease-associated mutations on enzyme-cofactor complexes in the hemostatic system."

The purpose of this study is to quantify the financial impact of prophylaxis with rFIXFc vs. other approved rFIX and reimbursed for treatment of HB in Italy. The number of patients was estimated according to Italian epidemiological data and use of rFIX. Dose and frequency of administration used for weekly prophylaxis were those recommended in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), while clinical trials and literature data were used to calculate bleeding rates and management. Drug costs were calculated using regional ex-factory net prices. In the model, a reference scenario (Reference) vs. an alternative scenario (Alternative) were created to account for introduction of rFIXFc, estimating an increasing trend of the market share of rFIXFc in a 3-year timeframe. The analysis was developed in the perspective of the National Health Service and included healthcare costs related to rFIX for prophylaxis and resolution of bleeding events. The model estimated an overall cumulative expenditure (years 1-3) of €209,453,646 for the Reference and €207,465,568 for Alternative scenarios, with calculated cumulative savings of €1,988,068. The increasing use of rFIXFc as a substitute for other rFIX concentrates in the treatment of HB can represent a financially viable choice for the Italian National Health Service while ensuring effective control of bleeding."

    "title": "Development of a Clinical Candidate AAV3 Vector for Gene Therapy of Hemophilia B.",
    "abstract": "Although recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) and serotype 5 (AAV5) vectors have shown efficacy in Phase 1 clinical trials for gene therapy of hemophilia B, it has become increasingly clear that these serotypes are not optimal for transducing primary human hepatocytes. We have previously reported that among the 10 most commonly used AAV serotypes, AAV serotype 3 (AAV3) vectors are the most efficient in transducing primary human hepatocytes <i>in vitro</i> as well as in \"humanized\" mice <i>in vivo</i>, and suggested that AAV3 vectors expressing human coagulation factor IX (hFIX) may be a more efficient alternative for clinical gene therapy of hemophilia B. In the present study, we extended these findings to develop an AAV3 vector incorporating a compact yet powerful liver-directed promoter as well as optimized hFIX cDNA sequence inserted between two AAV3 inverted terminal repeats. When packaged into an AAV3 capsid, this vector yields therapeutic levels of hFIX in hemophilia B and in \"humanized\" mice <i>in vivo.</i> Together, these studies have resulted in an AAV3 vector predicted to achieve clinical efficacy at reduced vector doses, without the need for immune-suppression, for clinical gene therapy of hemophilia B."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy is an opportunity for haemophilia patients to receive a one-time treatment and have lasting factor levels for years or decades instead of dependence on repeated administration within short intervals and on sustained supply of drug. Great strides have been made in the development of gene therapy for haemophilia in the last decade. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated gene transfer in haemophilia A and B has entered the phase III trial stage. Gene transfer by lentiviral vector or gene editing technologies using factor VIII (FVIII) or IX (FIX) genes are now entering clinical evaluation. It is expected that the first FVIII and FIX gene therapy products will soon be approved and distributed in major markets. Global access to gene therapy is a critical goal. This review presents new and ongoing efforts towards this goal in countries other than North America and Europe. In Japan, researchers, regulators and funders have established a promising gene therapy development platform for multiple diseases including haemophilia. Decades of scientific and clinical research in haemophilia gene therapy in China have led to a recently registered clinical trial of AAV-mediated gene therapy for haemophilia B. Other countries are in earlier phases of building gene therapy programmes or participate in international trials. A phase 2 feasibility trial of AAV-mediated FIX gene therapy in low- and middle-income countries aims to demonstrate that gene therapy could become available in resource-constrained socio-economic settings. The different strategies for establishing gene therapy provide opportunities for closing the global gap in haemophilia care."

    "abstract": "Development of inhibitors in hemophilia A and B comprise significant challenge for patients, hematologists, and health provider systems. It has recommended by the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) to check inhibitors every 3-4 months. The incidence of inhibitor in hemophilia B is lower than hemophilia A. Here, it tried to unravel whether the detection of inhibitors in hemophilia B neglected compared to hemophilia A or not? A comprehensive review carried out using six international and local medical search engines on published contributions about inhibitors in hemophilia A and B in Iran. From 699 titles, 12 relevant papers were selected. The mean of factor VIII inhibitors in hemophilia A was 14.8%. The mean of factor IX inhibitors in hemophilia B was 6%. The minimum and maximum reported percentages of factor VIII inhibitors were 4% and 19.6%, while the minimum and maximum of reported percentages of factor IX inhibitors were 0% and 11.8%, respectively. The inhibitors in hemophilia A had reported in 6 papers. One paper had covered the inhibitors in hemophilia B. There were five papers on inhibitors in both hemophilia A and B. The comparison between the reported patients showed that 3020 patients with hemophilia A and 314 patients with hemophilia B had studied. Consistent with the lower frequency of hemophilia B and the lower development of inhibitors in hemophilia B compared to hemophilia A, it was concluded that hemophilia B had not neglected in Iran. It seems to be rational that each country, check rates of detection of inhibitors in hemophilia B to identify whether it has neglected or not."

    "abstract": "The development of inhibitory antibodies to therapeutic factor VIII (FVIII) in haemophilia A (HA) patients is the major complication in treatment/prevention of haemorrhages. The reasons some HA patients develop inhibitors while others do not remain unclear. This review briefly summarizes our understanding of anti-FVIII immune responses, the roles of T cells, both effector and regulatory, and generally discusses the interplay between FVIII and the immune system, both in factor replacement therapy and gene therapy, with some comparisons to factor IX and haemophilia B therapies. Notably, we propose that the prevailing observed active tolerance to FVIII in both HA and non-HA individuals rests to greater or lesser extents on peripherally induced immune tolerance. We also propose that the immune systems of inhibitor-negative HA patients do not merely ignore therapeutic FVIII, but rather have immunologically assessed and actively tolerized the patients to exogenous FVIII. Induction of such peripheral immune tolerance may further be triggered in HA patients who failed to tolerize upon initial FVIII exposure by 'appropriate' stimulation of their immune system, eg by immune tolerance induction therapy via intensive FVIII therapy, by oral administration of FVIII, by cellular therapies or by gene therapy directed to immuno-tolerogenic sites such as the liver."

Immune tolerance induction (ITI) therapy is an approach for eradication of inhibitors. Some ITI protocols are routinely in use for the eradication of inhibitors in patients with hemophilia. Moreover, such a therapeutic regimen may facilitate the tendency to reduced bone density in patients with inhibitor. This study scheduled to investigate whether that predisposing role of ITI protocols with an immunosuppressive agent has considered or not. By a literature review, published ITI protocols in hemophilia with inhibitors were evaluated. Among them, 51 papers found and studied thoroughly. None of them had performed the bone mineral examination in patients with hemophilia and inhibitor under treatment. Since there are 2 coexisting facilitating factors in these protocols, considering the bone mineral density study for patients with inhibitor who are undergoing ITI protocols with an immunosuppressive agent is recommended."

A Cochrane Library and PubMed (MEDLINE) search of studies related to iliopsoas hematomas in hemophilia was analyzed. Pain in the hip joint area and femoral nerve involvement in people with hemophilia should alert physicians to the likelihood of a hemorrhage of the iliopsoas muscle. Clinically, reduced hip range of motion and deficient motor and sensory function of the femoral nerve can be found. Imaging studies, such as ultrasonography (US), CT scan, and MRI will confirm the diagnosis. The first-line therapy for iliopsoas hematoma must be conservative (hematological treatment using high-dose replacement therapy until full resorption monitored by means of imaging studies). Related femoral nerve involvement typically resolves with conservative treatment (rehabilitation). Pelvic hemophilic pseudotumors can occur in patients with hemophilia due to recurrent iliopsoas muscle bleeding, often related to late diagnosis and poor hemostasis. Long-term clotting factor replacement is the pillar of the management of iliopsoas hematomas. Percutaneous US-guided aspiration of blood can be performed in hematomas of large size. However, the rate of failed aspirations and hematoma repetition is substantial (13%)."

Patients with mild, moderate, or severe hemophilia A or B, who were followed-up in our center between January 1999 and December 2018 were included in the study. A total of 470 PwH (391 Hemophilia A and 79 Hemophilia B) were followed in this time period. With a minimum 1 and maximum 20 years (median: 11.5 y) of the following time, 7 of 470 (1.48%) PwH were diagnosed with cancer. The diagnosed cancer types were acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, thyroid cancer, rectum cancer, malign melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and gastric cancer. All patients except patients with leukemia had major surgical intervention and the hemostasis control was provided on the basis of institutional protocols. At the end of the study, all of the patients were alive besides the patient with acute myeloid leukemia. Nowadays, the management of PwH has improved immensely and the life span has progressively become similar to healthy male individuals. For accurate improvement and standardizing care, prospective data collection on the epidemiology of cancer in PwH is an important tool."

The success of AAV gene transfer highlights the need to answer outstanding clinical questions of safety, durability, and the nature of the human immune response to AAV vectors. Here, we present longitudinal follow-up data of subjects who participated in the first trial of a systemically delivered AAV vector. Adult males (n = 7) with severe hemophilia B received an AAV2 vector at doses ranging from 8 × 10<sup>10</sup> to 2 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg/kg to target hepatocyte-specific expression of coagulation factor IX; a subset (n = 4) was followed for 12-15 years post-vector administration. No major safety concerns were observed. There was no evidence of sustained hepatic toxicity or development of hepatocellular carcinoma as assessed by liver transaminase values, serum α-fetoprotein, and liver ultrasound. Subjects demonstrated persistent, increased AAV neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to the infused AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) as well as all other AAV serotypes tested (AAV5 and AAV8) for the duration of follow-up. These data represent the longest available longitudinal follow-up data of subjects who received intravascular AAV and support the preliminary safety of intravascular AAV administration at the doses tested in adults. Data demonstrate, for the first time, the persistence of high-titer, multi-serotype cross-reactive AAV NAbs for up to 15 years post- AAV vector administration. Our observations are broadly applicable to the development of AAV-mediated gene therapy."

Annual male haemophilia mortality data was extracted from the public multiple-cause-of-death databases of the Mortality Information System, searching deaths included in rubrics D66 \"hereditary factor VIII deficiency\" (haemophilia A), and D67 \"hereditary factor IX deficiency\" (Haemophilia B) of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, and processed by the Multiple Cause Tabulator. In Brazil, from 1999 to 2016, a total of 927 male deaths related to haemophilia occurred during the 18 year period, of which 418 (45,1 %) as underlying cause, and 509 (54,9 %) as associated cause of death. The leading associated cause of 418 deaths of haemophilia as underlying cause was hemorrhage (52.6%), half of which intracranial hemorrhage. Infectious and parasitic diseases accounted for 40,5% as the underlying causes of 509 deaths where haemophilia was an associated cause, where human immunodeficiency virus disease prevailed, however falling from 37,0% to 19.7%, and viral hepatitis increased from 6.0% to 7.9%; diseases of the circulatory system, increased from 13.5% to 18.4%, including intracranial hemorrhage from 5.7% to 7.0%, and neoplasms, from 8,5% to 13.2%, respectively from 1999-2007 to 2008-2016, followed as main underlying causes.

To evaluate patient adherence to prophylaxis regimens with a long-acting recombinant factor IX (rIX-FP; IDELVION<sup>®</sup> ) in clinical studies and real-world practice. In two phase 3 clinical studies, patients with haemophilia B (FIX ≤2%) recorded their dose, dosing frequency and rIX-FP consumption in an e-diary. Adherence to prescribed prophylaxis regimens was assessed in all patients and to prescribed dose in patients ≥12 years only. Additionally, adherence to rIX-FP prophylaxis regimens in real-world practice was captured. In clinical studies, 94.9% (n = 56/59) of patients ≥12 years and 100% (n = 27) of paediatric patients received ≥80% of the expected number of infusions for their assigned prophylaxis schedule. Overall, mean adherence rate was 95.5% across all prophylaxis regimens in patients ≥12 years and 97.9% with a 7-day regimen in paediatric patients. In patients ≥12 years, 85.7% (n = 54/63) were dose adherent, defined as receiving within 10% of their prescribed dose ≥80% of the time. In real-world practice, adherence was observed in 100% (n = 14 and n = 15, respectively) of patients in two haemophilia treatment centres and 57.1% (n = 4/7) of patients in a third centre; non-adherence (n = 3/7) was linked to insurance-related and parental issues. In clinical studies, patients with haemophilia B had high adherence rates to rIX-FP prophylaxis regimens with a variety of dosing intervals, enabling them to achieve very low bleeding rates. High adherence may also be achievable in real-world practice."

For clinical outcome evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, Foot Function Index (FFI), and range of motion (ROM) were analyzed. Postoperative clinical and radiological complications were also analyzed. The mean duration of follow-up was 6.8 ± 3.0 years. The mean age was 44.1 ± 9.9 years. The VAS for pain was significantly improved from 5.5 ± 2.3 to 0.9 ± 1.2 (<i>P</i> < .001). The FFI scale was significantly improved from 61.6% ± 15.5% to 16.6% ± 15.4% (<i>P</i> < .001). In FFI disability and activity subscales, the TAA group exhibited meaningful outcomes relative to those of the AA group (<i>P</i> = .012 and .036, respectively). The total ROM in the TAA group changed from 30.8 ± 12.6 degrees to 37.3 ± 12.8 degrees at final follow-up (<i>P</i> = .090). Three cases of osteolysis and 1 case of heterotopic ossification were noted in the TAA group. No cases of nonunion were noted in the AA group. Progressive arthrosis of adjacent joints after AA was observed in 1 case. Both TAA and AA in ESHAA exhibited significant improvement in pain based on VAS and FFI scales. Compared to AA, TAA resulted in superior outcomes in FFI disability and activity subscales, suggesting that TAA may be considered as a surgical option alongside AA for ESHAA.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of progressive moderate-to-vigorous intensity elastic resistance training on physical function and pain in this patient population. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a university laboratory setting where 20 patients (17 with severe, 1 with moderate, and 2 with mild hemophilia) aged 21 to 53 years received evaluations at baseline and 8-week follow-up. Participants were allocated to intervention (progressive strength training) or control (usual daily activities) groups. The intervention group trained 2 days per week during 8 weeks with elastic resistance. Intensity during the first 2 weeks was a 20-repetition maximum and increased progressively toward 15, 12, and finally 10 repetition maximum. The primary outcome was muscle strength. Secondary outcomes were the Timed \"Up and Go\" Test score, sit-to-stand, range of motion, Haemophilia Joint Health Score, kinesiophobia score, global impression of pain change, general self-rated health status, and desire to exercise. The intervention group showed greater strength improvements than the control group in almost all of the joints, with moderate to high effect sizes. The intervention group also showed better Timed \"Up and Go\" and sit-to-stand scores than the control group (moderate effect size), greater range of motion at the knee flexion with the right leg (trivial effect size), and better Haemophilia Joint Health Score at the left knee (small effect size). The intervention group showed greater overall pain reduction, self-rated overall status, and desire to exercise than the control group. Progressive strength training with elastic resistance performed twice a week during 8 weeks is safe and effective in people with hemophilia to improve muscle strength and functional capacity, reduce general pain, and improve self-rated health status and desire to exercise. This study provides evidence for the use of a specific strength training regimen for people with hemophilia. People with hemophilia of differing levels of severity, with adequate coverage with clotting factor, can safely engage in progressive strength training and can improve their functioning."

The patient was a 61-year-old Japanese man with HCV cirrhosis complicated with HIV coinfection through contaminated blood product for hemophilia B at age 1 year. The patient's liver disease was classified as Child-Pugh C, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score 38. He had been on hemodialysis for 6 years, but HIV RNA and HCV RNA had been undetectable after appropriate antiviral therapies. In September 2019, the patient underwent successful deceased donor (DD) SLK. The donor was a man in his 60s deceased due to cerebral hemorrhage. Regular DD liver transplantation was performed using the piggyback technique with a full-sized liver graft. Cold ischemia time was 566 min, and the graft liver weighed 1154 g. The graft kidney was transplanted extraperitoneally in the right iliac fossa. The administration of clotting factor IX was discontinued on day 3. The immunosuppressive regimen was based on intravenous induction with 2 mg/kg of basiliximab and 1 g methylprednisolone and subsequent oral administration of mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone, followed by low-dose tacrolimus after 1 week for kidney-sparing purpose. Steroid therapy was gradually discontinued at 3 months after SLK. The same pretransplantation antiretroviral therapy (ART; tenofovir and dolutegravir) was introduced after 3 days when the CD4 cell count was more than 300/μL and HIV RNA was within an undetectable range. The postoperative course was uneventful without infectious complication, and the patient was transferred to a referral hospital on day 90 and discharged home on day 111. Strategic surgical planning and meticulous pre- and post-transplant management of ART and clotting factors could lead to the success of SLK."

The PK characteristics, efficacy, and safety of the new rFVIII and rFIX concentrates and of non-replacement therapy, are reported in detail in the published clinical trials. Outstanding improvements of rFIX concentrates' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have allowed to reduce the bleedings in hemophilia B patients, in order to increase their adherence to prophylaxis and quality of life. Less significant are the effects of pegylation or Fc fusion on the pharmacokinetics of the new rFVIII concentrates. The new non-replacement therapy is achieving the favor of many treaters and patients, in particular those with Factor VIII inhibitors. Great attention must be paid to the dangerous synergy of APCC and emicizumab, responsible for some fatal events during the clinical trials and compassionate use of this drug.

In this study, we aimed to enhance platelet-FIX expression in FIX<sup>null</sup> mice with O<sup>6</sup> -methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT)-mediated in vivo drug selection of transduced cells under nonmyeloablative preconditioning. We constructed a novel lentiviral vector (2bF9/MGMT lentivirus vector), which harbors dual genes, the FIX gene driven by the αIIb promoter (2bF9) and the MGMT P140K gene under the murine stem cell virus promoter. Platelet-FIX expression in FIX<sup>null</sup> mice was introduced by 2bF9/MGMT-mediated hematopoietic stem cell transduction and transplantation. The 2bF9/MGMT-transduced cells were effectively enriched after drug selection by O<sup>6</sup> -benzylguanine/1,3-bis-2-chloroethyl-1-nitrosourea. There were a 2.9-fold higher FIX antigen and a 3.7-fold higher FIX activity in platelets, respectively, posttreatment compared with pretreatment. When a 6-hr tail bleeding test was used to grade the bleeding phenotype, the clotting time in treated animals was 2.6 ± 0.5 hr. In contrast, none of the FIX<sup>null</sup> control mice were able to clot within 6 hr. Notably, none of the recipients developed anti-FIX antibodies after gene therapy. One of four recipients developed a low titer of inhibitors when challenged with rhF9 together with adjuvant.

    "abstract": "Fusion proteins, which consist of factor VIII or factor IX and the transmucosal carrier cholera toxin subunit B, expressed in chloroplasts and bioencapsulated within plant cells, initiate tolerogenic immune responses in the intestine when administered orally. This approach induces regulatory T cells (Treg), which suppress inhibitory antibody formation directed at hemophilia proteins induced by intravenous replacement therapy in hemophilia A and B mice. Further analyses of Treg CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte sub-populations in hemophilia B mice reveal a marked increase in the frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>-</sup>FoxP3<sup>-</sup>LAP<sup>+</sup> T cells (but not of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T cells) in the lamina propria of the small but not large intestine. The adoptive transfer of very small numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>-</sup>LAP<sup>+</sup> Treg isolated from the spleen of tolerized mice was superior in suppression of antibodies directed against FIX when compared to CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells. Thus, tolerance induction by oral delivery of antigens bioencapsulated in plant cells occurs via the unique immune system of the small intestine, and suppression of antibody formation is primarily carried out by induced latency-associated peptide (LAP) expressing Treg that likely migrate to the spleen. Tolerogenic antigen presentation in the small intestine requires partial enzymatic degradation of plant cell wall by commensal bacteria in order to release the antigen. Microbiome analysis of hemophilia B mice showed marked differences between small and large intestine. Remarkably, bacterial species known to produce a broad spectrum of enzymes involved in degradation of plant cell wall components were found in the small intestine, in particular in the duodenum. These were highly distinct from populations of cell wall degrading bacteria found in the large intestine. Therefore, FIX antigen presentation and Treg induction by the immune system of the small intestine relies on activity of a distinct microbiome that can potentially be augmented to further enhance this approach."

    "abstract": "Following injury, a fibrin-rich provisional matrix is formed to stem blood loss and provide a scaffold for infiltrating cells, which rebuild the damaged tissue. Defects in fibrin network formation contribute to impaired healing outcomes, as evidenced in hemophilia. Platelet-fibrin interactions greatly influence fibrin network structure via clot contraction, which increases fibrin density over time. Previously developed hemostatic platelet-like particles (PLPs) are capable of mimicking platelet functions including binding to fibrin fibers, augmenting clotting, and inducing clot retraction. In this study, we aimed to apply PLPs within a plasma-based in vitro hemophilia B model of deficient fibrin network structure to determine the ability of PLPs to improve fibrin structure and wound healing responses within hemophilia-like abnormal fibrin network formation. PLP impact on structurally deficient clot networks was assessed via confocal microscopy, a micropost deflection model, atomic force microscopy and an in vitro wound healing model of early cell migration within a provisional fibrin matrix. PLPs improved clot network density, force generation, and stiffness, and promoted fibroblast migration within an in vitro model of early wound healing under hemophilic conditions, indicating that PLPs could provide a biomimetic platform for improving wound healing events in disease conditions that cause deficient fibrin network formation."

No inhibitors were observed (0 per 1000 subject-years; 95% confidence interval, 0-8.9) and the overall rFIXFc safety profile was consistent with prior studies. Annualized bleed rates remained low and extended-dosing intervals were maintained for most subjects. Median dosing interval for the IP group was approximately 14 days for adults and adolescents (n = 31) and 10 days for paediatric subjects (n = 5). B-YOND results confirm the long-term (up to 5 years, with cumulative duration up to 6.5 years) well-characterized safety and efficacy of rFIXFc treatment for haemophilia B."

    "title": "Attenuation of Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycan Binding Enhances <i>In Vivo</i> Transduction of Human Primary Hepatocytes with AAV2.",
    "abstract": "Use of the prototypical adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) capsid delivered unexpectedly modest efficacy in an early liver-targeted gene therapy trial for hemophilia B. This result is consistent with subsequent data generated in chimeric mouse-human livers showing that the AAV2 capsid transduces primary human hepatocytes <i>in vivo</i> with low efficiency. In contrast, novel variants generated by directed evolution in the same model, such as AAV-NP59, transduce primary human hepatocytes with high efficiency. While these empirical data have immense translational implications, the mechanisms underpinning this enhanced AAV capsid transduction performance in primary human hepatocytes are yet to be fully elucidated. Remarkably, AAV-NP59 differs from the prototypical AAV2 capsid by only 11 aa and can serve as a tool to study the correlation between capsid sequence/structure and vector function. Using two orthogonal vectorological approaches, we have determined that just 2 of the 11 changes present in AAV-NP59 (T503A and N596D) account for the enhanced transduction performance of this capsid variant in primary human hepatocytes <i>in vivo</i>, an effect that we have associated with attenuation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) binding affinity. In support of this hypothesis, we have identified, using directed evolution, two additional single amino acid substitution AAV2 variants, N496D and N582S, which are highly functional <i>in vivo</i>. Both substitution mutations reduce AAV2's affinity for HSPG. Finally, we have modulated the ability of AAV8, a highly murine-hepatotropic serotype, to interact with HSPG. The results support our hypothesis that enhanced HSPG binding can negatively affect the <i>in vivo</i> function of otherwise strongly hepatotropic variants and that modulation of the interaction with HSPG is critical to ensure maximum efficiency <i>in vivo</i>. The insights gained through this study can have powerful implications for studies into AAV biology and capsid development for preclinical and clinical applications targeting liver and other organs."

    "title": "Laboratory issues in gene therapy and emicizumab.",
    "abstract": "The treatment options for the haemostatic disorders, haemophilia A and haemophilia B, have progressed rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX) concentrates to replace these missing clotting factors highlighted discordance between one-stage activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)-based clotting factor assays and chromogenic factor assays with some products. This raised awareness of the importance of investigation of potential reagent or assay differences by pharmaceutical companies. In 2017, the FVIII mimetic, emicizumab, was approved as a prophylactic treatment for haemophilia A patients with anti-FVIII inhibitors. The mechanism of action of emicizumab causes interference with some commonly used haemostasis tests including the APTT and its associated one-stage APTT-based clotting assays. Chromogenic assays may also be affected but this is dependent on the particular constituents of the reagents. Chromogenic assays containing human factor IXa (FIXa) and factor X (FX) are sensitive to the presence of emicizumab but those containing bovine FIXa and FX are unaffected. Many haemostasis laboratories have been required to evaluate new assays to enable accurate monitoring of emicizumab in patient plasma. A number of gene therapy approaches have been trialled in both haemophilia A and haemophilia B but there are scant data published on the measurement of FVIII and FIX in these patients and whether there are discrepancies between reagents or assay methodologies."

    "abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> In hemophilia A the presence of non-neutralizing antibodies (NNAs) against Factor VIII (FVIII) may predict the development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) and accelerate the clearance of administrated FVIII concentrates. This systematic review aimed to assess: (1) the prevalence and incidence of NNAs in patients with congenital hemophilia without inhibitors and (2) the association between NNAs and patient and treatment characteristics. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a search in MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane database. We included cross-sectional and longitudinal studies reporting on NNAs in patients with hemophilia A and B, who were inhibitor-negative at the start of the observation period. Data were extracted on: hemophilia type and severity, patient and treatment characteristics, NNA prevalence and incidence, NNA assays and inhibitor development. Two independent reviewers performed study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment, using adapted criteria of the Joanna Briggs Institute. Studies were classified as high-quality when ≥5/9 criteria were met. NNA assays were classified as high-quality when both quality criteria were met: (1) use of positive controls and (2) competition with FVIII to establish FVIII-specificity. We reported NNA prevalence and incidence for each study. The pooled NNA prevalence was assessed for well-designed studies in previously treated patients, employing high-quality NNA assays. <b>Results:</b> We included data from 2,723 inhibitor-negative patients with hemophilia A, derived from 28 studies. Most studies were cross-sectional (19/28) and none reported on NNAs in hemophilia B. Study design was of high quality in 16/28 studies and the NNA assay quality was high in 9/28 studies. Various NNA assays were used, predominantly ELISA (18/28) with different cut-off values. We found a large variety in NNA prevalence (Range, 0-100%). The pooled NNA prevalence in high-quality studies was 25% (95% CI, 16-38%). The incidence of new NNA development was reported in one study (0.01 NNA per person-exposure day). <b>Conclusion:</b> This systematic review identified studies that were heterogeneous in study design, patient population and NNA assay type, with NNA prevalence ranging from 0 to 100% in inhibitor-negative patients with hemophilia A. The pooled NNA prevalence was 25% in high-quality studies including only previously treated patients and performing high-quality NNA assays."

    "title": "Pharmacokinetics for haemophilia treaters: Meaning of PK parameters, interpretation pitfalls, and use in the clinic.",
    "abstract": "Replacement therapy with concentrates of factor VIII or IX remains the gold standard for severe haemophilia management. The recent development of clotting factor products with extended half-life, widely available on the market since 2 years, facilitates adherence, improves considerably the patients' quality of life, and simplifies the management of breakthrough bleedings or surgery. These molecules have also brought to the limelight the concepts of optimization and personalization of anti-haemophilic prophylaxis. Pharmacokinetics (PK) is one of the tools that can help haematologists to adapt in a more objective and precise manner the prophylaxis regimen to each individual patient's specific needs. For many years, clinicians at haemophilia centres have been using some simple PK parameters, such as recovery and residual level. However, recently, they have been confronted with an important number of new PK parameters they were not familiar with, but that can be used to improve patient management. Due to the accumulation of PK data and their relative complexity, it is now necessary to analyse the relevance of the different PK parameters relative to haemophilia specificities, and also to know their limits to better use them."

    "abstract": "Inherited bleeding disorders are not uncommon in pediatric practice: most of them being chronic, require lifelong replacement therapy. To frame a management policy, it is essential to assess the load and pattern of bleeding disorders in the local population. However, there is paucity of data reporting the clinical spectrum of coagulation and platelet function disorders in Indian children. Hence to find out the exact burden and clinico-investigational profile of these patients we conducted this study. In this retrospective case review, detailed clinical information was extracted from case records in 426 children with a suspected diagnosis of hereditary bleeding disorder registered in the Pediatric Hematology clinic of a tertiary referral centre over a period of 14 years (1998-2011) and pooled for analysis. In our cohort prevalence of hemophilia A, hemophilia B, platelet function disorders, von Willebrand disease and other rare factor deficiencies were 72%, 11%, 7%, 4% and 4% respectively. Common clinical spectrum included skin bleeds, arthropathy, mucosal bleeds. 10% had deeper tissue bleeding and 16% received replacement therapy at the first visit. Nearly 3/4th of cases were lost for follow up after the initial visit. Hemophilia A was the commonest inherited bleeding disorder in our population. Skin bleeds and arthropathy were common clinical presentations. Factor replacement therapy was restricted to a minority. There is an urgent need for establishing centres of excellence with administrative commitment for factor replacement therapy for comprehensive management of such children in resource-limited countries."

    "abstract": "The time-dependent nature of factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitors is well described, and the standard FVIII Bethesda assay used to measure inhibitors incorporates a 2-hour incubation. Despite case reports and reviews describing the immediate-acting nature of factor IX (FIX) inhibitors, many coagulation laboratories continue to use a traditional prolonged incubation for FIX Bethesda assays. To our knowledge, a comprehensive evaluation of the FIX Bethesda assay without incubation has not been reported. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of a rapid FIX Bethesda (ie no incubation) compared with the standard Bethesda assay (2-hour incubation). The analysis used a Bethesda assay configured for either immediate testing or a 2-hour incubation. Samples from 14 haemophilia B patients with inhibitors and 9 non-human controls were tested. The two assays yielded similar performance overall. The average per cent difference in inhibitor titre between the rapid and standard FIX Bethesda assay was -3% (range -15% to +13%; P = .175) for patient samples and -2% (range -17% to +14%; P = .376) for controls. The rapid Bethesda assay showed good agreement with the standard Bethesda assay for determination of inhibitor levels in patients with severe haemophilia B. The rapid assay allows for faster assessment of inhibitors in patients with severe haemophilia B and has the potential to improve the ability of the coagulation laboratory to perform testing from a logistical viewpoint. Further studies involving larger numbers of patients would be important to confirm our findings."

    "abstract": "Clotting factor replacement forms the pillar of treatment for children with hemophilia. Most children can be treated using peripheral venipuncture, but very young children and children with poor venous access might require a central venous catheter. Short-term and long-term complications of implantable venous access device placement (also known as port placement) can result in important morbidity and mortality in children with hemophilia. The purpose of this study is to describe our experience with port placement in children and adolescents with severe hemophilia (<1% of the Factors VIII or IX). We performed a retrospective review over a 10-year period to identify port placement in pediatric patients with severe hemophilia. We reviewed demographic and procedural information, access frequency, mechanical complications, and central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). Eighteen males were included, with median age at insertion of 3.9 years (0.7-22.7 years). Fifteen of the 18 patients had hemophilia Type A and 3/18 had Type B. Thirteen had high neutralizing inhibitor titers. Technical success in port placement was achieved in 26/27 (96.3%) patients, with 1 port failure caused by venous occlusion from prior catheter placement. Port catheter size ranged from 5 French (Fr) to 7.5 Fr. All were single-lumen and placed via right (76.9%) or left (23.1%) internal jugular vein; 59.3% were placed during general anesthesia, and all had factor replacement prophylaxis. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was placed concurrently in 69.2% of the cases; per hospital policy, the port was only accessed 15 days post-placement to reduce the risk of site hematoma. Two patients were lost to follow-up. The total catheter days was 15,893. Ports were removed in 14/24 cases, most commonly because of CLABSI (7/24; 29.2%) and transition to peripheral infusion (3/24; 12.5%). Bleeding was the most common complication in the first 30 days after placement. There were nine CLABSI events (0.57 per 1,000 catheter days), all in patients with high neutralizing inhibitor titers. A higher frequency of port access (more or equal to daily vs. less than daily) correlated with higher infection rates (P=0.02). Median time from port insertion to first infection was 348 days (range 167-1,055 days). There were four fibrin-sheath-related catheter occlusions (0.25 per 1,000 catheter days): three catheters were salvaged with intra-catheter tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) instillation resulting in a salvage of an additional 1,214 catheter days, and one catheter was removed after tPA failure (0.06 per 1,000 catheter days). Port maintenance in boys with severe hemophilia is challenging given the need for long-term frequent device access that is associated with catheter-related infections. The rate of bleeding or infection did not differ in patients whether the device was accessed immediately or 15 days post placement. With appropriate pre- and post-procedural factor replacement, immediate and early term severe complications are not common."

We present our experience with hemophilia patients who underwent cardiac surgery in our Medical Center between 2004 and 2019. All hemophilia patients who underwent cardiac surgery were identified, and their peri-operative data evaluated retrospectively. Ten patients were identified: six with hemophilia-A, one with hemophilia-B, and three with hemophilia-C (factor XI deficiency). Cardiac procedures included ten coronary artery bypass grafts and one aortic valve replacement. Hemophilia-A and B patients were treated with factor substitution, whereas patients with factor XI deficiency were treated with fresh frozen plasma. One patient died, and one patient suffered from non-active gastrointestinal bleeding. While major cardiac surgery can be performed safely on patients with hemophilia, a multidisciplinary team approach and strict postoperative monitoring are essential in order to achieve optimal results."

    "abstract": "Human Factor IX is a highly post-translationally modified protein that is an important clotting factor in the blood coagulation cascade. Functional deficiencies in Factor IX result in the bleeding disorder haemophilia B, which is treated with plasma-derived or recombinant Factor IX concentrates. Here, we investigated the post-translational modifications of human serum-derived Factor IX and report previously undescribed O-linked monosaccharide compositions at serine 141 and a novel site of glycosylation. At serine 141 we observed two monosaccharide compositions, with HexNAc<sub>1</sub>Hex<sub>1</sub>NeuAc<sub>2</sub> dominant and a low level of HexNAc<sub>1</sub>Hex<sub>1</sub>NeuAc<sub>1</sub>. This O-linked site lies N-terminal to the first cleavage site for the activation peptide, an important region of the protein that is removed to activate Factor IX. The novel site is an N-linked site in the serine protease domain with low occupancy in a non-canonical consensus motif at asparagine 258, observed with a HexNAc<sub>4</sub>Hex<sub>5</sub>NeuAc<sub>2</sub> monosaccharide composition attached. This is the first reported instance of a site of modification in the serine protease domain. The description of these glycosylation events provides a basis for future functional studies and contributes to structural characterisation of native Factor IX for the production of effective therapeutic biosimilars and biobetters."

Primary endpoint: incidence of anti-FIX inhibitory antibodies (≥ 0.6 Bethesda Units). We present a 5-year analysis (<i>N</i> = 25, including remaining patients with ≥ 5 years' follow-up) and compare with a 1-year analysis (≥ 52 weeks' exposure). The main phase enrolled 25 children; 22 entered the extension phase; 17 remained in trial at data cutoff. Median treatment period: 5.6 years/patient; median total number of N9-GP exposure days: 290.0/patient. No patients developed anti-FIX inhibitory antibodies. No other safety concerns, including thromboembolic events, were reported. Neurological examinations have not revealed any new abnormal findings. Sixteen (64.0%) patients remained free from spontaneous bleeds; all bleeds were mild/moderate in severity; 93.0% were controlled with 1 to 2 N9-GP injections. No intracranial hemorrhages were reported. Annualized bleeding rates (ABRs) were very low at 5 years (median/Poisson-estimated mean overall ABR: 0.66/0.99), having decreased from the 1-year analysis (1.00/1.44). Median/Poisson-estimated mean spontaneous ABRs for the 1- and 5-year analyses: 0.00/0.45 and 0.00/0.33. Mean FIX trough activity at 5 years: 17.9%. Mean polyethylene glycol plasma concentration reached steady state at 6 months, increasing slightly over time, in line with increased FIX trough activity. N9-GP administered for ≥ 5 years shows favorable long-term safety and efficacy in PTPs with HB (FIX activity ≤ 2%)."

The views of all the three participants from Germany participating in the AMT-060 study have been investigated about their experiences with conventional and gene therapy and the effects of the forms of therapy on everyday life. The patients (aged 33-35 years) performed regular prophylactic replacement with factor IX concentrate prior to the gene therapy, reported 0-7 bleeds in the year prior to the treatment, with Hemophilia Joint Health Scores of 0-8. Following topics have been investigated \"dealing with illness\", \"participation in studies\", \"perception of conventional therapy\", \"perception of gene therapy\", \"significance of participation in gene therapy studies\", \"therapy of haemophilia after the end of the study\". All three participants have started to become more active and do more sports. However, they expressed anxiety about not knowing how long the effect would last and they felt that psychological support would be needed if the factor IX level fell back in the future. No patient expressed concern about any long-term potential negative consequences of gene therapy. Gene therapy has the potential to change the life of patients with haemophilia not only by the reduction of bleeding events but also by the increase of active and sportive activities."

The impact of these products in clinical practice to date remains understudied. We aimed to quantify the use of EHL products in prophylaxis in the US using the ATHN-dataset, a database of 145 ATHN-affiliated hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs). Further, we aimed to quantify the impact of EHL on key hemophilia indicators including annualized bleed rates (ABRs), hemophilia joint health scores (HJHS) and quality of life (QOL) metrics. The use of EHL vs standard half-life (SHL) products in severe hemophilia was compared between June 2018 and March 2019 using the ATHN-dataset. A cohort of patients was also recruited from seven participating HTCs in order to compare ABR, HJHS and QOL between product classes. By March 2019 the number of individuals with severe Hemophilia A (SHA) receiving EHLs remained relatively stable (28.4%), whereas the number of prescribed non-factor products increased to 7.1%, with a diminishing majority of patients (64.0%) continuing to receive SHLs. The majority of patients with severe hemophilia B (SHB) received treatment with EHLs including 57.5% by March 2019. There was a trend toward lower ABR with use of EHLs in SHA and SHB, although this did not result in improved HJHS nor QOL. EHL use in the United States in severe hemophilia continues to increase, although at a slower rate in SHA with the availability of non-factor therapy. The impact of the EHL therapies in clinical practice should continue to be examined prospectively."

    "abstract": "Despite the well-documented benefits of prophylaxis, treatment burden is still a barrier to adherence in patients with haemophilia. An extended half-life fusion protein linking recombinant FIX (rFIX) with human albumin (rIX-FP) has been developed for the treatment of patients with haemophilia B and is indicated for dosing up to every 14 days. This analysis evaluated real-world outcomes in patients switching to rIX-FP from the previous FIX product in Italy, Belgium and the UK. Anonymised chart data were collected from the pre-existing medical records of patients with haemophilia B between May and September 2018. Patients were included in the analysis if they had been treated with rIX-FP for ≥ 8 weeks. Data were compared between rIX-FP and the patient's prior FIX product. Twenty-three HTCs from Italy (n = 13), Belgium (n = 3) and the UK (n = 7) provided data for 84 male patients, 92.8% of which had severe haemophilia B. The majority of patients were previously on prophylactic regimens with their prior FIX product (Italy, 44/49; Belgium, 7/10; UK, 22/25). The switch to prophylaxis with rIX-FP led to reductions in mean annualised bleeding rate of 94.3% in Italy, 93.9% in Belgium and 67.7% in the UK compared with prior FIX prophylaxis. Overall, 41% of patients experienced zero spontaneous bleeds prior to switching, compared with 88% following the switch to rIX-FP. The majority of patients had a reduction in dosing frequency following the switch, with 98.6% of patients dosing once weekly or less frequently compared with 9.6% of patients dosing at this frequency with their prior FIX. Mean weekly FIX consumption was reduced compared with prior FIX prophylaxis. This retrospective review of real-world evidence demonstrated that switching to rIX-FP from prior FIX was associated with improved haemostatic efficacy and reduced factor consumption in patients with haemophilia B from Italy, Belgium and the UK."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in renal transplant (RT) recipients. The spectrum of illness ranges from infectious mononucleosis (IM) to post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). In association with clinical signs and symptoms, virus-specific serology and heterophile antibody tests are widely used in confirming the diagnosis of IM in the general population. However, these tests may have a limited role in immunosuppressed RT recipients from seropositive donor, especially in children who were EBV-seronegative prior to the transplant. The aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of these tests in the early diagnosis of IM in this subset of patients. <b>Methods:</b> This is a case study with a review of literature. <b>Results:</b> Here, we present a 14-year-old male with hemophilia B who presented with fever, fatigue, sore throat, palatal petechial rash, exudative tonsillitis and cervical lymphadenopathy 3 months post-RT. He was EBV seronegative prior to RT and received a deceased donor kidney transplant from a seropositive donor. Induction was done with Thymoglobulin and maintenance immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus and mycophenolate. Initial heterophile antibody test (monospot) was negative, but became positive at 5 months and remained positive at 9 months follow-up post-RT. EBV viral capsid antigens (VCA) IgM and IgG, early antigen (EA) and nuclear antigen (EBNA) were all negative at the time of presentation. VCA IgM and IgG both became positive at 5 months and peaked at 9 months follow-up, however the EA and EBNA remained negative. EBV viral load as measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative for the first 3 months post-RT but became positive at presentation, peaked at 6 months and started declining thereafter. Peripheral blood smear examination showed no absolute and atypical lymphocytosis. Cytomegalovirus PCR in the blood and throat culture for streptococcus were negative. There was no splenomegaly. He was managed conservatively with intravenous fluids, bed rest, antipyretics and reduction of immunosuppression. <b>Conclusions:</b> EBV serological markers have a limited role in the early diagnosis of EBV-IM following RT in prior seronegative children. Initial heterophile antibody test may also be negative, and hence a repeat test may be necessary. Once becoming positive, the VCA IgM may remain persistently elevated for prolonged duration. In addition to the suppressed cellular immunity secondary to immunosuppression, humoral response to viral infections is also delayed in transplant recipients, especially in the early transplant period. Hence, routine monitoring with PCR is superior to serology in diagnosing IM early and monitoring the EBV infection post-RT for timely evaluation and management."

A network of comprehensive haemophilia treatment centres (HTCs) located throughout the United States receives federal support for diagnosis and management of haemophilia and other rare bleeding disorders. Estimate the incidence and prevalence of haemophilia among US males using the HTC network. During the period 2012-2018, de-identified surveillance data were collected on all males who visited an HTC that included year of birth, gender, race, Hispanic ethnicity, residence zip code, haemophilia type and severity. Data from all patients were used to calculate period prevalence by haemophilia type, severity and state of residence. Data from a subset of patients born 1995-2014 were used to estimate incidence rates over the 20-year period. During the period, 21 748 males with haemophilia visited the HTCs resulting in an age-adjusted prevalence of 15.7 cases per 100 000 males (12 for haemophilia A and 3.7 for haemophilia B). Prevalence was higher among whites (15.1) than blacks (12.4) or Hispanics of either race (12.4). State-specific prevalence varied from 1.6 to 23.3 cases per 100 000. Based on 9587 males born during the index period, the average haemophilia incidence was 1 case per 4334 live male births. Based on these data, we estimate that there are between 29 761 and 32 985 males with haemophilia living in the United States today, the majority of whom receive comprehensive care in specialized clinical centres."

    "title": "Measurements of eftrenonacog alfa by 19 different combinations reagents/instrument: A single-centre study.",
    "abstract": "Recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) is an extended half-life concentrate for the treatment of haemophilia B (HB). rFIXFc activity monitoring is crucial in several clinical situations. However, differences were observed between one-stage clotting (OSC) and chromogenic assays, but not for all factor IX (FIX) concentrations. To compare rFIXFc measurements obtained using different instruments and common OSC and chromogenic asssays. FIX:C measurements were performed in rFIXFc-spiked plasma aliquots (targeted FIX levels of 1.5, 1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.05, 0.02 and 0.01 IU/mL) and plasma samples collected from two patients with HB at various time points after rFIXFc infusion, using three instruments (STA-R MAX, ACLTOP700 and CS2100i) and common clotting and chromogenic FIX:C assays. The same reagent could give different FIX:C measurements when adapted to different instruments. Moreover, the same reagent/instrument combination could give different results depending of the FIX concentration. For OSC assays, only STA-Cephascreen on STA-R MAX and CS2100i, SynthAFax on ACLTOP 700 and Actin on CS2100i provided acceptable recoveries for all rFIXFc concentrations. The chromogenic assays ROX-FIX and Biophen FIX:C underestimated rFIXFc for concentrations lower than 0.05 and 0.2 IU/mL, respectively. Our study demonstrates that the same reagent adapted to different instruments could lead to different rFIXFc values. As rFIXFc under/overestimation could be associated with inappropriate treatment or biased calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters, the reagent/instrument combination used by haemostasis laboratories should be considered and regularly evaluated by external quality assessment programmes."

    "title": "Performance of factor IX extended half-life product measurements in external quality control assessment programs.",
    "abstract": "Patients with hemophilia B are increasingly treated with extended half-life (EHL) factor IX (FIX) concentrates. For the laboratory, introduction of these EHL concentrates presents a major challenge. To understand the variation in FIX activity levels, all available diagnostic assays need to be directly compared. The ECAT, UKNEQAS, and RCPAQAP have collaboratively performed a global survey to evaluate the quality of FIX measurements using FIX deficient plasma samples spiked with recombinant FIX (rFIX), rFIXFP, rFIXFc, and N9-GP to levels at typical FIX trough (6 IU/dL) and peak levels (60 IU/dL). Participants were asked to use their routine protocols, using one-stage assays (OSA) or chromogenic assays (CA). In samples spiked with 6 IU/dL product, median (25%-75% range) FIX activity levels (OSA), were 8.0 IU/dL (7.0-9.2) for rFIX, 6.0 IU/dL (4.0-7.1) for rFIXFP, 6.6 IU/dL (5.5-8.0) for rFIXFc, and 4.9 IU/dL (3.5-8.4) for N9-GP. In samples spiked with 60 IU/dL, FIX activity levels measured (using OSA) was 63.0 IU/dL (59.9-67.0) for rFIX, 42.5 IU/dL (28.2-47.0) for rFIXFP, 50.0 IU/dL (45.0-55.0) for rFIXFc, and 34.0 IU/dL (24.8-67.5) for N9-GP. Considerable differences were observed between reagents for all samples. With CA, there was also quite some variation, but no differences between reagents. Large variation is observed in the measurement of FIX activity levels after administration of rFIX and EHL FIX products. For N9-GP, most silica-based assays show especially high levels. It is essential to standardize and improve reliability of measurements of these concentrates as diagnosis and treatment monitoring is based on these results."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy product release requires reliable and consistent demonstration of biopotency. In hemophilia B vectors, this is usually determined <i>in vivo</i> by measuring the plasma levels of the expressed human factor IX (FIX) transgene product in FIX knockout mice. To circumvent this laborious assay, we developed an <i>in vitro</i> method in which the HepG2 human liver cell line was infected with the vector, and the resulting FIX activity was determined in the conditioned medium using a chromogenic assay. The initial low sensitivity of the assay, particularly toward adeno-associated viral serotype 8 (AAV8), increased approximately 100-fold and allowed linear measurement in a broad range of multiplicities of infection. Statistical parameters indicated high assay repeatability (relative standard deviation (RSD) < 5%) and intra-assay reproducibility (RSD < 20%). To compare the performance of the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> biopotency assay, we applied statistical analyses including regression techniques and variation decomposition to the results obtained for 25 AAV8-FIX vector lots (BAX 335). These showed a highly significant correlation, with the cell culture-based assay demonstrating less variation than the <i>in vivo</i> test. The <i>in vitro</i> assay thus constitutes a viable alternative to using animals for lot release testing."

    "abstract": "Replacement therapy with plasma-derived or recombinant FVIII and FIX (pdFVIII/pdFIX or rFVIII/rFIX) concentrates is the standard of treatment in patients with haemophilia A and B, respectively. Measurement of factor VIII (FVIII:C) or factor IX (FIX:C) levels can be done by one-stage clotting assay (OSA) or chromogenic substrate assay (CSA). The French study group on the Biology of Hemorrhagic Diseases (a collaborative group of the GFHT and MHEMO network) presents a literature review and proposals for the monitoring of FVIII:C and FIX:C levels in treated haemophilia A and B patients, respectively. The use of CSA is recommended for the monitoring of patients treated with pdFVIII or rFVIII including extended half-life (EHL) rFVIII. Except for rFVIII-Fc, great caution is required when measuring FVIII:C levels by OSA in patients substituted by EHL-rFVIII. The OSA is recommended for the monitoring of patients treated with pdFIX or rFIX. Large discordances in the FIX:C levels measured for extended half-life rFIX (EHL-rFIX), depending on the method and reagents used, must lead to great attention when OSA is used for measuring FIX:C levels in patients substituted by EHL-rFIX. Data of most of recent studies, obtained with spiked plasmas, deserve to be confirmed in plasma samples of treated patients."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia carriers (HCs) face specific psychosocial challenges related to pregnancy, caused by their inherited bleeding disorder. Optimal support from healthcare providers can only be realized by exploring medical and psychological healthcare requirements. To review all published evidence on the experiences and attitudes of HCs regarding reproductive decision-making, prenatal diagnosis, pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium to provide an accessible overview of this information for health care providers. Cochrane library, PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched for original qualitative data. Two authors performed study selection, risk-of-bias assessment, data extraction, and data analysis through meta-summary. The extracted themes were discussed within the research team. Fifteen studies with an overall moderate quality were included. The following findings were identified: (a) Quality of life of family members with hemophilia influences reproductive decision-making; (b) Genetic counselling is generally considered useful; (c) The development of a specialized carrier clinic is considered valuable; (d) HCs describe prenatal diagnosis as beneficial yet psychosocially challenging; and (e) noninvasive prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are predominantly considered beneficial. These findings are limited by the overall moderate quality of included studies and the possibly partly outdated results in the current era of hemophilia treatment. Available qualitative literature on HCs around pregnancy focuses on genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis. Future studies are needed on the experiences and needs of HCs through pregnancy and puerperium as well as in light of emerging hemophilia diagnosis and treatment options."

    "abstract": ": Standard-of-care treatment for haemophilia A or B is to maintain adequate coagulation factor levels through clotting factor administration. The current study aimed to evaluate annualised bleeding rates (ABR) and treatment adherence for haemophilia A or B patients receiving standard half-life (SHL) vs. extended half-life (EHL) factor replacement products. We analysed data from the Adelphi Disease-Specific Programmes, a health record-based survey of United States and European haematologists. Analysis included 651 males with moderate-to-severe haemophilia A or B (the United States, n = 132; Europe, n = 519). The haemophilia A analysis included 501 patients (SHL, n = 435; EHL, n = 66). In the combined United States/European population, mean (SD) ABR was 1.7 (1.69) for the SHL group and 1.8 (2.00) for the EHL group. A total of 72% of patients receiving SHL factor VIII and 75% of patients receiving EHL factor VIII in the combined population were fully adherent (no doses missed of the last 10 doses), as reported by physicians. The haemophilia B analysis included 150 patients (SHL, n = 114; EHL, n = 36). The mean (SD) ABR in the combined population was 2.1 (2.16) for patients receiving SHL factor IX (FIX) and 1.4 (1.48) for patients receiving EHL FIX. The percentage of fully adherent patients (physician-reported) was similar in both treatment groups (SHL FIX, 68%; EHL FIX, 73%). In this preliminary real-world survey in a relatively small sample of patients, measures of ABR and adherence between SHL and EHL products were evaluated. Additional real-world research on prescribing patterns, SHL vs. EHL effectiveness, and adherence is warranted."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia A (HA) is a male-predominant disorder, yet women and girls can have factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency with bleeding events requiring treatment. This study aimed to identify and characterize female patients with HA. Administrative claims dated 01 January 2012-31 July 2016 were accessed for patients with 18 months' coverage by commercial or Medicare Advantage with Part D insurance. Patients were included by HA diagnoses or treatments and/or bleeding-related diagnoses or procedures, and excluded by haemophilia B or qualitative platelet disorder diagnoses. A sample of charts was examined for bleeding history, HA therapies and bleeding treatments. All-cause healthcare utilization and costs were also described. Among 353 patients meeting initial inclusion criteria, 86 charts were procured, with 8 patients identified as having HA. Their mean age was 60 ± 17 years and most were Medicare-insured. The mean Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 2.50 ± 2.56; the most prevalent comorbid conditions involved coagulation/haemorrhage, fluid/electrolyte balance and non-traumatic joint disorders. Over 18 months, a mean of 54 ambulatory visits and 120 pharmacy fills were observed; mean medical costs were $86 694 and pharmacy costs were $25 396. Identifying females with HA is challenging using healthcare claims, because diagnostic nomenclature is unclear for female patients treated for bleeding events. Although chart abstraction enhanced claims data, very few female patients were identified with HA. Nevertheless, even in a small sample, sizeable burden in comorbidity and healthcare use was observed. Improved nomenclature and coding for HA diagnoses for women and girls is key to improving research and treatment."

    "abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations in the human coagulation factor 9 (F9) gene lead to hemophilia B. Here, we dissected the consequences and the pathomechanism of a non-coding mutation (c.2545A>G) in the F9 3' untranslated region. Using wild type and mutant factor IX (FIX) minigenes we revealed that the mutation leads to reduced F9 mRNA and FIX protein levels and to lower coagulation activity of cell culture supernatants. The phenotype could not be compensated by increased transcription. The pathomechanism comprises the de novo creation of a binding site for the spliceosomal component U1snRNP, which is able to suppress the nearby F9 poly(A) site. This second, splicing-independent function of U1snRNP was discovered previously and blockade of U1snRNP restored mutant F9 mRNA expression. In addition, we explored the vice versa approach and masked the mutation by antisense oligonucleotides resulting in significantly increased F9 mRNA expression and coagulation activity. This treatment may transform the moderate/severe hemophilia B into a mild or subclinical form in the patients. This antisense based strategy is applicable to other mutations in untranslated regions creating deleterious binding sites for cellular proteins."

    "abstract": "Approximately 70% of patients with haemophilia exhibit a clear inheritance pattern, while for the remaining 30%, patients are the first to be diagnosed in their family and are considered sporadic cases. In such a setting, the determination of carrier status and the risk estimation of disease transmission to another child are major challenges for genetic counselling. Large studies have suggested that genetic testing reveals 70% of sporadic patients' mothers are carriers. In the remaining 30%, in some apparently non-carrier mothers, the pathogenic variant can be detected as low somatic and gonosomal mosaicism. The significance of mosaic pathogenic variants has thus far been underestimated, since conventional Sanger sequencing and other technology are not sufficiently sensitive. The study of various tissue samples and recent extra-sensitive molecular methods have now made it easier to detect both single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy-number variants (CNVs), at a mosaic level in parents, and to predict the probability of disease recurrence. This review seeks to examine various kinds of mosaicism in haemophilia, including the mechanisms by which they arise and the risk of passing these variants on to the next generation. In addition, we focus on the selection of cell tissues and methods to detect these mosaic variants in the haemophilia setting. Taking into account the high rate of mosaicism in mothers of sporadic cases, we propose a diagnostic flow chart that could facilitate better evaluation of the risk of transmitting haemophilia in genetic and prenatal counselling."

Existing case reports have demonstrated favorable outcomes in patients outside of the United States who received continuous infusions of recombinant factor IX replacement in the perioperative setting after liver transplant. Given limitations in the stability of the recombinant factor IX products in the United States, a dosing strategy was comprised of once daily bolus dosing to achieve satisfactory factor IX levels. Within 48 hours of initial surgery, the patient had sustained factor IX levels above 70% of normal and the patient required no further dosing of factor IX products to date. This strategy helped facilitate less frequent dosing as well as achieved targeted factor levels while synthetic function of the transplanted liver recovered."

The majority of PWH (77%) played sports weekly, of which 80% high-risk sports. Sports participation (median 3.0x/wk), and the proportion of injured PWH was similar in severe (42%) and non-severe (33%) PWH. Sports injuries were rare (65% no injuries in 3 years, median 0/y (IQR 0-1)). Annually, PWH did not report more injuries (15%) than age-matched boys (28%).

Sports participation was similar across severities and injury rates were not higher than among the general population. Injuries were not associated with frequency or type of sports. A prospective study with objective assessment of sports participation and injuries is warranted to confirm these findings and avoid recall bias."

A total of 129 HA patients (86 Adynovate, 43 Eloctate) and 64 HB (Alprolix) patients were included in the study. For HA, switching to EHL FVIII resulted in decreased injection frequency (3 to 2 per week), improved 'reduced adherence' rates (18% to 7%), decreased median annualized bleeding rate (ABR; 2.0 to 0.0) and increased proportion of patients with zero bleeds (44% to 64%).

Due to its complex composition, FIX-PCC is very challenging to bioprocess through virus removing nanofilters in order to ensure its biosafety. This article describes a two-step filtration process of FIX-PCC using a nanocellulose-based filter paper with tailored porosity. The filters were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cryoporometry with differential scanning calorimetry, and nitrogen gas sorption. Furthermore, in order to probe the filter's cut-off size rejection threshold, removal of small- and large-size model viruses, i.e., ΦX174 (28 nm) and PR772 (70 nm), was evaluated. The feed, pre-filtrate, and permeate solutions were characterized with mass-spectrometric proteomic analysis, dynamic light scattering (DLS), sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and analytical size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SEHPLC). By sequential filtration through 11 μm pre-filter and 33 μm virus removal filter paper, it was possible to achieve high product throughput and high virus removal capacity. The presented approach could potentially be applied for bioprocessing other protein-based drugs."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A and B are inherited X-linked disorders of hemostasis, associated with an increased bleeding tendency. Patients with severe hemophilia have undetectable clotting factor levels and experience spontaneous bleeds. In patients with nonsevere hemophilia, the clotting factor levels are 2% to 40% of normal and bleeds predominantly occur after provocative events such as trauma and surgery. Despite this milder phenotype, patients with nonsevere hemophilia may suffer from considerable morbidity and have an increased mortality risk. However, many aspects of the course of disease and treatment remain unclear. Information on the factors influencing interindividual differences in bleeding phenotype is lacking, and misdiagnosis may occur due to assay discrepancies in the diagnostic workup. Desmopressin is the preferred treatment modality, but some patients and indications require treatment with clotting factor concentrates. This may elicit inhibitor formation, which is associated with an increased burden of disease and a higher mortality rate. It has been found that patients with nonsevere hemophilia A carry a lifelong risk for this serious complication. In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of the diagnosis and management of nonsevere hemophilia. A report of science presented at the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2019 Annual Congress is also provided."

However, considerable interlaboratory variability has been reported for one-stage clotting (OSC) assays. This study aimed to evaluate the real-world, interlaboratory variability of routine FIX activity assays used in clinical haemostasis laboratories for the measurement of recombinant FIX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) activity. Human FIX-depleted plasma was spiked with rFIXFc at 0.80, 0.20 or 0.05 IU/mL based on label potency. Participating laboratories tested samples using their own routine OSC or chromogenic substrate (CS) assay protocols, reagents and FIX plasma standards. Laboratories could perform more than one measurement and method, and were not fully blinded to nominal activity values. A total of 142 laboratories contributed OSC results from 175 sample kits using 11 different activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) reagents. The median recovered FIX activity for the 0.80, 0.20 and 0.05 IU/mL samples was 0.72 IU/mL, 0.21 IU/mL and 0.060 IU/mL, respectively. Across all OSC reagents, interlaboratory variability (% CV) per aPTT reagent ranged from 9.4% to 32.1%, 8.2% to 32.6% and 12.2% to 42.0% at the 0.80, 0.20 and 0.05 IU/mL levels, respectively. CS results showed excellent median recoveries at all nominal levels (87.5% to 115.0%; n = 11) with low interlaboratory variability (CV 3.6% to 15.4%). This large, real-world data set indicates that rFIXFc activity in plasma samples can be accurately measured with the majority of routine OSC and CS assay methods. Given the variation in FIX assay procedures between sites, it is important that individual laboratories qualify their in-house methods for monitoring of rFIXFc activity."

In fact, reliable health-related quality of life data are even more critical in developing countries to advocate for government agencies to develop national haemophilia care programmes. However, validated tools are not yet available in sub-Saharan African countries. The purpose of this study was to complete the cultural adaptation and validation of the Canadian Haemophilia Outcomes-Kids' Life Assessment Tool version<sub>2.0</sub> (CHO-KLAT<sub>2.0</sub>) in Côte d'Ivoire. The process included four steps: a linguistic adaptation, cognitive debriefing interviews with children and their parents, a validity assessment with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) as a comparator, and a test-retest reliability assessment. The initial Ivoirian version of the CHO-KLAT<sub>2.0</sub> was developed through a linguistic adaptation performed in close collaboration with members of the local medical team and haemophilia community. Cognitive debriefings were completed with five boys and their parents, with the final Ivoirian version of the CHO-KLAT<sub>2.0</sub> developed in September 2017. The validation process included 37 boys with haemophilia (mean age: 11.4 years; 34 with severe and three with moderate forms of haemophilia, all treated on demand) and their parents. Among the child-reported population (n = 20), we observed a mean CHO-KLAT<sub>2.0</sub> score of 51.3 ± 9.2; there was a moderate correlation between the CHO-KLAT<sub>2.0</sub> and PedsQL scores (r = 0.581; p = 0.007) and an inverse correlation of the CHO-KLAT<sub>2.0</sub> and PedsQL scores with the global rating of the degree to which the boys were bothered by their haemophilia. The mean parent proxy CHO-KLAT<sub>2.0</sub> score (n = 17) was 53.5 ± 9.8. Among the parents, we found no significant correlation between the Ivoirian CHO-KLAT<sub>2.0</sub> and PedsQL scores or between the parent-reported scores and the parent global ratings of bother. The test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.879 (95% CI: 0.673; 0.954) for the child-reported questionnaires and 0.880 (95% CI: 0.694; 0.955) for the proxy-reported questionnaires. A cross-culturally adapted and validated version of the CHO-KLAT<sub>2.0</sub> for Côte d'Ivoire is now available that enables baseline values to be obtained and intervention outcomes (namely, prophylaxis) to be measured in Ivoirian boys with haemophilia."

Previously treated patients aged <12 years with moderate to severe hemophilia B enrolled in a 3-year extension study following a phase 3 pivotal study in which they received weekly rIX-FP prophylaxis. In the extension study, they could maintain or extend their prophylaxis interval to every 10 or 14 days if they were well controlled on the 7-day regimen. Compared with their initial regimen, by the end of the study, dosing intervals were the same, extended, and shortened in 16, 4, and 4 patients, respectively. Very low annualized spontaneous bleeding rates (AsBRs) were observed; median AsBR was 0.0 for the 7- and 10-day regimens, and 1.1 for the 14-day regimen. The 7- and 14-day regimens were comparable in preventing spontaneous bleeds; mean (95% confidence interval) difference in AsBR of -1.2 (-2.6 to 0.3) bleeding episodes/year/subject. Overall, 96% of bleeding episodes were successfully treated with one or two injections of rIX-FP. Patients on a 14-day regimen maintained a mean steady-state trough FIX level of >7.2 IU/dL. No patient developed an inhibitor. This extension study demonstrated the long-term safety and efficacy of weekly rIX-FP in pediatric patients. Additionally, it showed that adequate bleed protection can be achieved with 10- or 14-day rIX-FP regimens in selected pediatric patients while maintaining safety."

The European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) Coagulation Factor Variant Database Project aims to provide a single port of entry to a web-accessible resource for variants in genes involved in clinical bleeding disorders. New databases have evolved from previously developed single gene variant coagulation database projects, incorporating new data, new analysis tools and a new common database architecture with new interfaces and filters. These new databases currently present information about the genotype, phenotype (laboratory and clinical) and structural and functional effects of variants described in the genes of factor (F) VII (F7), FVIII (F8), FIX (F9) and von Willebrand factor (VWF). The project has improved the quality and quantity of information available to the haemostasis research and clinical communities, thereby enabling accurate classification of disease severity in order to make assessments of likely pathogenicity."

In Colombia, HB is considered a rare and high-cost disease, with 362 males reported in 2017. Here, we characterized 20 HB apparently unrelated families by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. Fourteen unique variants were identified: seven missense, three nonsense, one variant in the 3' UTR region, two large deletions >50 bp, and one intronic substitution that affects splicing c.520+13A>G that was present in 7/20 patients (35%). All these variants have been previously reported in the literature, except for exons 3 and 4, deletions, present in one patient. The genotype-phenotype association correlates with the reported in the literature, with the exception of one patient. This molecular analysis allowed us to establish the causal variant of HB in 100% of patients, to provide the appropriate genetic counseling to each of the families, and to propose a more cost-effective carrier analysis. Here, we reported the first variants in Colombian population with Hemophilia B, finding a new variant and one intron recurrent variant present in 35% of patients."

One such new product is dalcinonacog alfa, a recombinant FIX with modifications to provide improved features such as subcutaneous administration. In view of previously observed assay discrepancies with modified FIX therapeutics, the aim of this study was to assess potential discrepancies in potency measurement of dalcinonacog alfa between and within different assay methods. Potency of dalcinonacog alfa was measured against the 5th International Standard (IS) for FIX Concentrate and the 4th IS for FIX Plasma by One-Stage Clotting Assay, using 9 different APTT reagents and 2 commercially available FIX chromogenic kits. Plasma-derived concentrate and recombinant FIX samples were also included for comparison in every assay. Substantial discrepancies were observed when assaying dalcinonacog alfa using the one-stage clotting assay against both standards. No statistically valid results were obtained when testing dalcinonacog alfa using either chromogenic kit. Increasing the incubation time with the activation reagent in both chromogenic kits resulted in valid assays and increased the potency to become more in line with potencies by one-stage clotting assays. Increasing the incubation time in the chromogenic kits had no effect on the potencies of the plasma-derived or recombinant samples. However, incubation time influenced in the one-stage clotting assay using Dapttin. Within and between assay method discrepancy was found when assaying dalcinonacog alfa. Methods for potency labelling and clinical monitoring should be given careful consideration."

    "abstract": "The advent of extended half-life (EHL) recombinant clotting factors and innovative non-factor replacement therapeutics, such as emicizumab, offers several advantages over existing products for the prophylactic treatment of people living with hemophilia (PwH). These include low annual bleeding rates with less frequent dosing, higher trough plasma concentrations, and a more convenient route of administration. However, increasing use of these therapies poses challenges to clinicians and coagulation laboratories due to the lack of standardized assays for monitoring of hemostatic parameters, and the potential for misinterpretation of test results, which may jeopardize patient safety. Definitive diagnosis of hemophilia and treatment monitoring is reliant on demonstrating factor VIII (FVIII; hemophilia A) or factor IX (FIX; hemophilia B) deficiency using a functional coagulation assay. The most frequently used assays are based on activated partial thromboplastin time, using a one-stage or two-stage process. While one-stage and chromogenic assays have performed well with human-derived FVIII and FIX and full-length recombinant products, EHL recombinant factors are heterogeneous in structure and mode of action and therefore show wide variation in activity levels between different one-stage assays, and between one-stage and chromogenic assays. In the context of the recommended stepwise approach for laboratory diagnosis of hemophilia, we examine the diagnostic challenges associated with the use of EHL factors and novel non-factor therapeutics and consider the optimal diagnostic approach in PwH who are receiving these treatments. Ultimately, accurate diagnostic solutions are a prerequisite for personalized therapy to minimize treatment burden and improve quality of life in PwH."

    "abstract": "The recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector has been successfully employed in clinical trials for patients with blindness and bleeding diseases as well as neuromuscular disorders. To date, it remains a major challenge to achieve higher transduction efficiency with a lower dose of rAAV vector. Our previous studies have demonstrated that serum proteins are able to directly interact with AAV virions for transduction enhancement. Herein, we explored the effect of the FerA domains, which are derived from ferlin proteins and possess membrane-fusion activity, on AAV transduction. Our results show that FerA domains from dysferlin, myoferlin, and otoferlin proteins are able to directly interact with AAV vectors and enhance AAV transduction in vitro and in mice through either intravenous or intramuscular injections. The enhanced AAV transduction induced by human/mouse FerA domains is achieved in various cell lines and in mice regardless of AAV serotypes. Mechanism studies demonstrated that the FerA domains could effectively enhance the ability of AAV vectors to bind to target cells and cross the vascular barrier. Additionally, FerA domains slow down the blood clearance of AAV. Systemic administration of AAV8/hFIX-FerA complex induced approximate 4-fold more human coagulation factor IX expression and improved hemostasis in hemophilia B mice than that of AAV8/hFIX. Collectively, we show, for the first time, that multiple FerA domains could be tethered on the AAV capsid and enhance widespread tissue distribution in an AAV serotypes-independent manner. This approach therefore holds a promise for future clinical application."

Data from 16 contributing centers, in 13 European countries and Israel, were analyzed using logistic regression. Of 532 recruited individuals, this analysis included 370 patients with moderate or severe hemophilia who received on-demand or prophylactic therapy. For patients with a history of macroscopic hematuria, we analyzed the association between prophylaxis and reoccurrence of macroscopic hematuria within the past 5 years (n = 235 patients). Frequent (≥3 times/wk) prophylaxis was negatively associated with a recent episode of macroscopic hematuria (odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18-0.76). We also analyzed whether prophylaxis corresponded to a lower lifetime number of macroscopic hematuria episodes (n = 285 patients). Frequent prophylaxis for >15 years was associated with a lower number of episodes compared to on-demand treatment (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.16-0.54), whereas nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and severe hemophilia were associated with a higher number. There was no association of prophylaxis <3 times/wk with hematuria. Frequent prophylaxis was negatively associated with the number of episodes of macroscopic hematuria in people with hemophilia. Prevalence of macroscopic hematuria was higher among individuals with severe hemophilia and those regularly using NSAIDs."

The impact of rIX-FP, a recombinant FIX fused to recombinant albumin, on FIX consumption and surgical management was assessed in patients with haemophilia B. Male patients, ≤65 years old with severe haemophilia B (FIX activity ≤2%) requiring non-emergency surgery were enrolled in the surgical substudy of PROLONG-9FP. Dosing was based on World Federation of Hemophilia guidelines and patients' pharmacokinetics. Haemostatic efficacy was assessed on a 4-point scale. rIX-FP consumption and safety were monitored throughout the perioperative period. This updated dataset reports on thirty (8 minor and 22 major) surgeries conducted in 21 patients. A single preoperative bolus was used in 96.7% (n = 29) of surgeries. After minor surgery, patients received a median (range) of 0 (0-3) infusions with a median (range) consumption of 0 (0-178.89) IU/kg in the 14-day postoperative period. In patients who underwent major surgery (including 15 patients undergoing joint replacement surgery), the median (range) number of infusions in the 14-day postoperative period was 5 (0-11) and median consumption was 221.7 (0-444.07) IU/kg. Haemostatic efficacy was rated as excellent or good in 87.5% (7/8) of minor surgeries and 95.5% (21/22) of major surgeries. Surgical procedures can be performed using a single preoperative bolus of rIX-FP in nearly all patients. During postoperative care, use of rIX-FP necessitated infrequent infusions and low FIX consumption. Overall, data suggest rIX-FP simplifies perioperative care in patients with haemophilia B."

    "abstract": ": Hemophilia comprises two distinct genetic disorders caused by missing or defective clotting factor VIII (hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (hemophilia B). The management of these conditions has been for long based on replacement therapies, but emerging evidence garnered from recent landmark studies suggests that a promising avenue toward routine use of gene therapy is clearly progressing forward, thus generating unavoidable consequences on laboratory hemostasis, especially as pertaining to phenotypic testing. Although it seems likely that widespread use of gene therapy will be associated with a relative decrease of hemostasis tests requests in this patient population due to the relatively stable effect of transgene delivery and persistent production of endogenous clotting factor, some important aspects persuade us that conventional laboratory diagnostics, especially encompassing activated partial thromboplastin time, as well as one-stage and two-stage clotting factor assays, will not be completely voided in the gene therapy era. In particular, phenotypic testing will remain essential for excluding acquired or sporadic cases of hemophilia, for identifying and titrating factor inhibitors, as well as for defining and monitoring the long-term therapeutic effectiveness of gene transfection in hemophiliacs."

Mean age of the patients was 32 years (range 14-51), therefore this is a relatively young patients' cohort. Radiosynovectomy was performed in 37 patients with hemophilia A and in 17 patients suffering from hemophilia B. Since hemophilia is a sex-linked (x-linked) recessive disorder, all of the patients were male. There was no acquired hemophiliac among the treated patients. The RSO resulted in a 95% decline in bleedings per year and eliminated the incidence of further bleedings in 55% of the treated joints. Our findings support the view that radiosynoviorthesis can be considered as the first choice treatment for posttraumatic joint bleedings of hemophilic patients."

The objectives of this study were to (a) provide a detailed description of opioid exposure in haemophilia patients based on written prescription data, (b) compare our findings to national haemophilia-specific and general population datasets and (c) identify predictors of opioid exposure in haemophilia patients. Medical records of 183 adult and 135 paediatric patients from two haemophilia treatment centres (HTC) were reviewed over a 42-month period. Chronic exposure and acute opioid exposure were recorded, and results were compared to national haemophilia (ATHNdataset) and general population (CDC) data. We found that 56% of adult and 21% of paediatric patients were exposed to opioids, rates substantially higher than reported in the ATHNdataset (6%) and national population data from the CDC. In adults, but not children, severity of haemophilia was a significant predictor of opioid exposure. Most acute opioid prescriptions were not written by the HTC. This is the first study in the haemophilia population to examine opioid exposure based on prescription data. Opioid exposure was more common than predicted in both adult and paediatric study populations and was most often prescribed for acute pain or procedures by non-HTC providers. Haemophilia treatment centres need to take the lead in assessing pain in haemophilia patients, guiding treatment promoting non-opioid options, strengthen efforts to monitor opioid exposure and collect data on pain treatment in the haemophilia population."

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) gene therapy has shown efficacy in several clinical trials and is considered a highly promising technology to treat monogenic diseases such as hemophilia A and B. However, a major drawback of AAV8 gene therapy is that it can be applied only once because anti-AAV8 immunity develops after the first treatment. Readministration may be required in patients who are expected to need redosing, eg, due to organ growth, or to boost suboptimal expression levels, but no redosing protocol has been established. We have developed a preventive immune-suppressive protocol for a human factor IX (FIX) vector with an intended dose of ~5 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg/kg that inhibits the development of anti-AAV8 neutralizing-antibody (NAb) responses and anti-AAV8 T-cell responses using CTLA4-IgG (abatacept). In a preclinical model, transient treatment with abatacept during initial human FIX gene therapy efficiently inhibited the generation of AAV8-specific cellular and humoral responses, and thus permitted redosing of FIX. Furthermore, our data suggest that by suppression of anti-AAV8 NAb responses after the second higher dose (4 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg/kg) this protocol can be used to enable redosing up to such high doses. An additional advantage of CTLA4-IgG blocking CD28-mediated signals is its potential suppression of AAV8-specific cytotoxic CD8 T-cell responses, which are believed to kill transduced hepatocytes and might interfere with a successful readministration. Redosing protocols using approved drugs would be beneficial for patients because they could effortlessly be applied in clinical trials and enable safe and efficient treatment options for patients undergoing AAV8 gene therapy."

    "abstract": "Understanding pharmacokinetic (PK) differences between standard and extended half-life (EHL) products is important, particularly for factor IX (FIX), where differences are more significant than for factor VIII. Two single-dose PK trials showed N9-GP achieves higher FIX levels and greater area-under-the-curve than pdFIX, rFIX, and rFIXFc through higher recovery and longer terminal half-life. In paradigm 7, N9-GP demonstrated consistently favorable PK characteristics compared with rFIXFc. Collins et al explored population PK differences between N9-GP and pdFIX/rFIX based upon paradigm 1 data. This analysis uses population PK models based upon the paradigm 7 trial. 15 patients (21-65 years) with hemophilia B received single 50-IU/kg doses of N9-GP and rFIXFc ≥21 days apart. A population PK model developed from single-dose PK profiles simulated plasma FIX activity following dosing for surgery and on-demand treatment of bleeds. Simulations explored doses and frequencies required to sustain target World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) factor activity levels. PK profiles of N9-GP and rFIXFc were described by one- and three-compartment models, respectively. Simulations predicted significantly reduced dosing frequency and consumption for N9-GP than rFIXFc. For severe bleeds, a single N9-GP dose (80 IU/kg) is sufficient to maintain WFH-recommended FIX levels, whereas multiple rFIXFc doses are required. For surgery, redosing in the first week with N9-GP is modeled at day 6 vs rFIXFc dosing at 6, 30, 54, 78, and 126 hrs. For life-threatening bleeds, N9-GP is required at days 0, 3, 6, 13, and 18 vs rFIXFc redosing after 6 hrs with 10 additional doses at 24-, 48-, and 72 hr intervals. PK modeling approaches based upon direct comparative studies offer insights into PK differences between EHL FIX products. Model simulations show N9-GP may allow on-demand treatment and perioperative management with 55-75% fewer injections and 65-74% lower overall factor concentrate consumption than rFIXFc."

FIX potency of rFIX-FP when using APTT reagents with pure phospholipid emulsions with added colloidal silica was similar to OS method with Pathromtin SL. In contrast, close to 80% higher FIX potency for rFIX-FP, and similar to OS method with SynthAFax and to the CS method, was obtained when FXIa replaced contact activation.

Supportive results were obtained with the tissue factor/FVIIa method. Colloidal silica and Pathromtin SL impair activation of rFIX-FP, causing underestimation of rFIX-FP potency."

Corn trypsin inhibitor (4 µg/mL)-treated healthy blood was dosed with either anti-factor VIII (FVIII; hemophilia A model) or a recombinant factor IX (FIX) missense variant (FIX-V181T; hemophilia B model). Treated blood was perfused at 100 s<sup>-1</sup> wall shear rate over collagen/tissue factor (TF) or collagen/factor XIa (FXIa). Anti-FVIII partially blocked fibrin production on collagen/TF, but completely blocked fibrin production on collagen/FXIa, a phenotype reversed with 1 µmol/L bispecific antibody (emicizumab), which binds FIXa and factor X. As expected, emicizumab had no significant effect on healthy blood (no anti-FVIII present) perfused over collagen/FXIa. The efficacy of emicizumab in anti-FVIII-treated healthy blood phenocopied the action of emicizumab in the blood of a patient with hemophilia A perfused over collagen/FXIa. Interestingly, a patient-derived FVIII-neutralizing antibody reduced fibrin production when added to healthy blood perfused over collagen/FXIa. For low TF surfaces, reFIX-V181T (50 µg/mL) fully blocked platelet and fibrin deposition, a phenotype fully reversed with anti-TFPI. Two new microfluidic hemophilia A and B models demonstrate the potency of anti-TF pathway inhibitor, emicizumab, and a patient-derived inhibitory antibody. Using collagen/FXIa-coated surfaces resulted in reliable and highly sensitive hemophilia models."

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the distribution, clinical characteristics and outcome of inherited coagulation disorders (ICD) in Turkish children. Data from all children (age<18 years) with ICD examined in our center were retrospectively reviewed. There were 403 children with ICD (233 males and 170 females) with a median age of four years at diagnosis. The percentages of von Willebrand disease (vWd), hemophilia and rare bleeding disorders (RBD) were 40 %, 34 % and 26 %, type-1, type-2 and type-3 vWd were 63 % 17 % and 20 %, hemophilia A and B were 84 % and 16 %, and severe, moderate and mild hemophilia were 48 %, 30 % and 22 %, respectively. Factor VII and FXI deficiencies were the most prevalent, comprising 56 % and 22 % of all children with RBD, respectively. Parental consanguinity rates were 72 % in type-3 vWd and 61 % in severe RBD. The overall prevalence of gastrointestinal bleedings was 4.5 % (18/403), intracranial bleeding (ICB) was 4.96 % (20/403), mortality from ICB was 30 % (6/20) and the overall mortality rate was 1.49 % (6/403). No life-threatening bleeding was seen during regular prophylaxis. Chronic arthropathy prevalence in severe hemophilia was 8 % with primary prophylaxis and 53 % with demand therap. Inhibitor prevalence was 14 % in hemophilia-A and 5 % in hemophilia-B. These data show that vWd is the most common ICD, type-3 vWd and RBD are prevalent due to frequent consanguineous marriages and diagnosis of ICD is substantially delayed in Turkish children. Prophylactic replacement therapy prevents occurrence of life-threatening bleedings and reduces the development of hemophilic arthropathy."

    "title": "Vascularized Free Tissue Transfer in a Patient with Hemophilia B: Case Report and Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a blood disorder characterized by impairment of the coagulation cascade leading to an increased bleeding risk (Kauffman, 2014). As such, surgical management of these patients can become difficult and well-defined surgical guidelines are not yet in place (Assoumane et al., 2017). Close monitoring of perioperative factor levels may be even more crucial for those undergoing microvascular free tissue transfer. This is because either a hypercoagulable or hypocoagulable bleeding state has the potential to further increase the risk of vascular compromise to the flap. We report a successful case of mandibular reconstruction using a free fibular flap in a patient with severe hemophilia B and the protocols we used, as well as a review of the literature of similar cases. In the literature, we identified 6 cases of microvascular free tissue transfer in patients with hemophilia; two of these cases had complications which were both related to excess bleeding. It is crucial that these cases be managed in a multidisciplinary fashion in close consultation with a hematologist. The role of venothromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in the hemophilic patient undergoing free tissue transfer is discussed."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B is an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder caused by abnormalities in the coagulation factor IX gene. Without prophylactic treatment, patients experience frequent spontaneous bleeding episodes. Well-characterized animal models are valuable for determining the pathobiology of the disease and testing novel therapeutic innovations. Here, we generated a porcine model of hemophilia B using a combination of CRISPR/Cas9 and somatic cell nuclear transfer. Moreover, we tested the possibility of hemophilia B therapy by gene insertion. Frequent spontaneous joint bleeding episodes that occurred in hemophilia B pigs allowed a thorough investigation of the pathological process of hemophilic arthropathy. In contrast to the hemophilia B pigs, which showed a severe bleeding tendency and joint damage, the transgenic pigs carrying human coagulation factor IX exhibited a partial improvement of bleeding. In summary, this study not only offers a translational hemophilia B model for exploring the pathological process of hemophilic arthropathy but also provides a possibility for the permanent correction of hemophilia in the future by genome editing in situ."

    "abstract": "Early preclinical studies in rodents and other species did not reveal that vector or transgene immunity would present a significant hurdle for sustained gene expression. While there was early evidence of mild immune responses to adeno-associated virus (AAV) in preclinical studies, it was generally believed that these responses were too weak and transient to negatively impact sustained transduction. However, translation of the cumulative success in treating hemophilia B in rodents and dogs with an AAV2-<i>F9</i> vector to human studies was not as successful. Despite significant progress in recent clinical trials for hemophilia, new immunotoxicities to AAV and transgene are emerging in humans that require better animal models to assess and overcome these responses. The animal models designed to address these immune complications have provided critical information to assess how vector dose, vector capsid processing, vector genome, difference in serotypes, and variations in vector delivery route can impact immunity and to develop approaches for overcoming pre-existing immunity. Additionally, a comprehensive dissection of innate, adaptive, and regulatory responses to AAV vectors in preclinical studies has provided a framework that can be utilized for development of immunomodulatory therapies to overcome or bypass immune responses and for developing strategic approaches toward engineering stealth AAV vectors that can circumvent immunity."

    "abstract": "The development of neutralizing antibodies in hemophilia is a serious complication of factor replacement therapy. These antibodies, also known as \"inhibitors\", significantly increase morbidity within the hemophilia population and lower the quality of life for these patients. People with severe hemophilia A have an overall 25-40% lifetime risk of inhibitor development, compared to that of 5-15% lifetime risk in those with moderate/mild hemophilia A. The risk is lower in hemophilia B population (about 1-5%) and occurrence of inhibitors is almost only seen in patients with severe hemophilia B. The understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism leading to the development of inhibitors in patients with hemophilia has improved considerably over the last 2 decades. Identification of early biomarkers which predict inhibitor development in previously untreated patients with hemophilia will assist in risk identification and possible early intervention strategies. In this review, we aim to summarize the molecular mechanisms of inhibitor development in hemophilia and to identify potential areas in need of further investigation."

    "abstract": "There has been an ongoing debate as to whether hemophilia A (HA) is more severe than hemophilia B (HB), and there are studies supporting each side of the argument. The study aimed to investigate whether any differences in major bleeding events exist between patients with severe HA and HB. A nationwide, population-based retrospective cohort study using the National Health Insurance Research Database was conducted. We compared 658 patients with severe HA and 137 patients with severe HB without inhibitors from 1997 to 2013, during the period when adult patients older than 18 years old were treated with the on-demand therapy since birth. There was no significant difference between patients with severe HA and HB in the rate of major bleeding events, with an adjusted relative ratio of 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36-1.71, <i>P</i> = .548). There was also no significant difference in the incidence rate of major bleeding events between adult patients with HA and HB with the on-demand therapy, and an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.65-1.02). However, patients with HA had a lower incidence rate of intracranial hemorrhage, with an adjusted HR of 0.44 (95% CI: 0.25-0.79). In addition, no significant difference in the frequency of major bleeding events requiring hospitalization between patients with HA and HB was found, <i>P</i> > .05. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that patients with severe HB encountered a similar rate of major bleeding events to those with severe HA."

Frequencies of 3-5% have been reported but most studies to date were small, including patients with different severities, and without prospective follow-up for inhibitor incidence. Study objective was to investigate inhibitor incidence in patients with SHB followed up to 500 exposure days (ED), the frequency of allergic reactions, and the relationship with genotypes. Consecutive previously untreated patients (PUPs) with SHB enrolled into the PedNet cohort were included. Detailed data was collected for the first 50 ED, followed by annual collection of inhibitor status and allergic reactions. Presence of inhibitors was defined by at least two consecutive positive samples. Additionally, data on factor IX gene mutation was collected. 154 PUPs with SHB were included; 75% were followed until 75 ED, and 43% until 500 ED. Inhibitors developed in 14 patients (7 high-titre). Median number of ED at inhibitor manifestation was 11 (IQR 6.5-36.5). Cumulative inhibitor incidence was 9.3% (95%CI 4.4-14.1) at 75 ED, and 10.2% (5.1-15.3) at 500 ED. Allergic reactions occurred in 4 (28.6%) inhibitor patients. Missense mutations were most frequent (46.8%) overall but not associated with inhibitors. Nonsense mutations and deletions with large structural changes comprised all mutations among inhibitor patients and were associated with an inhibitor risk of 26.9% and 33.3%, respectively. In an unselected, well-defined cohort of PUPs with SHB, cumulative inhibitor incidence was 10.2% at 500 ED. Nonsense mutations and large deletions were strongly associated with the risk of inhibitor development. The PedNet Registry is registered at clinicaltrials.gov; identifier: NCT02979119."

His maternal uncle presented slightly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (48.2 s) and mildly decreased FIX activity (15.2%). Molecular genetic analysis of F9 revealed that they were hemizygous for a novel missense mutation, c.157G>C (p.Glu53Gln). Our study widens the mutation spectrum of the FIX gene.

FIX is not bioavailable when given orally due to poor stability and permeability in the gastrointestinal tract. The feasibility of fusing FIX with transferrin (Tf) to enhance the oral bioavailability of FIX is explored. Seven recombinant fusion proteins (rFIX-Tf) with different linkers were constructed and expressed in HEK293 cells and characterized by in vitro transcytosis and transferrin receptor (TfR) binding assay in Caco-2 cells and a one-stage clotting assay. The in vivo efficacy study was performed using a tail-bleeding model in hemophilia B mice. Fusion proteins rFIX-Tf/G<sub>2</sub> and rFIX-Tf/SVSQ were most permeable and showed a specific binding ability to TfR in Caco-2 cells. Both proteins retained FIX activity in clotting generation. The in vivo efficacy study showed that both proteins by intravenous injection significantly reduced blood loss. Most significantly, rFIX-Tf/G<sub>2</sub> demonstrated anti-bleeding activity when administered orally. Our results showed that the fusion protein technique with Tf could be potentially used for oral delivery of FIX and the linker between FIX and Tf in the fusion protein is crucial. rFIX-Tf/G<sub>2</sub> appears to be the most promising fusion protein as potential oral therapeutics for hemophilia B."

    "title": "Treatment Options in Hemophilia.",
    "abstract": "Approximately 4550 persons were under treatment for hemophilia in Germany in 2017. The condition is currently treated with intravenous supplementa- tion of the missing clotting factor, either prophylactically or as needed. Newer treat- ment options rely on novel mechanisms of action. This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in MEDLINE/PubMed, as well as on expert opinions and the recommenda- tions of specialty societies. Randomized controlled trials have shown that, in children aged 30 months to 6 years, prophylactic clotting-factor supplementation yields a markedly lower an- nual rate of hemorrhage than supplementation as needed: 3.27 (standard deviation [SD] 6.24) for the former vs. 17.69 (SD 9.25) for the latter. A similar large effect was seen in patients aged 12 to 50 years, with hemorrhage rates of 1.9 (SD 4.1) vs. 28.7 (SD 18.8). Clotting-factor preparations with longer half-lives make it possible to lessen the frequency of administration and to prevent subtherapeutic factor levels. A number of alternatives to clotting-factor supplementation have recently been approved or are currently being clinically tested. These new drugs are injected sub- cutaneously and have a longer half-life, possibly enabling better protection against bleeding than the current standard treatment. A further advantage of some of these drugs is that they can be given even in the presence of inhibitors to factor VIII. In addition, initial (phase I) clinical trials of gene therapy have been performed suc- cessfully for both hemophilia A and hemophilia B. Now that new alternatives to classic supplementation therapy are be- coming available, pertinent treatment algorithms for patients with hemophilia will have to be developed. It is still unclear to what extent the new drugs might supplant clotting factor supplementation as the first line of treatment."

    "title": "A Molecular Revolution in the Treatment of Hemophilia.",
    "abstract": "For decades, the monogenetic bleeding disorders hemophilia A and B (coagulation factor VIII and IX deficiency) have been treated with systemic protein replacement therapy. Now, diverse molecular medicines, ranging from antibody to gene to RNA therapy, are transforming treatment. Traditional replacement therapy requires twice to thrice weekly intravenous infusions of factor. While extended half-life products may reduce the frequency of injections, patients continue to face a lifelong burden of the therapy, suboptimal protection from bleeding and joint damage, and potential development of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (inhibitors) that require less efficacious bypassing agents and further reduce quality of life. Novel non-replacement and gene therapies aim to address these remaining issues. A recently approved factor VIII-mimetic antibody accomplishes hemostatic correction in patients both with and without inhibitors. Antibodies against tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and antithrombin-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) target natural anticoagulant pathways to rebalance hemostasis. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy provides lasting clotting factor replacement and can also be used to induce immune tolerance. Multiple gene-editing techniques are under clinical or preclinical investigation. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of these approaches, explain how they differ from standard therapies, and predict how the hemophilia treatment landscape will be reshaped."

We performed a prospective study on PWH from Côte d'Ivoire to collect data into inhibitor prevalence, create a database of haemophilia genotypes, establish correlations between inhibitor presence and genetic variants identified amongst Ivoirian PWHs and evaluate exposure to CFCs. The study included 54 unrelated participants (43 severe, four moderate, two mild haemophilia A and five severe haemophilia B). PWH were treated on-demand with various product types for short periods, non-intensively, and using low-dose regimens. We reported similar distributions of intron 22 inversions (39.5%), point pathogenic variants (32.6%) and rearrangements in Ivoirian severe haemophilia A patients versus non-African ethnic groups. The haplotypes H1 (29.6%), H2 (36.3%) and H3 (34.1%) frequencies in haemophilia A were consistent with results published on African populations. We identified eight new causal variants. An inhibitor was found in 12% of haemophilia A patients previously exposed to replacement therapies. Among PWH with inhibitors, 66.7% had a positive intron 22 inversion and 50% the H1 haplotype. This study provides original data on molecular diagnosis of haemophilia, inhibitor prevalence and risk factors for inhibitor development previously associated with inhibitors in Côte d'Ivoire. The low inhibitor prevalence likely reflects the limited exposure to replacement therapy in Côte d'Ivoire. Further larger, multicentric and international studies are needed to gain more insight on inhibitor incidence and risk factors in African PWH."

However, the diversity of reagents and instruments has resulted in significant FIX assay variability. The accuracy of the one-stage clotting assay to measure recombinant FIX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) activity was evaluated by major Japanese hemophilia treatment centers and commercial laboratories that measure factor IX activity for a majority of hemophilia B patients in Japan. Plasma-derived FIX (pdFIX) and recombinant FIX (rFIX) products were used as comparators. FIX-deficient plasma was spiked with four levels of FIX products based on label potency and measured under blinded conditions by routine one-stage clotting assay procedures in 19 participating laboratories. Interlaboratory coefficient of variation and spike recovery were calculated. Interlaboratory coefficient of variation of rFIXFc was not significantly different from that of rFIX, but appeared larger than that of pdFIX. Mean spike recovery for rFIXFc was generally comparable to rFIX and pdFIX. However, larger discrepancies between pdFIX and rFIX were observed in three of nine laboratories using ellagic acid-based activated partial thromboplastin time reagents. Recombinant FIX Fc fusion protein activity was found to be similar to that of rFIX or pdFIX by the one-stage clotting assay. However, minimizing interlaboratory variability is vital for optimizing future patient care."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy offers the potential for a cure for patients with hemophilia by establishing continuous endogenous expression of factor VIII or factor IX (FIX) following transfer of a functional gene to replace the hemophilic patient's own defective gene. The hemophilias are ideally suited for gene therapy because a small increment in blood factor levels (≥5% of normal) is associated with significant amelioration of bleeding phenotype in severely affected patients. In 2011, the St. Jude/UCL phase 1/2 trial was the first to provide clear evidence of a stable dose-dependent increase in FIX levels in patients with severe hemophilia B following a single administration of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. Transgenic FIX expression has remained stable at ∼5% of normal in the high-dose cohort over a 7-year follow-up period, resulting in a substantial reduction in spontaneous bleeding and FIX protein usage without toxicity. This study has been followed by unparalleled advances in gene therapy for hemophilia A and B, leading to clotting factor activity approaching normal or near-normal levels associated with a \"zero bleed rates\" in previously severely affected patients following a single administration of AAV vectors. Thus, AAV gene therapies are likely to alter the treatment paradigm for hemophilia A and B. This review explores recent progress and the remaining limitations that need to be overcome for wider availability of this novel treatment of inherited bleeding disorders."

Secondary analysis was implemented on longitudinal web-based survey data (n = 323) from haemophilia A or haemophilia B caregivers. Person-reported outcomes (PROs) included the HCI, the PROMIS-10 and Ryff psychological well-being subscales. Predictors included caregiver demographics; patient haemophilia characteristics; exercise; adherence; and quality-of-life (QOL) appraisal processes as measured by the brief appraisal inventory (BAI) which yields composite scores assessing awareness of challenges, fulfillment and growth, stay positive, social comparison and interpersonal problem-solving. Second-order factor analysis, structural equation modelling and residual modelling were implemented. A structural equation model fit the data well that contained bifactor representation of well-being with a general factor comprised of environmental mastery, positive relations with others, physical functioning and emotional functioning. Positive emotions was modelled as a component of well-being, with a unique component ('Alchemy') characterized by its associations with stay positive, and awareness of challenges appraisals, and difficulty paying bills. Alchemy had positive linear relationships with the first two, and a positive quadratic relationship with difficulty paying bills. Adopting positive-focused ways of thinking about one's life limitations may transform the negatives of haemophilia caregiving into something positive. Such cognitive habits reflect an awareness and acceptance of the limitations imposed by haemophilia caregiving."

There is a range of therapeutic approaches including factor replacement, embolization, radiotherapy and a variety of surgical interventions. However, there remains little evidence regarding the most appropriate treatment. We aimed to evaluate the available options of management for the haemophilia-associated pseudotumour. A literature review was performed using relevant terminology and reviewed for treatment approaches and outcomes. The results demonstrated that most of the data is from single case reports with a small number of single- and multicentre case series. In total, 133 patients with 134 described pseudotumours were identified. Adequate haemostatic control with factor replacement was a key component to successful treatment. Surgical excision was the most commonly reported surgical intervention with various composites used for filling of the surgical cavity. The use of radiotherapy has been described particularly in the paediatric population and sites of difficult surgical access. Embolization can be considered as a method of presurgical optimization. Patients with both factor inhibitors and pseudotumours have poorer postoperative outcomes. This review demonstrates that although a lack of large-centre, randomized studies, timely surgical intervention with adequate haemostatic support and the consideration adjuvant therapies in selected cases can achieve acceptable outcomes in this cohort of patients."

To investigate the evolution of PopPK use in clinical practice by comparing blood sampling strategies, patient features, and factor group between initial and recent periods of WAPPS-Hemo availability.

We compared patient characteristics (age, body weight, haemophilia type), product type and dose, and blood sampling times between the time frames. Over 1900 eligible infusions were submitted to WAPPS-Hemo during the periods studied, with 85% representing FVIII concentrates. In the recent cohort, PK profiles were requested for younger patients (median age 18 vs 26 years), with increased proportional EHL FVIII use (29% vs 14% of infusions). High-use centres generally submitted fewer blood samples per infusion than non-high-use centres, although the number of samples collected by non-high-use centres decreased significantly over time. During both periods, blood sample timing was generally consistent with ISTH recommended windows.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the perioperative haemostatic efficacy and safety of pd-FVIIa/FX in haemophilia patients with inhibitors. We retrospectively reviewed 25 operation charts from 14 haemophilia patients with high-responding inhibitors using pd-FVIIa/FX during the perioperative period. Efficacy was evaluated by attending physicians and results divided into four groups (excellent, good, fair, and poor). The operation chart was provided by nine Japanese medical institutes with expertise in haemophilia management. Out of the total of 25 surgical procedures, 44% (11/25) were classified as major surgery and the remainders were minor surgeries. In all of the surgeries but one, rFVIIa and/or APCC were administered in combination or sequential method. In all cases except one, the haemostatic efficiency rate was judged as excellent or good by treating physicians for an overall efficacy rate of 96%. No thrombotic adverse effects were reported. This study's results suggest that both combination and sequential therapy of pd-FVIIa/FX and other bypassing agents are well tolerated and effective for the control of perioperative bleeding in haemophilia patients with high-responding inhibitors."

Compared with 2005, the proportion PWSH on prophylaxis increased from 90% to 98.8% in children and from 64% to 80.2% in adults. The use of plasma-derived factor concentrates decreased from >70% to 55.3% in children and to 55.1% in adults. Mean annual factor consumption in PWSH without inhibitor was higher in 2015 compared with 2005 (children with HA: 151,489 vs. 98,894; adults with HA: 217,151 vs. 151,394; children with HB: 105,200 vs. 64,256; adults with HB: 159,185 vs. 85,295). Median annualized bleeding (annualized bleeding rate, ABR) and joint bleeding rates (annualized joint bleeding rate, AJBR) in 2015 were 2 and 0 in children and 3 and 0 in adults, respectively. In 2015 only one child (1.2%) but 101 (53.2%) adults with severe haemophilia were anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) positive. The rate of anti-HCV positive patients with active hepatitis C dropped from 63.8% to 12.9%. Within the last decade more patients with severe haemophilia were switched to a prophylactic regimen going along with a moderate increase in factor consumption achieving a low ABR and AJBR."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy for severe hemophilia B is advancing and offers sustained disease amelioration with a single treatment. We have reported the efficacy and safety of AMT-060, an investigational gene therapy comprising an adeno-associated virus serotype 5 capsid encapsidating the codon-optimized wild-type human factor IX (WT h<i>FIX</i>) gene with a liver-specific promoter, in patients with severe hemophilia B. Treatment with 2 × 10<sup>13</sup> gc/kg AMT-060 showed sustained and durable FIX activity of 3%-13% and a substantial reduction in spontaneous bleeds without T cell-mediated hepatoxicity. To achieve higher FIX activity, we modified AMT-060 to encode the R338L \"Padua\" <i>FIX</i> variant that has increased specific activity (AMT-061). We report the safety and increased FIX activity of AMT-061 in non-human primates. Animals (n = 3/group) received intravenous AMT-060 (5 × 10<sup>12</sup> gc/kg), AMT-061 (ranging from 5 × 10<sup>11</sup> to 9 × 10<sup>13</sup> gc/kg), or vehicle. Human FIX protein expression, FIX activity, and coagulation markers including D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin complexes were measured. At equal doses, AMT-060 and AMT-061 resulted in similar human FIX protein expression, but FIX activity was 6.5-fold enhanced using AMT-061. Both vectors show similar safety and transduction profiles. Thus, AMT-061 holds great promise as a more potent FIX replacement gene therapy with a favorable safety profile."

    "abstract": "Etranacogene dezaparvovec (AMT-061) is a recombinant AAV5 vector including a gene cassette containing the factor IX (FIX) Padua variant under the control of a liver-specific promoter. A phase 2b study was conducted to confirm that a single dose of 2 × 1013 genome copies per kilogram of etranacogene dezaparvovec will result in FIX activity ≥5% 6 weeks after dosing. Secondary end points included FIX activity at other time points, bleed frequency, FIX replacement, and safety. Etranacogene dezaparvovec was administered as a single IV infusion to 3 adults with severe to moderately severe hemophilia B. Before treatment, participants had low levels of preexisting neutralizing antibodies to AAV5. This article reports a planned 26-week interim assessment. At week 6, mean FIX activity was 31% (23.9%-37.8%), increasing to 47% (33.2%-57.0%) at 26 weeks, with 2 subjects exhibiting sustained activity >40%. Consistent with the FIX activity, etranacogene dezaparvovec was associated with a complete bleed cessation with no need for FIX replacement therapy up to 26 weeks. Etranacogene dezaparvovec was generally well tolerated. No clinically significant elevations in levels of liver enzymes or inflammatory markers were observed, and no use of corticosteroids related to treatment was required. In individuals with severe to moderately severe hemophilia B, etranacogene dezaparvovec resulted in clinically relevant increases in FIX activity, cessation of bleeds, and abrogation of the need for FIX replacement, despite the presence of preexisting anti-AAV5 neutralizing antibodies detected by using a highly sensitive luciferase assay. Consistency of results in the 3 participants supported an expanded evaluation of the safety/efficacy of etranacogene dezaparvovec in the HOPE-B (Health Outcomes With Padua Gene; Evaluation in Hemophilia-B) phase 3 trial. The current trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03489291."

    "abstract": "Replacement therapy with recombinant drugs is the main therapeutic strategy for hemophilia B patients. To reduce the production costs of recombinant coagulation factors, improvement of their expression and activity by enhancement of γ-carboxylation might be of interest. The expression and functional activity of vitamin K-dependent (VKD) coagulation proteins rely, in part, on the VKD process of γ-carboxylation that is mediated by the enzymes γ-carboxylase and vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR). Since the recombinant production of VKD proteins is hampered by the inefficiency of this enzymatic process, we specifically have examined the stable expression of functional blood coagulation factor IX (FIX) in HEK293 cells following transient overexpression of VKORC1 as an important part of VKOR component. Recombinant hFIX-producing human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were transfected to overexpress VKORC1. Following reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, expression efficiency of the active hFIX was analyzed by performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and coagulation test. In addition, to quantify γ-carboxylated recombinant FIX, the barium citrate method was used. Overexpression of VKORC1 in FIX-producing HEK cells, resulting in a 3.2-fold higher expression of functional FIX, which displayed a 1.4-fold enhanced specific activity. Moreover, a 3.9-fold enhanced recovery of fully γ-carboxylated FIX following barium citrate adsorption was achieved. Collectively, these findings indicate that the overexpression of VKORC1 results in the production of higher levels of functional hFIX in HEK293 cells. The increase of the VKORC1 as a supplier of γ-carboxylase seems to play a significant role in increasing the amount and efficiency of recombinant FIX production, thereby reducing the production costs."

    "abstract": "Patients with haemophilia A (HA) or B (HB) experience spontaneous limb- or life-threatening bleedings which are prevented by regular prophylactic intravenous infusions of the deficient coagulation factor (FVIII or FIX). Prophylaxis with subcutaneous long-acting non-factor products that improve in vivo thrombin generation is now under intensive investigation (concizumab, fitusiran) or successfully employed (emicizumab) in haemophilia patients. Both haemophilia patients with/without inhibitors take advantage of non-factor products employed alone. In those who also need bypassing agents (or FVIII concentrates) for breakthrough bleeds, thromboembolic events and/or thrombotic microangiopathy may occur. By enhancing thrombin generation, prothrombotic mutations co-segregating with FVIII/FIX gene mutations may trigger thrombotic episodes in HA patients carrying acquired thrombogenic factors (e.g. venous catheters). A thorough knowledge of individual needs increasingly contributed to improve comprehensive care and personalize treatments in haemophilia. Integrating genomics, lifestyle and environmental data is expected to be key to: 1) identify which haemophilia patients are less likely to benefit from a given intervention; 2) define optimal dosing and scheduling of bypassing agents (or FVIII) to employ in combination with non-factor products; 3) establish tests to monitor in vivo thrombin generation; 4) improve communication and deliver results to individuals. As individual outcomes will be improved and the risk of adverse events minimized, non-factor products will come into wider use within the haemophilia community, and patients will hopefully have no more risks of breakthrough bleeds. The risks of a normal life for a \"former haemophilia patient\" is likely to change the treatment landscape and the structure of haemophilia Centers."

Replacement therapy with clotting factor concentrates is the mainstay of treatment. Unlike in patients with HB, anaphylaxis in patients with HA is extremely rare. A retrospective study of prospectively collected data on patients with hemophilia who experienced anaphylaxis was conducted in our center. Demographic and clinical data were collected, and laboratory workups that included thrombin generation were conducted. Our first patient underwent successful immune tolerance induction (ITI) following the administration of rituximab. The second patient was transitioned to emicizumab. The third patient receives recombinant activated VIIa (rFVIIa) on demand. Thrombin generation was performed following current medical management protocols for supporting hemostasis. Our case series illustrates the difficulty in managing patients with anaphylaxis to replacement therapy. In the era of novel therapies, such as emicizumab, the management of HA patients who experience anaphylaxis to replacement therapy is becoming easier and may obviate the need for ITI. Current treatment strategies for HB patients with such anaphylaxis, however, are limited to rFVIIa, and it continues to pose a challenge."

However, there is a requirement for in-depth and comprehensive studies. This study aimed to analyse the evidence regarding the effects of exercise in PWH through an umbrella review of existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The secondary objective was to analyse the quality of the evidence. This umbrella review followed the PRISMA guidelines and was documented in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42019140785). We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, CINAHL and Cochrane Library databases. The methodological quality of the systematic reviews was assessed using AMSTAR 2. Out of a total of 1030 systematic reviews, 10 fulfilled the criteria. Only one study was classified as high quality, and half of the selected studies were classified as low or critically low quality according to AMSTAR 2. Furthermore, most reviews investigated the effects of strength training and aquatic training, with positive results associated with low adverse events. Range of motion, strength and pain were the most investigated variables. All reviews showed overlapping studies. Exercise is an effective way to treat haemophilia and has a low incidence of related adverse events. However, caution is needed in the interpretation of the results due to half of the selected reviews showed low or critically low quality and only one have high quality."

To validate the expression of corrected F9, we attempted to induce the differentiation of iPSCs toward hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) in vitro. We successfully repaired a disease-causing mutation in HB in patient-derived iPSCs. The transcription product of corrected F9 was confirmed in HLCs differentiated from gene-corrected iPSCs.

Given that there are multiple clinical trials completed and ongoing in this field, it is important to review the clinical evidence, particularly as a range of AAV-vector serotypes including AAV2, AAV5, AAV8, and AAV10 have been tested. Although there have been a number of successful trials, the development of two investigational AAV vectors for hemophilia B has been discontinued because they did not meet efficacy and/or safety expectations. Whether this difference between success and failure of gene transfer approaches reflects capsid choice, vector design, manufacturing system, or other variables is a question of great interest. Here, we examine the body of evidence across trials to determine the possible influences of serotype choice on key clinical outcomes such as safety, vector clearance, treatment eligibility, occurrence of transaminase elevations, activation of capsid-directed cytotoxic T cell responses, and clinical efficacy. In summary, gene transfer requires a balance between achieving sufficient transgene expression and minimizing destructive immune responses, which may be affected by AAV-vector serotype choice."

Plasma FIX activity level, assessed by chromogenic assay, was up to fourfold higher for hFIX-E456H compared with hFIX-WT and was not different compared with hFIX-R384L, among the three dose cohorts. Overall, the in vivo specific activity was increased by threefold for hFIX-E456H and 4.9-fold for hFIX-R384L compared with hFIX-WT. At the lower dose of 5 × 10<sup>9</sup> vg, the blood loss was significantly lower for hFIX-E456H compared with hFIX-WT, but did not differ compared with hFIX-R384L.

Previously, a thrombin-activatable FX variant with fibrinopeptide-A replacing the activation peptide (FX-delAP/FpA) has been described in this regard. Here we show that FX-delAP/FpA is characterized by a sixfold shorter circulatory half-life compared with wild-type FX, limiting its therapeutical applicability. We therefore designed a variant in which the FpA sequence is inserted C-terminal to the FX activation peptide (FX/FpA). FX/FpA displayed a similar survival to wt-FX in clearance experiments and could be converted into FX by thrombin and other activating agents. In in vitro assays, FX/FpA efficiently restored thrombin generation in hemophilia A and hemophilia B plasmas, even in the presence of inhibitory antibodies. Expression following hydrodynamic gene transfer of FX/FpA restored thrombus formation in FVIII-deficient mice in a laser-induced injury model as well as hemostasis in a tail-clip bleeding model. Hemostasis after tail transection in FVIII-deficient mice was also corrected at 5 and 90 minutes after injection of purified FX/FpA. Our data indicate that FX/FpA represents a potential tenase-bypassing agent for the treatment of hemophilia patients with or without inhibitors."

However, these patients and their families continue to report psychosocial problems regarding pregnancy and childbirth. In a situation where there is little medical support for haemophilia carriers (HCs), parents must inform their children regarding their possibility of being HCs. This study aimed to elucidate intentions and challenges among mothers with daughters who may be HCs, regarding providing them with carrier risk communication (RC). Study participants were mothers with daughters who have the possibility of being HCs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 mothers and were fully transcribed. The analysis was undertaken using a grounded theory-informed approach, through a process of repeated inductive and deductive qualitative coding. The study included 14 mothers who had already provided RC to their daughters, five who had not yet provided RC but who intended to do so, and one with no intention of providing RC. Mothers who had already provided RC included those who were not troubled and those who experienced psychological difficulties regarding the RC. Participants who had not provided RC experienced difficulties with 'not knowing what to do' and feelings of 'anxiety due to uncertainty' and reported not knowing the best RC method or timing. The study revealed a need for support for persons experiencing difficulties with informing their daughters of their possibility of being HCs. Healthcare professionals can advise parents to reduce the burden of providing carrier RC to their daughters."

Although there are various approaches to increasing the activity of rFIX, targeted protein engineering of specific residues could result in increased rFIX activity through enhanced γ-carboxylation. Specific amino acids in the propeptide sequence of vitamin K-dependent proteins are known to play a role in the interaction with the enzyme γ-carboxylase. The net hydrophobicity and charge of the γ-carboxylic recognition site (γ-CRS) region in the propeptide are important determinants of γ-carboxylase binding. So the contribution of individual γ-CRS residues to the expression of fully γ-carboxylated and active FIX was studied. Propeptide residues at positions -14, -13, or - 12 were substituted for equivalent prothrombin amino acids by SEOing PCR. The recombinant FIX variants were transfected and stably expressed in Drosophila S2 cells, and the expression of both total FIX protein and active FIX was assessed. While overall the substitutions resulted in an increase of both total FIX protein expression as well as an increase in the portion of active FIX, the highest increase in FIX protein expression, FIX activity, and specific FIX activity was observed following the simultaneous substitution of residues at positions -12, -13, and - 14. The enhanced rFIX activity was further confirmed by enrichment for functional, fully γ-carboxylated rFIX species via barium citrate adsorption. Our findings indicate that by increasing both the net charge and the net hydrophobicity of the FIX γ-CRS region, the expression of fully γ-carboxylated and as such active FIX is enhanced.

We discuss strengths and limitations of these assays, providing examples of clinical scenarios to highlight some of the challenges associated with their current use for diagnostic and monitoring purposes. Substantial inter-laboratory variability has been reported for one-stage assays when measuring the activity of factor replacement products due to the wide range of currently available aPTT reagents, calibration standards, factor-deficient plasmas, assay conditions and instruments. Chromogenic activity assays may avoid some limitations associated with one-stage assays, but their regulatory status, perceived higher cost, and lack of laboratory expertise may influence their use. Haemophilia management guidelines recommend the differential application of one or both assays for initial diagnosis and disease severity characterisation, post-infusion monitoring and replacement factor potency labelling. Efficient communication between clinical and laboratory staff is crucial to ensure application of the most appropriate assay to each clinical situation, correct interpretation of assay results and, ultimately, accurate diagnosis and optimal and safe treatment of haemophilia A or B patients."

For this mode of therapy to be widely applicable, it is crucial to develop high transduction and permeating vectors that infect the target at significantly low doses. Because glycosylation of capsid proteins is known to be rate limiting in the life cycle of many viruses, we reasoned that perturbation of glycosylation sites in AAV2 capsid will enhance gene delivery. In our first set experiments, pharmacological modulation of the glycosylation status in host cells, modestly decreased (1-fold) AAV2 packaging efficacy while it improved their gene expression (∼74%) in vitro. We then generated 24 mutant AAV2 vectors modified to potentially create or disrupt a glycosylation site in its capsid. Three of them demonstrated a 1.3-2.5-fold increase in transgene expression in multiple cell lines (HeLa, Huh7, and ARPE-19). Hepatic gene transfer of these vectors in hemophilia B mice, resulted in a 2-fold increase in human coagulation factor (F)IX levels, while its T/B-cell immunogenic response was unaltered. Subsequently, intravitreal gene transfer of glycosylation site-modified vectors in C57BL6/J mice demonstrated an increase in green fluorescence protein expression (∼2- to 4-fold) and enhanced permeation across retina. Subretinal administration of these modified vectors containing RPE65 gene further rescued the photoreceptor response in a murine model of Leber congenital amarousis.

To further investigate the bone healing following hemarthrosis in hemophilia we examined a two week time course using microCT, serum chemistry, and histological analysis. Elevated ratio of osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL), increased osterix<sup>+</sup> osteoblastic cells, and decreased smoothness of the cortical bone surface were evident within several days of injury, indicative of acute heterotopic mineralization along the cortical surface. This was closely followed by increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, increased osteoclast numbers, and significant trabecular bone loss. Uncoupled and disorganized bone formation and resorption continued for the duration of the study resulting in significant deterioration of the joint. Further elucidation of the shared mechanisms underlying abnormal bone homeostasis in the absence of FVIII or FIX is needed to guide evidence-based approaches to the screening and treatment of the prevalent bone defects in hemophilia A and B."

    "title": "Electromyographic and Safety Comparisons of Common Lower Limb Rehabilitation Exercises for People With Hemophilia.",
    "abstract": "Ankles and knees are commonly affected in people with hemophilia and thus are targets for prevention or rehabilitation. However, to our knowledge, no studies have evaluated muscle activity and safety during exercises targeting the lower limbs in people with hemophilia; this lack of information hinders clinical decision-making. The aim of this study was to compare the tolerability of, safety of, and muscle activity levels obtained with external resistance (elastic or machine)-based and non-external resistance-based lower limb exercises in people with hemophilia. This was a cross-sectional study. Eleven people who had severe hemophilia and were undergoing prophylactic treatment participated. In a single experimental session, participants performed knee extension and ankle plantar flexion during 3 exercise conditions in random order: elastic band-based resistance (elastic resistance), machine-based resistance (machine resistance), and no external resistance. Exercise intensities for the 2 external resistance-based conditions were matched for perceived exertion. Muscle activity was determined using surface electromyography (EMG) for the rectus femoris, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius lateralis, and tibialis anterior muscles. Participants were asked to rate exercise tolerability according to a scale ranging from \"very well tolerated\" to \"not tolerated\" and to report possible adverse effects 24 and 48 hours after the session. No adverse effects were reported, and exercise tolerability was generally high. In the knee extension exercise, the rectus femoris normalized EMG values during the elastic resistance and machine resistance conditions were similar; 29% to 30% higher activity was obtained during these conditions than during the non-external resistance condition. In the ankle plantar flexion exercise, the gastrocnemius lateralis normalized EMG value was 34% higher during the machine resistance condition than without external resistance, and the normalized EMG values during the elastic resistance and other conditions were similar. The small sample size and single training session were the primary limitations of this study. Exercises performed both with elastic bands and with machines at moderate intensity are safe, feasible, and efficient in people with severe hemophilia, providing comparable activity levels in the agonist muscles."

    "title": "Disease-related distress among adults with haemophilia: A qualitative study.",
    "abstract": "Distress related to disease burden has been defined and described among people with chronic diseases including diabetes and cancer. In these populations, disease-specific distress is associated with health outcomes. Haemophilia-related distress is less understood. To identify qualitative features of haemophilia-related distress among affected adults to ultimately inform the creation of a measurement tool. Adults with haemophilia A or B associated with a large haemophilia treatment centre in the south-eastern U.S. were recruited to participate in this qualitative study. Fifteen participants completed semi-structured telephone interviews. Interviews lasted 1-2 hours and explored experiences of distress related to various aspects of haemophilia. Interviews were audio taped, transcribed and coded using NVIVO, software for organizing, managing and analysing qualitative data. Coding was deductive and inductive, and the analysis was thematic. Haemophilia-related distress was broadly related to feelings of isolation and vulnerability which incorporated health system factors, physical functioning, caretaker roles and psychological considerations. Specific features associated with haemophilia-related distress included lack of trust in the knowledge of haemophilia and care provided by staff in community healthcare settings, concerns about the future such as health insurance access and ageing/disability, long-standing feelings of being different from others and feeling like an outsider, treatment burdens and fear of acute bleeds. Protective factors included supportive relationships with family, friends and haemophilia care teams through which participants received practical and emotional support. Features of haemophilia-related distress were identified. Results will facilitate distress measurement and intervention efforts to reduce distress in adults with haemophilia."

    "abstract": "Pain, anxiety, depression, and other aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are important issues for people with hemophilia and caregivers of children with hemophilia. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments may be used to assess aspects of HRQoL; however, the use of PROs in clinical management of patients with hemophilia is limited and inconsistent. The Bridging Hemophilia B Experiences, Results and Opportunities Into Solutions (B-HERO-S) study evaluated the impact of hemophilia B on HRQoL and other psychosocial aspects in affected adults and caregivers of children with hemophilia B. This post hoc analysis assessed correlations between PRO scores and psychosocial questions commonly asked in comprehensive care settings among B-HERO-S respondents. B-HERO-S consisted of two online surveys, one administered to adults with hemophilia B (n=299) and one administered to caregivers of children with hemophilia B (n=150). The adult survey included EQ-5D-5L with visual analog scale, BPI, HAL, and PHQ-9. The caregiver survey included PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Questions related to demographics, hemophilia treatment, and psychosocial questions asked in comprehensive care visits were also included in the surveys. A post hoc analysis was performed to assess correlations between responses to selected psychosocial questions with PRO scores. For adults with hemophilia B, greater pain severity and pain interference scores were associated with work-related problems, functional limitations, and relationship, psychological, and treatment issues. Significant correlations were also noted between some of these psychosocial outcomes and depressive symptoms. For caregivers, greater depression and anxiety were associated with employment issues, their child's functional, relationship, and psychological issues, having had difficulty or concerns with treatment/factor availability or affordability, and having less frequent HTC visits. High correlations were observed between PRO scores measuring pain, depression, and anxiety and questions commonly used in the comprehensive care setting to assess the psychosocial impact of hemophilia."

    "title": "Correlation of Body Mass Index with Pelvis and Lumbar Spine Alignment in Sagittal Plane in Hemophilia Patients.",
    "abstract": "<i>Introduction:</i> Concern about weight gain among people has been high due to negative health consequences in addition to the increasing prevalence of the problem. Overweight and obesity also occur in patients with hemophilia. Analysis of literature shows that increased body weight might have a biomechanical effect on the spatial orientation of the pelvis and the lumbar spine. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between body mass index (BMI) and the parameters characterizing the alignment of the sacrum (SS, sacral slope), the pelvis (PT, pelvic tilt; PI, pelvic incidence) and the angle value of lumbar lordosis (LL, lumbar lordosis) assessed in the sagittal plane among patients with hemophilia. <i>Materials and methods:</i> A total of 49 patients were subjected to the study, 23 of whom met the inclusion criteria. Body weight and height were measured. Measurement of the angle values of indicators characterizing the position of the lumbar-pelvic complex was established based on X-ray imaging analysis. <i>Results:</i> Analysis of the correlation between the BMI and sacral, pelvic, and lumbar indicators evaluated in the sagittal plane in the study group of patients with hemophilia showed a correlation between BMI and SS (<i>r</i> = 0.48). SS values were significantly and positively related to PI (<i>r</i> = 0.6; <i>p</i> = 0.002) and LL (<i>r</i> = 0.46; <i>p</i> = 0.02). The results obtained indicate the BMI relationship with the setting of the sacrum in the sagittal plane (SS). After adjusting for the knee flexion contracture, the correlation on the border of significance (<i>b</i> = 0.73, <i>p</i> = 0.07) between the body mass index and the spatial orientation of the pelvis and the spine was revealed. <i>Conclusion:</i> We hypothesize that increased body weight among people with hemophilia might have an effect on the positioning of the lumbosacral region. Therefore, it is believed that preventing obesity among people with hemophilia can contribute to a smaller number of intra-articular hemorrhages and better orthopedic condition of the limb joints, and thus could avoid changes in the lumbosacral region as well as their consequences."

    "title": "Patient-centred care in haemophilia: Patient perspectives on visualization and participation in decision-making.",
    "abstract": "The British Columbia Adult Haemophilia Team recently adopted a patient-centred care approach. The team presented visual information on an individual's pharmacokinetic profile and bleed history and encouraged patients to participate in treatment decisions. This qualitative study explored how this approach changed patients' understanding of haemophilia and how it facilitated them to make treatment decisions. We interviewed 18 males with mild, moderate or severe haemophilia, using a convenience sample from the adult haemophilia clinic at St. Paul's hospital in Vancouver, Canada. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and analyzed using descriptive content analysis. Most participants reported that reviewing visual information with the Clinic Team helped them in their communication with their care providers during their annual review clinic appointment. Despite this improved communication, for some the most important feature of their treatment was that they had switched from on-demand treatment to prophylactic treatment in recent years and were able to prevent bleeds. Almost half of the participants reported that the visual information presented increased their understanding of haemophilia and the pharmacokinetics of coagulation factor. Three patients improved their treatment adherence or had changed their prophylaxis schedules based on this. Most participants felt that they were involved in decision-making about their treatment schedule, which they appreciated. On the other hand, two participants thought the Clinic Team should make these decisions. Participants perceived the patient-centred prophylaxis approach helpful because it enhanced communication with the Clinic Team, increased their understanding of haemophilia and pharmacokinetics of coagulation factor and facilitated treatment decisions."

    "title": "Hemophilia - Impact of Recent Advances on Management.",
    "abstract": "There have been numerous advances in the field of hemophilia management in the past decade, including long acting factor products, non-factor products, and potentially curative interventions such as gene therapy. Each of these interventions introduces exciting treatment modalities to patients with both hemophilia A and B, however they also pose a daunting array of possible management options. Adverse reactions to novel agents are being reported as more patients are treated and long-term sustainability of interventions such as gene therapy is yet to be determined. The practicing hematologist should be aware of the intricacies involved in customizing care for their individual patients and be aware of the monitoring strategies for each interventional strategy to avoid adverse events. Upfront cost vs. long term benefit should be considered as choices of treatment strategies are made, especially in resource poor countries. The goal of the newer agents is to decrease annualized bleed rates and avoid debilitating arthropathy. This article looks at current treatment models for prophylaxis and management of inhibitors, reviews the recent advances in the field (with bioengineered factor products, non-factor products and gene therapy) and summarizes the incorporation of these new interventions in the treatment plan for patients with hemophilia."

    "abstract": "The research was conducted at a UK teaching hospital and Haemophilia Comprehensive Care Centre (CCC) as part of a research programme investigating physiotherapy for acute bleed management. The aim of the study was to understand the perspectives of people with haemophilia (PWH) on validated outcome measures (OM) and whether these measures capture changes relevant to them whilst recovering from an acute bleed episode. Any person with haemophilia registered to the CCC who reported an acute bleed within the past 2 years was invited to participate. Semi-structured interviews or workshops (activity-focused discussions with small groups) were conducted with PWH who had received physiotherapy treatment in the previous two years. These were used to explore opinions of PWH of commonly used outcome measures. Eight male PWH participated, mean age 61 years, ranging between 39 and 71. Seven participants had severe haemophilia A and 1 had von Willebrands. Participants described numerical rating scales of pain as abstract and expressed a preference for verbal or visual descriptors. In relation to function, the men generally found haemophilia-specific OM to be more relevant. The EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ5D-5L) and Haemophilia and Exercise Project Test Questionnaire (HEP-Test-Q) were considered as good measures due to brevity and ability to capture relevant changes promptly. Participants in this study reported a preference for short OMs that allow them to reference their ability during the acute bleed episode in comparison with their normal function."

For these reasons prophylactic treatment is nowadays considered a gold standard in the treatment of severe hemophilia A or B. Despite its benefits in terms of preventing bleeding and preserving patients' health, this intensive treatment is not always adhered to by patients with hemophilia - promotion of adherence should involve a multidisciplinary team which addresses not only the clinical aspects of a condition but also the different psychosocial aspects affecting patients and their (social, family and healthcare) environment."

    "abstract": "Rare bleeding disorders (RBDs) comprise of heterogeneous coagulation factor deficiencies and platelet disorders that are underreported worldwide. First report on RBD data from United States haemophilia treatment center network (USHTCN). A national surveillance system for the federally recognized USHTCN developed in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and American Thrombosis and Haemostasis Network (ATHN) was queried for patients with RBDs. Patient counts were extracted from the HTC Population Profile (HTC PP) component including limited data on patients followed through the USHTCN, and from the Registry component, including patient authorized, detailed clinical data. The prevalence of RBDs in the United States was estimated based on the HTC PP data and compared to the expected national prevalence based on data extrapolated from Orphanet, an international registry. Based on the estimated prevalence of RBD in the overall 2017 US population, the cases in the HTC network were lower than expected for FI, FII, FX, and FV + FVIII deficiencies by 36%, 61%, 75% and 94%, respectively, and higher than expected for FXIII, FV, FVII, and FXI deficiencies by 7%, 14%, 33% and 185%, respectively. The proportion of RBD patients reported in the HTC PP, enrolled in the Registry, was 10.8%. There is a clear need to identify individuals with RBDs who could benefit from the comprehensive care provided in the USHTCN. In addition, increased enrolment of people with all RBDs in the Registry is needed to improve knowledge of treatment outcomes of patients with RBDs in the United States."

    "abstract": "Prior to a surgical intervention, the examination of patient coagulation disorders is unfortunately often underestimated. While patients with a haemophilia A or B are usually aware of the congenital tendency to bleed, disorders of increased blood coagulation, thrombophilia, are frequently undetected. Therefore, complications caused by thromboses and embolisms after total hip arthroplasty are far more common than uncontrollable post-operative bleeding. Patients with liver cirrhosis are considered to be particularly complicated and their coagulation status can be difficult to manage. This article describes the most common pathological coagulation disorders and provides information to identify them preoperatively. Furthermore, surgical strategy considerations for the use of certain implant types in this patient group are discussed."

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based liver gene therapy has been shown to be clinically successful. However, the presence of circulating neutralizing antibodies (NABs) against AAV vector capsids remains a major challenge as it may prevent successful transduction of the target cells. Therefore, there is a need to develop strategies that would enable AAV-mediated gene delivery to patients with preexisting anti-AAV NABs. In the current study, the feasibility of using an immunoadsorption (IA) procedure for repeated, liver-targeted gene delivery in nonhuman primates was explored. The animals were administered IV with recombinant AAV5 (rAAV5) carrying the reporter gene human secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (hSEAP). Seven weeks after the first rAAV treatment, all of the animals were readministered with rAAV5 carrying the therapeutic hemophilia B gene human factor IX (hFIX). Half of the animals administered with rAAV5-hSEAP underwent IA prior to the second rAAV5 exposure. The transduction efficacies of rAAV5-hSEAP and rAAV5-hFIX were assessed by measuring the levels of hSEAP and hFIX proteins. Although no hFIX was detected after rAAV5-hFIX readministration without prior IA, all animals submitted to IA showed therapeutic levels of hFIX expression, and a threshold of anti-AAV5 NAB levels compatible with successful readministration was demonstrated. In summary, our data demonstrate that the use of a clinically applicable IA procedure enables successful readministration of an rAAV5-based gene transfer in a clinically relevant animal model. Finally, the analysis of anti-AAV NAB levels in human subjects submitted to IA confirmed the safety and efficacy of the procedure to reduce anti-AAV NABs. Furthermore, clinical translation was assessed using an immunoglobulin G assay as surrogate."

    "abstract": "Operations on patients with hemophilia A and B are complex. Studies evaluating postoperative outcomes and costs following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients with hemophilia are limited. A retrospective review of the entire Medicare dataset from 2005 to 2014 was performed. International Classification of Disease 9th revision codes were used to identify patients with hemophilia A and B and they were matched to controls using a 1:1 random matching process based on age, gender, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and select comorbidity burden. The 90-day preoperative period was evaluated for comorbidities and the 90-day postoperative period was analyzed for outcomes and reimbursements. Logistic regression models were generated to compare outcomes between cases and controls. A total of 4,034 patients with hemophilia were identified as having undergone TKA. About 44.8% were between the ages of 65 and 74 and 62.4% were female. Although the CCI was identical in both cohorts, individual comorbidities not controlled for varied significantly. Medical complications were more frequent among the patients with hemophilia: postoperative bleeding (odds ratio [OR]: 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-2.3), deep venous thrombosis (OR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.8-2.8), pulmonary embolism (OR: 2.9; 95% CI: 2.1-3.9), and blood transfusions (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.6-1.9). Hemophilia was associated with higher odds of periprosthetic infection (1.78 vs. 0.98%, OR: 1.8 95% CI: 1.2-2.7). The 90-day reimbursements were higher for patients with hemophilia (mean: $22,249 vs. $13,017, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Medicare beneficiaries with a diagnosis of hemophilia experience more frequent postoperative complications and incur greater 90-day costs than matched controls following TKA. Surgeons should consider this when optimizing patients for TKA and payors should consider this for risk-adjusting payment models."

Most (88%) of the 299 adults completing the survey had mild to moderate hemophilia B. Of those, 54% were married or in a long-term relationship, and 44% were single. Most adults (87%) reported that hemophilia affected their ability to form close relationships with partners or prospective partners; 35% were very/quite dissatisfied with the support received from a previous partner. Nearly all participants (98%) were very/quite satisfied with the support received from their current partner. Most were very/quite satisfied with the support from family (87%) and friends (96%). Most participants reported a negative reaction or experience as a result of disclosing their hemophilia (friend/colleague/employer, 76%/80%/82%, respectively). Of 150 caregivers of children with mostly mild to moderate hemophilia (74%), 89% were married or in a long-term relationship, and most felt very well/quite supported by their partner (98%) and family (92%). Most felt very/quite satisfied with the support of teachers (94%), children at school (80%), and other adults in regular contact (72%). Most caregivers reported negative experiences telling a friend (76%) or having their child tell a friend (69%) about the child's hemophilia; 43% reported that their child was bullied because of his/her hemophilia. Although the impact of severe hemophilia on relationships has been reported in HERO and other studies, B-HERO-S suggested that mild to moderate hemophilia B also significantly influences relationships of affected men/women and boys/girls, especially in disclosing their diagnosis, selecting a partner, and feeling bullied by peers/colleagues."
