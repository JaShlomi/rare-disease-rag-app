    "title": "The Hidden Burden: Gastrointestinal Involvement in Lysosomal Storage Disorders.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are rare inherited metabolic diseases characterized by defects in lysosomal enzyme function or membrane transport. These defects lead to substrate accumulation and multisystemic manifestations. This review focuses on gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in LSDs, which is a significant but often overlooked aspect of these disorders. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of GI manifestations in several LSDs, including Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, Pompe disease, Niemann-Pick disease type C, mucopolysaccharidoses and Wolman disease. The pathogenesis of GI involvement in LSDs varies and encompasses substrate accumulation in enterocytes, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, mass effects, smooth muscle dysfunction, vasculopathy, neuropathy, inflammation and alterations to the microbiota. Clinical presentations range from non-specific symptoms, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea and malabsorption, to more severe complications, such as protein-losing enteropathy and inflammatory bowel disease. Diagnosis often requires a high level of suspicion, as GI symptoms may precede the diagnosis of the underlying LSD or be misattributed to more common conditions. Management strategies include disease-specific treatments, such as enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy, as well as supportive care and targeted interventions for specific GI complications. This review highlights the importance of recognizing and properly managing GI manifestations in LSDs to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. It also emphasizes the need for further research to develop more effective treatments for life-threatening GI complications associated with these rare genetic disorders."

    "title": "Analysis of the Effect of Demographic Variables on Lysosomal Enzyme Activities in the Missouri Newborn Screening Program.",
    "abstract": "Newborn screening laboratories are increasingly adding lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), such as Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) and Pompe disease, to their screening panels. Without newborn screening, LSDs are frequently diagnosed only after the onset of symptoms; late detection can lead to profound and irreversible organ damage and mortality. While screening of these disorders has accelerated over the past five years, there is little published information regarding the potential correlation of demographic variables (age at sample collection, birthweight, gestational age, gender, etc.) with lysosomal enzyme activity. The Missouri State Public Health Laboratory prospectively screened more than 475,000 newborns for MPS I, Pompe disease, Gaucher disease, and Fabry disease between 15 January 2013 and 15 May 2018. This report investigates trends between several demographic variables and activities of four lysosomal enzymes: α-L-iduronidase (IDUA), acid α-glucosidase (GAA), acid β-glucocerebrosidase (GBA), and acid α-galactosidase (GLA). This information provides a valuable resource to newborn screening laboratories for the implementation of screening for lysosomal storage disorders and the establishment of screening cutoffs."

    "title": "Gaucher disease Type 3: classification of the chronic neuronopathic variant informed by genotype in a phenotypically diverse cohort.",
    "abstract": "Type 3 Gaucher disease, the chronic neuronopathic form caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in GBA1, is clinically heterogeneous and there have been few comprehensive studies of its natural history and phenotypic diversity. The greatest unmet clinical need is for disease-modifying treatment for the neurological manifestations, but the inability to identify unifying features in the existing nomenclature that would facilitate establishment of eligibility criteria and suitable endpoints in clinical trials, is a major challenge for therapeutic development. A multi-centre cohort study in England, GAUCHERITE, undertook retrospective and prospective clinical evaluation of patients with Gaucher disease; this sub-study is focussed on patients with nGD. The research cohort is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT code, 03240653. 42 patients with neuronopathic GD were recruited; 16 male and 26 female; nine patients had died (age of death 4 - 28 years), living patients aged 6-61yrs. We categorise them clinically (\"attenuated\", \"intermediate\" and \"severe\") and on the basis of defined pathogenic variants in GBA1. Childhood disease manifestations provide prognostic utility, especially in context of genotype. This work captures the full phenotypic spectrum and striking clinical diversity of neuronopathic Gaucher disease not encompassed by the existing nomenclature. We propose a novel descriptive system of phenotypic cateogrization: while this requires refinement and validation across the global population, it seeks to stimulate further exploration of disease behaviours that can be clearly stratified. By these means, we contend that identification of disease manifestations likely to respond to interventions with distinct modes of action in appropriate patient groups, will enhance the value of clinical trial programs and accelerate much needed therapeutic development."

    "abstract": "Imiglucerase (Cerezyme; Sanofi, Paris, France), an analogue of β-glucocerebrosidase produced by recombinant DNA technology, has been a safe and effective treatment for Gaucher disease (GD) for over 25 years. A new imiglucerase, Abcertin (Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea) has shown a similar safety and efficacy profile in previous clinical studies. This study compared the pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability to EU-sourced Cerezyme following a single 60 IU/kg dose. This phase 1, single-center, randomized, double-blind, two-way crossover study enrolled 36 healthy volunteers aged 18-45 years. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either Abcertin or Cerezyme in a predetermined sequence. Abcertin reached peak plasma concentrations at a median t<sub>max</sub> of 61 min (range: 40-121 min). The mean C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0-last</sub>, and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> were 115.4 mU/mL, 12,190 min·mU/mL, and 12,210 min mU/mL, respectively, indicating bioequivalence to Cerezyme. The mean t<sub>½</sub>, CL, and V<sub>z</sub> were 6.88 min, 376.7 mL/min, and 3.62 L, respectively, and were comparable between the two treatments. One participant in the Cerezyme group developed anti-drug antibodies, which were non-neutralizing A total of 24 subjects experienced treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). The most common TEAE was headache (3 in the Abcertin group and 5 in the Cerezyme group), followed by general disorders and administration site condition (3 in Abcertin group and 5 in Cerezyme group). Two participants in the Cerezyme sequence experienced severe TEAEs: one had a urinary tract infection, and the other developed urticaria, which leading to study withdrawal. Abcertin demonstrated pharmacokinetic equivalence to Cerezyme, with a comparable safety, immunogenicity, and tolerability profile. These findings support its potential as an affordable biosimilar for GD treatment."

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) associated with <i>GBA1</i> mutations-recently termed Sidransky syndrome-differs from idiopathic PD (iPD) by earlier onset, more rapid progression, and higher rates of non-motor symptoms. Our objective was to assess whether <i>GBA1</i> mutations contribute to olfactory dysfunction in PD and in asymptomatic carriers of the mutation. We compared olfactory and motor functions in 119 participants: Sidransky syndrome (n = 18), iPD (n = 30), <i>GBA1</i> variant carriers without PD (n = 21), Gaucher disease patients (n = 20), and healthy controls (n = 30). All were evaluated with the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT<sup>®</sup>) and the motor part of the Movement Disorders Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-mUPDRS). Mean age was 59.2 ± 11.7 years. Mean disease duration was 2.5 ± 2.2 years in Sidransky syndrome and 5.4 ± 4.9 years in iPD. We found that both PD groups had significantly lower BSIT<sup>®</sup> scores than non-PD groups (<i>p</i> < 0.001), particularly for leather, smoke, natural gas, pineapple, clove, rose, and lemon. Sidransky syndrome patients scored lower than iPD patients (<i>p</i> = 0.04). No significant olfactory deficits were observed in <i>GBA1</i> carriers or Gaucher patients without PD. We conclude that hyposmia is more pronounced in Sidransky syndrome than in iPD. However, normal olfaction in non-parkinsonian <i>GBA1</i> carriers suggests that <i>GBA1</i> variants alone do not account for olfactory loss in PD. Hyposmia likely reflects broader PD pathology rather than a direct effect of the <i>GBA1</i> mutation."

    "abstract": "Gaucher Disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder. Mutations in the GBA1 gene cause glucocerebrosidase enzyme deficiency that leads to the accumulation of its substrates. Enzyme replacement therapy emerged as a natural history-changing treatment. Up to now, mainly measurable treatment targets have been investigated for patients. In this study, the number of real-life based and GD related events before and after ERT were evaluated for the first time to assess the impact of ERT on GD patients in real-life settings. The events investigated consist of hematopoietic, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, neurologic, respiratory system and growth and puberty-related events, as well as events related to routine daily activities, and malignancy. A total of 29 events were reported from 5 different group of events between - 12 to -6 months and 16 events from - 6 months to baseline in all patients. After the initiation of ERT, the number of new events decreased to 1 in 6-12 months. At the end of the follow-up period, between 30 and 36 months, only 1 new event was recorded, the minimum event number overall. For all groups of events, there was a trend to decrease of the events for overall follow-up period. In conclusion, this is the first study that evaluate event-based outcomes in GD patients receiving ERT and show the real-life data by evaluating not only laboratory parameters but also clinical consequences of the treatment, providing practical clinical follow up."

    "title": "Broken Balance: Emerging Cross-Talk Between Proteostasis and Lipostasis in Neurodegenerative Diseases.",
    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are characterized by progressive neuronal loss, leading to cognitive and motor impairments. Although these diseases have distinct clinical manifestations, they share pathological hallmarks such as protein aggregation and lysosomal dysfunction. The lysosome plays a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by mediating the degradation and recycling of proteins, lipids, and other macromolecules. As such, it serves as a central hub for both proteostasis and lipostasis. This review outlines genetic and mechanistic parallels between rare lysosomal lipid storage diseases, such as Gaucher disease and Niemann-Pick disease, and more prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss how impaired lysosomal sphingolipid metabolism compromises lysosomal integrity, disrupts proteostasis, and contributes to neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we describe how age-related decline in lysosomal function may similarly drive neurodegeneration in the absence of overt genetic mutations. Taken together, this review highlights the lysosome as a central integrator of protein and lipid homeostasis and emphasizes the bidirectional relationship between lipostasis and proteostasis, whereby disruption of one adversely affects the other in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "Cardiac involvement in Gaucher disease (GD) is an uncommon feature, most often associated with the homozygous Asp448His (D409H) variant in GBA1 and typically presents with valvular and pericardial calcifications or myocardial infiltration. To date, approximately 132 individuals with this cardiovascular phenotype (GDIIIc) have been reported, with limited representation from the Middle East. This study reports the first cohort from Kuwait, involving five individuals from three unrelated Middle Eastern families, all with molecularly confirmed homozygous Asp448His variants. All individuals demonstrated early-onset cardiac valvular disease requiring surgical intervention, in addition to organomegaly, skeletal manifestations, and neurological symptoms. Despite corrective surgeries, four individuals died, with only one adult female currently alive and stable. Remarkably, this surviving patient is the first reported individual with GDIIIc to have successfully conceived and delivered a healthy child prior to her diagnosis, initiation of enzyme replacement therapy, or cardiac surgery. She later developed a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including phobias, hallucinations, obsessive thoughts, anxiety, and delusions of persecution, as well as resting tremors and dysphagia. Brain MRI revealed granular ependymitis and cerebral microbleeds-neuroradiological features not previously described in GDIIIc-making her case uniquely informative. These findings broaden the phenotypic spectrum of GDIIIc and highlight the importance of recognizing cardiac and neuropsychiatric manifestations in individuals with the Asp448His variant. Early identification and multidisciplinary management may improve outcomes in this ultra-rare but severe disease."

    "abstract": "The predominant etiologies of splenomegaly (SM) are readily discernible through routine clinical assessments, yet in numerous instances, the etiological basis remains elusive. Subsequent diagnostic steps are not consensual and are challenging for physicians due to miscellaneous causes and non-specific symptoms. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of Gaucher disease (GD) and other etiologies in patients presenting with unexplained splenomegaly (SM) after exclusion of first intention-diagnoses (e.g., portal hypertension, hematological malignancy, hemolytic anemia, and infection) based on basic physical examination, patient interview, and routine biological exams (e.g., full blood count, liver enzymes, and reticulocyte count). Additionally, the study aimed to describe the diagnostic tests performed and the most frequent associations observed. This French prospective, observational, multicenter, longitudinal SMS study enrolled 505 patients from September 2015 to April 2020, aged ≥ 15 years, referred to hematology or internal medicine departments, with a diagnostically confirmed SM (spleen length ≥ 13 cm). SM was defined as unexplained when routine clinical and biological tests were negative. Patients were followed up until an etiology was identified or up to 18 months after inclusion. An etiology of SM was found in 223 (44.5%) of 501 patients with follow up. Patients with explained SM were older, had a larger spleen, and had altered biological parameters compared with patients with unexplained SM. There was a higher prevalence of non-malignant diseases than hematological malignancies (27.1% vs. 17.0%). Overall, lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) were diagnosed in 10 patients (2.0%), including 4 patients with GD (0.8%). A list of potential predictive factors for the main diagnostic categories was identified that could optimize the diagnostic strategy for unexplained SM. This study provides new insights into exploring SM in the real world and proposes clinical and biological factors associated with specific etiologies. NCT04430881."

    "abstract": "Recombinant alleles are responsible for a large part of Gaucher disease (GD) causing alterations. This is because <i>GBA1</i>, the gene involved in GD, has a 96 % homologous pseudogene, <i>GBAP1</i>, at a 1.6kb distance. <i>GBA1</i> gene variants are also the most common molecular alteration among Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients, even in heterozygosity. The most common GD causing recombinant allele is Rec<i>Nci</i>I (which comprises three single nucleotide variants: p.L483P, p.A495P and p.Val499=). Every time this <i>GBA1</i> recombinant allele is formed by an unequal crossing over event, another allele is formed with a copy number gain, i.e., a triplicate copy where <i>GBA1</i> and <i>GBAP1</i> are preserved, and a third intermediate copy is formed with its sequence starting at <i>GBAP1</i> and then reverting to <i>GBA1</i> after the recombination point (called here TRIP-SV). Two cohorts were screened for the mid part of the TRIP-SV in PD patients using a specific amplification method. One cohort was formed by 65 early onset PD patients and the other with 100 idiopathic PD patients. In each cohort one patient carrying the TRIP-SV was detected. Sanger sequencing confirmed the expected sequence of the TRIP-SV. Our findings indicate that it is mandatory that groups analyzing the <i>GBA1</i> gene searching for molecular causation of PD investigate the presence of this SV encompassing the <i>GBA1</i>/<i>GBAP1</i> region, which pathogenicity deserves further studies."

    "abstract": "For many inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) the understanding of disease mechanisms remains limited, in part explaining their unmet medical needs. The expressivity of IEM disease phenotypes is affected by disease-modifying factors, including rare and common polygenic variation. We hypothesize that we can identify these modulating pathways using molecular signatures of IEM in combination with multiomic data and gene regulatory networks generated from non-IEM animal and human populations. We tested this approach by identifying and subsequently validating glucocorticoid signaling as a candidate modifier of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorders, and recapitulating complement signaling as a modifier of inflammation in Gaucher disease. Our work describes a novel approach that can overcome the rare disease-rare data dilemma and reveal new IEM pathophysiology and potential drug targets using multiomics data in seemingly healthy populations."

This study aims to investigate audiovestibular system involvement in patients with Gaucher disease type I (GD1) and type III (GD3) using audiometric and vestibular evaluations. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 42 patients diagnosed with GD who presented to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at Çukurova University Faculty of Medicine between January 2001 and September 2023. The evaluations included pure tone audiometry (PTA), speech discrimination scores (SDS), acoustic impedance tests, and Video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) assessments. Of the 42 patients, 18 were diagnosed with GD1, and 24 with GD3. Audiovestibular anomalies were identified in 11 patients (26.2%). Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) was detected in 9 patients, including 4 GD1 and 5 GD3 patients, with bilateral involvement in 5 cases. The severity of hearing loss ranged from mild to moderately severe. Vestibular impairment, demonstrated by reduced vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain and catch-up saccades (CUS), was observed in 5 patients, predominantly among GD3 cases. Notably, concurrent audiovestibular dysfunction was observed in three patients, one with GD1 and two with GD3. This study is the first to describe the vestibular involvement in GD1. Audiovestibular abnormalities can manifest in both GD1 and GD3 patients, with distinct patterns of involvement. Regular auditory and vestibular assessments are essential to identify sensory deficits early, guide rehabilitation strategies, and enhance the quality of life for GD patients."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive disorder with a wide range of clinical symptoms that cause abnormal function of parenchymal organs such as liver and spleen in patients. Enzyme replacement therapy, represented by imiglucerase, is a common approach for GD treatment. However, limited efficacy and high cost are important factors restricting its use. Ambroxol has gradually attracted attention due to its ease of administration, safety, and efficacy. However, there is no pharmacoeconomic evaluation of ambroxol for the treatment of GD in China. The cost-effectiveness profile of ambroxol combined with imiglucerase therapy for the treatment of GD, as opposed to imiglucerase monotherapy, needs to be investigated. This study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of ambroxol for GD in China from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. We constructed an eight-state Markov model based on the disease characteristics of GD. The Markov cycle was 1 month. The time horizon was 6 years. The willingness-to-pay threshold was chosen to be 1-3 times the gross national product (GDP) per capita. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated from the base-case analysis, and one-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The ICER value was ¥223,726.70, which was between 1 and 3 times GDP per capita. Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost of imiglucerase had a significant effect on ICER as well as demonstrating the stability of the results. Ambroxol combination therapy is a cost-effective regimen compared with imiglucerase monotherapy."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the <i>GBA1</i> gene. Type 1 Gaucher disease is characterised by substrate accumulation in the visceral organs, which occurs in combination with acute and chronic neurodegeneration that distinguish type 2 and type 3 GD, respectively. We have previously shown the efficacy of neonatal AAV9 gene therapy for treating type 2 GD and aimed to investigate post-symptomatic administration into a model of type 1 disease. Current murine models of type 1 disease are limited in their recapitulation of early onset phenotypic manifestation and thus we aimed to create a novel model of type 1 in which to test the efficacy of adult gene therapy. <b>Methods</b>: The novel AAV-GD1 model was created through intracerebroventricular injection of AAV9 containing the human <i>GBA1</i> gene under control of the neuron-specific synapsin promoter (AAV9.hSynI.h<i>GBA1</i>) to the pre-existing acute K14-lnl/lnl model of type 2 GD. Administration of AAV9.hSynI.h<i>GBA1</i> aimed to restore glucocerebrosidase expression in the brain and extend the lifespan beyond 14 days, allowing the visceral pathology to develop further. The organ pathology was characterised by immunohistochemistry at various time points. Once visceral disease was confirmed, an intravenous injection of AAV9 containing a ubiquitously active CAG promoter driving h<i>GBA1</i> (AAV9.CAG.h<i>GBA1</i>) was administered to post-symptomatic mice. Animals were aged for 2 and 4 months post-treatment with AAV9.CAG.h<i>GBA1</i>, and immunohistochemistry and enzymatic activity were assessed to investigate therapeutic efficacy. <b>Results</b>: The AAV-GD1 model displayed visceral pathology in the spleen, lung, and liver from 2 months of age. This allowed us to validate the efficacy of adult gene therapy; intravenous administration of AAV9.CAG.h<i>GBA1</i> transiently ameliorated the lung pathology and rescued the spleen pathology up to 4 months post-administration. <b>Conclusions</b>: The creation of the novel AAV-GD1 model with more aggressive visceral pathology presents a unique opportunity for investigation of new therapies to treat type 1 GD. AAV9.CAG.h<i>GBA1</i> represents a potential therapeutic option for all forms of Gaucher disease."

Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the GCase-encoding GBA1 gene cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease, while heterozygous and homozygous mutations are the most frequent genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease. These mutations commonly affect GCase stability, trafficking or activity. Here, we report the development and characterization of nanobodies (Nbs) targeting and acting as molecular chaperones for GCase. We identify several Nb families that bind with nanomolar affinity to GCase. Based on biochemical characterization, we group the Nbs in two classes: Nbs that improve the activity of the enzyme and Nbs that increase GCase stability in vitro. A selection of the most promising Nbs is shown to improve GCase function in cell models and positively impact the activity of the N370S mutant GCase.

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an inborn error of sphingolipid metabolism characterised by a block in the lysosomal degradation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), which consequently accumulates in the lysosomes of affected cells. The product of GlcCer degradation is ceramide, and it is reasonable to expect that there would be a reduction in ceramide in GD, but there is conflicting evidence in different cells and tissues. Using a stable isotope <sup>13</sup>C<sub>16</sub>-palmitate labelling method, we sought to investigate the impact of the block in GlcCer degradation on the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in a conduritol B epoxide (CBE)-induced GD macrophage model. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to measure acyl-, base-, and dual-labelled sphingolipid 'heavy' <sup>13</sup>C<sub>16</sub> isotopologues which were distinguished by their incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>16</sub> into the acyl chain, sphingoid base, or both, respectively. Base- and dual-labelled C16:0 ceramide was consistently elevated in CBE-GD macrophages whereas base- and acyl-labelled C24:0 ceramide was unchanged or decreased, suggesting a preference for <sup>13</sup>C<sub>16</sub>-palmitate in the sphingolipid de novo pathway over acyl elongation. Confirmation of the <sup>13</sup>C<sub>16</sub>-palmitate labelling results was then assessed with the sphingolipid de novo intermediate, sphinganine (d17:0), which also showed elevation of base-labelled C16:0 ceramide in CBE-GD macrophages and no change in base-labelled C24:0 ceramide. As palmitate and sphinganine are both precursors of ceramide de novo synthesis, all base- and dual-labelled ceramides can be accurately assigned as strictly de novo-derived. Therefore, we show that stable isotope <sup>13</sup>C<sub>16</sub>-palmitate labelling can detect alterations in the sphingolipid pathway and conclude that de novo synthesis is upregulated in the CBE-GD macrophage model. This upregulation is likely a compensatory mechanism employed by the CBE-GD macrophage to maintain ceramide homeostasis, following the loss of its generation through GlcCer turnover."

Age of symptomonset and disease progression varies across types of disease. Newborn screening (NBS) for Gaucher disease facilitates early identification of affected individuals and enables pre-symptomatic monitoring with the goal of starting therapies early and improving clinical outcomes. This multi-center study involved New Jersey NBS referral centers. Data regarding initial NBS results, confirmatory testing, diagnosis, and treatment were collected. For patients on therapy, monitoring biomarkers and exam findings are available as of the last clinical evaluation. Between July 2019 and December 2023, 438,515 newborns were screened, with 60 screen-positive cases. Of those positive screens, 19 cases with positive screens did not undergo confirmatory testing due to parental refusal, loss to follow-up, or death; 23 cases were false positives; 14 newborns were diagnosed with GD type I; 2 newborns were diagnosed with suspected type I GD; 2 newborns were diagnosed with GD type II; and 1 case is still pending. Three type I GD patients started enzyme replacement therapy, with the youngest starting at 28 months of age. Post-treatment data are available for these individuals. One type II case was referred to experimental gene therapy, and one was started on ERT. Our results demonstrate that NBS for GD is a valuable public health tool that can facilitate early diagnosis and intervention."

    "abstract": "Ischemic cardiomyopathy with comorbid obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with worse long-term outcomes. Intermittent hypoxia (IH), a key feature of obstructive sleep apnea, exacerbates sympathetic activity, hastening cardiac dysfunction and remodeling in ischemic cardiomyopathy rat models. This study explores whether targeted cardiac sympathetic denervation (CSD) can limit IH-induced progression of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Male Wistar rats underwent CSD, through ablation of the left middle cervical and stellate ganglions, and simultaneously myocardial infarction, via permanent left coronary artery ligation. Three days post surgery, rats were exposed to IH (21%-5% fraction of inspired O<sub>2</sub>, 60-second cycle, 8 hours/day) or normoxia. At 6 weeks, calcium transient, sarcomere shortening, and adrenergic reserve in response to isoproterenol (100 nmol/L) were assessed in isolated cardiomyocytes. At 14 weeks, sympathovagal balance, cardiac function, and remodeling were evaluated. Post myocardial infarction, CSD prevented IH-induced blunting of cardiomyocyte response to isoproterenol challenge and reduced cardiac sympathetic activity. In hypoxic animals, CSD reduced post-myocardial infarction alterations in long-term ejection fraction and mitigated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis. Transcriptomic analysis unveiled that CSD triggered biological processes related to cardiac repair and regeneration. Immunohistochemistry further supported these findings, demonstrating increased cardiomyocyte proliferation in the hypoxic group, as indicated by elevated Ki67 expression colocalized with MF20 markers. Our data demonstrate that CSD prevents IH-induced sympathetic hyperactivity, depletion of cardiac adrenergic reserve, and deterioration of cardiac function in a rat model of ischemic cardiomyopathy. This study highlights the intricate interplay between sympathetic activity and hypoxia in cardiac regeneration and underscores the importance of managing sympathetic hyperactivity in ischemic cardiomyopathy, particularly in the context of comorbid obstructive sleep apnea."

    "title": "Diagnosis of Inherited Metabolic Disease in Older Patients: A Systematic Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) are genetic disorders that disrupt biochemical processes in the human body, due to pathogenic variants in genes encoding enzymes or transporters. While IMDs are mostly diagnosed in infancy or childhood, there is an increasing number of diagnoses in adult patients. Delayed diagnosis, particularly in older patients, may reflect the diagnostic odyssey usually observed in rare diseases' patients and can result in complications and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. The aim of the study was to better characterize the diagnosis of IMDs in older patients (≥ 65 years). We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to examine the diagnosis and clinical presentation of IMDs in patients aged 65 and older. We searched databases like PubMed, Embase, and Lilacs for relevant studies from 1965 to 2023. A total of 260 articles were included, representing 293 patients with a median age of 69 years at diagnosis. From this SLR, 67 different diagnoses have been reported. The most frequently reported diseases were Fabry disease, alkaptonuria, Gaucher disease, mitochondrial disorders, and glycogen storage disease type V. Median diagnostic delay was 14.5 years with a wide range of 1-91 years. Musculoskeletal symptoms were the most frequently reported, followed by neurological and cardiovascular symptoms. Our findings underscore the importance of recognizing IMDs in older patients and the need for awareness among healthcare providers to improve diagnosis and patient care. Future guidelines and teaching programs should incorporate metabolic investigations for older patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of IMDs."

    "abstract": "A slow decline in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway is a hallmark of the normal aging brain. Yet, an acceleration of this cellular function may propel neurodegenerative events. In fact, mutations in genes associated with the autophagy-lysosomal pathway can lead to Parkinson's disease. Also, amyloidogenic protein deposition is observed in lysosomal storage disorders, which are caused by genetic mutations representing risk factors for Parkinson's disease. For example, Gaucher's disease GBA1 mutations leading to defects in lysosomal sphingolipid metabolism cause α-synuclein accumulation. We observed that increased lysosomal Tau accumulation is found in human dermal fibroblasts engineered for inducible Tau expression. Inhibition of the GBA1 product GCase augmented Tau-dependent lysosomal stress and Tau accumulation. Here, we show increased Tau seed-induced Tau accumulation in Gaucher's fibroblasts carrying GBA1 mutations when compared to normal fibroblasts. Pharmacological enhancement of GCase reversed this effect, notably, also in normal fibroblasts. This suggests that boosting GCase activity may represent a therapeutic strategy to slow down aging-dependent lysosomal deficits and brain protein deposition."

    "abstract": "Elevated serum uric acid (SUA) levels were observed in Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) patients followed for two decades in northern Israel. There are no previous reports regarding hyperuricaemia in GD1 patients. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of hyperuricaemia in GD1 patients and its correlation to disease severity, lymphoproliferative neoplasms and other malignancies. Clinical and laboratory data of 69 GD1 patients, 25 treatment-naïve and 44 on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), were evaluated for SUA levels, biomarkers and the presence of lymphoproliferative neoplasms and other malignancies. In 36 females and 33 males, the mean age was 51.6 ± 16.2 years, and the mean severity score index was 8.94. SUA levels were significantly higher in patients with severe disease compared to patients with mild disease. ERT had no significant effect on SUA levels. A linear correlation between SUA levels and disease severity was found. A linear correlation was also detected between acid phosphatase (AP) levels and SUA. Among patients with severe disease, 11% presented with a lymphoproliferative neoplasm, compared to 4% in patients with mild disease. A statistically significant difference in malignancy frequency between the two patient groups was not found. SUA levels are significantly elevated in severe GD1 patients and correlate with AP levels. AP was used in GD as a clinical biomarker, especially tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, which reflects GD macrophage activity and inflammation status, thus associated with disease severity. No correlation between SUA levels and lymphoproliferative neoplasms was found. SUA levels may be helpful in estimating Gaucher cell burden and GD1 severity."

    "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To screen high risk children for lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) in southern China and analyze the spectrum characteristics of LSD in this region. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 7 435 children at high risk of LSD were screened at Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University from January 2009 to December 2024. The activities of 22 lysosomal enzymes from peripheral blood leukocytes or plasma were measured by fluorescence or colorimetric assays with synthetic substrates to screen for 24 LSD subtypes. <b>Results:</b> Among the 7 435 high risk children, 759 children were diagnosed with LSD (10.2%). The diagnosed cases included 506 males and 253 females, with an age at diagnosis of 3.0 (2.5, 5.5) years. The common disease types were mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) (390 cases (51.4%)), sphingolipidoses (269 cases (35.4%)), glycogen storage disease (62 cases (8.2%)), and mucolipidosis types Ⅱ and Ⅲ (29 cases (3.8%)). Among the positive cases, 21 disease subtypes were identified. The 5 frequent subtypes, in descending order, were MPS type Ⅱ (197 cases (26.0%)), Gaucher disease (111 cases (14.6%)), MPS type ⅣA (87 cases (11.5%)), glycogen storage disease type Ⅱ (62 cases (8.2%)), and metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) (49 cases (6.5%)). The rarest subtypes were mannosidosis, multiple sulfatase deficiency and Wolman disease, each with 1 case (0.1%). <b>Conclusions:</b> Enzyme activity screening is essential for diagnosing high risk children with LSD. In Southern China, the most common LSD subtypes are MPS Ⅱ, Gaucher disease, MPS ⅣA, glycogen storage disease type Ⅱ, and MLD, while mannosidosis, multiple sulfatase deficiency and Wolman disease are the rarest."

    "abstract": "Photopharmacology leverages light-responsive drugs to achieve spatiotemporal control over their activation and interactions with biological targets. This high level of precision is particularly crucial for therapeutic strategies that require sequential drug-target binding and dissociation, such as pharmacological chaperones (PCs) for lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). PCs must tightly bind misfolded glycosidases in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to promote proper folding, yet efficiently dissociate in the lysosome to restore enzymatic function. Here, we demonstrate that azobenzene-equipped, photoswitchable sp<sup>2</sup>-iminosugars can fulfill these criteria by exploiting differential E-/Z-isomer interactions with aglycone-accommodating regions of target glycosidases. A diversity-oriented strategy was implemented, incorporating variations in glycomimetic portions, linkers, azobenzene substitution patterns, distal substituents, and valency to fine-tune light and temperature responsiveness. This approach yielded derivatives capable of selectively switching between α- and β-glucosidase inhibition, as well as conjugates exhibiting reversible nanomolar inhibition of human glucocerebrosidase, the dysfunctional enzyme in Gaucher disease, with remarkable switching factors under conditions that mirror the scenario at the ER and the lysosome. The results expand the scope of optoglycomics by providing a framework for designing photocommutators that enable reversible glycosidase modulation and laying the foundation for next-generation photoresponsive glycosidase inhibitors with therapeutic potential in LSDs and broader biomedical applications."

    "abstract": "Orphan diseases comprise a range of disorders that individually affect a small percentage of people, but collectively impact millions of people worldwide. Patients with this disorder often face significant challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and access to care due to their rare nature and limited understanding and treatment options. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the global healthcare in addressing the accessibility of essential treatments and medicines, but still challenges persist particularly related to orphan drugs (to treat rare diseases) in the developing world. The accessibility of orphan drugs remains a major challenge, where patients face barriers such as high costs, limited availability, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure. The high cost associated with orphan drugs presents a barrier to affordability for both patients and healthcare systems, causing disparities in access to life-saving treatments. The molecular farming approach utilizing plant-based production systems for recombinant protein production offers a hope for overcoming barriers to orphan drug access in resource-constrained settings. Molecular farming has the potential to produce a wide range of therapeutic proteins and biologics for the treatment of various rare diseases. The FDA approval of plant-derived proteins for the treatment of Gaucher disease (Elelyso) and Fabry disease (Elfabrio) highlights the potential of plant-based expression systems for the development of suitable drugs targeting niche and orphan diseases. This review examines the potential of the plant system in producing orphan drugs and also highlights the opportunities and challenges related to orphan drug manufacturing."

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are valuable research models for mechanistic studies. However, gene conversion between a gene-pseudogene pair that share high sequence identity and form direct repeats in proximity on the same chromosome can interfere with the precision of gene editing. Mutations in the human beta-glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1) are associated with Gaucher disease, Parkinson's disease, and Lewy body dementia. During the creation of a GBA1 KO iPSC line, we detected about 70% gene conversion from its pseudogene GBAP1. These events maintained the reading frame and resulted from GBA1-specific cleavage by CRISPR/Cas9, without disrupting the GBA1 gene. To increase the percentage of alleles with out-of-frame indels for triggering nonsense-mediated decay of the GBA1 mRNA, we supplied the cells with two single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) donors as homology-directed repair (HDR) templates. We demonstrate that HDR using the ssODN templates effectively competes with gene conversion and enabled biallelic KO clone isolation, whereas the nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR)-based deletion rate remained the same. Here, we report a generalizable method to direct cellular DNA repair of double strand breaks at a target gene towards the HDR pathway using exogenous ssODN templates, allowing specific editing of one gene in a gene-pseudogene pair without disturbing the other."

    "abstract": "Variants in the <i>GBA1</i> gene, encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucosylceramidase beta 1 (GCase), are linked to Parkinson's disease (PD) and Gaucher disease (GD). Heterozygous variants increase PD risk, while homozygous variants lead to GD, a lysosomal storage disorder. Some <i>GBA1</i> variants impair GCase maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum, blocking lysosomal transport and causing glucosylceramide accumulation, which disrupts lysosomal function. This study explores therapeutic strategies to address these dysfunctions. Using Site-directed Enzyme Enhancement Therapy (SEE-Tx<sup>®</sup>), two structurally targeted allosteric regulators (STARs), GT-02287 and GT-02329, were developed and tested in GD patient-derived fibroblasts with relevant GCase variants. Treatment with GT-02287 and GT-02329 improved the folding of mutant GCase, protected the GCase<sub>Leu444Pro</sub> variant from degradation, and facilitated the delivery of active GCase to lysosomes. This enhanced lysosomal function and reduced cellular stress. These findings validate the STARs' mechanism of action and highlight their therapeutic potential for GCase-related disorders, including GD, PD, and Dementia with Lewy Bodies."

In this study, we described the epidemiology of GD in France over more than three decades. The French GD registry (FGDR) includes all known patients with GD in France. We described patients' characteristics, and estimated the incidence, prevalence, and standardized mortality ratios of GD. We compared the evolution of diagnostic methods, diagnosis delays, and treatment over time, and assessed the incidence of bone events, malignancies, and Parkinson's disease. Between 1980 and 2024, 706 confirmed GD were included. In 2024, 447 patients were alive (413 type 1, 34 type 3). GD incidence was 0.21/1 000 000 PY, and GD prevalence was 0.61 and 0.05/100 000 inhabitants for type 1 and 3, respectively. The standardized mortality ratio was 0.70 for type 1 GD and 16.23 for type 3 GD. Over time, we observed a decrease in the delay between first symptoms and diagnosis (5.4 years before 2000; 0.8 after 2020; p = 0.001), with enzyme assays becoming the primary diagnostic method, a reduction in splenectomies, and a gradual increase in the use of substrate reduction therapy in type 1 GD. The incidences of bone events, malignancies, and Parkinson's disease were 23, 2.7, and 1.07 per 1000 person-years, respectively. This study provides updated epidemiological data on GD in France, showing improvements in disease knowledge, faster and less invasive diagnoses, and reassuring outcomes for type 1 GD, with lower mortality and a relatively low incidence of malignancies and Parkinson's disease."

Replacement of GCase is current standard of care for GD1; however, GCase has a relatively short active half-life at both physiological and lysosomal pH and biweekly intravenous administration does not provide a consistent exposure to active enzyme. FLT201 is the first adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy in clinical trials for treatment of GD1. FLT201 consists of a rationally designed AAV capsid (AAVS3) containing an expression cassette with an engineered GBA1 transgene that encodes a unique glucocerebrosidase variant (GCase85). GCase85 includes an engineered disulfide, which results in a >6-fold increase in active half-life in human serum and a >21-fold increase in active half-life at lysosomal pH conditions, with similar catalytic properties to those of wild-type and exogenous GCase. Preclinical data indicate that FLT201 could offer a durable treatment for Gaucher disease type 1, addressing unmet needs related to substrate accumulation in tissues poorly treated by current enzyme replacement therapy. The improved stability of the engineered GCase85 variant is predicted to be crucial for FLT201's therapeutic effectiveness."

    "abstract": "'Type 2' Gaucher disease, also referred to as 'acute neuronopathic' or 'infantile' Gaucher disease is an aggressive subtype of Gaucher disease, resulting from pathogenic variants in GBA1. The spectrum of phenotype ranges from hydropic perinatal presentations to an infantile disease characterised by rapid neurodegeneration. Increasingly, reports are offered of patients who survive into childhood, and it is unclear if these individuals represent a severe form of the type 3 (historically considered 'juvenile') disease or have modified outcomes resulting from contemporary medical interventions. Predicting outcome at point of diagnosis is increasingly important to families and clinicians, and while the impact of 'severe' or null alleles is appreciated, there remain significant uncertainties surrounding genotype-phenotype correlation. In an era of clinical trials and endeavors to find CNS modifying therapeutics, there is a need to be able to categorise and predict clinical outcomes more accurately. Here we report a case-series (n = 13) of internationally referred patients to a single centre, highlighting the spectrum of phenotype encompassed by the single nomenclature of 'type 2 Gaucher' disease. From this case-series we propose a new pragmatic, clinical classification system which could be applied to any infant at point of presentation. We subsequently applied this classification system to the historical literature and a further series of historical cases contributed by collaborators across the globe. We collated data from 250 cases, and demonstrate that it is feasible to apply this classification system and show that this has the potential to offer future genotype-phenotype correlation if expanded to a larger cohort."

    "abstract": "Biallelic mutations in the glucosylceramidase beta 1 (GBA1) gene are the underlying genetic cause of Gaucher's disease (GD), resulting in a deficient lysosomal hydrolase and subsequent accumulation of glycosphingolipids. More recently, GBA1 mutations have been identified as the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), associated with more pronounced symptoms characterized by earlier onset and accelerated cognitive decline. In these GBA-associated PD patients the α-synuclein pathology is more prominent, and recent data suggest a link between α-synucleinopathies and GBA1 mutations. Here, we explored the effect of GBA1 gene supplementation on the GD phenotypes and α-synuclein pathology by using the adeno-associated virus (AAV) system. We have compared two AAV serotypes, AAV5 and AAV9, and two different ubiquitous promoters, and demonstrate that both promoters work efficiently albeit not the same in vitro and in vivo. GBA1 overexpression reduces the accumulation of glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) and restores motor dysfunction in a GD mouse model. We further demonstrate that GBA1 overexpression can dissolve phospho-α-synuclein aggregation induced by the addition of α-synuclein pre-formed fibril (PFF) in a mouse primary neuron model suggesting the direct effect of β-Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) on α-synuclein accumulation. In vivo, we show that GCase inhibition can induce insoluble high-molecular-weight α-synuclein aggregation and that delivery of GBA1 achieves robust reduction of the α-synuclein aggregates in the mouse brain. In summary, GCase expression not only reduces GlcSph, but also restores GD motor dysfunction and removes α-synuclein aggregates which are the hallmark for PD and α-synucleinopathies. AAV delivery of GBA1 is a powerful approach to restore glucocerebrosidase function and to resolve misfolded α-synuclein protein, with applications for GD and PD."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by dysfunction of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. The enzyme deficiency is mainly due to mutations in the <i>GBA1</i> gene, and it is responsible for the accumulation of glucosylceramide within the lysosomes of monocyte macrophage-derived cells; causing the associated symptomatology. In this paper, we describe six new mutations identified in the <i>GBA1</i> gene, which, in combination with other mutations already documented, lead to absent or reduced glucocerebrosidase activity, resulting in pathological accumulation of the specific substrate and the clinical manifestations associated with Gaucher disease. We have identified three mutations (c.1578_1581dup, c.1308dup, and Y492X) that determine the formation of a premature stop codon in the translation process and three missense mutations (C342F, M280L, and Q247R) that lead to amino acid changes in proteins, resulting in decreased glucocerebrosidase activity. These mutations were never observed in our group of healthy control subjects > 1500 individuals. The patients examined had several clinical manifestations, which included hepatosplenomegaly and bone and hematologic involvement; considering the absence of enzyme activity, this suggests that the new mutations described here are associated with type I Gaucher disease. The identification of new mutations in patients with symptoms referable to Gaucher disease increases the molecular knowledge related to the <i>GBA1</i> gene and offers to clinicians significant support for the accurate diagnosis of the pathology."

Emerging evidence suggests that GD also has an impact on gynaecological well-being, with documented pregnancy-related complications. However, substantial evidence is still lacking, indicating the need for better surveillance of GD-associated gynaecological complications. To assess the frequency of gynaecological ailments, pregnancies and pregnancy-related complications and outcomes in women diagnosed with GD in Central and Southeastern Europe. An online questionnaire was developed to gather data on gynaecological and reproductive health among female patients aged 18 years or older from five countries (Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Northern Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina). The questionnaire was translated to native language of participating countries and distributed by the Croatian Gaucher Association. The study was conducted from December 2021 to March 2022. The variables assessed were treatment type, age at diagnosis, reproductive history, frequency of haematological disorders, infertility issues and pregnancy outcomes, as well as comparison of these variables between treated and untreated patients. Descriptive statistics were employed to calculate proportions, and mean values were computed for continuous variables. Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables. The study involved 26 participants. At the time of the study, four of the participants were undergoing substrate reduction therapy (SRT), and the remainder were receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Patients who received treatment during pregnancy reported a higher frequency of pregnancy-associated bleeding (71.3% vs 22.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.030). In total, there were 25 pregnancies and 20 births reported, while 11 (42.3%) respondents did not have children. All women conceived naturally, yet three reported difficulties with conception. Women who reported bleeding during pregnancy were more likely to experience issues with conception (<i>p</i> = 0.036) and bleeding during childbirth (<i>p</i> = 0.018). However, no significant difference was observed in relation to bleeding prior to pregnancy (<i>p</i> = 0.529). GD does not hinder pregnancy or motherhood, nor does it affect fertility, although it does require proper medical oversight and care. ERT alone may not be sufficient to prevent bleeding events, and detailed studies concerning coagulation might be necessary in pregnant women with GD."

The findings from this assessment are to support the decision-making process regarding the potential expansion of ERT coverage within Thailand's public health system. The analysis compared the current policy, which provides treatment with imiglucerase only for patients with Gaucher disease type 1, as listed in the National List of Essential Medicine, with a proposed policy that extends coverage to include Gaucher disease types 1 and 3b with either imiglucerase or velaglucerase. Cost-utility analysis of these policy options was performed using decision tree and Markov models over a lifetime horizon from a societal perspective. The financial implications for the relevant budgetary authority over 5 years were estimated. The research methodology adheres rigorously to Thailand's health technology assessment guidelines. The study found that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for treating both Gaucher disease types 1 and 3b are 6,769,000 and 9,359,000 baht per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for imiglucerase and velaglucerase, respectively, which is well beyond Thailand's cost-effectiveness threshold of 160,000 baht per QALY. Such an expansion would incur an additional budgetary burden of approximately 81 million baht for imiglucerase and 138 million baht for velaglucerase. Increasing the rate of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can improve the cost-effectiveness of the expansion. The study concludes that expanding ERT with either imiglucerase or velaglucerase to treat both Gaucher disease types 1 and 3b is not cost-effective at current prices in Thailand; however, it could become cost-effective with a reduction of approximately 60% in drug prices or if all eligible patients undergo HSCT."

It analyses over 40 DNA sequences in a single reaction, identifying copy number variations and large deletions/insertions in genes. The diagnostic process in LSDs starts with analysis of the missing or reduced enzyme, followed by genetic investigation and, if possible, a search for accumulated substrates. However, while genetic analysis using Sanger sequencing is excellent at detecting small genetic variations such as single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions or deletions, it cannot detect large deletions or insertions. <b>Methods:</b> In the present study, a total of 800 patients with clinical suspicion of Fabry, Gaucher, or Pompe diseases were investigated. An enzyme assay was carried out on each patient, followed by genetic analysis using PCR, Sanger sequencing, and MLPA. <b>Results:</b> Nine patients with deficient or absent enzyme activity had Sanger sequencing results that could not confirm the molecular genetic diagnosis because either no mutation (Fabry) or only one mutation (Gaucher and Pompe) was identified. Subsequent analysis by MLPA identified two males with a hemizygous deletion and two females with a heterozygous deletion for FD. For PD, one female and two males had a heterozygous deletion. For GD, one male had a homozygous deletion and one female had a heterozygous deletion. The remaining patients were analyzed by MLPA with negative results. <b>Conclusions:</b> The results obtained suggest that MLPA should be used in combination with classical sequencing methods to ensure a correct and timely diagnosis of LSDs."

We identified 220 patients (208 adults and 12 children under 18 years) with cryptogenic splenomegaly or who had undergone splenectomy (12 patients) without having reached a diagnosis. The median age was 11 years (interquartile range [IQR] 3-16) in the pediatric population and 51 years (IQR 38-65) in the adult population. Lower-than-normal enzyme values were detected in 19 DBSs, confirming eight positive cases, which corresponded to six patients with GD and two with ASMD. The rest of the DBSs with low enzyme activity were not genetically confirmed (58%). We determined that lysosomal diseases accounted for 3.6% of cryptogenic splenomegaly/splenectomy cases in our setting: 2.7% were GD and 0.9% ASMD, in a ratio of 1 ASMD patient to every 3 GD patients. Lyso-GL1 values in patients with GD were elevated in all but one individual, corresponding to a child diagnosed at 4 months old. The variants detected in the GBA1 gene were consistent with the most frequent variants found in Spain. The development and implementation of this protocol for the education and diagnosis of cryptogenic splenomegaly/splenectomy, even in asymptomatic patients, constitutes a comprehensive, simple, rapid, and effective screening method for the diagnosis of GD and ASMD."

    "title": "Role of Biomarkers in Diagnosing Disease, Assessing the Severity and Progression of Disease, and Evaluating the Efficacy of Therapies.",
    "abstract": "This paper reviews biomarkers in lysosomal disease according to their categories and definitions. There are numerous biomarkers in lysosomal diseases. Some are disease or organ-specific, but most are not. Organ-specific biomarkers are especially useful, but most biomarkers help with diagnosis, assessing disease severity, prognosis, and pharmacodynamic response. There are as yet no truly validated biomarkers in lysosomal diseases by the Prentice, Fleming, and DeMets criteria. None so far can serve as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials, or as substitutes for clinically meaningful endpoints that evaluate how patients feel, function, or survive. The US Food and Drug Administration has thus far used surrogate biomarkers to license therapy only for 3 lysosomal diseases-Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, and lysosomal lipase deficiency. The paucity of surrogate biomarkers reflects success in using clinically important endpoints for the licensing of therapies for Pompe disease, mucopolysaccharidosis IVA, VI, and VII, Niemann-Pick type C, and CLN2. In conclusion, biomarkers in lysosomal diseases are best used for diagnosis, patient categorization, pharmacodynamic response, and sometimes for patient prognosis and risk. Thus far, they have been less useful as surrogate biomarkers in pivotal clinical trials."

    "title": "Sphingolipidoses: expanding the spectrum of α-synucleinopathies.",
    "abstract": "Although α-synuclein pathology is typically associated with Lewy body diseases and multiple systems atrophy, increasing evidence indicates that it also occurs in a group of lysosomal storage disorders termed sphingolipidoses caused by the incomplete degradation, and subsequent accumulation, of a class of lipids termed sphingolipids. Notably, a number of genes that cause sphingolipidoses are also risk genes for Lewy body diseases, suggesting aetiological links between these distinct disorders. In the present review, we discuss the sphingolipidoses in which α-synuclein pathology has been reported: Gaucher disease, Krabbe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Tay-Sachs disease and Anderson-Fabry disease, and describe the characteristic clinical and pathological features of these disorders, in addition to the evidence suggesting α-synuclein pathology occurs in these disorders. Finally, we evaluate the pathological mechanisms that underlie these rare disorders, with particular attention to how the enzymatic deficiency, substrate accumulation, or both, could contribute to the genesis of α-synuclein pathology and the implications of this for Lewy body diseases."

    "abstract": "Sidransky syndrome represents a distinct variant of Parkinson's disease (PD) that is linked to pathogenic variants in the glucocerebrosidase (<i>GBA1</i>) gene. This disorder exhibits an earlier onset, a more severe course, and a higher dementia prevalence compared to idiopathic PD. While the pathogenesis remains debated between loss-of-function and gain-of-function mechanisms, targeted therapies are emerging. Pharmacological chaperones (PCs), like high-dose Ambroxol, aim to mitigate enzyme misfolding-a primary driver of this disorder-rather than addressing metabolic deficiencies seen in Gaucher disease. Despite failed trials of substrate reduction therapies, current clinical trials with Ambroxol and other PCs highlight promising avenues for disease modification. This commentary advocates for increased awareness of Sidransky syndrome to advance diagnostic strategies, promote genetic testing, and refine targeted treatments, with the potential to transform care for <i>GBA1</i>-related PD and prodromal stages of the disease."

The study included 31 patients with type I GD (21 patients with intact spleen and 10 patients with a history of splenectomy) over 18 years. Efficacy was assessed by the change in hemoglobin level (primary endpoint), platelet count, spleen and liver volumes, prevalence of bone marrow infiltration, and the number of patients with quiet hip disease according to magnetic resonance imaging (secondary endpoints). Safety was assessed by the incidence of treatment-related adverse events and serious adverse events, as well as by the incidence of production of imiglucerase binding and neutralizing antibodies (IgG, IgE). The mean follow-up duration was 54 weeks. The study did not show a statistically significant change in hemoglobin levels, platelet count, or spleen and liver volumes. There was an upward tendency in platelet count in the overall group (<i>p</i>=0.1) and patients after splenectomy (<i>p</i>=0.08). The prevalence of specific bone marrow infiltration and the number of patients with quiet hip disease remained unchanged. During the safety analysis, one adverse reaction, a mild increase in alanine aminotransferase, was reported, which resolved spontaneously by the end of the study. The immunogenicity analysis showed the initial presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) in 5 (16.7%) of the 30 examined patients. At the end of the study, ADAs were detected in only 3 (10%) patients. The detected ADAs had a low titer and no neutralizing activity, and they did not affect the treatment effectiveness. Long-term therapy with the imiglucerase biosimilar was associated with a stable course of GD without progression. It was characterized by a good safety profile and low immunogenicity."

Pulmonary involvement (PI) and lymphadenopathy (LD) are reported GD complications and have unknown incidence, pathogenesis, and response to treatments. Here, we report the case of a patient diagnosed with nGD with collodion skin who developed only mild neurological symptoms and later died in early childhood due to treatment-resistant PI and LD. A female neonate was born at 38 weeks of gestation (weight: approximately 2012 g, height: 45 cm). She had a collodion skin, hepatosplenomegaly, hemorrhagic plaques, and cholestatic liver disease at birth. She was diagnosed with GD based on decreased glucocerebrosidase enzyme activity, and genetic analysis of <i>GBA1</i> revealed compound heterozygous mutations of c.1193G > T (p.Arg398Leu) and c.1265_1319del (p.Leu422fs). Intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was initiated at the 15 days of age. At the age of 2 years and 2 months, she had a Developmental Quotient of 88 but developed horizontal gaze palsy. At 2 years 8 months of age, she developed mesenteric LD and PI because of which she failed to gain weight and developed tachypnea. She was started on oxygen therapy but died of respiratory failure and malnutrition due to PI and LD at the age of 3 years and 8 months. Pathological autopsy did not reveal the presence of Gaucher cells (GCs) in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, but all lung macrophages had been transformed to GCs that were draining the alveoli, LD was observed in the mesenteric and mediastinal lymph nodes, and nodules of GCs were formed in bilateral kidneys. In conclusion, nGD with collodion skin is not always classified GD2. Although her phenotype may be classified as GD3b, her clinical course was like severe GD1. In addition, PI and LD are difficult to treat with adequate ERT."

Non-neurological manifestations of this disease are amenable to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with olipudase alfa in both adult and pediatric patients. In this study, we offer evidence for the role of intervention in early childhood pediatric cases. We present longitudinal follow-up for two siblings with ASMD (<i>SMPD1</i> p.R498L/p.R610del compound heterozygous genotype) who were started on ERT at different ages (ages 3 and 7, duration of treatment >4 years). After initiation of ERT, both siblings demonstrated significant radiographic improvement of interstitial lung disease (ILD), organomegaly, and growth. Notably, the younger sibling who had started earlier on treatment did not experience any deceleration in growth parameters and has normal height and weight for age, while the older sibling showed a decline in growth velocity that improved once treatment was initiated. Similarly, the older sibling showed similar-to-worse ILD and more persistent organomegaly compared to the younger sibling. Treatment has resulted in sustained improvements in both patients. These findings suggest that early intervention with ERT in ASMD may have cumulative benefits for pediatric health and motivate early screening for ASMD in pediatric patients."

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 74 EEG recordings from 50 GD patients between January 2012 and July 2022. Twenty-three patients exhibited abnormal EEG recordings, including 11 of the GD1 type (the transitional type) and 12 with neuronopathic GD. Of the 12 neuronopathic GD patients, 9 patients with epilepsy were analysed specifically in terms of the clinical course. The primary waveform observed in the neuronopathic EEG recordings was the spike-and-wave complex (SWC) during both awake and sleep states. This was significantly different from sharp waves observed only during sleep in the patients of the transitional type (P = 0.0230). The abnormal discharges in the neuronopathic patients were most commonly located in the bilateral Rolandic areas, while the transitional type commonly involved the bilateral frontal regions. Three patients with an epileptic EEG pattern reported their initial seizures years later. Seizures in the neuronopathic patients were effectively controlled with anti-seizure medications (ASMs), despite the ongoing presence of abnormal EEG patterns. The EEG patterns during ocular symptoms were characterized by sporadic or continuous unilateral SWC during sleep. Patients with neuronopathic GD exhibit distinct EEG patterns that can help differentiate them from GD1 patients. Early treatment with ASMs can effectively control seizures. EEG plays a crucial role in monitoring seizures and can facilitate prompt intervention for GD patients."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease type 3 (GD3) is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by diverse neurological and systemic manifestations. Symptoms of ataxia, cognitive impairment, and other systemic symptoms profoundly impact daily activities and the quality of life for individuals living with the disease. Development of a conceptual model of disease for persons living with GD3 from birth to adulthood would enable objective monitoring of disease progression and assessment of treatment benefits. A targeted literature review, interviews with clinical experts, and interviews with individuals and their caregivers living in the UK and the US were carried out to understand the patient experience. Interviews were transcribed and de-identified data were analyzed to identify signs, symptoms, and impacts of ataxia, cognitive impairment, and other systemic impairments. A conceptual model was developed by integrating relevant signs, symptoms, and impacts experienced from birth through adulthood. Review of symptoms and impacts of GD3 from three published scientific articles, and interviews with six clinical experts, 12 individuals living with GD3, and 12 caregivers, identified 58 patient experience concepts associated with GD3. Signs and symptoms associated with ataxia appear during the first 3 years of life and persist beyond 5 years of age, while signs and symptoms related to neurocognition appear later in life. Difficulty in shifting gaze and/or tracking objects, ataxia, tremors, memory problems, difficulty in processing new information, fatigue, and bone pain are most salient concepts for GD3. In patients aged ≤ 5 years, motor manifestations and symptoms were far more prevalent than neurocognitive signs and symptoms. Inability to work or perform at school, limited social and family engagements, restricted mobility (walking, driving, public transportation), and declining independence were the most important impacts on individuals with GD3. Heterogeneity exists in GD3 manifestations, especially neuromuscular and neurocognitive signs, symptoms, and impacts, across all age ranges of individuals living with GD3. The conceptual model developed in the study provided a comprehensive understanding of the disease in individuals with GD3."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate and review the clinical and laboratory characteristics of Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) caused by the heterozygous mutation of the Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene. In this study, the bone marrow smear and biopsy slice were observed using Wright-Giemsa as well as Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) stains, respectively. Furthermore, peripheral blood leukocyte lysosomes were monitored by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The patient's and her parents' peripheral blood DNA were extracted, and the mutation sites of the GBA-related genes were sequenced via Sanger sequencing. It was revealed that the Gaucher cells in the bone marrow smear and biopsy slice had large volume, were round, ovoid or irregular, occasionally binucleated or multinucleated, with chromatin roughness and occasional nucleoli, rich in the cytoplasm, bluish or grayish-red colored, and with many cytoplasmic onion-skin-like striped structures. Furthermore, the expression of GBA was decreased, while glucosylsphingosine levels were elevated. Moreover, the patient had a heterozygous complex mutation in the GBA gene (GBA NM_001005741.2): c.1604G > Ap.Arg535Hi (R496H) from her mother and c.1448T > Cp. Leu483Pro (L444P) at chromosomal locations chr1:155204793 and chr1:155205043, respectively. The results show that a heterozygous complex mutation of R496H and L444P in the GBA gene causes the development of GD1. Clinical, enzyme activity-based assays, biological markers, and genetic analysis can significantly improve disease diagnosis and are important for early intervention and GD treatment."

Nerve damage in nGD, associated with stunted growth and development, arises from the degeneration and death of nervous system cells, which is often irreversible. Approved therapies effectively reduce the substrate burden outside the central nervous system (CNS) through augmenting mutant enzyme activity with pharmacologic recombinant GCase or by inhibiting glucocerebroside synthesis. However, these therapies do not provide neuroprotection. In this study, we developed a novel double-gene therapy based on adeno-associated virus (AAV), AAV9-GBA1-GDNF, which stably expresses human GBA1 and glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) over the long term. Pathological, molecular, and proteomic tests in the <i>nGD</i> model confirmed that the early stages of the disease are characterized by GBA1 deficiency, loss of neuronal function, and even neuronal death. After treatment with AAV9-GBA1-GDNF, the lifespan of <i>nGD</i> mice was extended, and weight, brain development, and motor ability were recovered. Additionally, GBA1 and GDNF additively prevented irreversible neuronal death by activating the AKT/GSK3β pathway. These findings offer potential therapeutic strategies for <i>nGD</i> and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with lysosomal dysfunction."

Beyond macrophages, GD pathology affects additional hematopoietic lineages, contributing to immune dysregulation. Existing Mx1-Cre Gba knockout models require induction protocols that lead to gene deletion outside hematopoietic cells, limiting the study of hematopoietic-specific effects. To overcome these limitations, we generated a hematopoietic-specific Gba knockout model by crossing Gbafl/fl mice with Vav-Cre, enabling early deletion of Gba exons 8-11 in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These mice were backcrossed to 129X1/SvJ and C57BL/6 J backgrounds, revealing that genetic background significantly influences disease severity. Efficient Gba excision was confirmed in bone marrow, spleen, and thymus, with minimal recombination in the liver. In VavCre 129 GD mice, glucocerebrosidase activity in the spleen was severely reduced, leading to GlcCer and GlcSph accumulation and Gaucher cell infiltration in the spleen and femurs. Transcriptomic analysis identified upregulation of inflammatory and lysosomal pathways. Immune cell deconvolution from RNA-seq data further revealed an expansion of monocytes, dendritic cells, and pro-inflammatory macrophage subsets, suggesting an altered immune landscape. Additionally, GPNMB, a potential GD biomarker, was significantly elevated in both spleens and sera of VavCre 129 GD mice. This hematopoietic-specific GD model provides a powerful platform for studying GD pathophysiology, modifier genes, and immune dysregulation. It offers new opportunities for biomarker discovery and for developing strategies targeting hematopoietic and immune mechanisms in GD and related lysosomal storage disorders."

Its application in rare disease (RD) drug development is promising, given the genetic basis of many RDs and the need for precision medicine approaches. Despite significant advancements, challenges persist in developing effective therapies for RDs due to small patient populations, genetic heterogeneity, and limited surrogate biomarkers. The Orphan Drug Act in the U.S. has incentivized RD drug development. However, the traditional drug approval process is constrained by logistical and economic challenges, necessitating innovative PGx-driven strategies. Identifying genetic biomarkers in the early drug development stages can optimize dose selection, enhance therapeutic efficacy, and reduce ADRs. Case studies such as eliglustat for Gaucher disease and ivacaftor for cystic fibrosis demonstrate the efficacy of PGx-guided treatment strategies. Integrating PGx into global drug development requires the harmonization of regulatory policies and increased diversity in genetic research. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools further enhance genetic analysis, disease prediction, and clinical decision-making. Modernizing drug labeling with PGx information is critical to ensuring safe and effective drug use. Collectively, PGx offers transformative potential in RD therapeutics by facilitating personalized medicine approaches and addressing unmet medical needs."

It can be categorized into neuronopathic and non-neuronopathic types. We previously constructed mouse models carrying the Gba1 F213I point mutation and tamoxifen-inducible systemic Gba1 knockout mice, both of which developed disease rapidly and had a short lifespan. This study combined these two models to create Gba1<sup>flox/F213I</sup>; UBC-CreERT2 mice. These mice exhibited a significantly extended lifespan, along with splenomegaly, infiltration of Gaucher-like cells, and reduced β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity. Additionally, they displayed chronic neuroinflammation. In the later stages, these mice also exhibited typical pathological features of Parkinson's disease (PD), including a reduction in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and an increase in the expression levels of the α-synuclein (α-syn) protein. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from the brain tissues of these mice revealed an early, robust inflammatory response, particularly with the activation of the interferon pathway, including the downstream expression of MHC I complex molecule genes, which was confirmed through Western blot analysis. In summary, we established a chronic neurogenic Gaucher disease mouse model that exhibited pronounced inflammatory activation and developed Parkinsonian-like phenotypes in the later stages."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD), a lysosomal storage disorder, results from the accumulation of glycosphingolipids due to deficient lysosomal glucocerebrosidase activity. This pathological accumulation triggers immune activation, which paradoxically induces UDPglucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG), further exacerbating the metabolic defect. Eliglustat, a highly specific inhibitor of UGCG, functions as a substrate reduction therapy (SRT) and has demonstrated efficacy in reversing GD manifestations in clinical trials and real-world settings. Despite its established safety profile, preclinical studies have shown that supratherapeutic concentrations of eliglustat can inhibit ion channels involved in cardiac electrophysiology. However, pharmacogenomic-guided dosing ensures therapeutic efficacy while maintaining a wide safety margin, minimizing such risks. Nevertheless, lingering concerns regarding cardiac safety have persisted, particularly in patients with preexisting cardiac comorbidities. We report a single-center experience of eliglustat use in 13 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1) and concurrent cardiac comorbidities. Patients underwent standard cardiac evaluations, including electrocardiogram (EKG) with QTc interval assessment and echocardiogram. Eliglustat dosing was guided by CYP2D6 metabolizer status, and potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) were carefully monitored. Cardiac comorbidities included prior myocardial infarction (<i>n</i> = 2), aortic stenosis (<i>n</i> = 2), atrial fibrillation (<i>n</i> = 2), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (<i>n</i> = 1), pericarditis (<i>n</i> = 1), premature ventricular complexes (<i>n</i> = 2), severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with right heart strain (<i>n</i> = 1), mitral annular calcification with diastolic dysfunction (<i>n</i> = 1), and mildly prolonged QTc interval (<i>n</i> = 1). No patients experienced arrhythmia, QTc prolongation, or arrhythmia-related symptoms. Treatment discontinuation was not required. All patients achieved expected therapeutic outcomes, as evidenced by serial reductions in glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) levels and other disease indicators. This study represents the first real-world clinical evidence evaluating Eliglustat's cardiac safety in a high-risk GD1 population. Unlike prior theoretical concerns derived from <i>in vitro</i> ion channel studies, our findings demonstrate that Eliglustat does not induce clinically significant cardiac events when administered according to pharmacogenomic guidelines. The misinformation regarding Eliglustat's cardiotoxicity, largely driven by speculative interpretations rather than clinical data, is effectively countered by our findings, which show no significant QT prolongation or arrhythmias over a median treatment duration of 8 years."

One of the few known exceptions is the enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) that requires the lysosomal integral membrane protein type-2 (LIMP-2) as a proprietary lysosomal transporter. Genetic variations in the GCase encoding gene GBA1 cause Gaucher's disease (GD) and present the highest genetic risk factor to develop Parkinson's disease (PD). Activators targeting GCase emerge as a promising therapeutic approach to treat GD and PD, with pre-clinical and clinical trials ongoing. In this study, we resolve the complex of GCase and LIMP-2 using cryo-electron microscopy with the aid of an engineered LIMP-2 shuttle and two GCase-targeted pro-macrobodies. We identify helix 5 and helix 7 of LIMP-2 to interact with a binding pocket in GCase, forming a mostly hydrophobic interaction interface supported by one essential salt bridge. Understanding the interplay of GCase and LIMP-2 on a structural level is crucial to identify potential activation sites and conceptualizing novel therapeutic approaches targeting GCase. Here, we unveil the protein structure of a mannose-6-phosphate-independent lysosomal transport complex and provide fundamental knowledge for translational clinical research to overcome GD and PD."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease and Gaucher disease are rare genetic disorders characterized by defective degradation of glycosphingolipids caused by enzymatic deficiencies in α-galactosidase A and β-glucocerebrosidase, respectively, and often require life-long treatment. Treatment options for these disorders include replacing the deficient enzymes via enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Agalsidase alfa for Fabry disease and velaglucerase alfa for Gaucher disease are two ERT options with demonstrated efficacy, safety, and tolerability. ERT infusions administered by a health care provider (HCP) in the clinic/hospital, or at the patient's home are considered HCP-supported infusions. Self-administration of ERT (by patient, partner, relative, or caregiver) is optional in patients who tolerate the HCP-supported infusions at home and have a suitable home environment. This analysis explored the safety profiles of self-administered agalsidase alfa (202 patients) and velaglucerase alfa (30 patients) versus HCP-supported infusions using data from the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) and Gaucher Outcome Survey (GOS) registries. The frequency of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) adverse events (AEs) recorded in the two registries was lower in patients self-administering (FOS: 4.5%, GOS: 0%) versus patients receiving HCP-supported infusions (FOS: 13.6%, GOS: 1.6%). In the FOS registry, AE rates per 100 patient-years (100PY) of follow-up were similar between the self-administration (7.99) and HCP-supported infusion (6.78) groups. In patients self-administering agalsidase alfa, cardiac disorders were the most frequently reported AEs (19 [9.4%] patients) and serious AEs (12 [5.9%]) and gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported IRRs (3 [1.5%]). In the GOS registry, AE rates per 100PY were similar between self-administration (4.97) and HCP-supported infusion (4.67) groups. In patients self-administering velaglucerase alfa, skin and subcutaneous disorders (4 [13.3%]) and infections and infestations (2 [6.7%]) were the most reported AEs and serious AEs, respectively, and no IRRs were reported. These findings suggest that self-administration of agalsidase alfa or velaglucerase alfa infusions are not associated with additional safety risks compared with HCP-supported infusions and are a suitable option for qualifying patients. Further research is warranted to support these findings and to explore further the long-term safety and efficacy of ERT self-administration. FOS trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03289065.

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease can have effects on the development of pregnancy, childbirth, and lactation, with impact on health of both the mother and the newborn. Management of pregnancies in Gaucher patients is further complicated by using of enzyme replacement therapy. Unfortunately, the available scientific evidence is not conclusive because there are not proper clinical trials on this issue. The aim of this work was to establish a management guide to address the main clinical problems before, during and after pregnancy and to provide key information to healthcare professionals, patients, and families. GRADE methodology to evaluate the quality of scientific evidence and develop recommendations was incorporated to elaborate this guide. For final recommendations, a structured consensus 2-round process was carried out using the Delphi method with a Gaucher expert panel. After this process, nine recommendations were elaborated related to pre-pregnant status and genetic counseling and for management during pregnancy, seven related to childbirth, and eight focused on management after delivery and breastfeeding. Regarding the quality of the evidence, values and preferences of patients were also considered. A consensus guide to define and standardize pregnancy management in Gaucher disease considering the best available evidence, complemented by experts' opinions, could be a relevant tool to help patients, nurses, midwives and physicians with little experience in Gaucher disease who do not have access to guidance from Gaucher disease treatment centers of excellence."

    "abstract": "<b><b>Background:</b></b> Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal disease. Extended neonatal screening currently includes GD in several different regions. Decision on when to start enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) upon confirmed diagnosis or upon appearance of first clinical manifestation of the disease remains an unmet need. <b>Methods:</b> We report our preliminary experience in tightly monitoring blood levels of glucosyl-sphingosine (lyso-Gb1), on DBS at birth and then every 4 weeks, in the absence of ERT in three consecutive newborns identified for GD as part of a screening program. <b>Results:</b> Initial lyso-Gb1 values were above cut-off. In two cases, lyso-Gb1 levels showed a reduction during the first 3 months of life and, by month 4, they had reached a value lower than the upper normal value. In the case of the third child, after an initial drop to less than 50% of the initial value, lyso-Gb1 levels remained pretty stable at the following four time-points. At the time of writing, all remain free from any disease manifestation at the age of 20, 11 and 8 months, respectively, with normal physical growth and blood count; therefore, ERT has not been started yet. <b>Conclusions:</b> A specific threshold for lyso-Gb1 value to be considered as associated with non-reversible progression to disease is not yet defined. We hypothesize that a trend toward stable increase of this biomarker, confirmed at repeated evaluation, rather than a single threshold, could be convincing for starting ERT even before clinical manifestation of the disease."

    "abstract": "Macrophages are specialised cells that degrade a range of substrates during their lifetime. In inherited lysosomal storage disorders, particularly the sphingolipidoses, macrophages transform into storage cells and contribute to pathology. An appropriate cultured macrophage model is desired for fundamental research and the assessment of considered therapeutic interventions. We compared commonly used macrophage cell lines, RAW264.7, J774A.1, and THP-1 cells, with human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) isolated from peripheral blood. Specific lysosomal glucosidases were analysed by enzymatic activity measurements and visualised with fluorescent activity-based probes. Special attention was given to lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (GBA1), the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease in which lipid-laden macrophages are a hallmark. In macrophage cell lines and HMDMs, various (glyco)sphingolipids relevant to GBA1 activity were determined. Finally, the feasibility of inactivation of GBA1 with a cell-permeable suicide inhibitor was established, as well as the monitoring of uptake of therapeutic recombinant human GBA1. Major differences among various cell lines were noted in terms of morphology, lysosomal enzyme expression, and glycosphingolipid content. HMDMs appear to be the most suitable model for investigations into GBA1 and Gaucher disease. Moreover, they serve as a valuable model for mannose-receptor mediated uptake of therapeutic human GBA1, effectively mimicking enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher disease."

    "title": "Clinical Outcomes and Genetic Mutations in Turkish Patients with Type 1 Gaucher Disease: Insights from a Single-Center Study.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene, leading to deficient β-glucocerebrosidase activity. This results in the accumulation of glucocerebroside in macrophages, primarily affecting the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and bones. Understanding the clinical outcomes and genetic mutation profiles in specific populations, such as Turkish patients, is essential for optimized disease management and personalized therapy and preventing morbidity and mortality. <b>Method:</b> This retrospective study analyzed data from 29 Turkish patients with previously diagnosed type 1 GD at a single center between September and December 2023. Genetic analyses were performed to identify GBA1 mutations using next-generation sequencing. Genetic mutations were the primary criterion for diagnosing GD. Clinical features, treatment responses, and outcomes were evaluated. Clinical parameters included hematological findings, organomegaly, and bone involvement. Data were analyzed to identify potential correlations between genetic mutations and clinical manifestations. <b>Results:</b> This study included 14 male and 15 female patients, with a mean diagnosis age of 22.1 years. A significant family history was observed in 93% of cases, and 52% had consanguineous parents. Epistaxis (72%) was the most common pre-diagnosis symptom. Most patients received enzyme replacement therapy with 60 units/kg. Treatment led to significant improvements, including increased hemoglobin (21.1%), higher platelet count (86.1%), and reduced organomegaly (liver (10.02%), spleen (25.22%)). Genetic analysis identified seven mutations, with c.1226A>G (p.N409S) being the most frequent. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study highlights the spectrum of clinical outcomes and genetic mutations in Turkish patients with GD, emphasizing the variability in disease severity based on genotype. GD should be considered for patients with unexplained nosebleeds, hepatosplenomegaly, bone pain, weakness, or siblings or other family members with similar symptoms. The genetic analysis revealed considerable heterogeneity among patients, which indicates the necessity of observing this in the development of personalized treatment strategies. Future studies with larger cohorts and long-term follow-up are needed to further elucidate genotype-phenotype correlations in this population."

    "title": "Challenges in Gaucher disease: Perspectives from an expert panel.",
    "abstract": "This focused review concentrates on eight topics of high importance for Gaucher disease (GD) clinicians and researchers: 1) The consideration of GD as distinct types rather than a spectrum. A review of the literature clearly supports the view that there are distinct types of GD. Type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic involvement, while types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive primary neuronopathic disease. 2) Neurologic and neuronopathic manifestations. A growing body of evidence indicates that the peripheral nervous system may be involved in GD type 1 and that there may also be signs and symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disease in this group. However, GD type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic disease, whereas GD types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive, albeit variable, primary neuronopathic disease. Abnormalities in saccadic eye movements have been suggested as being diagnostic for neuronopathic GD, but they may also occur in GD type 1 and in other inflammatory diseases. 3) The importance of whole GBA1 sequencing. This approach is superior to exome sequencing because of potential effects of deep intronic variants on gene expression. It also has the capacity to detect variant alleles that might be missed with gene panels. 4) Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The risks of MGUS, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are elevated in patients with GD compared to the general population and strong evidence indicates that lyso-Gb1 stimulates the formation of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-protein) in patients with GD and MGUS. 5) Pulmonary involvement in GD. Pulmonary complications can be identified through spirometry in up to 45 % of patients with GD type 1 and 55 % of those with GD type 3. Limited evidence exists that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) reduces the severity of these complications in patients with GD type 1. 6) Gaucheromas. These may occur in patients with GD types 1 or 3, but there is little detailed information about their inception, mechanisms underlying growth, cellular organization, and biochemical activities, and no definitive guidance for their management. Gaucheromas behave like benign (i.e. non-metastasizing) neoplasms, and it may be reasonable to classify them as such. 7) Bone and joint involvement. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans alone are insufficient for monitoring all changes in bone that may occur in patients with GD. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques using Dixon quantitative chemical shift imaging have provided results that correlate with GD severity scores, bone complications, and biomarkers for GD bone involvement. Thoracic kyphosis is a common complication of GD types 1 and 3, and there is very limited information regarding the effects of ERT or substrate synthesis inhibition therapy (SSIT) on this condition. 8) Treatment initiation, selection, combination, and switching. Prompt initiation of treatment in pediatric patients is important as GD can lead to impaired growth, lower peak bone mass, and delayed puberty. These adverse outcomes can often be ameliorated or prevented with timely treatment. Either ERT or eliglustat, a SSIT agent, is suitable as first-line treatment of adults with GD. Studies of switching from ERT to eliglustat, or between different ERT products, have indicated that changing treatment is safe, although efficacy outcomes vary. A critical remaining issue is the lack of treatments capable of reaching the CNS to slow or halt the progression of neuronopathic disease in patients with GD type 2 or 3 and potentially reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease in GD type 1 patients and heterozygotes for GBA1 variants."

    "abstract": "Treatment options for Type 1 Gaucher Disease (GD1) include enzyme replacement therapy and oral substrate reduction therapy. The criteria for treatment initiation vary across regions. Recent retrospective studies have highlighted the natural progression of never-treated GD1, suggesting that some patients remain asymptomatic or stable for extended periods. However, there is no data on long-term prospective follow-up. We conducted a prospective study following a cross-sectional analysis of 36 never-treated, non-splenectomised GD1 patients from the French Gaucher Disease Registry (FGDR). The objective was to describe the natural disease progression, tracking clinical, radiological, and biological characteristics over time. Thirty-six non-splenectomised and never-treated patients (19 women and 17 men) diagnosed with Gaucher Disease were prospectively followed for an additional median duration of 6.5 (5-8.3) years. Of the cohort, 17 remained untreated, 10 initiated treatment, and 7 were lost to follow-up. Although never-treated patients tended to be older at the time of first symptoms, diagnosis, and last follow-up compared to those who received treatment, the difference was not significant in this small cohort. At last follow-up, never-treated patients had no worsening of most of their symptoms. No significant changes were observed in platelets, chitotriosidase, and lyso-Gb1. In this prospective cohort, we highlight that patients with mild GD can remain untreated with no disease progression, offering insights into cost-effective management strategies. Identifying such patients is still challenging."

Oral substrate reduction therapy (SRT) with eliglustat offers a potential alternative, particularly for those with barriers to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Evaluate the safety and efficacy of eliglustat SRT in pediatric patients with type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1), both as initial therapy and as a switch from intravenous ERT. A prospective case series was conducted from 2017 to 2024. Yale's National Gaucher Disease Treatment Center, New Haven, CT, United States. Fourteen pediatric GD1 patients with significant barriers to receiving ERT. Eliglustat SRT was dosed pharmacogenomically based on CYP2D6 metabolizer status. Primary outcomes included safety and efficacy in reversing indicators of disease activity. Secondary outcomes involved changes in patient and parent-reported quality of life, assessed using PROMIS questionnaires. Eliglustat was initiated at a mean age of 12.5 years (range: 6-17 years) and administered for a mean duration of 3.6 years (range: 1-7 years). All patients remained on treatment and exhibited sustained reductions in glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) levels compared to baseline (<i>p</i> = 0.005). Other disease indicators demonstrated corresponding improvements. Adverse effects were limited to transient gastroesophageal reflux in 3/14 patients (21%). Serial electrocardiograms (EKGs) were normal. Growth and developmental milestones were appropriate for age in all patients. Patients and their parents reported a global improvement in quality of life. Eliglustat demonstrated significant clinical benefits in pediatric GD1 patients, as evidenced by reductions in GlcSph levels and other disease indicators. The therapy showed a favorable safety profile comparable to that observed in adults. These findings suggest eliglustat is a promising therapeutic option for pediatric GD1 patients, providing an effective alternative to ERT."

    "abstract": "Biallelic mutations in the <i>GBA1</i> gene encoding lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), lead to the development of the Gaucher disease (GD) and also represent a significant risk factor for the Parkinson's disease (PD). In most cases, mutations in the <i>GBA1</i> gene are located outside the region coding for the enzyme active site and cause a decrease in the GCase activity due to the reduction in the efficiency of transport of conformationally altered enzyme to the lysosomes. Drugs used to treat GD (enzyme replacement therapy) cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and, therefore, are not effective in the treatment of neuronal forms of GD or PD associated with mutations in the <i>GBA1</i> gene (GBA1-PD). Currently, inhibitors of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of PD. It was previously shown that inhibition of LRRK2 leads to the increase in the GCase activity in patient-specific GBA1-PD cells. We assessed the effect of the LRRK2 inhibitor MLi-2 on the GCase activity in the primary culture of peripheral blood macrophages from patients with type 1 GD. The activity of GCase and the levels of its substrate in cells cultured with and without MLi-2 was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). No effect of LRRK2 inhibition on the activity GCase in a group of patients with GD was found."

    "abstract": "For many inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) the understanding of disease mechanisms remains limited in part explaining their unmet medical needs. We hypothesize that the expressivity of IEM disease phenotypes is affected by the activity of specific modifier pathways, which is controlled by rare and common polygenic variation. To identify these modulating pathways, we used RNA sequencing to generate molecular signatures of IEM in disease relevant tissues. We then integrated these disease signatures with multiomic data and gene regulatory networks generated from animal and human populations without overt IEM. We identified and subsequently validated glucocorticoid signaling as a candidate modifier of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorders, and we re-capitulated complement signaling as a modifier of inflammation in Gaucher disease. Our work describes a novel approach that can overcome the rare disease-rare data dilemma, and reveal new IEM pathophysiology and potential drug targets using multiomics data in seemingly healthy populations."

    "abstract": "Despite life-long pharmacotherapy for many people affected by lysosomal storage diseases, no data are available on their beliefs about their treatments. Therapeutic options range from disease-specific, with varying levels of effectiveness, to purely supportive. This spectrum is illustrated by the three diseases Gaucher disease type 1 (effective disease-specific therapies), Fabry disease (disease-specific therapies with variable effectiveness), and mucopolysaccharidosis type III A/B (supportive care only). Employing the Necessity-Concerns Framework of the Beliefs in Medicine Questionnaire, we investigated intra- and intergroup variability in adults with Gaucher disease type 1, Fabry disease, and parents of children with mucopolysaccharidosis type III A/B. Participants rated <i>necessity</i> and <i>concern</i> items on a Likert scale, leading to categorization as <i>accepting</i>, <i>skeptical</i>, <i>indifferent</i>, or <i>ambivalent</i>. Self-reported demographic, disease-, and therapy-related data were also obtained. Eighty-one surveys were completed. Gaucher disease respondents (<i>n</i> = 15) were overwhelmingly categorized as <i>accepting</i> (high necessity, low concern). Female Fabry disease respondents (<i>n</i> = 43) were almost equally distributed over all categories except <i>accepting.</i> Male Fabry disease respondents (<i>n</i> = 16) were mostly <i>ambivalent</i> or <i>accepting</i>, indicating overall high necessity scores but varying concern. All mucopolysaccharidosis type III participants (<i>n</i> = 7) were categorized as <i>indifferent</i> (low necessity, low concern). The Beliefs in Medicine Questionnaire emerged as a valuable and feasibly employable tool for individual and group assessments in these populations. It reveals differences in beliefs aligned with current unmet medical needs. Expansion of this approach is warranted to optimize personalized counseling on therapeutic choices and to align drug development with the needs and beliefs of potential recipients."

It is well known that there is a strong association between the abnormal expression of miRNAs and various diseases including cancer. These abnormally expressed miRNAs can be used as biomarkers. Interestingly, several studies have reported a linkage between GD with an increased risk of cancer. Therefore, in the current study, we investigated the expression levels of selected miRNAs that are associated with cancers that might have potential use as biomarkers in GD. Blood samples were collected from 24 healthy volunteers, 6 carriers, and 20 treated patients with type 1 GD. A reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) platform was used to analyze the miRNA expression levels. While carriers had lower relative expressions of miRNA-15a with tumor suppressor ef-fect, and miRNA-150 and miRNA-181b with oncogene effect, treated patients with type 1 GD had lower relative expressions of miRNA-15a and miRNA-125b with tumor suppressor effect and higher relative expression miRNA-21 with oncogene effect (p<0.001, p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.05, p<0.001, and p<0.05, respectively). The results suggested that the downregulation of miRNA-15a and miRNA-125b expressions with tumor suppressor effect and the upregulation of miRNA-21 expression with on-cogene effect can be indicated to an increased risk for cancers such as multiple myeloma (MM), B-cell lymphoma, leukemia, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in GD."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal enzyme replacement therapy (<b>ERT</b>) holds potential for treating lysosomal storage disorders, but achieving targeted delivery of deficient therapeutic enzymes remains a significant challenge. This study presents a novel approach for the lysosome-specific delivery of the β-glucosidase (<b>B8CYA8</b>) enzyme by covalently conjugating lysosome-targeting mannose-6-phosphate functionalized glycopolypeptides (<b>M6P-GP</b>). We used a protein-glycopolypeptide conjugate developed through advanced protein engineering and bioconjugation techniques. By conjugating β-glucosidase to <b>M6P-GP</b> that has a high affinity for the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptors (<b>CI-MPR</b>) and lysosomal receptors, we enhance the enzyme's selective intracellular uptake and lysosome-specific localization. To attain maximum activity of the near-native enzyme after delivery, we have designed and synthesized an acetal linkage containing the pH-responsive linker maleimide-acetal-azide (<b>MAA</b>), which will cleave in the lysosomal acidic pH to detach the glycopolypeptide from the protein backbone. We demonstrated the efficient cellular uptake of the protein-glycopolypeptide conjugate and showed targeted lysosome delivery, leading to increased enzymatic activity compared to untreated cells. Our results proved that the approach mainly improves the specificity and efficiency of enzyme delivery, particularly into lysosomes, which may enable new methods for <b>ERT</b>.

Therefore, assessing cognition and detecting cognitive changes in these individuals over time have become important components of their care. The National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHT-CB, Version 2) is a brief, standardized instrument designed to measure cognitive processes in individuals 3-85 years of age. With its availability and ease of administration by a trained provider, the NIHT-CB could potentially be used in a clinical health care setting to help screen/monitor cognition in individuals with PD. This is the first study to report the use of the NIHT-CB in children and adolescents with IOPD and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) and their performance on this instrument in comparison to traditional neuropsychological measures. Fourteen children with IOPD (median age = 10.5, range = 6-19 years) and eight with LOPD (median age = 12.5, range = 7-17 years) were administered the NIHT-CB and a neuropsychological battery by the same psychologist with expertise in PD. On the NIHT-CB and selected neuropsychological measures, nearly all median scores for the IOPD group were lower than those of the LOPD group. However, none of the differences between the IOPD and LOPD groups were statistically significant. Consistent with previous reports, there was a wide range of scores among the IOPD and LOPD participants on both the neuropsychological measures and the NIHT-CB. The lowest median NIHT-CB score for both groups was on the Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test (IOPD = 77.5, LOPD = 84), a measure of executive function and selective attention. Positive, significant relationships were found between the NIHT-CB and neuropsychological measures of overall cognition, reading decoding, and short-term working memory on the Wechsler Intelligence Test scales and the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement subtest for the IOPD group only. Though not a replacement for an established neuropsychological battery, the NIHT-CB could potentially be used as a screening measure to provide a baseline level of cognitive functioning in children and adolescents with IOPD. Observed changes in the NIHT-CB Cognitive Function Composite or selected subtests over time may also signal the need for a more comprehensive neuropsychological battery and/or brain imaging studies as indicated. Longitudinal studies examining the performance of a larger cohort of IOPD and LOPD children and adults at multiple time points are needed."

    "abstract": "In the last few decades, neonatal screening (NBS) has expanded to include lysosomal storage diseases, allowing for the early identification of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. However, neonatal diagnosis of late-onset disorders can cause parental stress and affect family well-being, possibly leading to overmedicalization. The impact of a positive NBS for Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) can have an important impact on parental psychological well-being and psychosocial functioning. This study aims to study parental stress in parents of newborns who had a positive result for Gaucher disease in an NBS program in Northeastern Italy. Fourteen parents (7 fathers and 7 mothers) of seven children with confirmed GD1 (86% boys) completed the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF) at diagnosis (T0), 12 months (T1), and 36 months (T2). A control group of fourteen parents (7 fathers and 7 mothers) whose children had normal NBS results was included. Interviews were conducted for the GD1 group at T2 to investigate the usefulness of the NBS program. At T0, higher parental stress was assessed in GD1 parents compared to the healthy controls. Subsequently, the parents of GD1 children reported significant reductions in Parental Distress at T1 compared to T0. Mothers showed further reductions at T2, while the fathers' distress decreased but not significantly. GD1 mothers had significantly higher distress scores than the controls at T1, but this difference diminished over time. Our study highlights the psychological impact of NBS on GD1, emphasizing the need for better multidisciplinary communication to reduce parental stress throughout the diagnostic and treatment process."

This is a cross-sectional study of the COMEBAC cohort that followed patients 4 months after hospitalization for COVID-19 at Bicêtre Hospital. Patients with lingering symptoms or who had been in critical care (n = 177) were invited to a day hospital for assessment of MDD and peripheral inflammation. Ten peripheral inflammatory markers were examined: plasmatic C-reactive protein; leukocyte, monocyte, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts; the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio; the systemic inflammatory index (i.e., the (platelet x neutrophil) to lymphocyte ratio); cortisol, ferritin, and hemoglobin levels. Current MDD was assessed through structured interviews with a psychiatrist, depressive symptoms through self-questionnaires. Peripheral inflammatory markers were compared between patients with post-COVID MDD and patients without a lifetime history of psychiatric disorders (controls). Out of 177 patients, 24 (13.6%) had MDD. No significant differences in peripheral inflammatory markers were observed between patients with post-COVID MDD and controls.

Variants in the glucosylceramidase beta 1 (GBA1) gene are the strongest genetic risk factor for PD, while homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in this gene classically cause Gaucher disease (GD). This study presents an early-onset PD patient with a homozygous GBA1 deletion. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed, and the identified variant was validated via Sanger sequencing. The variant was classified according to ACMG guidelines and ClinGen updates. The patient, a Brazilian female of mixed ethnicity, exhibited the full spectrum of classical motor and non-motor PD symptoms without evident hallmarks of GD. The identified homozygous GBA1 variant (NM_000157.4:c.222_224del; p.T75del; rs761621516) has a very low global allele frequency (0.00003284) and is associated with reduced enzymatic activity. This variant exhibits a founder effect among individuals of African descent. This case highlights an intricate genotype-phenotype landscape for GBA1 variants, underscoring the role of homozygous GBA1 variants in PD pathogenesis."

A woman with GD, a compound heterozygote of N370S (now commonly described as c.1226A>G (N409S)-mild pathogenic variant) and 84insG (severe pathogenic variant), had PGT consulting before planned in vitro-fertilization. Her mother, an 84insG carrier, had early-onset PD. <i>GBA1</i> sequencing of her spouse was negative. We discussed the selection for N370S carrier embryos to reduce PD risk. This case report demonstrates the expansion of PGT for late-onset conditions. These novel indications will increase the number of subjects who would be candidates for PGT. The medical and bioethical considerations of these cases should be acknowledged by the professional community and discussed with couples during genetic counseling."

    "title": "Development of selective nanomolar cyclic peptide ligands as GBA1 enzyme stabilisers.",
    "abstract": "The stabilisation of recombinant glycosidases by exogenous ligands, known as pharmacological chaperones or enzyme stabilisers, has recently garnered great clinical interest. This strategy can prevent enzyme degradation in the blood, reducing required dosages of recombinant enzyme and extending IV injection intervals, thereby reducing side effects, improving patient lifestyles and treatment costs. While this therapeutic approach has been successfully implemented for treating Pompe and Fabry diseases, clinical studies for Gaucher disease using chaperones alone or in combination with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) have been limited, and no small molecule chaperones have yet been approved for this condition. Developing such therapies requires selective and effective reversible GBA1 ligands. Here, we describe the development of a new class of selective macrocyclic peptide GBA1 ligands using random nonstandard peptides integrated discovery (RaPID) technology, and demonstrate their ability to bind and stabilise rhGBA1 in plasma at nanomolar concentrations. These cyclic peptides do not inhibit endogenous GBA1 in cells due to poor cell permeability but can stabilise extracellular rhGBA1 in plasma, presenting significant potential as a combinatorial ERT-pharmacological chaperone therapy for Gaucher disease."

    "abstract": "Retinal vasoproliferative tumor, otherwise known as retinal reactive astrocytic tumor, is a rare entity presenting as a mass in the inferior peripheral retina, associated with vascular abnormalities, and usually accompanied by exudative manifestations that affect the visual prognosis. The precise etiology is unknown, but the predominantly astrocytic and reactive nature of these lesions now appears to be established. It is classified as primary or secondary, and numerous associated ocular conditions have been reported, including pigmentary retinopathy, pars planitis and Coats' disease. The main differential diagnosis is the retinal capillary hemangioblastoma in von Hippel-Lindau disease. There is currently no consensus on the ideal treatment, and numerous therapeutic modalities have been described in limited case series, with variable success rates. Nevertheless, treatment is essential when there is a visual risk and is based on a combined, thoughtful approach to the various therapeutic modalities available, depending on the individual characteristics of the tumor. Conservative treatments such as laser photocoagulation, cryotherapy and/or photodynamic therapy are generally preferred for small tumors, while more invasive treatments such as brachytherapy are proposed for large lesions or tumors for which the exudative activity cannot be controlled. Vitreoretinal surgery is frequently required for complications such as retinal detachment, epiretinal membranes or vitreous hemorrhage. Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are an adjuvant treatment for the macular edema frequently associated with the disease."

    "abstract": "Transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) is a type of protein aggregation disease. Its clinical heterogeneity imposes challenges in effective management. Red blood cell (RBC) variables may be clinically relevant as mechanistic parts or tellers of TDT pathophysiology. This is a cross-sectional study of RBC and plasma physiology in adult patients with TDT vs healthy control. TDT plasma was characterized by increased protein carbonylation, antioxidants, and larger than normal extracellular vesicles. RBCs were osmotically resistant but prone to oxidative hemolysis. They overexposed phosphatidylserine and exhibited pathologically low proteasome proteolytic activity (PPA), which correlated with metabolic markers of the disease. RBC ultrastructure was distorted, with splenectomy-related membrane pits of 300 to 800 nm. Plasma metabolomics revealed differences in heme metabolism, redox potential, short-chain fatty acids, and nitric oxide bioavailability, but also in catecholamine pathways. According to coefficient of variation assessment, hemolysis, iron homeostasis, PPA, and phosphatidylserine exposure were highly variable among patients, as opposed to RBC fragility and plasma antioxidants, amino acids, and catecholamines. Sex-based differences were detected in hemolysis, redox, and energy variables, whereas splenectomy-related differences referred to thrombotic risk, RBC morphology, and plasma metabolites with neuroendocrine activity. Hepcidin varied according to oxidative hemolysis and metabolic markers of bacterial activity. Patients with higher pretransfusion hemoglobin levels (>10 g/dL) presented mildly distorted profiles and lower membrane-associated PPA, whereas classification by severity of mutations revealed different levels of hemostasis, inflammation, plasma epinephrine, hexosamines, and methyltransferase activity markers. The currently reported heterogeneity of cellular and biochemical features probably contributes to the wide phenotypic diversity of TDT at clinical level."

    "abstract": "Depending on zygosity and the specific change, different variants in the GBA1 gene can cause Parkinson's disease (PD, PARK-GBA1) with reduced penetrance, act as genetic risk factors for PD or parkinsonism, and/or lead to Gaucher's disease (GD). This MDSGene systematic literature review covers 27,963 patients carrying GBA1 variants from 1082 publications with 794 variants, including 13,342 patients with PD or other forms of parkinsonism. It provides a comprehensive overview of demographic, clinical, and genetic findings from an ethnically diverse sample originating from 82 countries across five continents. The most frequent pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were \"N409S\" (aka \"N370S\"; dominating among Jewish and Whites), and \"L483P\" (aka \"L444P\"; dominating among Asians and Hispanics), whereas the most common coding risk variants were \"E365K\" (E326K), and \"T408M\" (T369M) (both common among Whites). A novel finding is that early-onset PD patients were predominantly of Asian ethnicity, whereas late-onset PD patients were mainly of White ethnicity. Motor cardinal features were similar between PD patients and other forms of parkinsonism, whereas motor complications and non-motor symptoms were more frequently reported in PD patients carrying \"severe\" variants than in those with \"risk\" or \"mild\" variants. Cognitive decline was reported in most patients after surgical treatment, despite achieving a beneficial motor function response. Most GD patients developing PD harbored the \"N409S\" variant, were of Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity, and showed a positive response to chronic levodopa treatment. With this review, we start to fill the gaps regarding genotype-phenotype correlations in GBA1 variant carriers, especially concerning PD. © 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "There are still few centres, which specialise in the care of adults with inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). All physicians who participated in the SSIEM adult metabolic physicians group paper in 2014 were contacted to provide updated data on their IEM patients. Fifteen adult centres responded to our survey with information on their patients. Nine thousand, six hundred fifty-one patients were included in the final cohort, compared with 6 182 in the previous analysis. There were 394 separate diagnoses. The most common diseases were phenylketonuria (19.6%), mitochondrial disorders (12.3%) and lysosomal storage disorders such as Fabry disease (20.1% of LSD's), Pompe disease (3.1%), and Gaucher disease (2.8%). Among the disorders that can present with acute metabolic decompensation, the urea cycle disorders (4.0%), were most common (ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency 2.6%), followed by maple syrup urine disease (1.1%) and glycogen storage disease type I (0.7%). Patients were frequently diagnosed as adults, particularly those with mitochondrial disease and lysosomal storage disorders. Many patients are only diagnosed in adulthood (> 40%) and the cohort is increasing substantially with 9 651 patients included in the final analysis (34% increase compared to our original paper). Thus reinforcing the need for adult specialists to be trained in this area."

Initial workup showed anemia, thrombocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The patient underwent an open biopsy of the right femur with irrigation and debridement that was inconclusive, but cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and group G hemolytic streptococci that were treated with clindamycin. Differential diagnosis was broad with a negative workup for malignancy, chronic granulomatous disease, infectious causes, sarcoidosis, and vasculitis. Multiple MRIs were consistent with bilateral femur osteomyelitis, right proximal tibia, and right humerus osteomyelitis with negative cultures on subsequent admissions. The patient was diagnosed with chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). He had clinical and laboratory improvement for two years on methotrexate. He was then tried on a short course of steroids and adalimumab for worsening symptoms. Bone biopsy was repeated, and findings were consistent with Gaucher disease (GD), which was confirmed on biochemical testing with low beta-glucosidase activity. He was started on enzyme replacement therapy with clinical and biochemical improvement."

The objective of this study was to provide recommendations on the statistical analysis and reporting of single-arm pregnancy medication safety studies using primary source datasets. A Delphi consensus-setting protocol was used to acquire agreement on recommendations from experts with extensive knowledge and experience in conducting studies investigating medication safety in pregnancy. A series of recommendations, along with their scientific justifications and examples of how to calculate and describe exposure and outcome incidences, were critiqued and improved through a series of online Delphi review rounds. Agreement to inclusion scoring was assessed using a five-point Likert scale. Recommendations with a median Likert-scale score of at least 4, where ≥ 80% of the expert panel scored the recommendation at level 4 or higher, was used as the threshold for inclusion. The Delphi consensus methodology produced a set of 30 recommendations spread over five themes. These included descriptions of (1) study sample, (2) medication exposure, (3) maternal outcomes, (4) pregnancy and birth outcomes, and (5) fetal and neonatal outcomes. Of the 30 recommendations, 19 were strongly advised while 11 were included for consideration where their implementation may be beneficial for supplementing data communication. Use of the finalised set of recommendations should be encouraged to help standardise published evidence around medication use in pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disease due to deficiency of glucocerebrosidase, leading to the accumulation of glucosylceramide, particularly in macrophages. In addition to storage, secondary abnormalities such as inflammation, cellular stress, and impaired autophagy may contribute to the disease pathogenesis. The onset and course of progression of these secondary abnormalities remains unclear. Owing to the increasingly widespread newborn screening programs, diagnosis can be made at a presymptomatic stage. Understanding the early natural course of the disease is important for optimal monitoring and management of such at-risk individuals.The aim of our study is to investigate secondary abnormalities in very young children with type 1 Gaucher disease identified through neonatal screening. We enrolled five children (<4 years old) with type I Gaucher disease in a presymptomatic stage and not receiving therapy. We assessed plasma cytokine profiles (TNFα, IL1β, and IL6 by ELISA), activation of pro-inflammatory p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the abundance of LC3-II as indicator of autophagic flux, by immunoblotting. All subjects exhibited elevated TNFα (mean 21.74 μmol/L, SD 37.48, range 2.37-88.72 μmol/L). The other cytokines analyzed were within normal range. Cellular stress (activation of p38) was present in the child with higher glucosylsphingosine (GluSph) accumulation. Additionally, all subjects showed a significant reduction in LC3-II (mean 88 %, SD 9 %, range 77-98 %), indicating reduced autophagic flux. We have identified the presence of inflammation with inhibition of autophagic flux in presymptomatic young children with a genetically confirmed high-risk of developing Gaucher disease. These findings contribute insights into the early course of Gaucher disease and support the management of at-risk individuals identified by newborn screening. Therapeutic interventions including specific enzyme replacement or other means to address inflammation or autophagy could delay or prevent the onset of symptomatic disease and consequential disability. Further clinical studies are warranted to explore these possibilities."

    "abstract": "Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli hemolytic-uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS) is a severe illness predominantly affecting young children, with limited treatment options beyond supportive care. Eliglustat, approved for Gaucher disease, shows potential in reducing Shiga toxin binding to target glomerular endothelial cells in vitro, prompting interest as a treatment for STEC-HUS. However, it remains unknown what dose is likely to be effective and safe for treatment of STEC-HUS in the pediatric population. We hypothesize that effective and safe levels of eliglustat can be reached in children. We identified pharmacokinetic targets of efficacy for treatment and prophylaxis of STEC-HUS based on a preclinical model and human cardiac safety data. Then, we developed oral and intravenous dosing regimens using population pharmacokinetic (popPK) simulations based on an existing model enriched to allow extrapolation to a simulated virtual pediatric population. These dosing regimens were then confirmed using a verified physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. We simulated, using popPK data, oral and intravenous dosing regimens resulting in adequate target exposure in > 90% of all patients, with minimal expected risk for cardiotoxicity. Confirmation of these dosing regimens with PBPK modeling resulted in very similar exposure, with lower interindividual variability and minimal toxicity potential. Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, we developed oral and intravenous eliglustat dosing regimens that are likely safe and effective for treatment of STEC-HUS and prophylaxis in case of outbreaks of STEC infections. Clinical evaluation of these dosing regimens in children suspected of or diagnosed with STEC-HUS is required and should include assessment of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety (e.g., ECG monitoring)."

The panels were diverse, with balanced representation of professional background, gender, and geography, including civil society representatives. Outcome were included if ≥ 80% of participants scored them as critically important and ≤10% rated them as not important. The final COS includes seven main maternal outcomes-pregnancy outcome, maternal death, suspected symptomatic infection, confirmed infection, severe disease, preterm delivery, mode of birth; seven complementary maternal outcomes-antepartum haemorrhage, postpartum haemorrhage, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, maternal sepsis, admission to intensive care unit/special units, respiratory support, depression and anxiety; 11 main neonatal outcomes-neonatal death, neonatal suspected symptomatic infection, confirmed infection, severe disease, vertical transmission, low birth weight, prematurity, congenital disorder, respiratory support, skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding; and, four complementary neonatal outcomes-admission to neonatal intensive care unit/special units, respiratory failure, birth asphyxia, sepsis.

    "abstract": "Wearable sensors have the potential to transform diagnosis, monitoring, and management of children who have neurological conditions. Traditional methods for assessing neurological disorders rely on clinical scales and subjective measures. The snapshot of the disease progression at a particular time point, lack of cooperation by the children during assessments, and susceptibility to bias limit the utility of these measures. Wearable sensors, which capture data continuously in natural settings, offer a non-invasive and objective alternative to traditional methods. This review examines the role of wearable sensors in various paediatric neurological conditions, including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, as well as Rett syndrome, Down syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy, ataxia, Gaucher disease, headaches, and sleep disorders. The review highlights their application in tracking motor function, seizure activity, and daily movement patterns to gain insights into disease progression and therapeutic response. Although challenges related to population size, compliance, ethics, and regulatory approval remain, wearable technology promises to improve clinical trials and outcomes for patients in paediatric neurology."

Patients may present with a wide spectrum of disease manifestations, including hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, bone manifestations, and in the case of GD types 2 and 3, neurodegeneration, cognitive delay, and/or oculomotor abnormalities. While there is no treatment for neuronopathic GD, non-neuronopathic manifestations can be efficiently managed with enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy. However, many patients with GD experience a lengthy diagnostic odyssey, which can negatively affect their access to care and clinical outcomes. The cause of this diagnostic delay is multifaceted. Since genotype/phenotype correlations in GD are not always clear, it is difficult to predict the presence, severity, and onset of clinical manifestations. This heterogeneity, combined with the molecular complexity of the <i>GBA1</i> locus, low disease prevalence, and limited knowledge of GD among providers serves as a barrier to early diagnosis of GD. In this review, we discuss such obstacles and challenges, considerations, and future steps toward improving the diagnostic journey for patients with GD."

We previously discovered that a <i>minos</i>-inserted mutation in the <i>GBA1</i> gene of fruit flies, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, mimics human neuronopathic GD (nGD) characteristics, providing a promising model for studying the molecular mechanisms of the disease. We also reported that extremely low-frequency electric fields (ELF-EFs) promote sleep and extend the lifespan of wild-type flies. In this study, we show that ELF-EFs have health-promoting effects on nGD model flies. Firstly, the total sleep time and sleep episode duration of EF-exposed nGD model flies increased. EFs also extended the lifespans of nGD model flies. Additionally, the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-related gene <i>PERK</i> and autophagy-related gene <i>p62</i> were elevated after EF exposure. The effects of EF exposure on nGD flies are associated with the change of these genes expression. Our findings suggest that EF exposure may be effective as an additional therapy for nGD."

Glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1) has been shown to be a reliable, key, specific, and sensitive biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response in clinical studies of patients with GD. We evaluated the change in lyso-Gb1 concentration over time following enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed GD using real-world data from the Gaucher Outcome Survey disease registry. Data for patients aged ≥ 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of GD and at least two lyso-Gb1 assessments were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were stratified by treatment status at baseline (time of first lyso-Gb1 assessment). Lyso-Gb1 concentrations were measured from dried blood spot (DBS) samples by Centogene AG. Assessments included change in lyso-Gb1 concentration, hemoglobin concentration, platelet counts, and spleen and liver volume from baseline to the last lyso-Gb1 assessment. Of 2007 patients enrolled in the Gaucher Outcome Survey as of February 25, 2022, 435 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study: 318 treated ('all treated'; 277 receiving treatment at baseline, 41 treatment naive at baseline), 38 receiving treatment at baseline who stopped treatment before the last lyso-Gb1 assessment, and 79 untreated. Lyso-Gb1 concentrations decreased from baseline to the last lyso-Gb1 assessment for all treated patients (median change - 8.6 ng/mL), and increased for untreated patients (median change 25.0 ng/mL) and those who stopped treatment (median change 19.5 ng/mL). Decreases were greater for all treatment-naive than previously treated patients (median change - 120.5 vs. - 3.3 ng/mL) and for velaglucerase alfa-treated patients vs. the overall treated cohort (-32.6 vs. - 8.6 ng/mL). Small improvements in hemoglobin concentrations, platelet counts, and spleen volume were observed for treated patients but not untreated/stopped treatment cohorts. In this study, changes in lyso-Gb1 concentrations from DBS were reflective of responses to enzyme replacement therapy initiation or withdrawal in most patients. These findings confirm that the use of DBS samples for routine monitoring of lyso-Gb1 concentrations in patients with GD is feasible in real-world settings and may be useful to assess treatment response."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of glucocerebroside lipids within multiple organs due to a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme (acid β-glucosidase). It is an inherited autosomal recessive disease. The onset of symptoms can vary depending on disease type and severity, with milder forms presenting in adulthood. The main clinical manifestations include cytopenia, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and bone lesions. GD is characterized by several bone manifestations, such as osteopenia/osteoporosis, focal lytic or sclerotic lesions, osteonecrosis acute or chronic bone pain, Erlenmeyer flask deformity, and subchondral joint collapse with secondary degenerative arthritis. In 70-100% of patients affected by Gaucher disease type 1, clinical or radiographic evidence of bone disease occurs. Among bone complications, osteoporosis is very common, but its etiopathogenesis in GD is not completely clear. Results deriving from experimental studies support the hypothesis that there is an aberrant activity of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts due to several factors, resulting in impaired bone turnover. Bone complications represent the main cause of pain, disability, and reduced quality of life in these patients. Therefore, there is a need to enhance awareness among physicians on the skeletal manifestations throughout life of GD patients, in order to improve diagnosis and management of bone complications. In particular, this narrative review focuses on risk of bone fragility in GD, etiopathogenetic hypotheses, epidemiological data, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of osteoporosis in patients suffering from Gaucher disease, specifying the challenges not yet addressed."

This study evaluates bone health in adult GD type 1 patients, focusing on skeletal complications, bone mineral density (BMD), and biochemical markers. A cohort of adult GD type 1 patients followed up at Ege University Pediatric Metabolism Department were retrospectively examined. This study included 32 patients with GD type 1, comprising 11 males (34.4%) and 21 females (65.6%). The median age at diagnosis was 20.5 years (min: 3-max:65), and at enrolment, it was 35 years (min:18-max:71). Most patients (93.8%) had organomegaly, and 93.8% had cytopenia. Common genetic variants were p.Asn409Ser (60.9%), p.Leu483Pro (7.8%), and p.Asp448His(4.7%). All patients were on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for a median of 11 years (min:2-max:18). Bone complications included pathologic fractures in six patients (19%) and avascular necrosis in 12 patients (37.5%). Bone pain was reported by 93.7% of patients at admission and persisted in 59.4% during follow-up. DXA scans showed abnormal bone mineral density (BMD) in 62.5% of patients initially, with a significantly low bone density in 3.1% and reduced bone density in 59.3%. BMD improved with treatment, as evidenced by a significant increase in Z scores (p < 0.05). Elevated chitotriosidase (75%), ferritin (50%), and immunoglobulin G (21.9%) levels were noted but did not correlate with BMD. Seven patients (22%) were splenectomized, all with bone issues. Bone health in GD involves multiple factors beyond biochemical markers. While ERT improves BMD, bone pain and fractures remain significant issues. Comprehensive management, including regular BMD monitoring and better vitamin D supplementation adherence, is crucial. Further research is needed to improve treatments for bone complications in GD."

Equally unresolved is how the accumulation of a diverse spectrum of substrates in the neuronal lysosomes results in remarkably similar neurodegenerative outcomes.

The accumulation of toxic substrates, which causes the hallmark symptoms of GD, is dependent on the extent of enzyme dysfunction. Accordingly, three distinct subtypes have been recognized, with type 1 GD (GD1) as the common and milder form, while types 2 (GD2) and 3 (GD3) are categorized as neuronopathic and severe. Manifestations variably include hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, easy bruising, inflammation, bone pain and other skeletal pathologies, abnormal eye movements and neuropathy. Although the molecular basis of GD is relatively well understood, currently used biomarkers are nonspecific and inadequate for making finer distinctions between subtypes and in evaluating changes in disease status and guiding therapy. Thus, there is continued effort to investigate and identify potential biomarkers to improve GD diagnosis, monitoring and potential identification of novel therapeutic targets. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of emerging biomarkers in GD that can enhance current understanding and improve quality of life through better testing, disease management and treatment."

    "title": "African ancestry neurodegeneration risk variant disrupts an intronic branchpoint in <i>GBA1</i>.",
    "abstract": "Recently, a novel African ancestry specific Parkinson's disease (PD) risk signal was identified at the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase (<i>GBA1</i>). This variant (rs3115534-G) is carried by ~50% of West African PD cases and imparts a dose-dependent increase in risk for disease. The risk variant has varied frequencies across African ancestry groups, but is almost absent in European and Asian ancestry populations. <i>GBA1</i> is a gene of high clinical and therapeutic interest. Damaging bi-allelic protein-coding variants cause Gaucher disease and mono-allelic variants confer risk for PD and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, likely by reducing the function of glucocerebrosidase. Interestingly, the novel African ancestry specific <i>GBA1</i> risk variant is a non-coding variant, suggesting a different mechanism of action. Using full length RNA transcript sequencing, we identified intron 8 expression in risk variant carriers (G) but not in non-variant carriers (T). Antibodies targeting the N-terminus of glucocerebrosidase showed that this intron-retained isoform is likely not protein coding and subsequent proteomics did not identify a shorter protein isoform, suggesting the disease mechanism is RNA-based. CRISPR editing of the reported index variant (rs3115534) revealed that this is the responsible sequence alteration driving production of these intron 8 containing transcripts. Follow-up analysis of this variant showed that it is in a key intronic branchpoint sequence and therefore has important implications in splicing and disease. In addition, when measuring glucocerebrosidase activity we identified a dose-dependent reduction in risk variant carriers (G). Overall, we report the functional effect of a <i>GBA1</i> non-coding risk variant, which acts by interfering with the splicing of functional <i>GBA1</i> transcripts, resulting in reduced protein levels and reduced glucocerebrosidase activity. This understanding reveals a novel therapeutic target in an underserved and underrepresented population."

    "abstract": "Mutations in the <i>GBA1</i> gene, which encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), are associated with Gaucher disease and increased risk of Parkinson's disease. This study describes the discovery and characterization of novel allosteric pharmacological chaperones for GCase through an innovative computational approach combined with experimental validation. Utilizing virtual screening and structure-activity relationship optimization, researchers identified several compounds that significantly enhance GCase activity and stability across various cellular models, including patient-derived fibroblasts and neuronal cells harboring <i>GBA1</i> mutations. Among these, compound <b>3</b> emerged as a lead candidate, demonstrating the ability to enhance GCase protein levels and enzymatic activity while effectively reducing the accumulation of toxic substrates in neuronal models. Importantly, pharmacokinetic studies revealed that compound <b>3</b> has favorable brain penetration, indicating its potential as a disease-modifying therapy for <i>GBA1</i>-related disorders affecting the central nervous system. This research not only offers a framework for developing allosteric GCase modulators but also unveils promising new therapeutic strategies for managing Gaucher disease and Parkinson's disease. The ability of compound <b>3</b> to cross the blood-brain barrier emphasizes its potential significance in addressing neurological symptoms associated with these conditions."

    "abstract": "Gaucheromas, pseudotumors composed of Gaucher cells, are rare complications of Gaucher's Disease (GD). They are usually seen in patients receiving enzyme replacement. Surgery is generally not recommended for these benign masses in treatment management. Most patients treated with Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) show organ enlargement and improvement in laboratory values. In our case, no change in the size of the lesions was observed despite 4 years of standard dose ERT. A 27-year-old female, not having a known chronic disease and occasionally consulting doctors due to bone pain, weakness, and fatigue, visited the emergency department with the complaint of a nosebleed four years ago. The patient was found to have hepatosplenomegaly in physical examination and was referred to the hematology clinic because of pancytopenia. According to the physical examination and laboratory results, the desired leukocyte glucocerebrosidase level was 0.4 micromol/lt/hour (normal range > 2.5). Homozygous mutations of p.L483P and L483P were observed in genetic tests. Based on these results, the patient was diagnosed with GD. Although the patient received regular weekly treatment for 4 years, no significant change was observed in the spleen size. The patient was admitted to the hospital in April 2022 with complaints of abdominal fullness and indigestion. Her quality of life was deteriorating due to massive splenomegaly. A splenectomy was performed on the patient. In our case, splenic gaucheroma, a rare complication of Gaucher's disease, was found to be present. These masses, which are a rare complication of GD, have started to be better recognized by radiologists and clinicians thanks to the case series shared, and it is clear that there is a need for standardization and further research in this field. With an increase in the number of cases and experiences in this field, there will inevitably be different and new developments in follow-up and treatment approaches."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare genetic disorder with multi-system involvement. Liver fibrosis is a long-term complication of GD, potentially leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are currently no validated clinical tools for the monitoring of liver fibrosis in patients with GD. In this study, we aim at assessing the validity of common fibrosis-predicting scores, developed for other diseases, for the use in GD, using transient elastography as a gold-standard, as well as developing the first GD-specific liver fibrosis predicting score. We enrolled 19 adult patients with GD who had been on treatment for a minimum of 1 year on enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy and who had no evidence of any other liver disease except GD or metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which is a common comorbidity of GD. We analyzed the correlation between liver stiffness and genotype, treatment modality (imiglucerase or other therapies), clinical severity, and clinical laboratory tests. We found that the common liver fibrosis scores APRI, FIB-4, and NFS did not accurately predict liver fibrosis in people with GD. We also found that male sex, the DS3 score, AST, and GGT levels significantly correlated with liver stiffness, and used these to create a simple but accurate fibrosis-predicting score specifically for GD (the \"Gaucher liver fibrosis score\", or GLFS), with high accuracy (AUC = 0.8571, p = 0.0206). We believe that our new GLFS may be used in clinical practice to help prioritize GD patients for closer monitoring of liver fibrosis."

The aim of NBS is to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions in newborns as early as possible, before the onset of disease symptoms. Early diagnosis enables timely treatments and improves the quality of life for affected patients. A pilot project for dried blood spot (DBS) NBS of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), including Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPSI, IDUA α-L-iduronidase deficiency), Pompe disease (GAA α-glucosidase acid deficiency), Gaucher disease (GBA β-glucosidase deficiency) and Fabry disease (GLA α-galactosidase deficiency), was conducted using the digital microfluidic (DMF) technique. DBS were analyzed in a multiplexed assays for the enzymatic activities of four lysosomal enzymes (IDUA, GAA, GBA, GLA), and subjects identified as deficient in any of these enzymes were referred to the clinical reference center for diagnosis confirmation. From June 6th, 2022, to May 12th, 2023, a total of 7650 newborns were analyzed and 1 subject affected by Pompe disease was identified together with two additional subjects, suspected of Pompe and Fabry disease respectively, for whom continued follow-up is mandatory to determine the phenotype. The pilot project for DBS NBS of four LSDs in Campania Region validated the effectiveness of DMF method, established enzymatic activity cut-offs, and identified newborns referred to the clinical center for integrated diagnostics, including genetic analyses. The results suggest that this technique can effectively detect potentially affected newborns, who will require further diagnostic confirmation and clinical follow-up.

Despite effective treatments, insufficient disease awareness frequently results in diagnostic delays during which irreversible complications occur. We delineated the shared and distinctive features of hepatic, splenic, and lipoprotein phenotypes in ASMD and GD1. We analyzed baseline hepatic, splenic, and lipoprotein phenotypes of untreated adults in pivotal trials of ASMD (ASCEND, N=36) and GD1 (ENGAGE, N=40). The mean cohort ages were 34.8 years in ASMD and 31.8 years in GD1. Most patients had normal or low body mass index. Moderate hepatosplenomegaly (mean volume in multiples of normal) was common in both cohorts (hepatomegaly 1.53±0.42 and 1.40±0.32, respectively; splenomegaly 11.45±4.36 and 13.20±5.91, respectively). Liver function tests were mildly elevated in ASMD but normal in GD1. In both disorders, mean HDL cholesterol (mg/dL) was profoundly low (22.23±9.14 ASMD; 26.25±8.08 GD1) and correlated inversely with liver volume (r=-0.45 ASMD, p=0.005; r=-0.50 GD1, p=0.001) and spleen volume (r=-0.60 ASMD, p=0.0001; r=-0.63 GD1, p<0.0001). Mean LDL cholesterol (mg/dL) was elevated in ASMD (145.86±49.80) but low in GD1 (68.85±22.53). HDL cholesterol correlated inversely with serum concentrations of lyso-sphingomyelin in ASMD (r=-0.48, p=0.003) and glucosylsphingosine in GD1 (r=-0.63, p<0.0001). ASMD and GD1 should be considered in differential diagnosis of patients with unexplained liver and lipid abnormalities, especially young, lean adults with very low HDL and hepatosplenomegaly. HDL emerged as a potential biomarker of disease activity in these sphingolipid disorders."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) is an ultra-rare lysosomal storage disease with two distinct phenotypes, an infantile-onset form (formerly Wolman disease) and a later-onset form (formerly cholesteryl ester storage disease). The objective of this narrative review is to examine the most important aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of LAL-D and to provide practical expert recommendations. The infantile-onset form occurs in the first weeks of life and is characterized by malnourishment and failure to thrive due to gastrointestinal impairment (vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption), as well as systemic inflammation, hepatosplenomegaly, and adrenal calcifications. Mortality is close to 100% before one year of life in the absence of specific treatment. The later-onset form can be diagnosed in childhood or adulthood and is characterized by chronic liver injury and/or lipid profile alterations. When LAL-D is suspected, enzyme activity should be determined to confirm the diagnosis, with analysis from a dried blood spot sample being the quickest and most reliable method. In infantile-onset LAL-D, the initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (sebelipase α) and careful nutritional management with a low-lipid diet is very urgent, as prognosis is directly linked to the early initiation of specific treatment. In recent years, our knowledge of the management of LAL-D has increased considerably, with improvements regarding the initial enzyme replacement therapy dose and careful nutritional treatment with a low-lipid diet to decrease lipid deposition and systemic inflammation, leading to better outcomes. In this narrative review we offer a quick guide for the initial management of infantile-onset LAL-D."

Systemic inflammation, cellular stress, and metabolic dysfunction may influence endocrine function, including the thyroid. This study evaluated thyroid function and morphology in 60 GD patients, alongside carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Anthropometric, biochemical, and hormonal tests were conducted, including thyroid ultrasound and shear-wave elastography (SWE). Clinical data, bone mineral density (BMD), and body composition (BOD POD) analyses were correlated. Healthy controls, matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), were included. GD patients had higher thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels within normal limits. Hypothyroidism occurred in 7%, elevated anti-thyroid antibodies in 8%, and nodular goiter in 23%. Patients with nodular goiter showed lower platelet counts and higher chitotriosidase and glucosylsphingosine (lysoGb-1) levels. Patients with type 3 GD had larger thyroid volumes and greater stiffness on SWE than patients with type 1 GD. GD patients also exhibited increased metabolic risk, including central obesity and elevated glucose levels. GD patients, despite normal thyroid hormone levels, exhibit subtle alterations in thyroid function indicators. Their increased risk of central obesity and glucose metabolism disorders, alongside higher TSH and FT4 levels, underscores the need for closer monitoring and further investigation."

(1) Develop and validate a multiplex ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) methodology using DUS to quantify twenty-one lysosphingolipids normalized to creatinine for eight different sphingolipidoses. (2) Establish normal reference values to evaluate the clinical utility of the methodology. Samples were eluted from a 5 cm filter paper disk (~1 mL of urine) and extracted on Oasis MCX solid-phase extraction cartridges prior to injection in the UPLC-MS/MS system. Urinary lysosphingolipids were stable on DUS at -80 °C and -30 °C for 117 days, at 21.5 °C and 4 °C for at least 26 days, and at 35 °C for 3 days.

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD), an autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder, primarily affects the lysosomal enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), leading to glucosylceramide accumulation in lysosomes. GD presents a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. This study deploys immune-based proteomics and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics technologies to comprehensively investigate the biochemical landscape in 43 deeply phenotyped type 1 GD patients compared to 59 controls. Conventional and systems biology approaches have been used to analyze the data. The results show promising biological imprints. Elevated phosphatidylcholines in GD patients suggest altered lipid metabolism, potentially due to their increased synthesis. This points to endoplasmic reticulum stress and impaired lipid trafficking, commonly seen in lysosomal diseases. GD patients exhibit an inflammatory profile with elevated cytokines and autoimmune-like inflammation, even in treated patients, highlighting the complexity of GD-related immune imbalances. Mitochondrial dysfunction clues are found through increased oxidative stress markers and altered acylcarnitine profiles in GD patients, suggesting mitochondrial membrane dysfunction affecting carnitine-carrying capacity. Furthermore, platelet count, splenectomy, treatment, and clinical traits were associated with specific omics features, providing insights into GD's clinical heterogeneity and potential diagnostic markers. Autophagy inhibition appears pivotal in GD, driving lipid synthesis, impaired mitochondrial function, and inflammation through chronic activation of mTORC1. Despite limitations like focusing on type 1 GD and using targeted omics approaches, this study provides valuable insights into GD metabolic and immune dysregulation. It lays the basis for future comprehensive investigations into GD manifestations with broader scope and molecular coverage. KEY MESSAGES: The study sheds light on metabolic and immune dysregulation in Gaucher disease. Gaucher disease patients showed elevated phosphatidylcholines, disrupted lipid metabolism, and inflammation profiles. Signs of mitochondrial dysfunction are evident in Gaucher disease patients, with autophagy inhibition significantly affecting lipid synthesis, mitochondrial function, and inflammation via chronic activation of mTORC1."

    "abstract": "Gaucher's disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the <i>GBA1</i> gene. Mutations in the gene lead to the deficiency of glucocerebrosidase, an enzyme that helps in the breakdown of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) into ceramide and glucose. The lack of the enzyme causes GlcCer accumulation in macrophages, resulting in various phenotypic characteristics of GD. The currently available therapies, including enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy, only provide symptomatic relief. However, they grapple with limitations in efficacy, accessibility, and potential side effects. These observations laid the foundation to search for new approaches in the management of GD. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology emerges as a beacon of hope, offering novel avenues for future GD therapies. The true magic of iPSCs lies in their ability to differentiate into various cell types. By reprogramming patient-derived cells into iPSCs, researchers can generate personalized models that recapitulate the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the GD. These models are valuable tools for dissecting intricate disease pathways, developing novel therapeutic targets, and enhancing the drug development process for GD. This review emphasizes the significance of iPSCs technology in GD management. Further, it addresses several challenges that are being encountered in the application of iPSC technology in the management of GD. In addition, it provides several insights into the future aspects of iPSC technology in the management of GD."

    "abstract": "Gaucher Disease (GD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, leading to the accumulation of glucosylceramide in various cells, including red blood cells (RBCs). This accumulation results in altered biomechanical properties and rheological behavior of RBCs, which may play an important role in blood rheology and the development of bone infarcts, avascular necrosis (AVN) and other bone diseases associated with GD. In this study, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations are employed to investigate the biomechanics and rheology of blood and RBCs in GD under various flow conditions. The model incorporates the unique characteristics of GD RBCs, such as decreased deformability and increased aggregation properties, and aims to capture the resulting changes in RBC biophysics and blood viscosity. This study is the first to explore the Young's modulus and aggregation parameters of GD RBCs by validating simulations with confocal imaging and experimental RBC disaggregation thresholds. Through <i>in silico</i> simulations, we examine the impact of hematocrit, RBC disaggregation threshold, and cell stiffness on blood viscosity in GD. The results reveal three distinct domains of GD blood viscosity based on shear rate: the aggregation domain, where the RBC disaggregation threshold predominantly influences blood viscosity; the transition area, where both RBC aggregation and stiffness impact on blood viscosity; and the stiffness domain, where the stiffness of RBCs emerges as the primary determinant of blood viscosity. By quantitatively assessing RBC deformability, RBC disaggregation threshold, and blood viscosity in relation to bone disease, we find that the RBC aggregation properties, as well as their deformability and blood viscosity, may contribute to its onset. These findings enhance our understanding of how changes in RBC properties impact on blood viscosity and may affect bone health, offering a partial explanation for the bone complications observed in GD patients."

ERT is being administered either in specialized clinics or in the home care setting. Studies indicate that home-based ERT can be considered safe and positively effects patient reported outcomes. Due to the higher level of individual care required by nurses when administering ERT at home, questions arise whether this will result in additional costs for health care systems. Since cost data to the German health care system are currently unavailable, this study aims to assess home care ERT costs of LSD patients. The longitudinal study assessed the direct costs of home-based ERT for patients with LSD diseases Fabry, Pompe, Gaucher, and MPS I from 2019 to 2021 on a patient-by-patient basis by evaluating the healthcare documentation. Costs assessed included ERT drug and further administration equipment, time needed to prepare, administer, and post-process the infusion, and travel expenses of nursing staff. Data from 62 patients was analyzed: of these, 29 (46.8%) with Fabry disease, 19 (30.6%) with Pompe disease, 10 (16.1%) with Gaucher disease, and 4 (6.5%) with MPS I. Patients ranged in age from 3 to 79 (mean 40 years); 42% of patients reported comorbidities (19.4% with hypertension, and 10% with heart disease). Mean total ERT-related costs were €369,047 per year across all patients. Approximately 98.5% of these costs were attributable to the infusion therapy and administration itself (€363,880), and approximately 1.5% were attributable to personnel and travel costs. Patients with Pompe disease incurred the highest average annual costs (€483,907) and patients with Fabry disease the lowest (€264,896). Cost differences among underlying LSDs were due primarily to ERT drug costs; the drug infused for Fabry disease costs about half as much as that for Gaucher or for Pompe disease. Despite MPS I patients requiring about twice as many infusions, significantly lower drug costs for this disease resulted in the second lowest total mean costs of all LSD subtypes analyzed. As total costs are almost entirely driven by infusion-related material, especially the ERT drug, moving ERT into the home environment is not expected to increase costs."

    "abstract": "Recently, an African ancestry-specific Parkinson disease (PD) risk signal was identified at the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase (GBA1). This variant ( rs3115534 -G) is carried by ~50% of West African PD cases and imparts a dose-dependent increase in risk for disease. The risk variant has varied frequencies across African ancestry groups but is almost absent in European and Asian ancestry populations. GBA1 is a gene of high clinical and therapeutic interest. Damaging biallelic protein-coding variants cause Gaucher disease and monoallelic variants confer risk for PD and dementia with Lewy bodies, likely by reducing the function of glucocerebrosidase. Interestingly, the African ancestry-specific GBA1 risk variant is a noncoding variant, suggesting a different mechanism of action. Using full-length RNA transcript sequencing, we identified partial intron 8 expression in risk variant carriers (G) but not in nonvariant carriers (T). Antibodies targeting the N terminus of glucocerebrosidase showed that this intron-retained isoform is likely not protein coding and subsequent proteomics did not identify a shorter protein isoform, suggesting that the disease mechanism is RNA based. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats editing of the reported index variant ( rs3115534 ) revealed that this is the sequence alteration responsible for driving the production of these transcripts containing intron 8. Follow-up analysis of this variant showed that it is in a key intronic branchpoint sequence and, therefore, has important implications in splicing and disease. In addition, when measuring glucocerebrosidase activity, we identified a dose-dependent reduction in risk variant carriers. Overall, we report the functional effect of a GBA1 noncoding risk variant, which acts by interfering with the splicing of functional GBA1 transcripts, resulting in reduced protein levels and reduced glucocerebrosidase activity. This understanding reveals a potential therapeutic target in an underserved and underrepresented population."

The conditions are rare, and there is therefore a need for accurate and up to date information concerning the disease course and survival to assist in the design of clinical trials. RETRIEVE is a natural history study aiming to: (1) collect data on the survival of patients with early-onset (onset of first neurological manifestation before 24 months of age) GM1, GM2, or GD2; (2) collect data that could constitute a historical control group for future clinical trials; and (3) evaluate whether the conditions can be assessed together in a single interventional clinical trial. Group A included patients who were deceased or with unknown survival status at enrollment and was thus limited to retrospective data. Group B included patients who were alive at enrollment, who were followed prospectively with additional retrospective data collection. Group A included 185 patients (60 with GM1, 78 with GM2, and 47 with GD2), and Group B included 40 patients (18 with GM1, 16 with GM2, and 6 with GD2). Mean and median age at diagnosis and age at onset of first neurological manifestation were youngest in patients with GD2 and oldest in patients with GM2 in both groups. In Group A, median (95% CI) survival was 19.0 (18.0, 22.0), 44.0 (37.0, 51.9) and 14.0 (10.0, 16.0) months in patients with GM1, GM2 and GD2, respectively. In Group B, hypotonia was experienced by most patients with GM1 (17/18, 94.4%), and was less common in patients with GM2 (12/16, 75.0%) and GD2 (4/6, 66.7%). Strabismus and splenomegaly were reported in all six patients with GD2. RETRIEVE is one of the largest natural history studies of GM1, GM2, and GD2. Results were generally consistent with the published literature, with differences potentially due to variation in inclusion criteria. The difference in median survival between patients with early-onset GM1, GM2, and GD2 reported in this study suggests that the three diseases should not be pooled for study in clinical trials."

Highly stable and low-dispersed Velaglucerase-loaded Eudragit nanoparticles (NPs) (NPs: Vela); 150-160 nm mean size, polydispersity index <0. 15, zeta potential around -32 mV, and 95 % Velaglucerase alfa encapsulation efficiency were obtained. Crystallographic structural analysis by Small Angle X-ray Scattering, confirmed that Velaglucerase alfa was incorporated into the nanoparticle matrix. In vitro studies revealed that NPs: Vela preferentially interact with immunoglobulins and fibrinogen, and a positive enzyme release from NPs:Vela was observed at acidic pH; while no release was observed in neutral conditions. A positive internalization of NPs:Vela in GD mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) was also verified, increasing enzyme cellular activity compared to non-treated cells. Confocal microscopy verified that NPs:Vela colocalized with lysosomes, but no effect of NPs: Vela in the mineralization of MSC was observed. Finally, the viability of GD cell lines is not affected by NPs: Vela, in comparison with Velaglucerase alone, that negatively affects the viability of the target cells. This nanocarrier system for Velaglucerase alfa delivery in lysosomes, initially proposed to improve ERT for GD, may also serve as a starting point to address pathophysiological mechanisms in GD and other lysosomal disorders."

The spectrum of clinical manifestations is extremely heterogeneous. LSD diagnosis and management still present many issues. <b>Methods:</b> A group of Italian experts and patients' representatives met to discuss some critical aspects, and among the most impactful are early diagnosis, the transition of the patient from pediatric to adult age, territorial management, and the multidisciplinary approach. <b>Results:</b> Possible solutions to diagnostic delays may be a widespread newborn screening and screening programs on selected populations. The lack of a structured transition process could be helped by the drafting of shared diagnostic and therapeutic care pathways beyond the availability of databases accessible to the different levels that manage a patient. Territorial management could benefit from telemedicine, but a homogeneous diffusion of home therapy, not yet everywhere possible, is essential. A fundamental role is played by the patient associations, which should be increasingly involved in the political choices. It is also crucial to create structured multidisciplinary teams of experts for disease management and comorbidities. A transversal need appears to be greater training on LSDs. In Italy, the \"Statement of Udine\" was developed to guide further steps towards improvements in inherited metabolic medicine in adults, referencing the experience from the United Kingdom. <b>Conclusions:</b> Much can be done for the early diagnosis and management of LSDs with an effective treatment, but many aspects need improvement for the overall management of the patient. An investment in dedicated resources, formal recognition, and training is needed to address these unmet needs."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal lipid storage disorder caused by β-glucocerebrosidase (encoded by <i>GBA1</i> gene) activity deficiency, resulting in the accumulation of glucosylceramide (Gb1) and its deacylated metabolite glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1). Lyso-Gb1 has been studied previously and proved to be a sensitive biomarker, distinguishing patients with GD from carriers and healthy subjects. It was shown that its level corresponds with β-glucocerebrosidase activity, thus it remains unknown as to why carriers have slightly higher lyso-Gb1 level than healthy population. This is the first report on lyso-Gb1 levels describing representative cohort of GD carriers. Our data of 48 GD carriers, including three newborns, indicated that there are significant differences in lyso-Gb1 levels between carriers having a GD-affected mother and a healthy mother (11.53 and 8.45, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.00077), and between carriers of the L483P <i>GBA1</i> variant and carriers of other <i>GBA1</i> pathogenic variants (9.85 and 7.03, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.07). Through analysing our unique data of three newborns whose mothers are patients with GD, we also found that lyso-Gb1 is most probably transferred to the foetus via placenta."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Patients with Gaucher disease have a high risk of bone disease, with osteonecrosis representing the most debilitating complication. The pathogenesis of osteonecrosis has not been fully elucidated yet, and there is an unmet need for predictive biomarkers of bone complications. We aimed to assess the utility of angiogenesis and bone turnover biomarkers as predictors of osteonecrosis in Gaucher disease. <b>Methods</b>: Angiogenesis and bone turnover biomarkers were measured in 146 Gaucher disease patients (70M:76F, median age 49.5 [IQR 36.7 to 61]) with/without osteonecrosis enrolled in the UK-based registry GAUCHERITE [enrolment 2015-2017]. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was used to compare the osteonecrosis predictive value of angiogenesis and bone turnover biomarkers and determine the optimal cut-off values for each biomarker. <b>Results</b>: Sixty-two patients had osteonecrosis before study enrolment, 11 had osteonecrosis during follow-up, and 73 remained osteonecrosis-free. Patients with osteonecrosis showed increased osteopontin and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 levels and decreased MMP-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C compared with those free from osteonecrosis. MMP-9 predicted future osteonecrosis with higher sensitivity and specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.84 [95% CI 0.84-0.99]; sensitivity/specificity 82%/75%; cutoff value ≤ 72,420 pg/mL) than osteopontin, MMP-2 and VEGF-C when taken alone. The combination of MMP-9 and VEGF-C further increased the discriminating accuracy. <b>Conclusions</b>: The osteopontin-MMPs-VEGF axis is dysregulated in Gaucher disease patients with osteonecrosis. The combination of MMP-9 and VEGF-C circulating levels may serve to identify Gaucher disease patients at risk of osteonecrosis."

Gaucher disease type IIIC is a rare subtype that is characterized by cardiovascular involvement, eye-movement disorders, and late-onset neurological symptoms. We present a 14-year-old adolescent boy diagnosed with Gaucher disease type IIIC at age four with a homozygous D409H mutation who developed severe aortic valve stenosis, extensive aortic calcification and a porcelain aorta despite enzyme replacement treatment since the diagnosis. Despite the challenges during the cardiac surgery, we successfully performed transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The patient developed a complete atrioventricular block and required a pacemaker after the TAVI. He experienced further complications during the follow-up. The case presents the challenges in the treatment of cardiovascular complications in patients with Gaucher disease and demonstrates the importance of individualized treatment approaches, as well as the potential advantages and complications of TAVI in difficult situations like this."

    "title": "Different and unusual presentation of Gaucher's disease with the same mutation in the glucocerebrosidase enzyme (F266L) in two patients: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher is an autosomal recessive inherited lysosomal storage disorder. The incidence of this disease is rare with a global estimate of around 1 in 57,000 to 1 in 75,000. Gaucher's disease is caused by a mutation in the glucocerebrosidase gene. Common symptoms of this disease include hepatosplenomegaly, moderate neurological symptoms, and late‑onset skeletal alterations. However, Gaucher can sometimes have rare presentations that lead to a delayed diagnosis in patients. This report discusses two adult cases of Gaucher's disease (type 1) with the same mutation but with unusual symptoms. One patient was a 44-year-old man who had been experiencing chronic cough since he was 10 years old, and the other patient was a 27-year-old woman with itching, both atypical symptoms of Gaucher. Bronchodilators and prednisolone were administered for chronic cough and antihistamines and prednisolone were given for the itching, but little to no improvement was seen. Sonography tests revealed that both cases had splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and liver malfunction, characteristic of Gaucher's disease. Bone marrow aspiration tests confirmed the presence of Gaucher's cells in their bones. The level of glucocerebrosidase enzyme in both cases was less than 1.5 nmol/mL/hour. Whole exon sequencing confirmed a mutation on exon 8 of the GBA1 gene in a homozygous form in both cases, resulting in a transversion mutation (C > G) at position c.798, leading to the substitution of phenylalanine 266 with leucine. Both patients were of Bakhtiyari ethnicity and had parents who were in a consanguineous marriage. After receiving Cerezyme treatment, both cases experienced a disappearance of their cough and itching symptoms. This report highlights the importance of recognizing the unusual presentation of Gaucher's disease especially in regions with high rates of consanguineous marriage and thalassemia. This knowledge can aid physicians in making accurate diagnoses and providing appropriate treatment."

    "abstract": "Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is an oxidant produced endogenously by several enzymatic pathways. While it can cause molecular damage, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also plays a role in regulating cell proliferation and survival through redox signaling pathways. In the vascular system, red blood cells (RBCs) are notably efficient at metabolizing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In addition to a robust antioxidant defense, we recently determined that human RBCs also have a high membrane permeability to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> that is independent of aquaporin 1 or aquaporin 3. In this work, we sought to further investigate the permeation mechanism of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> through the membrane of human RBCs. First, we explored the role of other erythrocytic membrane proteins in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> transport, including urea transporter B and ammonia transporter Rh proteins. However, no differences were found in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> permeability in RBCs lacking these proteins compared to control RBCs. We then focused on the hypothesis that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> diffuses through the lipid bilayer. To test this, we studied H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> permeability in RBCs from patients with Gaucher disease (GD), which accumulate sphingolipids in the membrane, affecting RBC morphology and deformability. We found that RBCs from GD patients exhibited lower H₂O₂ membrane permeability. In another approach, we treated normal RBCs with hexanol, which fluidizes the lipid fraction of the RBC membrane, and observed an increase in the permeability to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In contrast, hexanol had no effect on the rate of water efflux by aquaporin 1. Together, these results support the hypothesis that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> diffusion through the RBC membrane occurs primarily through the lipid fraction."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) type 3 is an autosomal recessive lysosomal disease caused by deficiency of β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) and encompasses a spectrum of cardiac, neurological, and ophthalmological abnormalities. Although the clinical presentations can be diverse, a recognized clinical trajectory points to an early onset, predominantly before 18 years. GD type 3c is primarily caused by homozygosity for <i>GBA</i> pathogenic variant c.1342G>C (p.Asp448His; historically referred to as D409H) and includes visceral, hematological, skeletal, and cardiac abnormalities. Notably, GD type 3c is distinct from other GD types because it is primarily characterized by valvular heart disease. Yet, with less than 50 patients with GD type 3c reported to date, the phenotypic spectrum and extent of cardiac involvement remains ill-defined. We present a 20-year-old female with an atypical presentation of GD type 3c consisting of chronic intermediate uveitis as the presenting feature and the presence of extensive polyneuropathy starting in adolescence which has been previously unreported in GD type 3c. Distinctively, she has maintained normal cardiac function. Moreover, we compare our case with those reported in the literature to broaden awareness of the varied initial presentations of this disease. The diverse presentations seen in GD type 3c, underscored by our case and those previously reported, demonstrate the need for standardized evaluation and management protocols."

We compared cross-sectional data on visceral, hematological, and biochemical manifestations of untreated adult patients with chronic visceral ASMD (<i>n</i> = 19) and GD1 (<i>n</i> = 85). Spleen volume, liver volume, and bone marrow fat fraction did not significantly differ between the two disease groups (<i>p</i> >0.05 for all).

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder marked by a substantial reduction in beta-glucocerebrosidase activity. Historically, supportive treatments such as splenectomy and orthopedic interventions were employed, whereas recent advances have led to the approval of Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) and Substrate Reduction Therapy (SRT) as therapeutic options. The authors present the case of a 61-year-old female with chronic abdominal pain, abdominal fullness, pancytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly, all indicative of Gaucher's disease, later confirmed by histopathological examination. The patient was informed about newer treatment options like ERT and SRT, as well as the traditional approach of splenectomy. However, due to financial constraints, she opted for splenectomy in conjunction with conservative management. Gaucher disease is defined by a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase, leading to the accumulation of Gaucher cells (pathognomonic of the disease), particularly in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and lungs. Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1) can manifest at any age, from childhood to late adulthood. Definitive diagnosis is confirmed by reduced beta-glucocerebrosidase activity. Traditionally, treatment options for GD1 have been supportive, including splenectomy, blood transfusions, and orthopedic procedures. However, SRT and ERT, though effective, remain prohibitively expensive and often inaccessible in low-resource settings. Early diagnosis of Gaucher disease is challenging due to its rarity and should be considered in patients presenting with hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and low glucocerebrosidase activity."

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), a rare autosomal recessive multisystemic disorder, substantially impacts patients' day-to-day activities, outcomes, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The PROPEL trial compared cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat (cipa+mig) with alglucosidase alfa plus placebo (alg+pbo) in adult patients with LOPD over 52 weeks and showed improved motor and respiratory function in patients switching treatment from standard-of-care enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to cipa+mig at baseline. This study evaluated the impact of cipa+mig on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including HRQoL in ERT-experienced patients, using data from PROPEL. PROs evaluated included the Subject's Global Impression of Change (SGIC), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function Short Form 20a, PROMIS Fatigue Short Form 8a, Rasch-built Pompe-specific Activity (R-PAct), and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions 5 Response Levels (EQ-5D-5L). The proportions of responders in the cipa+mig arm and the alg+pbo arm were compared via chi-squared or Fisher's exact test (patient-level responder analysis), and least squares (LS) mean differences were calculated for change from baseline at Week 52 of the PRO measures (group-level analysis). At Week 52, patient-level SGIC responder and group-level SGIC analyses favored cipa+mig compared with alg+pbo across all SGIC domains (e.g. 90 vs. 59% responders in the cipa+mig vs. the alg+pbo group for SGIC ability to move around; P = 0.0005; and LS mean difference 0.385; P = 0.02). Similarly, PROMIS Physical Function and Fatigue domains numerically favored cipa+mig in both analyses (e.g. 50 vs. 40% responders in the cipa+mig vs. alg+pbo arm for PROMIS Physical Function; P = 0.37; and LS mean difference 3.1; P = 0.11). R-PAct for both treatment groups was similar in the patient-level responder analysis, but numerically favored alg+pbo in the group-level analysis (35% responders in both arms; P = 0.95; and LS mean difference -0.8; P = 0.48). Self-care, usual activities, and depression/anxiety domains of EQ-5D-5L numerically favored cipa+mig in both analyses (e.g. 20 vs. 12% responders in the cipa+mig vs. alg+pbo arm for EQ-5D-5L self-care; P = 0.54; and LS mean difference -0.108; P = 0.52). Overall, switching treatment from alglucosidase alfa to cipa+mig positively impacted PRO measurements during the double-blind period of PROPEL.

    "abstract": "N-glycosylation is a key post-translational modification critical for protein function and stability. Chitotriosidase-1 (CHIT1), belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 18, is clinically utilized as a biomarker of Gaucher disease. A G102S variant is common in some populations, but the implications of this missense mutation on CHIT1 function and in disease pathology are unknown. We have investigated the effects of the G102S mutation on the N-glycosylation, structure, and activity of CHIT1. Three recombinant CHIT1 proteins, wild-type (WT), G102S, and N100Q+G102S double mutants, were expressed, purified, and analyzed for glycosylation using SDS-PAGE, MALDI-MS, PNGase F treatment, and lectin blotting. NMR and LC-MS/MS were employed to characterize glycan structures. Enzymatic assays and molecular dynamics simulations were used to assess the effects of mutations on CHIT1 function and dynamics. The G102S mutation introduced a new N-glycosylation site at N100, confirmed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-MS, and the composition of the N-glycan structures was verified by lectin blotting, NMR, and MS. Both G102S and N100Q+G102S proteins exhibited reduced catalytic efficiency compared to WT. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that G102S mutation induces significant structural changes and reduces stability, particularly without N-glycan, likely impairing substrate binding and enzymatic activity. Our findings indicate that the common G102S mutation affects the structure and function of CHIT1, partially by introducing a new N-glycosylation site. They provide a foundation for further research on the impact of N-glycosylation on its hydrolase activity and structural dynamics, with potential implications for understanding the role of CHIT1 in Gaucher disease."

The heterozygous E326K form is one of the most common genetic risk factors for PD worldwide, but, to date, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigate the effect of the E326K on the structure, stability, dimerization process, and interaction mode with some proteins of the interactome of GCase using multiple molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at pH 5.5 and pH 7.0 to mimic the lysosomal and endoplasmic reticulum environments, respectively. The analysis of the MD trajectories highlights that the E326K mutation did not significantly alter the structural conformation of the catalytic dyad but significantly makes the structure of the dimeric complexes unstable, especially at lysosomal pH, potentially impacting the organization of the quaternary structure. Furthermore, the E326K mutation significantly impacts protein interactions by altering the binding mode with the activator Saposin C (SapC), reducing the binding affinity with the inhibitor α-Synuclein (α-Syn), and increasing the affinity for the Lysosomal integral membrane protein-2 (LIMP-2) transporter."

Lysosomal enzymes break down macromolecular compounds, which contribute to metabolic homeostasis. Stored, undegraded materials have multiple effects on cells that lead to the activation of autophagy and apoptosis, including the toxic effects of lyso-lipids, the disruption of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion homeostasis, the secondary storage of macromolecular compounds, the activation of signal transduction, apoptosis, inflammatory processes, deficiencies of intermediate compounds, and many other pathways. Clinical observations have shown that carriers of potentially pathogenic variants in LSD-associated genes and patients affected with some LSDs are at a higher risk of cancer, although the results of studies on the frequency of oncological diseases in LSD patients are controversial. Cancer is found in individuals affected with Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, Niemann-Pick type A and B diseases, alfa-mannosidosis, and sialidosis.

Flies homozygous for the D415S mutation (dubbed D370S hereafter) presented low GCase activity and substrate accumulation, which led to lysosomal defects, activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), inflammation/neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration along with earlier death compared to control flies. Surprisingly, the L494P (called L444P hereafter) flies presented higher GCase activity with fewer lysosomal defects and milder disease in comparison to that presented by the D370S homozygous flies. Treatment with ambroxol had a limited effect on all homozygous fly lines tested.

This study provides insights into the survival rates and associated risk factors for GD patients in Brazil, contributing to the global understanding of GD and its management. While we acknowledge the inherent limitations of relying largely on electronic medical records and categorical codes, our findings underscore the need for early diagnosis, timely initiation of treatment, effective management of comorbidities, and personalized dosing strategies to improve patient outcomes. Future studies should aim to incorporate clinical verification of electronic data to further enhance the reliability and applicability of these findings."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) resulting from inherited glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) deficiency. GD diagnosis relies on GBA1 activity assays, typically employing 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (4MU-β-Glc) as fluorogenic substrate. However, these assays suffer from background 4MU release by the non-lysosomal GBA2 and cytosolic GBA3 enzymes. Here we developed GBA1-selective fluorogenic substrates by synthesizing a series of 6-O-acyl-4MU-β-Glc substrates with diverse fatty acid tails. Because of the chemical and enzymatic instability of the ester bonds, analogs of 6-O-palmitoyl-4MU-β-Glc (3) with different chemical linkages were synthesized. 6-O-alkyl-4MU-β-Glc 9, featuring an ether linkage, emerged as the most optimal GBA1 substrate, exhibiting both a low K<sub>m</sub> and compared to substrate 3 a high V<sub>max</sub>. Importantly, substrate 9 is not hydrolyzed by GBA2 and GBA3 and therefore acts as a superior substrate for GD diagnosis. Plants contain glycosyl phytosterols (campesterol, β-sitosterol, and sigmasterol) that may also be acylated at C-6. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that 6-O-acylated and regular glycosylcholesterol (HexChol) tend to be increased in spleens of patients with GD. Moreover, significant increases in 6-O-acyl-glycosyl-phytosterols were detected in GD spleens. Our findings suggest uptake of (6-O-acyl)-glycosyl-phytosterols from plant food and subsequent lysosomal processing by GBA1, and comprise the first example of accumulation of an exogenous class of glycolipids in GD. Excessive exposure of rodents to glycosylated phytosterols has been reported to induce manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD). Further investigation is warranted to determine whether (6-O-acyl)-glycosyl-phytosterols could contribute to the enigmatic link between inherited defects in GBA1 and the risk for PD."

    "abstract": "Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) is implicated in both a rare, monogenic disorder (Gaucher disease, GD) and a common, multifactorial condition (Parkinson's disease, PD); hence, it is an urgent therapeutic target. To identify correctors of severe protein misfolding and trafficking obstruction manifested by the pathogenic L444P-variant of GCase, we developed a suite of quantitative, high-throughput, cell-based assays. First, we labeled GCase with a small proluminescent HiBiT peptide reporter tag, enabling quantitation of protein stabilization in cells while faithfully maintaining target biology. TALEN-based gene editing allowed for stable integration of a single HiBiT-<i>GBA1</i> transgene into an intragenic safe-harbor locus in <i>GBA1</i>-knockout H4 (neuroglioma) cells. This GD cell model was amenable to lead discovery via titration-based quantitative high-throughput screening and lead optimization via structure-activity relationships. A primary screen of 10,779 compounds from the NCATS bioactive collections identified 140 stabilizers of HiBiT-GCase-L444P, including both pharmacological chaperones (ambroxol and noninhibitory chaperone NCGC326) and proteostasis regulators (panobinostat, trans-ISRIB, and pladienolide B). Two complementary high-content imaging-based assays were deployed to triage hits: The fluorescence-quenched substrate LysoFix-GBA captured functional lysosomal GCase activity, while an immunofluorescence assay featuring antibody hGCase-1/23 directly visualized GCase lysosomal translocation. NCGC326 was active in both secondary assays and completely reversed pathological glucosylsphingosine accumulation. Finally, we tested the concept of combination therapy by demonstrating synergistic actions of NCGC326 with proteostasis regulators in enhancing GCase-L444P levels. Looking forward, these physiologically relevant assays can facilitate the identification, pharmacological validation, and medicinal chemistry optimization of small molecules targeting GCase, ultimately leading to a viable therapeutic for GD and PD."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) are a heterogenous group of inborn errors of metabolism due to lysosomal malfunction. LSDs affect 1 in 5000 live births, albeit every LSD itself has a low incidence. The most common LSDs are Fabry disease and Gaucher disease. The underlying cause mainly is an enzyme deficiency but may also be due to defects in transport or activation proteins, which result in progressive intra- and extra-lysosomal accumulation of undegraded storage material. The lysosomes play a key role in degradation and cellular recycling of macromolecules. Besides disturbance of cellular function, substrate accumulation may result in secondary toxic and/or inflammatory processes. For treatment of Fabry and Gaucher disease, several therapeutic approaches are approved including enzyme replacement therapy, chaperon therapy for Fabry disease and substrate reduction therapy for Gaucher disease."

    "abstract": "The maxilla is a facial bone with a dense blood supply. Although rare, infections, trauma, and certain metabolic disorders can lead to necrosis of the maxillary bone. The maxilla, a vital bone forming the roof of the oral cavity, is particularly susceptible to mucormycosis, a prevalent fungal infection, especially in individuals with diabetes and compromised immune systems. Here, we discuss mucormycosis-associated maxillary necrosis in a patient with uncontrolled diabetes. Early identification and treatment of this lethal fungal infection can significantly reduce its mortality and morbidity rates. Due to the maxilla's high vascularity, necrosis is uncommon. However, various infections, including bacterial, viral, and fungal, can lead to maxillary necrosis. Other potential causes include trauma, radiation, prolonged corticosteroid use, and lipid metabolism disorders (like Gaucher disease). Early diagnosis and timely treatment are crucial to significantly reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with this life-threatening fungal infection."

    "abstract": "Anemia and hyperferritinemia are frequent findings at diagnosis of Gaucher disease (GD). Macrophage-independent dyserythropoiesis and abnormal iron metabolism have been shown. We evaluated hematological and iron status at diagnosis (T0) and the effect of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on erythropoiesis and iron utilization over 5-year follow-up in type 1 GD patients and in an ex vivo model of erythropoiesis from CD34 + peripheral blood cells. At T0, 41% of patients had anemia and 51% hyperferritinemia. Hemoglobin increased from 12.6 (T0) to 13.9 g/dL (T6), GFD15, a marker of ineffective erythropoiesis, decreased from 5401 to 710 pg/ml, and serum ferritin decreased from 614 to 140 mcg/L (p < 0.001). In parallel, transferrin saturation (TSAT) increased. Hepcidin, although in the normal range, decreased from T0 to T6. Ex vivo studies showed that ERT restores the erythroid cells derived from CD34 + impaired ability to differentiate. During ERT, an increase in TFRC expression, consistent with the ability of erythroid precursors to uptake iron, and a reduction in HAMP and concomitant increase in SLC40A1 were observed. This is the largest study with a longitudinal follow-up evaluating erythropoiesis and iron metabolism, combining clinical and ex vivo data in GD. Iron dysregulation likely contributes to anemia, and ERT, by improving iron distribution, improves erythropoiesis."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy is currently in development for several monogenetic diseases including lysosomal storage disorders. Limited evidence is available on patient preferences for gene therapy in this population. In this study, we compare gene therapy-related risk tolerance between people affected by three lysosomal storage diseases currently faced with different therapeutic options and prognoses. A survey including the probabilistic threshold technique was developed in which respondents were asked to choose between gene therapy and the current standard of care. The attributes included to establish participants' risk tolerance were previously identified in focus groups of affected people or their representatives, namely: risk of mild side effects, severe side effects, the need for additional medication, and the likelihood of long-term effectiveness. The survey was distributed among people receiving outpatient care for type 1 Gaucher disease (good prognosis with current treatment options), Fabry disease (varying prognosis with current treatment options, XY-genotype on average more severely affected than XX), and parents representing people with severe forms of mucopolysaccharidosis type III A/B (poor prognosis, no disease-specific therapy available). A total of 85 surveys were completed (15 Gaucher disease respondents, 62 Fabry disease respondents (17 self-identifying male), eight parents of ten people with mucopolysaccharidosis type III). Disease groups with higher disease severity trended towards higher risk tolerance: Gaucher disease respondents were most cautious and predominantly preferred the current standard of care as opposed to MPS III representatives who were more risk tolerant. Respondents with Fabry disease were most heterogeneous in their risk tolerance, with male participants being more risk tolerant than female participants. Long-term effectiveness was the attribute in which respondents tolerated the least risk. People affected by a lysosomal storage disease associated with a poorer prognosis and less effective current treatment options trended towards more risk tolerance when choosing between gene therapy and the current standard of care. This study shows the importance of involvement of patient preferences before and during the development process of new treatment modalities such as gene therapy for rare diseases, to ensure that innovative therapies align with the wishes and needs of people affected by these diseases."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is one of the most common types of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) caused by pathogenic variants of lysosomal β-glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1), resulting in the impairment of Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme function and the accumulation of a glycolipid substrate, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) within lysosomes. Current therapeutic approaches such as enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy cannot fully rescue GD pathologies, especially neurological symptoms. Meanwhile, delivery of lysosomal enzymes to the endocytic compartment of affected human cells is a promising strategy for treating neuropathic LSDs. Here, we describe a novel approach to restore GCase enzyme in cells from neuropathic GD patients by producing extracellular vesicle (EVs)-containing GCase from cells overexpressing GBA1 gene. Lentiviral vectors containing modified GBA1 were introduced into HEK293T cells to produce a stable cell line that provides a sustainable source of functional GCase enzyme. The GBA1-overexpressing cells released EV-containing GCase enzyme, that is capable of entering into and localizing in the endocytic compartment of recipient cells, including THP-1 macrophage, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, and macrophages and neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of neuropathic GD patients. Importantly, the recipient cells exhibit higher GCase enzyme activity. This study presents a promising therapeutic strategy to treat severe types of LSDs. It involves delivering lysosomal enzymes to the endocytic compartment of human cells affected by conditions such as GDs with neurological symptoms, as well as potentially other neurological disorders impacting lysosomes."

    "abstract": "Crystal-storing histiocytosis is a rare entity due to tumorous deposits of histiocytes containing crystalline inclusions, which in a majority of cases are made of immunoglobulins associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, although association with non-neoplastic disorders has also been reported. The histiocytes may be so abundant to obscure the underlying lymphoplasmacytic neoplasm. On the other hand, the Gaucher-like histiocytes might lead to a misinterpretation of granulomatous inflammation or storage disease. Herein, this case study reported clinical, pathological and next generation sequencing (NGS) features of a case of kappa chain myeloma with Gaucher-like crystal-storing histiocytosis in the bone marrow (BM). The methodology included BM aspiration and biopsy, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and NGS study by TruSight Oncology 500. Morphologically, the BM smear showed dense infiltration of sea blue histiocytes and atypical plasma cells with rhomboid crystals in cytoplasm. The BM biopsy showed excessive plasmacytic aggregates and dense histiocytic infiltrates with wrinkled paper-like or needle shaped cytoplasm. These plasma cells were positive for CD138 and showed lambda chain restriction. Electron microscopy highlighted the long rhomboid crystals with distinct periodicity consistent with crystalline immunoglobulins in the histiocytes. In addition, the NGS study from the BM aspiration specimen revealed PARP1, MSH6, KDR, CCND3 and STK11 mutations, which might be associated with inferior survival of myeloma patients. Accordingly, this case died of pneumonia with septic shock during treatment. Our findings suggest that the presence of rhomboid crystals in bone marrow smears may alert pathologists to look for the possibility of crystal-storing histiocytosis and the prognosis of patients with multiple myeloma may depend on the genetic features of tumor cells rather than the association with crystal-storing histiocytosis."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. The most common subtype in Europe and the USA, type 1 (GD1), is characterized by fatigue, cytopenia, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, bone disease, and rarely pulmonary disease. Increased life expectancy brought about by improved treatments has led to new challenges for adolescents and their transition to adult care. Efficient healthcare transition to adult care is essential to manage the long-term age-related complications of the disease. This international study consisted of two online surveys: one survey for patients with GD1 and one survey for healthcare professionals (HCPs) involved in treatment of patients with GD1. The aims of this international, multi-center project were to evaluate the current transition process in various countries and to understand the challenges that both HCPs and patients experience. A total of 45 patients and 26 HCPs took part in the survey, representing 26 countries. Our data showed that a third (11/33) of patients were aware of transition clinics and most stated that the clinic involved patients with metabolic diseases or with GD. Seven patients attended a transition clinic, where most patients (5/7) received an explanation of the transition process. Approximately half of HCPs (46%; 12/26) had a transition clinic coordinator in their healthcare center, and 10 of HCPs had a transition clinic for patients with metabolic diseases in their healthcare center. HCPs reported that transition clinics were comprised of multi-disciplinary teams, with most patients over the age of 18 years old managed by hematology specialists. The main challenges of the transition process reported by HCPs included limited funding, lack of expertise and difficulty coordinating care amongst different specialties. Our study demonstrates the lack of a standardized process, the need to raise awareness of transition clinics amongst patients and the differences between the transition process in different countries. Both patients and HCPs expressed the need for a specialist individual responsible for transition, efficient coordination between pediatricians and adult specialists and for patient visits to the adult center prior to final transition of care."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease, the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease, is caused by homozygous mutations at the GBA gene, which is responsible for encoding the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Neuronopathic Gaucher disease is associated with microgliosis, astrogliosis, and neurodegeneration. However, the role that microglia, astrocytes, and neurons play in the disease remains to be determined. In the current study, we developed inducible, cell-type-specific Gba-KO mice to better understand the individual impacts of Gba deficiencies on microglia and neurons. Gba was conditionally knocked out either exclusively in microglia or neurons or throughout the body. These mouse models were developed using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre system, with tamoxifen administration commencing at weaning. Microglia-specific Gba-KO mice showed no signs of disease. However, the neuron-specific Gba KO resulted in a shortened lifespan, severe weight loss, and ataxia. These mice also had significant neurodegeneration, microgliosis, and astrogliosis accompanied by the accumulation of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine, recapitulating Gaucher disease-like symptoms. These surprising findings reveal that, unlike the neuron-specific Gba deficiency, microglia-specific Gba deficiency alone does not induce disease. The neuronal Gaucher disease mouse model, with a median survival of 16 weeks, may be useful for future studies of pathogenesis and the evaluation of therapies."

Three principal forms are recognized in humans, two being neuronopathic and resulting in neurodegeneration. Only two spontaneously arising cases have been described in domestic animals, one in a dog and the other in a flock of Southdown sheep. Since microglial activation is increasingly being recognized as having an important role in the pathogenesis of Gaucher disease and archival brains were available from lambs with type II glucocerebrosidosis, we wanted to determine whether microglia were activated in these brains. Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1), a specific and the most widely expressed immunohistochemical marker of microglial activation, was used. Striking and widely distributed activation of microglia was demonstrated, suggesting that microglia actively participate in the development of neuropathological changes in ovine Gaucher disease. This aspect of Gaucher disease requires further study in any future cases detected in domestic animal species, including the mechanism by which this markedly increased Iba1 expression is related to disease progression."

Clinically, PD with GBA1 mutations (GBA1-PD) is characterized by particular features regarding the progression of symptom severity. On the therapeutic side, the discovery of the relationship between GBA1 variants and PD offers an opportunity for targeted therapeutic interventions.

The pregnancy was terminated due to major fetal anomaly, and whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis of fetal tissue and parental blood unveiled a pathogenic variant in exon 10 of the GBA gene (NM_001005741.3: c.1265T > G: p.L422R) originating from the mother. Additionally, a novel CNV (chr1: 155204785-155205635 deletion, 0.85 kb) spanning exon 10-12 in the GBA gene was identified from the father.

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a growing health problem affecting nearly 1 billion people worldwide. The landmark feature of OSA is chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), accounting for multiple organ damage, including heart disease. CIH profoundly alters both visceral white adipose tissue (WAT) and heart structure and function, but little is known regarding inter-organ interaction in the context of CIH. We recently showed that visceral WAT senescence drives myocardial alterations in aged mice without CIH. Here, we aimed at investigating whether CIH induces a premature visceral WAT senescent phenotype, triggering subsequent cardiac remodeling. In a first experiment, 10-week-old C57bl6J male mice (n = 10/group) were exposed to 14 days of CIH (8 h daily, 5%-21% cyclic inspired oxygen fraction, 60 s per cycle). In a second series, mice were submitted to either epididymal WAT surgical lipectomy or sham surgery before CIH exposure. Finally, we used p53 deficient mice or Wild-type (WT) littermates, also exposed to the same CIH protocol. Epididymal WAT was assessed for fibrosis, DNA damages, oxidative stress, markers of senescence (p16, p21, and p53), and inflammation by RT-qPCR and histology, and myocardium was assessed for fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. CIH-induced epididymal WAT remodeling characterized by increased fibrosis, oxidative stress, DNA damage response, inflammation, and increased expression of senescent markers. CIH-induced epididymal WAT remodeling was associated with subtle and early myocardial interstitial fibrosis. Both epididymal WAT surgical lipectomy and p53 deletion prevented CIH-induced myocardial fibrosis. Short-term exposure to CIH induces epididymal WAT senescent remodeling and cardiac interstitial fibrosis, the latter being prevented by lipectomy. This finding strongly suggests visceral WAT senescence as a new target to mitigate OSA-related cardiac disorders."

Early and accurate diagnosis is important to enable effective treatment decisions, prevent unnecessary testing, and facilitate genetic counseling. This study aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model for GD screening and GD early diagnosis based on real-world clinical data using the Maccabi Healthcare Services electronic database, which contains 20 years of longitudinal data on approximately 2.6 million patients. We screened the Maccabi Healthcare Services database for patients with GD between January 1998 and May 2022. Eligible controls were matched by year of birth, sex, and socioeconomic status in a 1:13 ratio. The data were partitioned into 75% training and 25% test sets and trained to predict GD using features obtained from medical and laboratory records. Model performances were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the precision-recall curve. We detected 264 confirmed patients with GD to which we matched 3,429 controls. The best model performance (which included known GD signs and symptoms, previously unknown clinical features, and administrative codes) on the test set had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.95 ± 0.03 and area under the precision-recall curve = 0.80 ± 0.08, which yielded a median GD identification of 2.78 years earlier than the clinical diagnosis (25th-75th percentile: 1.29-4.53). Using an ML approach on real-world data led to excellent discrimination between GD patients and controls, with the ability to detect GD significantly earlier than the time of actual diagnosis. Hence, this approach might be useful as a screening tool for GD and lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, advanced ML analytics may highlight previously unrecognized features associated with GD, including clinical diagnoses and health-seeking behaviors."

In previous studies, we established Gba1 F213I point mutation mice and found that homozygous Gba1 F213I mutant mice died shortly after birth, while heterozygous mice could survive normally. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic changes in the brain tissue of Gba1 F213I heterozygous mice, identifying 138 differentially expressed genes. Among them, Nfe2l1 was the most significantly downregulated gene. Inhibition or knockdown of GBA1 in BE(2)-M17 cells resulted in decreased expression levels of NFE2L1. Knockdown of GBA1 or NFE2L1 could lead to an elevation in intracellular aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, while upregulation of NFE2L1 effectively mitigated those cellular manifestations induced by GBA1 knockdown. In summary, our in vitro results showed that upregulation of NFE2L1 may provide a therapeutic benefit for cellular phenotypes resulting from GBA1 knockdown, providing new insights for future research on GD and GBA1-associated PD."

Exploring differential gene expression between apple genotypes carrying contrasting combinations of these QTLs could depict original candidate genes and pathways implicated. We therefore carried out RNA sequencing just before and five days after inoculation of the pathogenic fungi <i>Venturia inaequalis</i>, in sixteen genotypes from a pseudo-F1 progeny segregating for resistant or susceptible alleles of the three QTLs. The current dataset includes i) transcriptomic profile description, ii) analysis of differentially expressed genes related to none or combined QTLs, infected or not with <i>Venturia inaequalis</i> and iii) disease phenotyping of the same genetic materials. The raw data files have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository with the accession number GSE250309. These outputs represent the first step towards elucidating the genetic basis of quantitative apple scab resistance. In the long term, this data set will improve apple breeding strategies on how to combine qualitative (used so far) and quantitative resistances to apple scab, with the aim of diversifying selective pressures on the pathogen."

GD is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by glucocerebrosidase deficiency with multi-organ involvement. Besides common clinical features such as hepatosplenomegaly and skeletal involvement, less frequent neurological symptoms, such as oculomotor apraxia, are indicative of neuronopathic forms of the disease, namely GD type 3, to be confirmed both by enzyme activity and genetic testing. Overall, GD management requires a multidisciplinary approach involving metabolic pediatricians, neurologists, psychologists, and geneticists, and currently relies on early enzyme replacement therapy. Although enzyme replacement therapy has proved to be effective in improving systemic signs and symptoms, it is unable to alleviate neurological complications once these have occurred, as it does not pass across the blood-brain barrier. Neurological improvements may occur through indirect mechanisms. Thus, our case report aims to highlight the importance of considering GD in the differential diagnosis of pediatric patients presenting with splenomegaly associated with neurological manifestations, as early intervention may significantly modify the disease progression and prevent further irreversible complications."

We documented the clinical history of 31 untreated patients with GD1 followed in our clinic for 4-26 (median 15) years. This was a retrospective, observational study of the progress of untreated adult patients with GD1 followed by blood tests (haemoglobin, platelet counts, ferritin and chitotriosidase), organ volumes (spleen and liver), bone manifestations (through magnetic resonance imaging and dual X-ray absorptiometry scans) and neurological and quality of life issues. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of the Student paired t test and the modified Wald test for 95% confidence intervals. We found that the above parameters remained stable in most patients over a period of 4-26 (median 15) years. Five patients progressed from normal bone density to osteopenia and two from osteopenia to osteofibrosis; six were peri- or post-menopausal females. The DS-3 was stable over time. Only four of the 31 patients were started on enzyme or substrate reduction therapy. Our results demonstrate that many patients with GD1, provided with close follow-up by a specialist centre, can be followed for many years without requiring treatment and with no or minimal worsening of their GD1 manifestations."

    "abstract": "Enzymatic deficiency in Gaucher disease (GD) may induce oxidative stress. Vitamin E is the nature's most effective lipid-soluble antioxidant. This prospective clinical trial assessed the oxidant-antioxidant status in Egyptian patients with GD and the efficacy and safety and of vitamin E as an adjuvant antioxidant therapy. Forty children and adolescents with GD on stable doses of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) were enrolled. Abdominal ultrasonography and transient elastography were performed. Malondialdehyde (MDA), vitamin E, and antioxidant enzymes (reduced glutathione [GSH], superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione peroxidase [GPx], and peroxiredoxin 2 [PRDX2]) were assessed. Patients were compared with 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Patients with GD were randomized either to receive oral vitamin E for 6 months or not. All patients with GD had significantly higher MDA levels with lower levels of vitamin E and antioxidant enzymes compared with healthy controls (p < 0.001). Vitamin E and PRDX2 were negatively correlated to severity score index (SSI), lyso GL1, and MDA. After 6 months of vitamin E supplementation, SSI and liver and spleen volumes and liver stiffness were significantly lower. Lyso GL1 and MDA were significantly decreased post-vitamin E therapy while antioxidant enzymes were significantly higher compared with baseline levels and with patients without vitamin E therapy. Oxidative stress is related to disease severity in pediatric patients with GD. A 6-month vitamin E supplementation for those patients represents a safe therapeutic adjuvant agent increasing the efficacy of ERT, reducing oxidative stress, and improving outcomes."

To analyze the application of gSRT to the treatment of LSDs, identifying the silencing tools and delivery systems used, and the main challenges for its development and clinical translation, highlighting the contribution of nanotechnology to overcome them. A systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines was performed. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used for searching terms related to LSDs and gene-silencing strategies and tools. Fabry, Gaucher, and Pompe diseases and mucopolysaccharidoses I and III are the only LSDs for which gSRT has been studied, siRNA and lipid nanoparticles being the silencing strategy and the delivery system most frequently employed, respectively. Only in one recently published study was CRISPR/Cas9 applied to treat Fabry disease. Specific tissue targeting, availability of relevant cell and animal LSD models, and the rare disease condition are the main challenges with gSRT for the treatment of these diseases. Out of the 11 studies identified, only two gSRT studies were evaluated in animal models. Nucleic acid therapies are expanding the clinical tools and therapies currently available for LSDs. Recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9 technology and the growing impact of nanotechnology are expected to boost the clinical translation of gSRT in the near future, and not only for LSDs."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal degradation pathways coordinate the clearance of superfluous and damaged cellular components. Compromised lysosomal degradation is a hallmark of many degenerative diseases, including lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), which are caused by loss-of-function mutations within both alleles of a lysosomal hydrolase, leading to lysosomal substrate accumulation. Gaucher's disease, characterized by <15% of normal glucocerebrosidase function, is the most common LSD and is a prominent risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease. Here, we show that either of two structurally distinct small molecules that modulate PIKfyve activity, identified in a high-throughput cellular lipid droplet clearance screen, can improve glucocerebrosidase function in Gaucher patient-derived fibroblasts through an MiT/TFE transcription factor that promotes lysosomal gene translation. An integrated stress response (ISR) antagonist used in combination with a PIKfyve modulator further improves cellular glucocerebrosidase activity, likely because ISR signaling appears to also be slightly activated by treatment by either small molecule at the higher doses employed. This strategy of combining a PIKfyve modulator with an ISR inhibitor improves mutant lysosomal hydrolase function in cellular models of additional LSD."

In the current study, we use a designed, thermostable form of glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the enzyme defective in Gaucher disease (GD), to attempt to alleviate neurological symptoms in a GD mouse that models type 3 disease, i.e. the chronic neuronopathic juvenile subtype. Upon injection of an AAVrh10 (adeno-associated virus, serotype rh10) vector containing the designed GCase (dGCase) into the left lateral ventricle of Gba<sup>-/-</sup>;Gba<sup>tg</sup> mice, a significant improvement in body weight and life-span was observed, compared to injection of the same mouse with the wild type enzyme (wtGCase). Moreover, a reduction in levels of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), and an increase in levels of GCase activity were seen in the right hemisphere of Gba<sup>-/-</sup>;Gba<sup>tg</sup> mice, concomitantly with a significant improvement in motor function, reduction of neuroinflammation and a reduction in mRNA levels of various genes shown previously to be elevated in the brain of mouse models of neurological forms of GD. Together, these data pave the way for the possible use of modified proteins in gene therapy for lysosomal storage diseases and other monogenetic disorders."

    "title": "Burden of rare genetic disorders in India: twenty-two years' experience of a tertiary centre.",
    "abstract": "Rare disorders comprise of ~ 7500 different conditions affecting multiple systems. Diagnosis of rare diseases is complex due to dearth of specialized medical professionals, testing labs and limited therapeutic options. There is scarcity of data on the prevalence of rare diseases in different populations. India being home to a large population comprising of 4600 population groups, of which several thousand are endogamous, is likely to have a high burden of rare diseases. The present study provides a retrospective overview of a cohort of patients with rare genetic diseases identified at a tertiary genetic test centre in India. Overall, 3294 patients with 305 rare diseases were identified in the present study cohort. These were categorized into 14 disease groups based on the major organ/ organ system affected. Highest number of rare diseases (D = 149/305, 48.9%) were identified in the neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental (NMND) group followed by inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) (D = 47/305; 15.4%). Majority patients in the present cohort (N = 1992, 61%) were diagnosed under IEM group, of which Gaucher disease constituted maximum cases (N = 224, 11.2%). Under the NMND group, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (N = 291/885, 32.9%), trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders (N = 242/885; 27.3%) and spinal muscular atrophy (N = 141/885, 15.9%) were the most common. Majority cases of β-thalassemia (N = 120/149, 80.5%) and cystic fibrosis (N = 74/75, 98.7%) under the haematological and pulmonary groups were observed, respectively. Founder variants were identified for Tay-Sachs disease and mucopolysaccharidosis IVA diseases. Recurrent variants for Gaucher disease (GBA:c.1448T > C), β-thalassemia (HBB:c.92.+5G > C), non-syndromic hearing loss (GJB2:c.71G > A), albinism (TYR:c.832 C > T), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CYP21A2:c.29-13 C > G) and progressive pseudo rheumatoid dysplasia (CCN6:c.298T > A) were observed in the present study. The present retrospective study of rare disease patients diagnosed at a tertiary genetic test centre provides first insight into the distribution of rare genetic diseases across the country. This information will likely aid in drafting future health policies, including newborn screening programs, development of target specific panel for affordable diagnosis of rare diseases and eventually build a platform for devising novel treatment strategies for rare diseases."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD), an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, results from GBA1 variants causing glucocerebrosidase (GCase) deficiency. While enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) helps with systemic symptoms, neurological complications in GD2 and GD3 persist due to the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) limiting ERT efficacy. Ambroxol, a BBB-permeable chaperone, enhances GCase activity. Our review explores high-dose ambroxol's therapeutic potential, both preclinical and clinical, in GD2 and GD3. PubMed was searched for studies published before March 2023, including clinical, animal, and in vitro studies focusing on the effect of high-dose ambroxol in GD2 and GD3. A narrative synthesis was performed. Nine in vitro, three animal, and eight clinical studies were included, demonstrating varied responses to ambroxol across diverse outcome measures. In vitro and animal studies demonstrated reduced endoplasmatic reticulum stress due to the relocation of GCase from the ER to the lysosomes. In vitro cell lines exhibited varying degrees of increased GCase activity. Clinical trials observed reduced lyso-GL1 levels in plasma (41-89%) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (26-97%), alongside increased GCase activity in GD3 patients. Ambroxol exhibited varying effects on neurological outcomes and development. No severe adverse events were reported. High-dose ambroxol shows promise in managing neurological manifestations in GD3, albeit with uncertainties resulting from genetic heterogeneity and variable response. Further clinical trials, are essential for elucidating dosage-response relationships and refining treatment outcomes and strategies for neuronopathic GD."

    "abstract": "An exciting development in the field of neurodegeneration is the association between the rare monogenic disorder Gaucher disease and the common complex disorder Parkinson disease (PD). Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from an inherited deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, encoded by GBA1, which hydrolyses the glycosphingolipids glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine. The observation of parkinsonism in a rare subgroup of individuals with Gaucher disease first directed attention to the role of glucocerebrosidase deficiency in the pathogenesis of PD. PD occurs more frequently in people heterozygous for Gaucher GBA1 mutations, and 3-25% of people with Parkinson disease carry a GBA1 variant. However, only a small percentage of individuals with GBA1 variants develop parkinsonism, suggesting that the penetrance is low. Despite over a decade of intense research in this field, including clinical and radiological evaluations, genetic studies and investigations using model systems, the mechanism underlying GBA1-PD is still being pursued. Insights from this association have emphasized the role of lysosomal pathways in parkinsonism. Furthermore, different therapeutic strategies considered or developed for Gaucher disease can now inform drug development for PD."

Progranulin (PGRN, encoded by GRN/Grn) is a modifier of GCase, but the interplay between PGRN and GCase, specifically GBA1/Gba1 mutations, contributing to GD severity is unclear. Mouse models were developed with various dosages of Gba1 D409V mutation against the PGRN deficiency (Grn-/-) [Grn-/-;Gba1D409V/WT (PG9Vwt), Grn-/-;Gba1D409V/D409V (PG9V), Grn-/-;Gba1D409V/Null (PG9VN)]. Disease progression in those mouse models was characterized by biochemical, pathological, transcriptomic, and neurobehavioral analyses. Compared to PG9Vwt, Grn-/-;Gba1WT/Null and Grn-/- mice that had a higher level of GCase activity and undetectable pathologies, homozygous or hemizygous D409V in PG9V or PG9VN, respectively, resulted in profound inflammation and neurodegeneration. PG9VN mice exhibited much earlier onset, shorter life span, tissue fibrosis, and more severe phenotypes than PG9V mice. Glycosphingolipid accumulation, inflammatory responses, lysosomal-autophagy dysfunction, microgliosis, retinal gliosis, as well as α-Synuclein increases were much more pronounced in PG9VN mice. Neurodegeneration in PG9VN was characterized by activated microglial phagocytosis of impaired neurons and programmed cell death due to necrosis and, possibly, pyroptosis. Brain transcriptomic analyses revealed the intrinsic relationship between D409V dosage, and the degree of altered gene expression related to lysosome dysfunction, microgliosis, and neurodegeneration in GD, suggesting the disease severity is dependent on a GCase activity threshold related to Gba1 D409V dosage and loss of PGRN. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of GD pathogenesis by elucidating additional underlying mechanisms of interplay between PGRN and Gba1 mutation dosage in modulating GCase function and disease severity in GD and GBA1-associated neurodegenerative diseases."

Nevertheless, no specific PREMs in GD have been published, neither PROMs for Spanish GD patients have been developed. Two project coordinators selected key-points to be included in a PROMs/PREMs questionnaire, and the scientific committee and a group of expert patients contributed to the initial draft. Then, 9 meetings with experts were held to discuss controversial points. After, a questionnaire with 103 items regarding symptomatology, aspects of daily life and care experience was developed. Finally, it was conducted a Delphi survey among a multidisciplinary group of experts in GD. Consensus was reached on 85 out of the 103 items. Recommendations on PROMs and PREMs regarding symptomatology, aspects of daily life and care experience were obtained. Consensus was reached on the importance of considering fatigue, concentration problems, and communication issues in GD patients using 5-step analog scales. Panelists recommended asking GD patients about the impact on social functioning and work/school performance. Finally, consensus was reached on considering care experiences, such as treatment satisfaction, treatment interruptions or transitions and healthcare professionals involved in patient's management to perceive patient's perceptions. This expert consensus may help developing GD-specific PROMs/PREMs for improving GD management. Properly developed and validated PROMs/PREMs may help decision-making, establishing patient-tailored therapeutic and follow-up goals."

    "abstract": "Neuropathic lysosomal storage diseases (NLSDs), including ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 3 (CLN3) disease and Gaucher disease type 2 (GD2), are typically present in adolescents; however, there are no approved therapies. CLN3 disease is the most common of the 13 types of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and Gaucher disease is the most common type of lysosomal storage disease. These NLSDs share oxidative stress and lysosomal dysfunction with Parkinson's disease. In this study, we used patient-derived cells (PDCs) and resorcinol to develop a therapeutic agent based on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) activation. PPARγ is a major regulator of autophagy and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Resorcinol, a polyphenolic compound, has been reported to exhibit PPARγ agonistic potential. Protein levels were analyzed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Changes in cellular metabolism, including ROS levels, lipid droplet content, and lysosomal activity, were measured by flow cytometry. Resorcinol reduced ROS levels by suppressing hypoxia-inducible factor 1α levels in CLN3-PDCs. Resorcinol upregulated autophagy and reduced lipid accumulation in CLN3-PDCs; however, these effects were abolished by autophagy inhibitors. Resorcinol increased nuclear PPARγ levels in CLN3-PDCs, and PPARγ antagonists abolished the therapeutic effects of resorcinol. Moreover, Resorcinol upregulated nuclear PPARγ levels and lysosomal activity in GD2-PDCs, and reduced lipid accumulation and ROS levels. In summary, resorcinol alleviated the shared pathogenesis of CLN3 disease and GD2 through PPARγ upregulation. These findings suggest that resorcinol is a potential therapeutic candidate for alleviating NLSD progression."

This has led to speculations of some protective effect for carriers of this variant. During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, GD patients reportedly had a surprisingly low infection rate and mild symptoms considering their disease status. As SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into the cell via membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), we speculated that differences in levels of soluble ACE2 in GD patients could contribute to this protective state. While ACE is known to be elevated in GD, to our knowledge, ACE2 levels have not been explored. We measured serum and macrophage-bound levels of ACE and ACE2 by ELISA and western blot, respectively, in GD patients and age- and sex-matched controls. Our results reveal a significant elevation of both serum and macrophage-bound ACE and ACE2 in GD patients compared to healthy controls. This elevation appears to be mitigated by GD treatment. Moreover, the most robust ACE2 elevation was observed in N370S homozygotes, and was not effected by treatment. Since coronaviruses use the ACE2 receptor as a gateway for host cell entry, we speculate that elevated circulating ACE2 may serve as a decoy. This might explain the observed mild infections in GD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic."

    "abstract": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by various combinations of autonomic failure, parkinsonism, and cerebellar ataxia. To elucidate variants associated with MSA, we have been conducting short-read-based whole-genome sequence analysis. In the process of the association studies, we initially focused on GBA1, a previously proposed susceptibility gene for MSA, to evaluate whether GBA1 variants can be efficiently identified despite its extraordinarily high homology with its pseudogene, GBA1LP. To accomplish this, we conducted a short-read whole-genome sequence analysis with alignment to GRCh38 as well as Sanger sequence analysis and compared the results. We identified five variants with inconsistencies between the two pipelines, of which three variants (p.L483P, p.A495P-p.V499V, p.L483_M489delinsW) were the results of misalignment due to minor alleles in GBA1P1 registered in GRCh38. The miscalling events in these variants were resolved by alignment to GRCh37 as the reference genome, where the major alleles are registered. In addition, a structural variant was not properly identified either by short-read or by Sanger sequence analyses. Having accomplished correct variant calling, we identified three variants pathogenic for Gaucher disease (p.S310G, p.L483P, and p.L483_M489delinsW). Of these variants, the allele frequency of p.L483P (0.003) in the MSA cases was higher than that (0.0011) in controls. The meta-analysis incorporating a previous report demonstrated a significant association of p.L483P with MSA with an odds ratio of 2.85 (95% CI; 1.05 - 7.76, p = 0.0400)."

The most severe complication in RDEB patients is the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), leading to premature death. There is a great deal of evidence suggesting a permissive tumor microenvironment (TME) as a driver of SCC development in RDEB patients. In a cohort of RDEB patients, we characterized the immune profiles of RDEB-SCCs and compared them with clinical, histopathological, and prognostic features. RDEB-SCCs were subdivided into four groups based on their occurrence (first onset or recurrences) and grading according to clinical, histopathological parameters of aggressiveness. Thirty-eight SCCs from 20 RDEB patients were analyzed. Five RDEB patients experienced an unfavorable course after the diagnosis of the first SCC, with early recurrence or metastasis, whereas 15 patients developed multiple SCCs without metastasis. High-risk primary RDEB-SCCs showed a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in the tumor microenvironment and an increased proportion of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Additionally, citrullinated histone H3, a marker of NETs, was increased in the serum of RDEB patients with high-risk primary SCC, suggesting that this modified form of histone H3 may serve as a potential blood marker of unfavorable prognosis in RDEB-SCCs."

The pathogenesis of <i>GBA1</i>-PD is closely associated with mutations in the <i>GBA1</i> gene, which encodes the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). In this review, we discuss two mechanisms by which <i>GBA1</i> mutations contribute to disease development: 'haploinsufficiency,' where a single functional gene copy fails to produce a sufficient amount of GCase, and 'gain of function,' where the mutated GCase acquires harmful properties that directly impact cellular mechanisms for alpha-synuclein degradation, leading to alpha-synuclein aggregation and neuronal cell damage. Continued research is advancing our understanding of how these mechanisms contribute to the development and progression of <i>GBA1</i>-PD, with the 'gain of function' mechanism appearing to be the most plausible. This review also explores the implications of <i>GBA1</i> mutations for therapeutic strategies, highlighting the need for early diagnosis and targeted interventions. Currently, small molecular chaperones have shown the most promising clinical results compared to other agents. This synthesis of clinical, pathological, and molecular aspects underscores the assertion that <i>GBA1</i>-PD is a distinct clinical and pathobiological PD phenotype, necessitating specific management and research approaches to better understand and treat this debilitating condition."

    "abstract": "Trihydroxypiperidines are a therapeutically valuable class of iminosugar. We applied a one-pot amination-cyclisation cascade reaction to synthesise 3,4,5-trihydroxypiperidine stereoisomers in three steps from commercially available pentoses and in excellent overall yields. Using our methodology, the yields of the syntheses of meso-1, meso-2 and 3L are the highest reported to date. The synthetic methodology was readily extended to the three-step synthesis of N-alkyl derivatives by replacing the ammonia nitrogen source with a primary amine. The trihydroxypiperidines and N-alkyl analogues were screened for enzyme inhibitory activity using Fabrazyme (Fabry disease), GCase (Gaucher's disease), Agrobacterium sp. β-glucosidase, and Escherichia coli β-galactosidase. N-Phenylethyl 3,4,5-trihydroxypiperidine (N-phenylethyl-1-(3R,4R,5S)-piperidine-3,4,5-triol) showed good inhibitory activity of Fabrazyme (K<sub>i</sub> = 46 μM). This activity was abolished when the N-phenylethyl group was removed or replaced with a non-aromatic alkyl chain."

    "abstract": "People with rare lysosomal storage diseases face challenges in their care that arise from disease complexity and heterogeneity, compounded by many healthcare professionals being unfamiliar with these diseases. These challenges can result in long diagnostic journeys and inadequate care. Over 30 years ago, the Rare Disease Registries for Gaucher, Fabry, Mucopolysaccharidosis type I and Pompe diseases were established to address knowledge gaps in disease natural history, clinical manifestations of disease and treatment outcomes. Evidence generated from the real-world data collected in these registries supports multiple stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, drug developers, researchers and regulators. To maximise the impact of real-world evidence from these registries, engagement and collaboration with the patient communities is essential. To this end, the Rare Disease Registries Patient Council was established in 2019 as a partnership between the Rare Disease Registries and global and local patient advocacy groups to share perspectives on how registry data are used and disseminated. The Patient Council has resulted in a number of patient initiatives including patient representation at Rare Disease Registries advisory boards; development of plain language summaries of registry publications to increase availability of real-world evidence to patient communities; and implementation of digital innovations such as electronic patient-reported outcomes, and patient-facing registry reports and electronic consent (in development), all to enhance patient engagement. The Patient Council is building on the foundations of industry-patient advocacy group collaboration to fully integrate patient communities in decision-making and co-create solutions for the rare disease community."

    "abstract": "Hearing loss is frequently associated with Gaucher disease (GD). Gaucher cells are enlarged reticuloendothelial cells containing glucocerebroside in the lysosomes due to deficiency of the glucocerebrosidase. Gaucheromas consist of accumulated Gaucher cells. Gaucher cells accumulate in variable tissues including the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and the middle ear and the mastoid causing conductive hearing loss. Neurons and astrocytes in the central nervous system are affected in neuronopathic GD leading to sensorineural hearing loss. Gaucheromas can develop even in patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). We report a 19-year-old female patient with GD type 3 who developed profound bilateral hearing loss associated with intracranial Gaucheroma. Combination therapy of ERT with imiglucerase and substrate reduction therapy (SRT) with eliglustat significantly decreased the size of Gaucher cells and cleared the characteristic microtubular structures in the lysosomes in Gaucher cells. Early implementation of SRT may prevent at least conductive hearing impairment in GD although it may not prevent sensorineural hearing loss due to inner hair cell dysfunction which is also known to be associated with neuronopathic GD."

Initiated in 2010, the Gaucher Outcome Survey (GOS) is an ongoing, international, multicenter, observational registry (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03291223) for patients with a diagnosis of Gaucher disease (GD), irrespective of treatment type or status, with a primary objective to monitor safety and long-term effectiveness of velaglucerase alfa. <b>Methods:</b> Here, we evaluated the GOS population 12 years after the registry initiation. <b>Results:</b> As of 25 February 2023, 2084 patients enrolled in the GOS and 1643 received GD-specific treatment. Patients exhibited broad heterogeneity at baseline: age of diagnosis (0 to 85.3 years), hemoglobin concentrations (<80.0 g/L to >150 g/L), platelet counts (<50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L to >450 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), and liver and spleen volumes. Most patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy reported improvements in clinical parameters within 1 year of treatment initiation, maintained over the course of treatment up to 12 years, whereas untreated patients had baseline values closer to standard reference thresholds and showed stability over time. <b>Conclusion:</b> The 12-year data from the GOS confirm the impact of long-term treatment with GD-specific agents and offer insights into disease progression and outcomes in a real-world setting."

    "abstract": "Pulmonologists may be involved in managing pulmonary diseases in children with complex clinical pictures without a diagnosis. Moreover, they are routinely involved in the multidisciplinary care of children with rare diseases, at baseline and during follow-up, for lung function monitoring. Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of genetic diseases characterised by a specific lysosomal enzyme deficiency. Despite varying pathogen and organ involvement, they are linked by the pathological accumulation of exceeding substrates, leading to cellular toxicity and subsequent organ damage. Less severe forms of LSDs can manifest during childhood or later in life, sometimes being underdiagnosed. Respiratory impairment may stem from different pathogenetic mechanisms, depending on substrate storage in bones, with skeletal deformity and restrictive pattern, in bronchi, with obstructive pattern, in lung interstitium, with altered alveolar gas exchange, and in muscles, with hypotonia. This narrative review aims to outline different pulmonary clinical findings and a diagnostic approach based on key elements for differential diagnosis in some treatable LSDs like Gaucher disease, Acid Sphingomyelinase deficiency, Pompe disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis. Alongside their respiratory clinical aspects, which might overlap, we will describe radiological findings, lung functional patterns and associated symptoms to guide pediatric pulmonologists in differential diagnosis. The second part of the paper will address follow-up and management specifics. Recent evidence suggests that new therapeutic strategies play a substantial role in preventing lung involvement in early-treated patients and enhancing lung function and radiological signs in others. Timely diagnosis, driven by clinical suspicion and diagnostic workup, can help in treating LSDs effectively."

    "title": "Deficiency of Glucocerebrosidase Activity beyond Gaucher Disease: PSAP and LIMP-2 Dysfunctions.",
    "abstract": "Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) is a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of glucosylceramide in the presence of its activator saposin C (SapC). SapC arises from the proteolytical cleavage of prosaposin (encoded by <i>PSAP</i> gene), which gives rise to four saposins. GCase is targeted to the lysosomes by LIMP-2, encoded by <i>SCARB2</i> gene. GCase deficiency causes Gaucher Disease (GD), which is mainly due to biallelic pathogenetic variants in the GCase-encoding gene, <i>GBA1</i>. However, impairment of GCase activity can be rarely caused by SapC or LIMP-2 deficiencies. We report a new case of LIMP-2 deficiency and a new case of SapC deficiency (missing all four saposins, PSAP deficiency), and measured common biomarkers of GD and GCase activity. Glucosylsphingosine and chitotriosidase activity in plasma were increased in GCase deficiencies caused by <i>PSAP</i> and <i>GBA1</i> mutations, whereas <i>SCARB2</i>-linked deficiency showed only Glucosylsphingosine elevation. GCase activity was reduced in fibroblasts and leukocytes: the decrease was sharper in <i>GBA1</i>- and <i>SCARB2</i>-mutant fibroblasts than <i>PSAP</i>-mutant ones; LIMP-2-deficient leukocytes displayed higher residual GCase activity than <i>GBA1</i>-mutant ones. Finally, we demonstrated that GCase mainly undergoes proteasomal degradation in LIMP-2-deficient fibroblasts and lysosomal degradation in PSAP-deficient fibroblasts. Thus, we analyzed the differential biochemical profile of GCase deficiencies due to the ultra-rare <i>PSAP</i> and <i>SCARB2</i> biallelic pathogenic variants in comparison with the profile observed in <i>GBA1</i>-linked GCase deficiency."

Survival rates in the second of two clinical trials was greater, despite recruiting more severely ill patients, probably related to higher initial and maximal doses. We aimed to evaluate the effective pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Sebelipase alfa when administered to patients with severe WD at 5 mg/kg twice weekly, an intensive regimen which was not assessed in the trials. We recruited 3 patients receiving Sebelipase alfa 5 mg/kg twice weekly. We measured LAL activity in leukocytes and plasma oxysterol concentration in two patients and LAL activity in fibroblasts in one patient. Clinical follow up was also assessed. Analyses of LAL activity and oxysterols demonstrate that there is short-lived enzyme activity post-dosing which is associated with the release of stored lipids. Clinical data demonstrate that 5 mg/kg twice weekly dosing is well tolerated and effective. 5 mg/kg twice weekly dosing with Sebelipase alfa rescues severely ill infants with WD by increasing substrate clearance. There is biologically relevant lipid accumulation in the 'trough' periods before the next dosing, even with this intensive regimen."

The disease is divided into three types based on neurocognitive involvement with GD1 having no involvement while the acute (GD2) and chronic (GD3) are neuronopathic. The non-neurological symptoms of GD3 are well treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) which has replaced hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). ERT is unable to prevent neurological progression as the enzyme cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. In this retrospective study, we report the general, neurocognitive, and biochemical outcomes of three siblings with GD3 after treatment with ERT or HSCT. Two were treated with HSCT (named HSCT1 and HSCT2) and one with ERT (ERT1). All patients were homozygous for the c.1448 T > C, (p.Leu483Pro) variant in the GBA1 gene associated with GD3. ERT1 experienced neurocognitive progression with development of seizures, oculomotor apraxia, perceptive hearing loss and mental retardation. HSCT1 had no neurological manifestations, while HSCT2 developed perceptive hearing loss and low IQ. Chitotriosidase concentrations were normal in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for HSCT1 and HSCT2, but both were markedly elevated in ERT1. We report a better neurological outcome and a normalization of chitotriosidase in the two siblings treated with HSCT compared to the ERT-treated sibling. With the advancements in HSCT over the past 25 years, we may reconsider using HSCT in GD3 to achieve a better neurological outcome and limit disease progression."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Gaucher Disease type 1 (GD1) is a recessively inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has become the standard of care for patients with GD. However, over 10% of patients experience an incomplete response or partial loss of response to ERT, necessitating the exploration of alternative approaches to enhance treatment outcomes. The present feasibility study aimed to determine the feasibility of using a second-generation artificial intelligence (AI) system that introduces variability into dosing regimens for ERT to improve the response to treatment and potentially overcome the partial loss of response to the enzyme. <b>Methods:</b> This was an open-label, prospective, single-center proof-of-concept study. Five patients with GD1 who received ERT were enrolled. The study used the Altus Care™ cellular-phone-based application, which incorporated an algorithm-based approach to offer random dosing regimens within a pre-defined range set by the physician. The app enabled personalized therapeutic regimens with variations in dosages and administration times. <b>Results:</b> The second-generation AI-based personalized regimen was associated with stable responses to ERT in patients with GD1. The SF-36 quality of life scores improved in one patient, and the sense of change in health improved in two; platelet levels increased in two patients, and hemoglobin remained stable. The system demonstrated a high engagement rate among patients and caregivers, showing compliance with the treatment regimen. <b>Conclusions:</b> This feasibility study highlights the potential of using variability-based regimens to enhance ERT effectiveness in GD and calls for further and longer trials to validate these findings."

    "abstract": "The conventional approach to developing light-sensitive glycosidase activity regulators, involving the combination of a glycomimetic moiety and a photoactive azobenzene module, results in conjugates with differences in glycosidase inhibitory activity between the interchangeable E and Z-isomers at the azo group that are generally below one-order of magnitude. In this study, we have exploited the chemical mimic character of sp<sup>2</sup>-iminosugars to access photoswitchable p- and o-azobenzene α-O-glycosides based on the gluco-configured representative ONJ. Notably, we achieved remarkably high switching factors for glycosidase inhibition, favoring either the E- or Z-isomer depending on the aglycone structure. Our data also indicate a correlation between the isomeric state of the azobenzene module and the selectivity towards α- and β-glucosidase isoenzymes. The most effective derivative reached over a 10<sup>3</sup>-fold higher inhibitory potency towards human β-glucocerebrosidase in the Z as compared with the E isomeric form. This sharp contrast is compatible with ex-vivo activation and programmed self-deactivation at physiological temperatures, positioning it as a prime candidate for pharmacological chaperone therapy in Gaucher disease. Additionally, our results illustrate that chemical tailoring enables the engineering of photocommutators with the ability to toggle inhibition between α- and β-glucosidase enzymes in a reversible manner, thus expanding the versatility and potential therapeutic applications of this approach."

The estimated carrier frequencies of ASMD- and GD-related variants were 1/180 and 1/154 in Japanese individuals, equivalent to disease occurrence frequencies of 1/128,191 and 1/94,791 individuals, respectively.

GBA1 variant carriers are at risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), but only those with biallelic mutations cross the threshold of GCase reduction, leading to substrate accumulation and GD. The link between GBA1 mutations, GD and PD is not fully understood. Here we aimed at reporting the results of a large PD population screening with dried blood spot tests for GD. We measured GCase activity and GlcSph levels in 1344 PD patients with dried blood spot tests, and performed GBA1 genetic sequencing. While the GCase activity was reduced in GBA1-PD carriers compared to wild type PD, GlcSph was increased in GBA1-PD compared to GBA1-controls, regardless of the underlying type of GBA1 variant. 13.6 % and 0.4 % of PD patients had mono- or biallelic GBA1 mutations respectively. GCase deficiency, lipid accumulation and clinical manifestations of GD was detected in five PD patients with biallelic GBA1 mutations, of whom four had a risk combined with a GD causing variant. GlcSph appearing higher in PD may represent a reliable biomarker of the disease and deserves to be further investigated. This study highlights the importance of screening PD patients for possible underlying GD, which is a treatable condition that should not be missed.

Osteonecrosis is a principal clinical manifestation of Gaucher disease and often leads to joint collapse and fractures. T1-weighted (T1w) modality in MRI is widely used to monitor bone involvement in Gaucher disease and to diagnose osteonecrosis. However, objective and quantitative methods for characterizing osteonecrosis are still limited. In this work, we present a deep learning-based quantification approach for the segmentation of osteonecrosis and the extraction of characteristic parameters. We first constructed two independent U-net models to segment the osteonecrosis and bone marrow unaffected by osteonecrosis (UBM) in spine and femur respectively, based on T1w images from patients in the UK national Gaucherite study database. We manually delineated parcellation maps including osteonecrosis and UBM from 364 T1w images (176 for spine, 188 for femur) as the training datasets, and the trained models were subsequently applied to all the 917 T1w images in the database. To quantify the segmentation, we calculated morphological parameters including the volume of osteonecrosis, the volume of UBM, and the fraction of total marrow occupied by osteonecrosis. Then, we examined the correlation between calculated features and the bone marrow burden score for marrow infiltration of the corresponding image, and no strong correlation was found. In addition, we analyzed the influence of splenectomy and the interval between the age at first symptom and the age of onset of treatment on the quantitative measurements of osteonecrosis. The results are consistent with previous studies, showing that prior splenectomy is closely associated with the fractional volume of osteonecrosis, and there is a positive relationship between the duration of untreated disease and the quantifications of osteonecrosis. We propose this technique as an efficient and reliable tool for assessing the extent of osteonecrosis in MR images of patients and improving prediction of clinically important adverse events."

Thirty LSD children and thirty non-LSD children were enrolled for this study according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Children with MPS and GD showed non-significant differences in decayed, missing, or filled teeth (DMFT) scores (p = .115). Scores of dmft showed a significant increase in MPS, but not in GD children (p = .020, p = .127).

The investigational agent venglustat is being studied in combination with imiglucerase as potential treatment for systemic and neuronopathic manifestations of GD3 in a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial (LEAP; N = 11). To understand perceived changes in GD3 symptoms from the perspectives of patients, caregivers, and clinicians, we conducted a qualitative case study of selected LEAP participants. Four patients in LEAP (age range, 20-28 years), four of their caregivers, and three clinicians involved in LEAP were interviewed individually by moderators using semi-structured guides. Clinicians' perceptions were based on observation of interviewed patients and those in LEAP who were not interviewed, as well as information provided by other staff involved in LEAP, patients, and caregivers. Reported changes in GD3 symptoms varied among patients and among reporters. Only eye movement was spontaneously mentioned as improved by at least one patient, caregiver, and clinical expert. Symptom improvement also varied in terms of time to improvement. Within the first weeks, improvements were seen in understanding new information or complex instructions, remembering the weekday, eye movement, tremor, and seizures. Changes in alertness, engagement and responsiveness, memory, and concentration appeared after months or a year. Most caregivers and all clinical experts reported greater patient independence (e.g., increased ability to perform activities of daily living or travel independently during the trial) as a perceived treatment effect on a GD3 impact. For one patient who perceived benefits from venglustat therapy, pharmacokinetic analyses during LEAP found low to undetectable venglustat levels in their plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Outcomes from this study provide insights into GD3 symptoms and the early signaling of changes reported during venglustat therapy. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT02843035."

    "abstract": "Our aim was to compare the costs and efficacy of ambroxol in combination with imiglucerase with the costs and efficacy of imiglucerase only in the treatment of Gaucher disease type 2 (GD2) in the socio-economic settings of the Republic of Serbia, an upper-middle-income European economy. The perspective of the Serbian Republic Health Insurance Fund was chosen for this study, and the time horizon was 6 years. The main outcomes of the study were quality-adjusted life years gained with ambroxol + imiglucerase and comparator, and direct costs of treatment. The study was conducted through the generation and simulation of the Markov chain model. The model results were obtained after Monte Carlo microsimulation of a sample with 1,000 virtual patients. Treatment with ambroxol in combination with imiglucerase was cost-effective when compared with imiglucerase only and was associated with positive values of net monetary benefit regardless of the onset of the disease. Such beneficial result for ambroxol and imiglucerase combination is primarily driven by the low cost of ambroxol and its considerable clinical effectiveness in slowing the progression of neural complications of GD2. If ambroxol and imiglucerase are used in combination for the treatment of GD2, it is more cost-effective than using imiglucerase alone."

    "title": "Molecular mechanisms of the ambroxol action in Gaucher disease and GBA1 mutation-associated Parkinson disease.",
    "abstract": "Glucocerebrosidase (GCase), encoded by the GBA1 gene, is one of the lysosomal enzymes responsible for hydrolyzing the glycosphingolipids. Deficiency in GCase activity (in patients with two defective alleles of GBA1) leads to glucosylceramide storage in lysosomes which in turn results in the development of the Gaucher diseases, a lysosomal storage disorder, while a heterozygous state may be correlated with the GBA1 mutation-associated Parkinson disease. One of the proposed forms of therapy for these two conditions is the use of pharmacological chaperones which work by facilitating the achievement of the correct conformation of abnormally folded enzymes. Several compounds with chaperone activities against GCase have already been tested, one of which turned out to be ambroxol. Studies conducted on the action of this compound have indeed indicated its effectiveness in increasing GCase levels and activity. However, some data have begun to question its activity as a chaperone against certain GCase variants. Then, a number of articles appeared pointing to other mechanisms of action of ambroxol, which may also contribute to the improvement of patients' condition. This paper summarizes the biological mechanisms of action of ambroxol in Gaucher disease and GBA1 mutation-associated Parkinson disease, focused on its activity as a chaperone, modulator of ERAD pathways, inducer of autophagy, and pain reliever in cellular and animal models as well as in patients. The effects of these activities on the reduction of disease markers and symptoms in patients are also discussed. Consideration of all the properties of ambroxol can help in the appropriate choice of therapy and the determination of the effective drug dose."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and disabling bone manifestations requiring regular MRI monitoring. The EIROS study assessed the real-world impact of velaglucerase alfa on GD1 bone disease, using MRI data collected in French clinical practice. <b>Methods</b>: MRIs collected retrospectively from treatment initiation and prospectively during follow-up (12-months) were analyzed centrally by a blinded expert radiologist to evaluate bone infiltration using the Bone Marrow Burden (BMB) score and a qualitative method (stable, improved or worsened for the spine and femur). Abdominal MRIs were also centrally analyzed to assess hepatosplenomegaly. Bone manifestations, hepatosplenomegaly, and hematologic parameters were analyzed from medical records. <b>Results</b>: MRI data were available for 20 patients: 6 treatment-naive patients and 14 patients who switched to velaglucerase alfa from another GD treatment. Interpretable MRIs for BMB scoring were available for seven patients for the spine and one patient for the femur. Qualitative assessments (<i>n</i> = 18) revealed stability in spine and femur infiltration in 100.0% and 84.6% of treatment-switched patients (<i>n</i> = 13), respectively, and improvements in 80.0% and 60.0% of treatment-naive patients (<i>n</i> = 5), respectively; no worsening of bone infiltration was observed. Liver, spleen, and hematologic parameters improved in treatment-naive patients and remained stable in treatment-switched patients. <b>Conclusions</b>: The qualitative real-world data support findings from clinical trials suggesting the long-term effectiveness of velaglucerase alfa on GD1 bone manifestations. When MRI assessment by radiologists with experience of GD is not possible, a simplified qualitative assessment may be sufficient in clinical practice for monitoring bone disease progression and treatment response."

As the presentation of this disease is similar to more common diseases like malaria, portal hypertension, hematological disorders, and kala-azar, this rare disease may not be thought of as a differential diagnosis, and a high index of suspicion is required to avoid diagnostic delay. We report a case of type 1 Gaucher's disease in an adult male born out of a consanguineous marriage. He was from a region where the prevalence of infectious diseases and sickle cell anemia is high. He presented with abdominal distension, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy showed the presence of Gaucher cells. Glucocerebrosidase levels showed decreased enzyme activity. The genetic study revealed a very rare mutation that has not been reported in the 1000 Genomes database till now. Retrospectively, the most important clue was his birth out of a consanguineous marriage of his parents."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is classically divided into three types, based on the presence or absence of neurological signs and symptoms. However, presentation can be highly variable in adulthood, and this aspect has not been adequately addressed in the literature so far. We performed a systematic literature review to analyze the entire spectrum of neurological manifestations in adult patients previously classified as GD type I, II, or III, evaluating the role of variants in different neurological manifestations. We searched databases for studies reporting clinical data of adult GD patients (age ≥ 18). Data extraction included GD types, GBA1 variants, age at disease onset and diagnosis, duration of GD, and age at onset and type of neurological symptoms reported. Among 4190 GD patients from 85 studies, 555 exhibited neurological symptoms in adulthood. The median age at evaluation was 46.8 years (IQR 26.5), age at neurological symptoms onset was 44 years (IQR 35.1), and age at GD clinical onset was 23 years (IQR 23.4). Parkinsonism, including Parkinson's disease and Lewy Body dementia, was the most reported neurological manifestation. Other symptoms and signs encompassed oculomotor abnormalities, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, myoclonus, and cerebellar, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. The genotype N370S/N370S mostly presented with Parkinsonism and the L444P variant with severe and earlier neurological symptoms. The findings of this systematic review highlight: (1) the relevance of a comprehensive neurological assessment in GD patients, and (2) the importance of considering possible undiagnosed GD in adult patients with mild systemic symptoms presenting unexplained neurological symptoms."

    "title": "The Etiologic Landscape of Lymphoproliferation in Childhood: Proposal for a Diagnostic Approach Exploring from Infections to Inborn Errors of Immunity and Metabolic Diseases.",
    "abstract": "Lymphoproliferation is defined by lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or lymphocytic organ and tissue infiltration. The most common etiologies of lymphoproliferation are represented by infectious diseases and lymphoid malignancies. However, it is increasingly recognized that lymphoproliferative features can be the presenting sign of rare conditions, including inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). Among IEI, lymphoproliferation is frequently observed in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and related disorders, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase δ syndrome, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related disorders. Gaucher disease and Niemann-Pick disease are the most common IEMs that can present with isolated lymphoproliferative features. Notably, other rare conditions, such as sarcoidosis, Castleman disease, systemic autoimmune diseases, and autoinflammatory disorders, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with persistent lymphoproliferation when infectious and malignant diseases have been reasonably ruled out. The clinical features of lymphoproliferative diseases, as well as the associated clinical findings and data deriving from imaging and first-level laboratory investigations, could significantly help in providing the correct diagnostic suspicion for the underlying etiology. This paper reviews the most relevant diseases associated with lymphoproliferation, including infectious diseases, hematological malignancies, IEI, and IEM. Moreover, some practical indications to orient the initial diagnostic process are provided, and two diagnostic algorithms are proposed for the first-level assessment and the approach to persistent lymphoproliferation, respectively."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) stands as one of the most prevalent lysosomal disorders, yet neuronopathic GD (nGD) is an uncommon subset characterized by a wide array of clinical manifestations that complicate diagnosis, particularly when neurological symptoms are understated. nGD may manifest as the acute neuronopathic type, or GD type 2 (GD2), either prenatally or within the first weeks to months of life, whereas GD type 3 (GD3) symptoms may emerge at any point during childhood or occasionally in adolescence. The clinical presentation encompasses severe systemic involvement to mild visceral disease, often coupled with a spectrum of progressive neurological signs and symptoms such as cognitive impairment, ataxia, seizures, myoclonus, varying degrees of brainstem dysfunction presenting with stridor, apneic episodes, and/or impaired swallowing. This manuscript aims to provide a comprehensive review of the incidence, distinctive presentations, and diverse clinical phenotypes of nGD across various countries and regions. It will explore the natural history of the neurodegenerative process in GD, shedding light on its various manifestations during infancy and childhood, and offer insights into the diagnostic journey, the challenges faced in the clinical management, and current and investigative therapeutic approaches for GD's neurological variants."

The most acute neuronopathic form (nGD), for which there are no curative therapeutic options, is characterised by devastating neuropathology and death during infancy. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic benefit of systemically delivered AAV9 vectors expressing the human GBA1 gene at two different doses comparing a neuronal-selective promoter with ubiquitous promoters. Our results highlight the importance of a careful evaluation of the promoter sequence used in gene delivery vectors, suggesting a neuron-targeted therapy leading to high levels of enzymatic activity in the brain but lower GCase expression in the viscera, might be the optimal therapeutic strategy for nGD."

We engineered an adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid, BI-hTFR1, that binds human transferrin receptor (TfR1), a protein expressed on the blood-brain barrier. BI-hTFR1 was actively transported across human brain endothelial cells and, relative to AAV9, provided 40 to 50 times greater reporter expression in the CNS of human <i>TFRC</i> knockin mice. The enhanced tropism was CNS-specific and absent in wild-type mice. When used to deliver <i>GBA1</i>, mutations of which cause Gaucher disease and are linked to Parkinson's disease, BI-hTFR1 substantially increased brain and cerebrospinal fluid glucocerebrosidase activity compared with AAV9. These findings establish BI-hTFR1 as a potential vector for human CNS gene therapy."

    "abstract": "Nutrient avidity is one of the most distinctive features of tumours. However, nutrient deprivation has yielded limited clinical benefits. In Gaucher disease, an inherited metabolic disorder, cells produce cholesteryl-glucoside which accumulates in lysosomes and causes cell damage. Here we develop a nanoparticle (AbCholB) to emulate natural-lipoprotein-carried cholesterol and initiate Gaucher disease-like damage in cancer cells. AbCholB is composed of a phenylboronic-acid-modified cholesterol (CholB) and albumin. Cancer cells uptake the nanoparticles into lysosomes, where CholB reacts with glucose and generates a cholesteryl-glucoside-like structure that resists degradation and aggregates into microscale crystals, causing Gaucher disease-like damage in a glucose-dependent manner. In addition, the nutrient-sensing function of mTOR is suppressed. It is observed that normal cells escape severe damage due to their inferior ability to compete for nutrients compared with cancer cells. This work provides a bioinspired strategy to selectively impede the metabolic action of cancer cells by taking advantage of their nutrient avidity."

However, the birth prevalence of these disorders is rarely reported in the Chinese population, and subclinical forms of diseases among patients identified by NBS have not been evaluated. To evaluate the birth prevalence of the 6 LSDs in the Shanghai population and determine subclinical forms based on clinical, biochemical, and genetic characteristics. This cohort study included 50 108 newborns recruited from 41 hospitals in Shanghai between January and December 2021 who were screened for 6 LSDs using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Participants with screen-positive results underwent molecular and biochemical tests and clinical assessments. Data were analyzed from January 2021 through October 2022. All participants were screened for Gaucher, acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), Krabbe, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, Fabry, and Pompe diseases using dried blood spots. Primary outcomes were the birth prevalence and subclinical forms of the 6 LSDs in the Shanghai population. Disease biomarker measurements, genetic testing, and clinical analysis were used to assess clinical forms of LSDs screened. Among 50 108 newborns (26 036 male [52.0%]; mean [SD] gestational age, 38.8 [1.6] weeks), the mean (SD) birth weight was 3257 (487) g. The MS/MS-based NBS identified 353 newborns who were positive. Of these, 27 newborns (7.7%) were diagnosed with 1 of 6 LSDs screened, including 2 newborns with Gaucher, 5 newborns with ASMD, 9 newborns with Krabbe, 8 newborns with Fabry, and 3 newborns with Pompe disease. The combined birth prevalence of LSDs in Shanghai was 1 diagnosis in 1856 live births, with Krabbe disease the most common (1 diagnosis/5568 live births), followed by Fabry disease (1 diagnosis/6264 live births), and ASMD (1 diagnosis/10 022 live births). Biochemical, molecular, and clinical analysis showed that early-onset clinical forms accounted for 3 newborns with positive results (11.1%), while later-onset forms represented nearly 90% of diagnoses (24 newborns [88.9%]). In this study, the combined birth prevalence of the 6 LSDs in Shanghai was remarkably high. MS/MS-based newborn screening, combined with biochemical and molecular genetic analysis, successfully identified and characterized newborns who were screen-positive, which may assist with parental counseling and management decisions."

This study will explore physician attitudes about ARPs and determine if there are relationships to clinical practice and personal characteristics. This is a national observational cross-sectional study that used an electronic questionnaire addressing reported practice, attitudes regarding the ARPs, and responses to clinical vignettes. Participants were physicians in Canadian tertiary-care pediatric settings. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze physician attitudes. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to determine associations between physician and practice characteristics and likelihood to consider ARP. Eighty three respondents represented 12 institutions, with a majority from general or complex care pediatrics. There was a wide disparity between likelihood to consider ARP in each clinical scenario. Likelihood to consider ARP ranged from to 19% to 78% depending on the scenario. Two scenarios were equally split in whether the respondent would offer an ARP. None of the demographic characteristics were significantly associated with likelihood to consider ARP. Often, gastrojejunostomy tubes alone were considered (56% to 68%). There is considerable variability in physician attitudes toward and recommendations regarding ARPs to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease. We did not find a significant association with clinical experience or location of practice. More research is needed to define indications and outcomes for ARPs. This is a scenario where shared decision-making, bringing together physician and family knowledge and expertise, is likely the best course of action."

    "abstract": "Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) is implicated in both a rare, monogenic disorder (Gaucher disease, GD) and a common, multifactorial condition (Parkinson's disease); hence, it is an urgent therapeutic target. To identify correctors of severe protein misfolding and trafficking obstruction manifested by the pathogenic L444P-variant of GCase, we developed a suite of quantitative, high-throughput, cell-based assays. First, we labeled GCase with a small pro-luminescent HiBiT peptide reporter tag, enabling quantitation of protein stabilization in cells while faithfully maintaining target biology. TALEN-based gene editing allowed for stable integration of a single HiBiT-<i>GBA1</i> transgene into an intragenic safe-harbor locus in <i>GBA1</i>-knockout H4 (neuroglioma) cells. This GD cell model was amenable to lead discovery via titration-based quantitative high-throughput screening and lead optimization via structure-activity relationships. A primary screen of 10,779 compounds from the NCATS bioactive collections identified 140 stabilizers of HiBiT-GCase-L444P, including both pharmacological chaperones (ambroxol and non-inhibitory chaperone NCGC326) and proteostasis regulators (panobinostat, trans-ISRIB, and pladienolide B). Two complementary high-content imaging-based assays were deployed to triage hits: the fluorescence-quenched substrate LysoFix-GBA captured functional lysosomal GCase activity, while an immunofluorescence assay featuring antibody hGCase-1/23 provided direct visualization of GCase lysosomal translocation. NCGC326 was active in both secondary assays and completely reversed pathological glucosylsphingosine accumulation. Finally, we tested the concept of combination therapy, by demonstrating synergistic actions of NCGC326 with proteostasis regulators in enhancing GCase-L444P levels. Looking forward, these physiologically-relevant assays can facilitate the identification, pharmacological validation, and medicinal chemistry optimization of new chemical matter targeting GCase, ultimately leading to a viable therapeutic for two protein-misfolding diseases."

Here, we evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of AL01211 in healthy Chinese volunteers. AL01211 was tested in a Phase 1, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with single-dose (15 and 60 mg) and multiple-dose (30 mg) arms. Results of AL01211 demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, rapid absorption (median time to maximum plasma concentration [t<sub>max</sub>] 2.5-4 hours), relatively slow clearance rate (mean apparent total clearance from plasma [CL/F] 88.3-200 L/h) and the mean terminal half-life above 30 hours.

The existence of a single laboratory of Biochemical Genetics for the whole island facilitated the creation of a national registry for IMD. The minimal prevalence of IMD in Cyprus is 53.3 cases per 100,000 live births. The most common group are disorders of amino acid metabolism (41.0%), followed by disorders of carbohydrate metabolism (16.5%), disorders of complex molecule degradation (16.5%), mitochondrial disorders (10.5%) and disorders of vitamin and co-factor metabolism (5.5%). Hyperphenylalaninaemia is the most common IMD (14.0%) followed by galactosaemia (7.0%), glutaric aciduria type I (5.5%) and MSUD (4.0%).

We report real-world outcomes with long-term eliglustat treatment in adults with GD1 in the International Collaborative Gaucher Group Gaucher Registry. Among 5985 GD1 patients in the Registry as of January 6, 2023, 872 started eliglustat at ≥18 years old; of these, 469 met inclusion criteria. We compared clinical parameters at eliglustat initiation (i.e., baseline) and follow-up in treatment-naïve patients and used linear mixed models to estimate annual change from baseline in parameters among patients who switched to eliglustat after ≥1 year on enzyme replacement therapy. Over 4 years of follow-up in non-splenectomized treatment-naïve patients, hemoglobin and platelet count increased, liver and spleen volume decreased, and total lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) Z-score decreased slightly. Among non-splenectomized switch patients, on average, hemoglobin decreased -0.030 (95% CI: -0.053, -0.008) g/dL (N = 272) and platelet count increased 2.229 (95% CI: 0.751, 3.706) × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup> (N = 262) annually up to 10 years; liver volume decreased (-0.009 [95% CI: -0.015, -0.003] MN) (N = 102) and spleen volume remained stable (-0.070 [95% CI: -0.150, 0.010] MN) (N = 106) annually up to 7 years; and total lumbar spine BMD Z-score increased 0.041 (95% CI: 0.015, 0.066) (N = 183) annually up to 8 years.

The prevalence and risk factors of HCV-related PN in the absence of MCG are largely unknown. We conducted a prospective, single-center study, examining the prevalence and reversibility of HCV-associated neuropathy in the absence of MCG. Nerve fiber density in the epidermis was evaluated through skin biopsy and electroneurography (ENG) before HCV-treatment initiation and 1 year post sustained virological remission (SVR). Forty HCV-infected individuals (nine HIV co-infected) with no other neuron-harming factors were included; four other HCV mono- and three HIV co-infected individuals were excluded due to presence of diabetes, B12 insufficiency, or neurotoxic drugs. Twelve consecutive controls with no neuron-harming conditions were also recruited; eight more were excluded due to meeting exclusion criteria. Four patients had ENG signs of polyneuropathy (two with HCV mono- and two with HIV co-infection), while seven more (five with HCV mono- and two with HIV co-infection) had signs of mono-neuropathy, leading to PN prevalences of 22.5% and 44% for mono- and co-infection, respectively (<i>p</i> value 0.179). The two patients with HCV mono-infection and polyneuropathy and the one with ulnar nerve damage showed ENG improvement 1 year post SVR.

PN is common in HCV infection; successful eradication of HCV leads to PN improvement."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme deficiency, leading to glycosylceramide (Gb-1) and glucosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb-1) accumulation. The pathological hallmark for GD is an accumulation of large macrophages called Gaucher cells (GCs) in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, which are associated with chronic organ enlargement, bone manifestations, and inflammation. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5 (TRAP5 protein, <i>ACP5</i> gene) has long been a nonspecific biomarker of macrophage/GCs activation; however, the discovery of two isoforms of TRAP5 has expanded its significance. The discovery of TRAP5's two isoforms revealed that it is more than just a biomarker of macrophage activity. While TRAP5a is highly expressed in macrophages, TRAP5b is secreted by osteoclasts. Recently, we have shown that the elevation of TRAP5b in plasma is associated with osteoporosis in GD. However, the role of TRAP isoforms in GD and how the accumulation of Gb-1 and Lyso-Gb-1 affects TRAP expression is unknown. 39 patients with GD were categorized into cohorts based on bone mineral density (BMD). TRAP5a and TRAP5b plasma levels were quantified by ELISA. ACP5 mRNA was estimated using RT-PCR. An increase in TRAP5b was associated with reduced BMD and correlated with Lyso-Gb-1 and immune activator chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18). In contrast, the elevation of TRAP5a correlated with chitotriosidase activity in GD. Lyso-Gb-1 and plasma seemed to influence the expression of ACP5 in macrophages. As an early indicator of BMD alteration, measurement of circulating TRAP5b is a valuable tool for assessing osteopenia-osteoporosis in GD, while TRAP5a serves as a biomarker of macrophage activation in GD. Understanding the distinct expression pattern of TRAP5 isoforms offers valuable insight into both bone disease and the broader implications for immune system activation in GD."

GBA1 encodes the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which orchestrates the degradation of glucosylceramide (GluCer) in the lysosome. Recent studies have shown that GluCer accelerates α-synuclein aggregation, exposing GCase deficiency as a major risk factor in PD pathology and as a promising target for treatment. This study investigates the interaction of GCase and three disease-associated variants (p.E326K, p.N370S, p.L444P) with their transporter, the lysosomal integral membrane protein 2 (LIMP-2). Overexpression of LIMP-2 in HEK 293T cells boosts lysosomal abundance of wt, E326K, and N370S GCase and increases/rescues enzymatic activity of the wt and E326K variant. Using a novel purification approach, co-purification of untagged wt, E326K, and N370S GCase in complex with His-tagged LIMP-2 from cell supernatant of HEK 293F cells is achieved, confirming functional binding and trafficking for these variants. Furthermore, a single helix in the LIMP-2 ectodomain is exploited to design a lysosome-targeted peptide that enhances lysosomal GCase activity in PD patient-derived and control fibroblasts. These findings reveal LIMP-2 as an allosteric activator of GCase, suggesting a possible therapeutic potential of targeting this interaction."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a mutation in the GBA1 gene, responsible for encoding the enzyme Glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Although neuronal death and neuroinflammation have been observed in the brains of individuals with neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD), the exact mechanism underlying neurodegeneration in nGD remains unclear. In this study, we used two induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived neuronal cell lines acquired from two type-3 GD patients (GD3-1 and GD3-2) to investigate the mechanisms underlying nGD by biochemical analyses. These iPSCs-derived neuronal cells from GD3-1 and GD3-2 exhibit an impairment in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium homeostasis and an increase in unfolded protein response markers (BiP and CHOP), indicating the presence of ER stress in nGD. A significant increase in the BAX/BCL-2 ratio and an increase in Annexin V-positive cells demonstrate a notable increase in apoptotic cell death in GD iPSCs-derived neurons, suggesting downstream signaling after an increase in the unfolded protein response. Our study involves the establishment of iPSCs-derived neuronal models for GD and proposes a possible mechanism underlying nGD. This mechanism involves the activation of ER stress and the unfolded protein response, ultimately leading to apoptotic cell death in neurons."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessively inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by biallelic pathological variants in the GBA1 gene. Patients present along a broad clinical spectrum, and phenotypes are often difficult to predict based on genotype alone. The variant R463C (p.Arg502Cys) exemplifies this challenge. To better characterize its different clinical presentations, we examined the records of 25 current and historical patients evaluated at the National Institutes of Health. Nine patients were classified as GD1, 14 were classified as GD3, and two had an ambiguous diagnosis between GD1 and GD3. In addition, we reviewed the published literature in PubMed and Web of Science through December 2023, identifying 62 cases with an R463C variant from 18 countries. Within the NIH cohort, the most common second variants were N370S (p.N409S) and L444P (p.L483P). R463C/L444P was encountered in patients with GD1 and GD3 in both the NIH cohort and worldwide. In the literature, R463C/R463C was also reported in both GD1 and GD3, although sparse phenotypic information was shared. Often the phenotype reflected what might be predicted for the second mutant allele. This diversity of phenotypes emphasizes the need for longitudinal follow-up to assess symptom development and neurological involvement."

We prospectively evaluated 41 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease using a 3.0 T MRI and MRE between January 2019 and February 2020. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging data was collected. Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearman's correlation were applied to evaluate liver and spleen MRI and MRE, clinical and laboratory variables, and GD-DS3.

Moderate and strong and correlations were found between liver and spleen iron overload (rho = 0.537; p = 0.002); between liver and spleen volume (rho = 0.692, p < 0.001) and between liver and spleen stiffness (rho = 0.453, p = 0.006). Moderate correlations were found between liver stiffness and GD-DS3 (rho = 0.559; p < 0.001) and between splenic volume and GD-DS3 (rho = 0.524; p = 0.001). The prevalence of hepatosplenomegaly, liver fibrosis, and liver iron overload in treated patients with GD is low, which may be related to the beneficial effect of treatment. Liver MRE and splenic volume correlate with severity score and may be biomarkers of disease severity."

    "title": "Variant-specific effects of GBA1 mutations on dopaminergic neuron proteostasis.",
    "abstract": "Glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA1) mutations are the most important genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinically, mild (e.g., p.N370S) and severe (e.g., p.L444P and p.D409H) GBA1 mutations have different PD phenotypes, with differences in age at disease onset, progression, and the severity of motor and non-motor symptoms. We hypothesize that GBA1 mutations cause the accumulation of α-synuclein by affecting the cross-talk between cellular protein degradation mechanisms, leading to neurodegeneration. Accordingly, we tested whether mild and severe GBA1 mutations differentially affect the degradation of α-synuclein via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and macroautophagy and differentially cause accumulation and/or release of α-synuclein. Our results demonstrate that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and total ubiquitination rates were significantly increased in cells with severe GBA1 mutations. CMA was found to be defective in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopaminergic neurons with mild GBA1 mutations, but not in those with severe GBA1 mutations. When examining macroautophagy, we observed reduced formation of autophagosomes in cells with the N370S and D409H GBA1 mutations and impairments in autophagosome-lysosome fusion in cells with the L444P GBA1 mutation. Accordingly, severe GBA1 mutations were found to trigger the accumulation and release of oligomeric α-synuclein in iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons, primarily as a result of increased ER stress and defective macroautophagy, while mild GBA1 mutations affected CMA, which is mainly responsible for the degradation of the monomeric form of α-synuclein. Overall, our findings provide new insight into the molecular basis of the clinical variability in PD associated with different GBA1 mutations."

Deficiency in the SCARB2 gene causes progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME), a rare group of inherited neurodegenerative diseases characterized by myoclonus. We found that Scarb2 deficiency in mice leads to age-dependent dietary lipid malabsorption, accompanied with vitamin E deficiency. Our investigation revealed that Scarb2 deficiency is associated with gut dysbiosis and an altered bile acid pool, leading to hyperactivation of FXR in intestine. Hyperactivation of FXR impairs epithelium renewal and lipid absorption. Patients with SCARB2 mutations have a severe reduction in their vitamin E levels and cannot absorb dietary vitamin E. Finally, inhibiting FXR or supplementing vitamin E ameliorates the neuromotor impairment and neuropathy in Scarb2 knockout mice. These data indicate that gastrointestinal dysfunction is associated with SCARB2 deficiency-related neurodegeneration, and SCARB2-associated neurodegeneration can be improved by addressing the nutrition deficits and gastrointestinal issues."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme deficiency. Gaucher cells transformed from the macrophages by progressive sphingolipid accumulation and infiltrate bone marrow, spleen, liver, and other organs. The accumulation of substrate causes inflammation, compromised cellular homeostasis, and disturbed autophagy. It has been hypothesized that this proinflammatory state of GD leads cytokines and chemokines release. As a result of inflammatory process, the cellular dysfunction caused by disruption of cellular signaling, organelle dysfunction, or autoimmune antibodies may affect endocrine profile of GD patients such as hormone levels, lipid profile, and bone mineral density status. A total of 13 patients confirmed to have GD, 12 non-neuronopathic type and one subacute neuronopathic type, were enrolled in our study. The median treatment duration in the enzyme therapy was 13.33 years (9-26 years). At least one endocrinological abnormality was detected in blood tests of nine patients. Hyperinsulinism was the most common finding although fasting blood glucose levels HgbA1c levels were normal in all patients. Two patients had osteopenia, and osteoporosis was detected in two patients. Low HDL levels were detected in six patients, but HDL levels below 23 mg/dL associated with disease severity have been detected in two patients who have not receiving enzyme replacement therapy. None of patients had thyroidal dysfunction. This study had revealed endocrinological abnormalities in GD patients that have not led any severe morbidity in our patients. However, thyroid hormone abnormalities, insulin resistance, or lipid profile abnormalities may cause unpredictable comorbidities. Endocrinological assessment in GD patients in routine follow-up may prevent possible clinical manifestation in long term as well as can define efficacy of ERT on endocrine abnormalities."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD), a rare hereditary lysosomal storage disorder, occurs due to a deficiency in the enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). This deficiency leads to the buildup of substrate glucosylceramide (GlcCer) in macrophages, eventually resulting in various complications. Among its three types, GD2 is particularly severe with neurological involvements. Current treatments, such as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), are not effective for GD2 and GD3 due to their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Other treatment approaches, such as gene or chaperone therapies are still in experimental stages. Additionally, GD treatments are costly and can have certain side effects. The successful use of messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines for COVID-19 in 2020 has sparked interest in nucleic acid-based therapies. Remarkably, mRNA technology also offers a novel approach for protein replacement purposes. Additionally, self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) technology shows promise, potentially producing more protein at lower doses. This review aims to explore the potential of a cost-effective mRNA/saRNA-based approach for GD therapy. The use of GCase-mRNA/saRNA as a protein replacement therapy could offer a new and promising direction for improving the quality of life and extending the lifespan of individuals with GD."

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra and the presence of α-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions. Gaucher's disease is caused by homozygous mutations in β-glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA). GBA mutation carriers have an increased risk of PD. Coptis chinensis (C. chinensis) rhizome extract is a major herb widely used to treat human diseases. This study examined the association of GBA L444P mutation with Taiwanese PD in 1016 cases and 539 controls. In addition, the protective effects of C. chinensis rhizome extract and its active constituents (berberine, coptisine, and palmatine) against PD were assayed using GBA reporter cells, LC3 reporter cells, and cells expressing mutated (A53T) α-synuclein. Case-control study revealed that GBA L444P carriers had a 3.93-fold increased risk of PD (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.37-11.24, p = 0.006) compared to normal controls. Both C. chinensis rhizome extract and its constituents exhibited chemical chaperone activity to reduce α-synuclein aggregation. Promoter reporter and endogenous GBA protein analyses revealed that C. chinensis rhizome extract and its constituents upregulated GBA expression in 293 cells. In addition, C. chinensis rhizome extract and its constituents induced autophagy in DsRed-LC3-expressing 293 cells. In SH-SY5Y cells expressing A53T α-synuclein, C. chinensis rhizome extract and its constituents reduced α-synuclein aggregation and associated neurotoxicity by upregulating GBA expression and activating autophagy. The results of reducing α-synuclein aggregation, enhancing GBA expression and autophagy, and protecting against α-synuclein neurotoxicity open up the therapeutic potentials of C. chinensis rhizome extract and constituents for PD."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by functional glucocerebrosidase enzyme deficiency. Hepatosplenomegaly and hematological complications are found in both Gaucher disease and Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency, which is caused by acid sphingomyelinase dysfunction. The possible overlap in clinical presentation can cause diagnostic errors in differential diagnosis. For this reason, in patients with an initial clinical suspicion of Gaucher disease, we aimed to carry out a parallel screening of acid sphingomyelinase and glucocerebrosidase. <b>Methods:</b> Peripheral blood samples of 627 patients were collected, and enzymatic activity analysis was performed on both glucocerebrosidase and acid sphingomyelinase. The specific gene was studied in samples with null or reduced enzymatic activity. Specific molecular biomarkers helped to achieve the correct diagnosis. <b>Results:</b> In 98.7% of patients, normal values of glucocerebrosidase activity excluded Gaucher disease. In 8 of 627 patients (1.3%), the glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity assay was below the normal range, so genetic GBA1 analysis confirmed the enzymatic defect. Three patients (0.5%) had normal glucocerebrosidase activity, so they were not affected by Gaucher disease, and showed decreased acid sphingomyelinase activity. SMPD1 gene mutations responsible for Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency were found. The levels of specific biomarkers found in these patients further strengthened the genetic data. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our results suggest that in the presence of typical signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease, Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency should be considered. For this reason, the presence of hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and anemia should alert clinicians to analyze both enzymes by a combined screening. Today, enzyme replacement therapy is available for the treatment of both pathologies; therefore, prompt diagnosis is essential for patients to start accurate treatment and to avoid diagnostic delay."

Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) deficiency, leading to skeletal complications. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the GBA1 gene on osteoporosis progression in GD patients and the specific populations. We selected 8115 patients with osteoporosis (T-score ≤ - 2.5) and 55,942 healthy individuals (T-score > - 1) from a clinical database (N = 95,223). Monocytes from GD patients were evaluated in relation to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammasome activation, and osteoclastogenesis. An in vitro model of GD patient's cells treated with adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-GBA1 to assess GBA1 enzyme activity, chitotriosidase activity, ER stress, and osteoclast differentiation. Longitudinal dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data tracking bone density in patients with Gaucher disease (GD) undergoing enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) over an extended period. The GBA1 gene variant rs11264345 was significantly associated [P < 0.002, Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.06] with an increased risk of bone disease. Upregulation of Calnexin, NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) and Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (ASC) was positively associated with osteoclastogenesis in patients with GD. In vitro AAV9-GBA1 treatment of GD patient cells led to enhanced GBA1 enzyme activity, reduced chitotriosidase activity, diminished ER stress, and decreased osteoclast differentiation. Long-term bone density data suggests that initiating ERT earlier in GD leads to greater improvements in bone density. Elevated ER stress and inflammasome activation are indicative of osteoporosis development, suggesting the need for clinical monitoring of patients with GD. Furthermore, disease-associated variant in the GBA1 gene may constitute a risk factor predisposing specific populations to osteoporosis."

Because a scarcity of data on this condition contributes to management challenges and poor outcomes, we aimed to describe the clinical spectrum, cancer biology, and impact of genetics on patient survival in CMMRD. In this cohort study, we collected cross-sectional and longitudinal data on all patients with CMMRD, with no age limits, registered with the International Replication Repair Deficiency Consortium (IRRDC) across more than 50 countries. Clinical data were extracted from the IRRDC database, medical records, and physician-completed case record forms. The primary objective was to describe the clinical features, cancer spectrum, and biology of the condition. Secondary objectives included estimations of cancer incidence and of the impact of the specific mismatch-repair gene and genotype on cancer onset and survival, including after cancer surveillance and immunotherapy interventions. We analysed data from 201 patients (103 males, 98 females) enrolled between June 5, 2007 and Sept 9, 2022. Median age at diagnosis of CMMRD or a related cancer was 8·9 years (IQR 5·9-12·6), and median follow-up from diagnosis was 7·2 years (3·6-14·8). Endogamy among minorities and closed communities contributed to high homozygosity within countries with low consanguinity. Frequent dermatological manifestations (117 [93%] of 126 patients with complete data) led to a clinical overlap with neurofibromatosis type 1 (35 [28%] of 126). 339 cancers were reported in 194 (97%) of 201 patients. The cumulative cancer incidence by age 18 years was 90% (95% CI 80-99). Median time between cancer diagnoses for patients with more than one cancer was 1·9 years (IQR 0·8-3·9). Neoplasms developed in 15 organs and included early-onset adult cancers. CNS tumours were the most frequent (173 [51%] cancers), followed by gastrointestinal (75 [22%]), haematological (61 [18%]), and other cancer types (30 [9%]). Patients with CNS tumours had the poorest overall survival rates (39% [95% CI 30-52] at 10 years from diagnosis; log-rank p<0·0001 across four cancer types), followed by those with haematological cancers (67% [55-82]), gastrointestinal cancers (89% [81-97]), and other solid tumours (96% [88-100]). All cancers showed high mutation and microsatellite indel burdens, and pathognomonic mutational signatures. MLH1 or MSH2 variants caused earlier cancer onset than PMS2 or MSH6 variants, and inferior survival (overall survival at age 15 years 63% [95% CI 55-73] for PMS2, 49% [35-68] for MSH6, 19% [6-66] for MLH1, and 0% for MSH2; p<0·0001). Frameshift or truncating variants within the same gene caused earlier cancers and inferior outcomes compared with missense variants (p<0·0001). The greater deleterious effects of MLH1 and MSH2 variants as compared with PMS2 and MSH6 variants persisted despite overall improvements in survival after surveillance or immune checkpoint inhibitor interventions. The very high cancer burden and unique genomic landscape of CMMRD highlight the benefit of comprehensive assays in timely diagnosis and precision approaches toward surveillance and immunotherapy. These data will guide the clinical management of children and patients who survive into adulthood with CMMRD.

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease, an autosomal recessively inherited lysosomal storage disorder, results from biallelic mutations in the <i>GBA1</i> gene resulting in deficient activity of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. In Gaucher disease, the reduced levels and activity of glucocerebrosidase lead to a disparity in the rates of formation and breakdown of glucocerebroside and glucosylsphingosine, resulting in the accumulation of these lipid substrates in the lysosome. This gives rise to the development of Gaucher cells, engorged macrophages with a characteristic wrinkled tissue paper appearance. There are both non-neuronopathic (type 1) and neuronopathic (types 2 and 3) forms of Gaucher disease, associated with varying degrees of severity. The visceral and hematologic manifestations of Gaucher disease respond well to both enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy. However, these therapies do not improve the neuronopathic manifestations, as they cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. There is now an established precedent for treating lysosomal storage disorders with gene therapy strategies, as many have the potential to cross into the brain. The range of the gene therapies being employed is broad, but this review aimed to discuss the progress, advances, and challenges in developing viral gene therapy as a treatment for Gaucher disease."

Paraquat (PQ), a herbicide, increases PD risk in most studies. Its effects on the brain involve alterations in the gut microbiome. Exposure to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), a mouse model of colitis, can be used to determine whether gut microbiome alterations are sufficient to induce PD-relevant phenotypes. We rederived the A53T-L444P and A53T mouse lines to assess whether PQ, PQ in combination with radiation exposure (IR), and DSS have differential effects in A53T and A53T-L444P mice and whether these effects are associated with alterations in the gut microbiome. PQ and PQ + IR have differential effects in A53T and A53T-L444P mice. In contrast, effects of DSS are only seen in A53T-L444P mice. Exposure and genotype modulate the relationship between the gut microbiome and behavioral performance. The gut microbiome may be an important mediator of how environmental exposures or genetic mutations yield behavioral and cognitive impacts."

    "title": "Women with Gaucher Disease.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is an inherited disorder in which there is a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, which leads to the accumulation of glucosylceramide. Although much scientific evidence is now available, there is still limited data on the impact on the different life stages of women with this disease. Among other alterations, a delay in menarche has been described, although it has not been related to fertility problems. Menorrhagia is relatively frequent, being related to the presence of thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopathies or coagulation disorders. On the other hand, pregnancy planning is an increasingly frequent concern. All patients should undergo genetic counseling, and it is important to monitor the appearance or worsening of organomegaly, bone and hematologic abnormalities to establish clinical and therapeutic recommendations. Management during the puerperium will depend on the evolution of gestation, and, during the lactation period, the potential appearance of bone complications should be assessed. An early onset of menopause, compared to the general population, has also been described, which may accelerate the development of osteopenia. Finally, although the usual screening protocols for neoplasms are currently being performed, it is recommended to watch for early signs of liver or renal neoplasms when examining the results of imaging tests performed during evaluations for this disease."

    "title": "Glucosylceramide accumulation in microglia triggers STING-dependent neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in mice.",
    "abstract": "Mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) are responsible for Gaucher disease (GD) and are considered the strongest genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). GCase deficiency leads to extensive accumulation of glucosylceramides (GCs) in cells and contributes to the neuropathology of GD, PD, and LBD by triggering chronic neuroinflammation. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which GC accumulation induces neuroinflammation. We found that GC accumulation within microglia induced by pharmacological inhibition of GCase triggered STING-dependent inflammation, which contributed to neuronal loss both in vitro and in vivo. GC accumulation in microglia induced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage to the cytosol to trigger STING-dependent inflammation. Rapamycin, a compound that promotes lysosomal activity, improved mitochondrial function, thereby decreasing STING signaling. Furthermore, lysosomal damage caused by GC accumulation led to defects in the degradation of activated STING, further exacerbating inflammation mediated by microglia. Thus, limiting STING activity may be a strategy to suppress neuroinflammation caused by GCase deficiency."

    "title": "Comparative study of enriched dopaminergic neurons from siblings with Gaucher disease discordant for parkinsonism.",
    "abstract": "Inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patient samples have significantly enhanced our ability to model neurological diseases. Comparative studies of dopaminergic (DA) neurons differentiated from iPSCs derived from siblings with Gaucher disease discordant for parkinsonism provides a valuable avenue to explore genetic modifiers contributing to <i>GBA1</i>-associated parkinsonism in disease-relevant cells. However, such studies are often complicated by the inherent heterogeneity in differentiation efficiency among iPSC lines derived from different individuals. To address this technical challenge, we devised a selection strategy to enrich dopaminergic (DA) neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). A neomycin resistance gene <i>(neo)</i> was inserted at the C-terminus of the <i>TH</i> gene following a T2A self-cleavage peptide, placing its expression under the control of the <i>TH</i> promoter. This allows for TH+ DA neuron enrichment through geneticin selection. This method enabled us to generate comparable, high-purity DA neuron cultures from iPSC lines derived from three sisters that we followed for over a decade: one sibling is a healthy individual, and the other two have Gaucher disease (GD) with <i>GBA1</i> genotype N370S/c.203delC+R257X (p.N409S/c.203delC+p.R296X). Notably, the younger sister with GD later developed Parkinson disease (PD). A comprehensive analysis of these high-purity DA neurons revealed that although GD DA neurons exhibited decreased levels of glucocerebrosidase (GCase), there was no substantial difference in GCase protein levels or lipid substrate accumulation between DA neurons from the GD and GD/PD sisters, suggesting that the PD discordance is related to of other genetic modifiers."

This study aimed to further understand the correlation between clinical phenotypes and genotypes in GD patients through a retrospective analysis of 20 cases in Shanxi Bethune Hospital, including their clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, enzyme studies, and genetic results. Among the 20 GD patients, 16 were classified as Type Ⅰ GD with a median age of diagnosis of 24 years, and 4 were classified as Type Ⅲ GD with a median age of diagnosis of 19 years. All patients exhibited splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia, with 16 patients showing skeletal imaging changes, and 5 of them presenting with bone pain symptoms. Genetic analysis revealed 15 distinct mutations, predominantly missense mutations, with L483P being the most prevalent (35.7%), followed by V414L, L303I, and F252I. Mutation sites were predominantly located in exon 7. Noteworthy findings included the first report of the S310G mutation by our research group and the first occurrence of the K196R mutation in the Chinese population. Additionally, the N227S mutation was implicated in a potential association with neuropathy. Despite advancements, Uncertainties still exist in the correlation between clinical phenotypes and genotypes in GD patients."

    "abstract": "High sustained anti-rhGAA antibody titers (HSAT; ≥12,800) are directly linked to reduced efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and subsequent clinical deterioration in infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD). We have previously demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of a bortezomib-based immune-tolerance induction (ITI) regimen (bortezomib, rituximab, methotrexate, and IVIG) in eliminating HSAT. Here, we describe two IOPD cases (patients 6 and 8) who developed HSAT at 8 and 10 weeks on ERT despite transient low-dose methotrexate ITI administration in the ERT-naïve setting and were treated with a bortezomib-based ITI regimen, and we compare their courses to a series of six historical patients (patients 1-5, and 7) with a similar presentation who exemplify our evolving approach to treatment. In total, patients 6 and 8 received 16 and 8 doses of bortezomib (4 doses=1 cycle) respectively reducing titers from 25,600 to seronegative, but differences in the course of their therapy were instructive regarding the optimal approach to initial treatment of HSAT; specifically, patient 6 was treated initially with only a single course of bortezomib rescue therapy, while patient 8 received two back-to-back courses. Patient 8 received IVIG therapy throughout the immunosuppression whereas patient 6 received IVIG therapy and was switched to subcutaneous IgG replacement. Patient 6 had a transient reduction in anti-rhGAA antibodies, after receiving a single initial cycle of bortezomib, but had a recurrence of high anti-rhGAA antibody titer after 160 weeks that required 3 additional cycles of bortezomib to ultimately achieve tolerance. In contrast, patient 8 achieved tolerance after being given two consecutive cycles of bortezomib during their initial treatment and had B cell recovery by week 54. Since the reduction in anti-rhGAA antibodies, both patients are doing well clinically, and have decreasing ALT, AST, and CK. No major infections leading to interruption of treatment were observed in either patient. The bortezomib-based ITI was safe and well-tolerated, and patients continue to receive ERT at 40 mg/kg/week. These case studies and our previous experience suggest that to achieve an effective reduction of anti-rhGAA antibodies in the setting of HSAT, bortezomib should be initiated at the earliest sign of high anti-rhGAA antibodies with a minimum of two consecutive cycles as shown in the case of patient 8. It is important to note that, despite initiation of ERT at age 2.3 weeks, patient 8 quickly developed HSAT. We recommend close monitoring of anti-rhGAA antibodies and early intervention with ITI as soon as significantly elevated anti-rhGAA antibody titers are noted."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disease that leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside within reticuloendothelial cells, haematological, neurological, skeletal and abdominal organs. These clinical manifestations are common to all types of GD, but categorization depends on the absence of neurological involvement (type I) or its presence (type II and III). Cardiac involvement is rare and only reported in few cases, where valvular and aortic calcifications were associated with type IIIc. Other cardiac manifestations, such as constrictive pericarditis, pulmonary hypertension, myocardial infiltration, and restrictive cardiomyopathy, had also been reported. We report a case of a 72-year-old patient with known type 1 GD who presented with a sudden syncope during exercise. He reported also an exercise intolerance evolving for three months. Echocardiography found concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with segmental hypokinesis, bi-atrial enlargement, and mildly reduced ejection fraction. Mitral flow was in favour of grade II diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressure. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) showed interstitial fibrosis in the basal infero-septal wall, probably due to the myocardial infiltration of GD. Due to the lack of echocardiographic and CMR hallmarks of cardiac GD, we conducted a literature review on similar findings. This case illustrates the importance of non-invasive cardiac imaging in the diagnosis, prognosis and management of cardiac manifestations of GD."

The synthesized iminosugars were grafted by copper-free strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition onto phosphorus dendrimers. The hexavalent and dodecavalent pyrrolidines were evaluated as β-glucocerebrosidase inhibitors. The level of inhibition suggests that monofluorocyclooctatriazole group may contribute to the affinity for the protein leading to potent multivalent inhibitors. Docking studies were carried out to rationalize these results. Then, the iminosugars clusters were evaluated as pharmacological chaperones in Gaucher patients' fibroblasts. An increase in β-glucocerebrosidase activity was observed with hexavalent and dodecavalent pyrrolidines at concentrations as low as 1 µM and 0.1 µM, respectively. These iminosugar clusters constitute the first example of multivalent pyrrolidines acting as pharmacological chaperones against Gaucher disease."

The atypical clinical manifestations of Gaucher disease often contribute to delays in diagnosis and treatment. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 4-month-old female infant admitted to the Department of Pediatrics with progressive hepatosplenomegaly since birth. Concurrently, she had cytomegalovirus infection and sensory neurological hearing loss. Gaucher disease diagnosis was confirmed through whole-exome sequencing and validated by a glucocerebrosidase activity test, revealing the mutation site as c.1448T>C. This report outlines the differential diagnosis process for Gaucher disease in this infant before confirmation, contributing valuable insights for early diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS Our case underscores the challenge of diagnosing Gaucher disease due to its atypical presentation. The coexistence of cytomegalovirus infection complicates the clinical picture, emphasizing the need for careful differential diagnosis. Unfortunately, delayed diagnosis is all too common in rare diseases like Gaucher disease, even when the clinical presentation is seemingly typical. This highlights the need for increased awareness and education within the medical community to facilitate early recognition, which is essential for prompt intervention and improved outcomes. This report contributes valuable clinical and genetic information, aiming to enhance awareness and deepen the understanding of Gaucher disease in infants, particularly those with concurrent infections."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive ailment resulting from glucocerebrosidase deficiency caused by a mutation in the GBA1 gene, leading to multi-organ problems in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. In China, GD is extremely uncommon and has a lower incidence rate than worldwide. In this study, we report the case of an adult male with an enlarged spleen for 13 years who presented with abdominal distension, severe loss of appetite and weight, reduction of the three-line due to hypersplenism, frequent nosebleeds, and bloody stools. Regrettably, the unexpected discovery of splenic pathology suggestive of splenic Gaucher disease was only made after a splenectomy due to a lack of knowledge about rare disorders. Our patient's delayed diagnosis may have been due to the department where he was originally treated, but it highlights the need for multidisciplinary consultation in splenomegaly of unknown etiology. We then investigated the patient's clinical phenotypes and gene mutation features using genetically phenotypical analysis. The analysis of the GBA1 gene sequence indicated that the patient carried a compound heterozygous mutation consisting of two potentially disease-causing mutations: c.907C > A (p. Leu303Ile) and c.1448 T > C (p. Leu483Pro). While previous research has linked the p. Leu483Pro mutation site to neurologic GD phenotypes (GD2 and GD3), the patients in this investigation were identified as having non-neuronopathic GD1. The other mutation, p. Leu303Ile, is a new GD-related mutation not indexed in PubMed that enriches the GBA1 gene mutation spectrum. Biosignature analysis has shown that both mutations alter the protein's three-dimensional structure, which may be a pathogenic mechanism for GD1 in this patient."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD, OMIM 230800) is one of the most common lysosomal disorders, being caused by the deficient activity of the enzyme acid β-glucocerebrosidase (Gcase). Three clinical forms of Gaucher's disease (GD) are classified based on neurological involvement. Type 1 (GD1) is non-neuronopathic, while types 2 (GD2) and 3 (GD3) are neuronopathic forms. Gcase catalyzes the conversion of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) into ceramide and glucose. As GlcCer accumulates in lysosomal macrophages, it undergoes deacylation to become glycosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), which has shown to be a useful and reliable biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of treated and untreated patients with GD. Multiple myeloma (MM) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death among patients with GD and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a non-neoplastic condition that can be a telltale sign of a B clonal proliferation caused by the chronic activation of B cells. This study aimed to quantify Lyso-Gb1 levels in dried blood spots (DBS) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as biomarkers for Gaucher disease (GD) and discuss the association of this biomarker with other clinical parameters. This is a mixed-methods study incorporating both cross-sectional and longitudinal elements within a cohort design with a convenience-sampling strategy. Data collection took place from January 2012 to March 2023. Lyso-Gb1 extraction from DBS involved the use of a methanol-acetonitrile-water mixture, followed by incubation and centrifugation. Analysis was performed using UPLC-MS/MS with MassLynx software version 4.2 and the control group for the DBS measurements included general newborns. CSF Lyso-Gb1 was extracted using ethyl acetate, analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS with a calibration curve, and expressed in pmol/L. Lysosomal activity in CSF was assessed by measuring chitotriosidase (Cht), and other lysosomal enzyme activities were assessed as previously described in the literature. Patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) were used as controls. Thirty-two treated patients (twenty-nine GD1 and three GD3, all on ERT except for one GD type on SRT with eliglustat) and three untreated patients (one GD1, one GD2, and one GD3) were included. When analyzing only the treated GD1 group, a significant correlation was found between lyso-Gb1 and age (rho = -0.447, <i>p</i> = 0.001), ChT, and IgG levels (rho = 0.73, <i>p</i> < 0.001; and rho = 0.36, <i>p</i> = 0.03, respectively). Five GD1 patients (three females, mean age 40 years) also had their CSF collected and analyzed. The average measurement of lyso-Gb1 in CSF was 94 pmol/L (range: 57.1-157.9 pmol/L) versus <6.2 pmol/L in the control group (MLD). This is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that lyso-Gb1 has been associated with IgG levels. While this finding reflects a risk for MGUS or MM and not only chronic plasma B-cell activation, it still requires further studies. Moreover, the analysis of CSF lyso-Gb1 levels in GD1 patients was demonstrated to be significantly higher than the control group. This raises the hypothesis that CSF lyso-Gb1 may serve as a valuable indicator for neurological involvement in GD, providing insights into the potential implications for neurological manifestations in GD, including GD1. The correlation between lyso-Gb1 and ChT levels in treated GD1 patients further underscores the interconnectedness of lysosomal markers and their relevance in monitoring."

    "abstract": "Mutations in the β-glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) gene do cause the lysosomal storage Gaucher disease (GD) and are among the most frequent genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). So far, studies on both neuronopathic GD and PD primarily focused on neuronal manifestations, besides the evaluation of microglial and astrocyte implication. White matter alterations were described in the central nervous system of paediatric type 1 GD patients and were suggested to sustain or even play a role in the PD process, although the contribution of oligodendrocytes has been so far scarcely investigated. We exploited a system to study the induction of central myelination in vitro, consisting of Oli-neu cells treated with dibutyryl-cAMP, in order to evaluate the expression levels and function of β-glucocerebrosidase during oligodendrocyte differentiation. Conduritol-B-epoxide, a β-glucocerebrosidase irreversible inhibitor was used to dissect the impact of β-glucocerebrosidase inactivation in the process of myelination, lysosomal degradation and α-synuclein accumulation in vitro. Moreover, to study the role of β-glucocerebrosidase in the white matter in vivo, we developed a novel mouse transgenic line in which β-glucocerebrosidase function is abolished in myelinating glia, by crossing the Cnp1-cre mouse line with a line bearing loxP sequences flanking Gba1 exons 9-11, encoding for β-glucocerebrosidase catalytic domain. Immunofluorescence, western blot and lipidomic analyses were performed in brain samples from wild-type and knockout animals in order to assess the impact of genetic inactivation of β-glucocerebrosidase on myelination and on the onset of early neurodegenerative hallmarks, together with differentiation analysis in primary oligodendrocyte cultures. Here we show that β-glucocerebrosidase inactivation in oligodendrocytes induces lysosomal dysfunction and inhibits myelination in vitro. Moreover, oligodendrocyte-specific β-glucocerebrosidase loss-of-function was sufficient to induce in vivo demyelination and early neurodegenerative hallmarks, including axonal degeneration, α-synuclein accumulation and astrogliosis, together with brain lipid dyshomeostasis and functional impairment. Our study sheds light on the contribution of oligodendrocytes in GBA1-related diseases and supports the need for better characterizing oligodendrocytes as actors playing a role in neurodegenerative diseases, also pointing at them as potential novel targets to set a brake to disease progression."

To date, a crucial part of diagnosing LSDs is measuring enzymatic activity in leucocytes, plasma, or dried blood spots (DBS). Here, we present results from a proof-of-principle study, evaluating an innovative digital microfluidics (DMF) platform, referred to as SEEKER®, that can measure the activity of the following four lysosomal enzymes from DBS: α-L-iduronidase (IDUA) for mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I), acid α-glucosidase (GAA) for Pompe disease, β-glucosidase (GBA) for Gaucher disease, and α-galactosidase A (GLA) for Fabry disease. Over 900 DBS were analysed from newborns, children, and adults. DMF successfully detected known patients with MPS I, Pompe disease, and Gaucher disease, and known males with Fabry disease. This is the first demonstration of this multiplexed DMF platform for identification of patients with LSDs in a specialised diagnostic enzyme laboratory environment. We conclude that this DMF platform is relatively simple, high-throughput, and could be readily accommodated into a specialised laboratory as a first-tier test for MPS I, Pompe disease, and Gaucher disease for all patients, and Fabry disease for male patients only."

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily known for typical motor features that arise due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. However, the precise molecular aetiology of the disease is still unclear. Several cellular pathways have been linked to Parkinson's disease, including the autophagy-lysosome pathway, α-synuclein aggregation and mitochondrial function. Interestingly, the mechanistic link between GBA1, the gene that encodes for lysosomal β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), and Parkinson's disease lies in the interplay between GCase functions in the lysosome and mitochondria. GCase mutations alter mitochondria-lysosome contact sites. In the lysosome, reduced GCase activity leads to glycosphingolipid build-up, disrupting lysosomal function and autophagy, thereby triggering α-synuclein accumulation. Additionally, α-synuclein aggregates reduce GCase activity, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of lysosomal dysfunction and α-synuclein accumulation. GCase can also be imported into the mitochondria, where it promotes the integrity and function of mitochondrial complex I. Thus, GCase mutations that impair its normal function increase oxidative stress in mitochondria, the compartment where dopamine is oxidized. In turn, the accumulation of oxidized dopamine adducts further impairs GCase activity, creating a second cycle of GCase dysfunction. The oxidative state triggered by GCase dysfunction can also induce mitochondrial DNA damage which, in turn, can cause dopaminergic cell death. In this review, we highlight the pivotal role of GCase in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis and discuss promising examples of GCase-based therapeutics, such as gene and enzyme replacement therapies, small molecule chaperones and substrate reduction therapies, among others, as potential therapeutic interventions."

This report aims to present a case of type IIIb GD in a Chinese child with a focus on the manifestation of hearing loss and the importance of early diagnosis and monitoring. The patient underwent a routine physical examination upon admission, followed by CT scans of the chest and abdomen, MRI of the brain, and bone marrow smear examination. The patient's GBA enzyme activity, Lyso-GL-1 levels, and GBA gene expression were analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and next-generation sequencing technology. Finally, auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing was conducted. This report presented a case of a Chinese boy with hematological manifestations as the first symptom, followed by hepatosplenomegaly, and the bilateral femurs showed obvious Erlenmeyer flask-like changes. Combined with GBA enzyme activity, Lyso-GL-1 and GBA genotype analysis results, the boy was initially diagnosed as type I GD. During the follow-up, the boy developed nystagmus, bilateral ABR V wave threshold increased, V/I amplitude ratio <0.5, accompanied by delayed growth and development, and finally diagnosed as type IIIb. This case suggests the necessity of neuropathy monitoring in patients with type I GD during the early stages of the disease. This includes EEG, neuro-ophthalmological examination, and auditory function assessment, which can help reflect the progression of neuropathy and facilitate the early diagnosis of type III GD."

    "abstract": "Natural Killer T (NKT) cells are distinct innate lymphocytes that recognize lipid antigens in the context of nonpolymorphic molecule CD1d. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy wherein malignant plasma cells express CD1d and are sensitive to lysis by NKT cells. Progressive malignancy in MM is characterized by NKT cell dysfunction. Several studies have tried to harness the anti-tumor properties of NKT cells in MM to mediate tumor regression. NKT cells are also attractive targets for approaches at immune redirection in MM with chimeric-antigen receptor NKT (CAR-NKT) and bispecific antibodies. In addition to the commonly studied invariant-NKT (iNKT) cells, MM patients often also exhibit alterations in type-II NKT cells and their ligands. In patients and mouse models with Gaucher disease (GD), an inherited lipid-storage disorder with markedly increased risk for MM, distinct type-II NKT cells exhibit a T-follicular helper (NKT-TFH) phenotype and provide help to lipid-specific B cells. Chronic immune activation in this setting eventually sets the stage for malignancy, which can be targeted in both mouse models and GD patients by reducing the underlying antigen. NKT cells are thus integrally linked to MM pathogenesis and an attractive target for MM immunotherapy."

    "abstract": "The phase III double-blind PROPEL study compared the novel two-component therapy cipaglucosidase alfa + miglustat (cipa + mig) with alglucosidase alfa + placebo (alg + pbo) in adults with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). This ongoing open-label extension (OLE; NCT04138277) evaluates long-term safety and efficacy of cipa + mig. Outcomes include 6-min walk distance (6MWD), forced vital capacity (FVC), creatine kinase (CK) and hexose tetrasaccharide (Hex4) levels, patient-reported outcomes and safety. Data are reported as change from PROPEL baseline to OLE week 52 (104 weeks post-PROPEL baseline). Of 118 patients treated in the OLE, 81 continued cipa + mig treatment from PROPEL (cipa + mig group; 61 enzyme replacement therapy [ERT] experienced prior to PROPEL; 20 ERT naïve) and 37 switched from alg + pbo to cipa + mig (switch group; 29 ERT experienced; 8 ERT naive). Mean (standard deviation [SD]) change in % predicted 6MWD from baseline to week 104 was + 3.1 (8.1) for cipa + mig and - 0.5 (7.8) for the ERT-experienced switch group, and + 8.6 (8.6) for cipa + mig and + 8.9 (11.7) for the ERT-naïve switch group. Mean (SD) change in % predicted FVC was - 0.6 (7.5) for cipa + mig and - 3.8 (6.2) for the ERT-experienced switch group, and - 4.8 (6.5) and - 3.1 (6.7), respectively, in ERT-naïve patients. CK and Hex4 levels improved in both treatment groups by week 104 with cipa + mig treatment. Three patients discontinued the OLE due to infusion-associated reactions. No new safety signals were identified. Cipa + mig treatment up to 104 weeks was associated with overall maintained improvements (6MWD, biomarkers) or stabilization (FVC) from baseline with continued durability, and was well tolerated, supporting long-term benefits for patients with LOPD.Trial registration number: NCT04138277; trial start date: December 18, 2019."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is mainly caused by glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme deficiency due to genetic variations in the <i>GBA1</i> gene leading to the toxic accumulation of sphingolipids in various organs, which causes symptoms such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and neurological manifestations. GD is clinically classified into the non-neuronopathic type 1, and the acute and chronic neuronopathic forms, types 2 and 3, respectively. In addition to the current approved GD medications, the repurposing of Ambroxol (ABX) has emerged as a prospective enzyme enhancement therapy option showing its potential to enhance mutated GCase activity and reduce glucosylceramide accumulation in GD-affected tissues of different <i>GBA1</i> genotypes. The variability in response to ABX varies across different variants, highlighting the diversity in patients' therapeutic outcomes. Its oral availability and safety profile make it an attractive option, particularly for patients with neurological manifestations. Clinical trials are essential to explore further ABX's potential as a therapeutic medication for GD to encourage pharmaceutical companies' investment in its development. This review highlights the potential of ABX as a pharmacological chaperone therapy for GD and stresses the importance of addressing response variability in clinical studies to improve the management of this rare and complex disorder."

Database search and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Twenty-one studies (182 patients) were included. The evidence was low in quality. Variable responses to Ambroxol were observed. Response rates were 36% and 55% in two studies reporting on type 1 GD. One study found a 22% response rate in type 2 GD, whereas another study found 29% of patients with type 3 GD reported neurological improvements. No severe adverse events were reported in the literature, with mild and reversible side effects reported. Varying response rates are to be expected (29%-100%) when treating neurological manifestations. Varying degrees of symptomatic improvement for the treatment of GD were noted in the literature.

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of iron homeostasis causes iron-mediated cell death, recently described as ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is reported in many chronic diseases, such as hepatic cancer, renal, and cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, atherosclerosis). However, there is a notable scarcity of research studies in the existing literature that explore treatments capable of preventing ferroptosis. Additionally, as far as the author is aware, there is currently no established model for studying ferroptosis within cardiovascular cells, which would be essential for assessing metal-chelating molecules with the potential ability to inhibit ferroptosis and their application in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, a smooth muscle cell-based ferroptosis model is developed upon the inhibition of the system X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter by erastin associated or not with Fe(III) overload, and its rescue upon the introduction of well-known iron chelators, deferoxamine and deferiprone. We showed that erastin alone decreased the intracellular concentration of glutathione (GSH) without affecting peroxidized lipid concentrations. Erastin with ferric citrate was able to decrease intracellular GSH and induce lipid peroxidation after overnight incubation. Only deferiprone was able to rescue the cells from ferroptosis by decreasing lipid peroxidation via iron ion chelation in a 3:1 molar ratio."

However, literature on GD with concomitant nonimmune hemolytic anemia is scarce. A 1-year 6-month-old male child presented in 2018 with complaints of palpable mass in left upper abdomen, fever, cough, and vomiting. On examination, he had pallor, hepatosplenomegaly of 2 cm and 8 cm below costal margin, respectively. A clinical diagnosis of hemolytic anemia was suspected. Complete blood count revealed Hb---6.7 g/dL, TLC---8.9 × 10 3 /μL, platelet count---180 × 10 3 /μL. Peripheral smear showed predominantly microcytic hypochromic anemia with moderate degree of anisocytosis, many nucleated red blood cells, few schistocytes, polychromatophils and corrected reticulocyte count 7.89%. S. Bilirubin was 1.1 mg/dL. Hb high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of the child and his parents was within normal limit. Hematological work up revealed negative results for direct Coombs' test, osmotic fragility test, and sickling test. Test for Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency was positive (39 units/trillion RBC, normal 146--376). He was transfused intermittently and given steroids to manage his anemia. He was on regular follow up during which his blood counts revealed persistent anemia and thrombocytopenia. In view of this, bone marrow was performed to exclude myelofibrosis. Aspirate smears were cellular and showed normoblastic erythroid hyperplasia. Numerous large histiocytes with basophilic fibrillary cytoplasm exhibiting \"crumpled tissue paper\" appearance were seen. Similar findings were seen on bone marrow trephine biopsy. Genetic testing revealed pathogenic variations in the GBA gene. Beta glucosidase enzyme levels were low while chitotriosidase was raised (1109.19 nmol/hr/mL). A final diagnosis of G6PD with GD was made.

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a prevalent lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) that significantly impacts individuals' lives. However, the exorbitant prices of GD medications pose a major hurdle in ensuring widespread availability and affordability of treatment in India. The country heavily relies on imported medications, leading to high costs and limited access for many patients. This article aims to address this issue by advocating for the establishment of indigenous manufacturing capabilities for GD medicines in India. Through an examination of the current landscape of GD treatment, including the availability, affordability, and challenges associated with imported medications, this article highlights the urgent need for localized production. By focusing on the potential benefits of indigenous manufacturing, such as reduced costs, increased accessibility, and enhanced availability, this research aims to provide insights and recommendations to policymakers, healthcare professionals, and relevant stakeholders. The findings underscore the importance of developing domestic manufacturing capabilities to address the affordability and accessibility challenges faced by GD patients in India. The research also emphasizes the potential positive impact on the healthcare system, the pharmaceutical industry, and the overall well-being of individuals with GD. Ultimately, this article seeks to stimulate discussions and actions towards creating a sustainable framework for indigenous manufacturing of GD medicines, thereby improving the lives of those affected by this rare and debilitating condition."

Defective autophagic degradation of unwanted cellular constituents is associated with several pathologies, including loss of normal protein homeostasis, particularly of α-synuclein, and innate immune dysfunction. The latter is observed both peripherally and centrally in PD and GD. Here, we will discuss the mechanistic links between autophagy and immune dysregulation, and the possible role of these pathologies in communication between the gut and brain in these disorders. Recent work in a fly model of neuronopathic GD (nGD) revealed intestinal autophagic defects leading to gastrointestinal dysfunction and immune activation. Rapamycin treatment partially reversed the autophagic block and reduced immune activity, in association with increased survival and improved locomotor performance. Alterations in the gut microbiome are a critical driver of neuroinflammation, and studies have revealed that eradication of the microbiome in nGD fly and mouse models of PD ameliorate brain inflammation. Following these observations, lysosomal-autophagic pathways, innate immune signalling and microbiome dysbiosis are discussed as potential therapeutic targets in PD and GD.

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive condition associated with clinical features such as splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and bone abnormalities. Three clinical forms of GD have been defined based on the absence (type 1, GD1) or presence (types 2 and 3) of neurological signs. Early diagnosis can reduce the likelihood of severe, often irreversible complications. The aim of this study was to validate the ability of factors from the Gaucher Earlier Diagnosis Consensus (GED-C) scoring system to discriminate between patients with GD1 and controls using real-world data from electronic patient medical records from Maccabi Healthcare Services, Israel's second-largest state-mandated healthcare provider. We applied the GED-C scoring system to 265 confirmed cases of GD and 3445 non-GD controls matched for year of birth, sex, and socioeconomic status identified from 1998 to 2022. The analyses were based on two databases: (1) all available data and (2) all data except free-text notes. Features from the GED-C scoring system applicable to GD1 were extracted for each individual. Patients and controls were compared for the proportion of the specific features and overall GED-C scores. Decision tree and random forest models were trained to identify the main features distinguishing GD from non-GD controls. The GED-C scoring distinguished individuals with GD from controls using both databases. Decision tree models for the databases showed good accuracy (0.96 [95% CI 0.95-0.97] for Database 1; 0.95 [95% CI 0.94-0.96] for Database 2), high specificity (0.99 [95% CI 0.99-1]) for Database 1; 1.0 [95% CI 0.99-1] for Database 2), but relatively low sensitivity (0.53 [95% CI 0.46-0.59] for Database 1; 0.32 [95% CI 0.25-0.38]) for Database 2). The clinical features of splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia (< 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), and hyperferritinemia (300-1000 ng/mL) were found to be the three most accurate classifiers of GD in both databases. In this analysis of real-world patient data, certain individual features of the GED-C score discriminate more successfully between patients with GD and controls than the overall score. An enhanced diagnostic model may lead to earlier, reliable diagnoses of Gaucher disease, aiming to minimize the severe complications associated with this disease."

Glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitors reduce GSL production and have potential to treat multiple GSL storage diseases. AL01211 is a potent, oral GCS inhibitor being developed for the treatment of Type 1 Gaucher disease and Fabry disease. AL01211 has minimal central nervous system penetration, allowing for treatment of peripheral organs without risking CNS-associated adverse effects. AL01211 was evaluated in a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study with single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) arms, to determine safety, pharmacokinetics including food effect, and pharmacodynamic effects on associated GSLs. In the SAD arm, AL01211 showed a Tmax of approximately 3.5 hours, mean clearance (CL/F) of 130.1 L/h, and t<sub>1/2</sub> of 39.3 hours. Consuming a high-fat meal prior to dose administration reduced exposures 3.5-5.5-fold, indicating a food effect. In the MAD arm, AL01211 had an approximately 2-fold accumulation, reaching steady-state levels by 10 days. Increasing exposure inversely correlated with a decrease in GSL with plasma glucosylceramide and globotriacylceramide reduction from baseline levels, reaching 78% and 52% by day 14, respectively. AL01211 was generally well-tolerated with no AL01211 associated serious adverse events, thus supporting its further clinical development."

Since phenotypes of murine models of GD often differ from those in patients, the careful characterization of <i>Gba1</i> mutant mice is necessary to establish their ability to model GD. We performed side-by-side comparative biochemical and pathologic analyses of four murine <i>Gba1</i> models with genotypes L444P/L444P (p.L483P/p.L483P), L444P/null, D409H/D409H (p.D448H/p.D448H) and D409H/null, along with matched wildtype mice, all with the same genetic background and cage conditions. All mutant mice exhibited significantly lower glucocerebrosidase activity (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and higher glucosylsphingosine levels than wildtype, with the lowest glucocerebrosidase and the highest glucosylsphingosine levels in mice carrying a null allele. Although glucocerebrosidase activity in L444P and D409H mice was similar, D409H mice showed more lipid accumulation. No Gaucher or storage-like cells were detected in any of the <i>Gba1</i> mutant mice. Quantification of neuroinflammation, dopaminergic neuronal loss, alpha-synuclein levels and motor behavior revealed no significant findings, even in aged animals. Thus, while the models may have utility for testing the effect of different therapies on enzymatic activity, they did not recapitulate the pathological phenotype of patients with GD, and better models are needed."

    "abstract": "Rare diseases are particular pathological conditions affecting a limited number of people and few drugs are known to be effective as therapeutic treatment. Gaucher disease, caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, belongs to this class of disorders, and it is considered the most common among the Lysosomal Storage Diseases. The two main therapeutic approaches are the Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) and the Substrate Reduction Therapy (SRT). ERT, consisting in replacing the defective enzyme by administering a recombinant enzyme, is effective in alleviating the visceral symptoms, hallmarks of the most common subtype of the disease whereas it has no effects when symptoms involve CNS, since the recombinant protein is unable to significantly cross the Blood Brain Barrier. The SRT strategy involves inhibiting glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), the enzyme responsible for the production of the associated storage molecule. The rational design of new inhibitors of GCS has been hampered by the lack of either the crystal structure of the enzyme or an in-silico model of the active site which could provide important information regarding the interactions of potential inhibitors with the target, but, despite this, interesting results have been obtained and are herein reviewed."

Homozygous or compound heterozygous GBA1 mutations cause the lysosomal storage disease Gaucher disease (GD) due to severe loss of GCase activity. Loss-of-function variants in the GBA1 gene are also the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Restoring lysosomal GCase activity represents an important therapeutic approach for GBA1-associated diseases. We hypothesized that increasing the stability of lysosomal GCase protein could correct deficient GCase activity in these conditions. However, it remains unknown how GCase stability is regulated in the lysosome. We found that cathepsin L, a lysosomal cysteine protease, cleaves GCase and regulates its stability. In support of these data, GCase protein was elevated in the brain of cathepsin L-KO mice. Chemical inhibition of cathepsin L increased both GCase levels and activity in fibroblasts from patients with GD. Importantly, inhibition of cathepsin L in dopaminergic neurons from a patient GBA1-PD led to increased GCase levels and activity as well as reduced phosphorylated α-synuclein. These results suggest that targeting cathepsin L-mediated GCase degradation represents a potential therapeutic strategy for GCase deficiency in PD and related disorders that exhibit decreased GCase activity."

Enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme/Lumizyme) has led to better outcomes, but many patients have plateaued or declined despite treatment. The second-generation ERT avalglucosidase alfa (Nexviazyme) was designed to have enhanced cellular uptake via the conjugation of additional bis-mannose-6-phosphate residues. There have been trials comparing the efficacy of alglucosidase and avalglucosidase, but there remains a need for more real-world data on patients who switched from alglucosidase to avalglucosidase. <b>Methods:</b> A chart review was conducted on <i>n</i> = 15 patients with late-onset Pompe disease followed at a single center who switched from alglucosidase to avalglucosidase and continued for at least 6 months. <b>Results:</b> A total of <i>n</i> = 8/15 patients received alglucosidase for more than 3 years prior to switching, and <i>n</i> = 7/15 received it for more than 5 years prior to switching. There were statistically significant improvements in CK, Hex4, and AST with mean differences of -104.8 U/L, -3.0 mmol/molCr, and -14.7 U/L, respectively, post-switch. 6-Minute Walk Test; comfortable gait speed; Gait, Stairs, Gower, Chair; and Quick Motor Function Test scores improved or stabilized in most patients post-switch (<i>n</i> = 8/12, <i>n</i> = 11/12, <i>n</i> = 9/12, <i>n</i> =7/11, respectively). Of <i>n</i> = 7 patients with pulmonary function testing, <i>n</i> = 4/7 had improved upright FVC. Patient-reported outcomes revealed improvements in dyspnea (<i>n</i> = 4/4), physical function (<i>n</i> = 3/4), fatigue (<i>n</i> = 2/3), and lower back pain (<i>n</i> = 3/3). Avalglucosidase was well tolerated without infusion-associated reactions, and all <i>n</i> = 7 patients on home infusions continued receiving ERT at home.

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive chronic lung disease. Myofibroblasts play a critical role in fibrosis. These cells produce the extracellular matrix (ECM), which contributes to tissue regeneration; however, excess ECM production can cause fibrosis. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad signaling induces ECM production by myofibroblasts; therefore, the inhibition of TGF-β/Smad signaling may be an effective strategy for IPF treatment. We recently reported that miglustat, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of Smad2/3. In the present study, we examined the anti-fibrotic effects of another GCS inhibitor, eliglustat, a clinically approved drug for treating Gaucher disease type 1, in myofibroblasts derived from patient with IPF (IPF-MyoFs). We found that eliglustat exerted anti-fibrotic effects independent of GCS inhibition, and inhibited TGF-β1-induced expression of α-smooth muscle actin, a marker of fibrosis, without suppressing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2/3. RNA sequencing analysis of eliglustat-treated human lung fibroblasts identified sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) activation. Transient overexpression of SREBP2 attenuated the TGF-β1-induced increase in the expression of Smad target genes in IPF-MyoFs, and SREBP2 knockdown nullified the inhibitory effect of eliglustat on TGF-β1-induced expression of α-SMA. These results suggested that eliglustat exerts its anti-fibrotic effects through SREBP2 activation. The findings of this study may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for IPF treatment."

    "abstract": "The construct validity and interpretation of the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS<sup>®</sup>) Physical Function short form 20a (PF20a) questionnaire were evaluated for patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), a rare, autosomal recessive, progressive neuromuscular disorder treatable by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). In the phase 3 PROPEL study, adults with LOPD underwent testing of physical functioning and had PRO measurements at baseline and at weeks 12, 26, 38, and 52 while receiving experimental or standard-of-care ERT. All patients were pooled for analyses, without comparisons between treatment groups. Associations and correlations between PROMIS PF20a scores and the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), % predicted forced vital capacity (FVC), manual muscle test (MMT) of the lower extremities, Gait, Stairs, Gowers' maneuver, Chair (GSGC) score, and Rasch-built Pompe-specific Activity (R-PAct) scale were evaluated by calculating regression coefficients in linear regression models and Pearson correlation coefficients (R); patients' age, sex, race, ERT prior to study, body mass index, and study treatment were included as covariables. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of PROMIS PF20a was determined using distribution- and anchor-based methods. 123 patients received at least 1 dose of ERT. In multivariable analyses, PROMIS PF20a scores had strong correlations with R-PAct scores (R = 0.83 at baseline and R = 0.67 when evaluating changes between baseline and 52 weeks) and moderate correlations with the 6MWD (R = 0.57 at baseline and R = 0.48 when evaluating changes between baseline and 52 weeks). Moderate correlations were also observed between PROMIS PF20a and MMT (R = 0.54), GSGC (R=-0.51), and FVC (R = 0.48) at baseline. In multivariable linear regression models, associations were significant between PROMIS PF20a and 6MWD (P = 0.0006), MMT (P = 0.0034), GSGC (P = 0.0278), and R-PAct (P < 0.0001) at baseline, between PROMIS PF20a and 6MWD (P < 0.0001), FVC (P = 0.0490), and R-PAct (P < 0.0001) when combining all measurements, and between PF20a and 6MWD (P = 0.0016) and R-PAct (P = 0.0001) when evaluating changes in scores between baseline and 52 weeks. The anchor-based and distribution-based MCID for a clinically important improvement for PROMIS PF20a were 2.4 and 4.2, respectively. PROMIS PF20a has validity as an instrument both to measure and to longitudinally follow physical function in patients with LOPD. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03729362.

    "title": "Glucosylceramide flippases contribute to cellular glucosylceramide homeostasis.",
    "abstract": "Lipid transport is an essential cellular process with importance to human health, disease development, and therapeutic strategies. Type IV P-type ATPases (P4-ATPases) have been identified as membrane lipid flippases by utilizing nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD)-labeled lipids as substrates. Among the 14 human type IV P-type ATPases, ATP10D was shown to flip NBD-glucosylceramide (GlcCer) across the plasma membrane. Here, we found that conversion of incorporated GlcCer (d18:1/12:0) to other sphingolipids is accelerated in cells exogenously expressing ATP10D but not its ATPase-deficient mutant. These findings suggest that 1) ATP10D flips unmodified GlcCer as well as NBD-GlcCer at the plasma membrane and 2) ATP10D can translocate extracellular GlcCer, which is subsequently converted to other metabolites. Notably, exogenous expression of ATP10D led to the reduction in cellular hexosylceramide levels. Moreover, the expression of GlcCer flippases, including ATP10D, also reduced cellular hexosylceramide levels in fibroblasts derived from patients with Gaucher disease, which is a lysosomal storage disorder with excess GlcCer accumulation. Our study highlights the contribution of ATP10D to the regulation of cellular GlcCer levels and maintaining lipid homeostasis."

We report a case of a 12-year-old female, the last born of 6 from a family with no known familial disease who presented with non-neuronopathic Gaucher disease and superimposed malaria. The disease was initially misdiagnosed as hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly but was subsequently confirmed by examination of the bone marrow smear and core. The disease was managed supportively and splenectomy was done due to worsening hematological parameters. She currently takes morphine for bone pains in addition to physiotherapy. Always HMS is a common complication in malaria endemic areas, other causes of hepatosplenomegaly need to be excluded before the diagnosis is made. Diagnosis and treatment of patients with rare conditions like GD is still a challenge in developing countries. Although splenectomy is indicated in GD, it should only be done when it is absolutely necessary."

    "abstract": "The outermost hydrophobic layer of plants, i.e. the cuticle, is mainly composed of cutin, a polyester of hydroxy fatty acids with reported eliciting and/or antimicrobial activities for some of them. By-products of the fruit processing industry (fruit pomaces), often strongly enriched in cuticular material, are therefore a potential source of bioactive compounds for crop protection against pathogen attack. We investigated the utilization of tomato and apple pomaces in the development of a cutin-based biocontrol solution against apple scab, a major apple disease caused by <i>Venturia inaequalis</i>. Several cutin monomer extracts obtained through different strategies of depolymerization and purification were first compared for their ability to induce a targeted set of defense genes in apple seedlings after foliar application. After a step of formulation, some extracts were chosen for further investigation <i>in planta</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Our results show that formulated cutin monomers could trigger a significant transcriptome reprogramming in apple plants and exhibit an antifungal effect on <i>V. inaequalis</i>. Cutin monomers-treated apple seedlings were significantly protected against infection by the apple scab agent. Altogether, our findings suggest that water-dispersed cutin monomers extracted from pomaces are potential new bio-based solutions for the control of apple scab."

    "title": "Identification of GM1-Ganglioside Secondary Accumulation in Fibroblasts from Neuropathic Gaucher Patients and Effect of a Trivalent Trihydroxypiperidine Iminosugar Compound on Its Storage Reduction.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder characterized by a dysfunction of the lysosomal glycoside hydrolase glucocerebrosidase (GCase) due to mutations in the gene GBA1, leading to the cellular accumulation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer). While most of the current research focuses on the primary accumulated material, lesser attention has been paid to secondary storage materials and their reciprocal intertwining. By using a novel approach based on flow cytometry and fluorescent labelling, we monitored changes in storage materials directly in fibroblasts derived from GD patients carrying N370S/RecNcil and homozygous L444P or R131C mutations with respect to wild type. In L444P and R131C fibroblasts, we detected not only the primary accumulation of GlcCer accumulation but also a considerable secondary increase in GM1 storage, comparable with the one observed in infantile patients affected by GM1 gangliosidosis. In addition, the ability of a trivalent trihydroxypiperidine iminosugar compound (CV82), which previously showed good pharmacological chaperone activity on GCase enzyme, to reduce the levels of storage materials in L444P and R131C fibroblasts was tested. Interestingly, treatment with different concentrations of CV82 led to a significant reduction in GM1 accumulation only in L444P fibroblasts, without significantly affecting GlcCer levels. The compound CV82 was selective against the GCase enzyme with respect to the β-Galactosidase enzyme, which was responsible for the catabolism of GM1 ganglioside. The reduction in GM1-ganglioside level cannot be therefore ascribed to a direct action of CV82 on β-Galactosidase enzyme, suggesting that GM1 decrease is rather related to other unknown mechanisms that follow the direct action of CV82 on GCase. In conclusion, this work indicates that the tracking of secondary storages can represent a key step for a better understanding of the pathways involved in the severity of GD, also underlying the importance of developing drugs able to reduce both primary and secondary storage-material accumulations in GD."

    "abstract": "Modifications of the hemoglobin (Hb) structure in regions involving the regulation of oxygen transport may lead to an increased oxygen affinity for the hemoglobin molecule and impaired oxygen delivery to the tissues. Herein, we present six patients with high-oxygen-affinity Hb variants, either in heterozygous form or in compound heterozygosity (such as heterozygosity for Hb Hiroshima, Köln, Crete, and compound heterozygosity Hb Crete with β or δβ thalassemia), in order to demonstrate the need for prompt and accurate diagnosis and enrich the limited literature due to the rarity of such cases. Hb Crete, Hb Hiroshima, and Hb Köln have distinct pathophysiologies and may result in different clinical phenotypes. In conclusion, high-oxygen-affinity hemoglobins are rare and inherited within a dominant autosomal manner, have various clinical presentations, and should always be suspected in patients with erythrocytosis. Their management (as phlebotomy or low-dose aspirin) should be based on an individualized assessment of the risk of complications, the medical history, concomitant symptoms, and quality of life."

    "abstract": "Mutations in GBA1, which encodes the lysosome enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (also referred to as acid β-glucosidase or GCase), are the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Evidence also suggests that loss of GCase activity is implicated in PD without GBA1 mutations. Consequently, therapies targeting GCase are actively being pursued as potential strategies to modify the progression of PD and related synucleinopathies. Despite this significant interest in GCase as a therapeutic target, the lack of well-characterized GCase antibodies continues to impede progress in the development of GCase-targeted therapies. This study aims to independently evaluate human GCase (hGCase) antibodies to provide recommendations for western blot, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and AlphaLISA (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay) assays. Two mouse monoclonal antibodies, hGCase-1/17 and hGCase-1/23, were raised against hGCase using imiglucerase, the recombinant enzyme developed to treat patients, as the antigen. These novel antibodies, alongside commonly used antibodies in the field, underwent evaluation in a variety of assays. The characterization of hGCase-1/17 and hGCase-1/23 using genetic models including GBA1 loss-of-function human neuroglioma H4 line and neurons differentiated from human embryonic stem cells revealed their remarkable specificity and potency in immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore, a hGCase AlphaLISA assay with excellent sensitivity, a broad dynamic range, and suitability for high throughput applications was developed using hGCase-1/17 and hGCase-1/23, which enabled a sandwich assay configuration. The hGCase immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and AlphaLISA assays utilizing hGCase-1/17 and hGCase-1/23 will not only facilitate improved investigations of hGCase biology, but can also serve as tools to assess the distribution and effectiveness of GCase-targeted therapies for PD and related synucleinopathies."

    "abstract": "The efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa for infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is limited in some patients due to the development of high and sustained antibody titers (HSAT; ≥12,800). We carried out detailed immunophenotyping of IOPD patients (n=40), including analysis of circulating cell populations by flow cytometry and plasma cytokines by multiplex array, to determine whether patients with HSAT have unique immunological characteristics compared to those with low titers (LT; <12,800). Compared to patients with LT, patients who develop HSAT were skewed toward a type 2 immune profile, with an increased frequency of Th2 cells that was positively correlated with levels of Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) and pro-inflammatory (IL-6, TNF-α, MIP-1α, MIP-1β) cytokines. B cells were increased in HSAT patients with a decreased fraction of unswitched memory B cells. Plasma GM-CSF concentrations were lower on average in HSAT patients, while CXCL11 was elevated. Finally, using principal components analysis, we derived an HSAT Signature Score that successfully stratified patients according to their antibody titers. The immune profiles revealed in this study not only identify potential biomarkers of patients that developed HSAT but also provide insights into the pathophysiology of HSAT that will ultimately lead to improved immunotherapy strategies."

    "abstract": "In the last two decades, the development of high-throughput diagnostic methods and the availability of effective treatments have increased the interest in newborn screening for lysosomal storage disorders. However, long-term follow-up experience is needed to clearly identify risks, benefits and challenges. We report our 8-year experience of screening and follow-up on about 250,000 neonates screened for four lysosomal storage diseases (Pompe disease, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, Fabry disease, Gaucher disease), using the enzyme activity assay by tandem mass spectrometry, and biomarker quantification as a second-tier test. Among the 126 positive newborns (0.051%), 51 infants were confirmed as affected (positive predictive value 40%), with an overall incidence of 1:4874. Of these, three patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease, two with neonatal-onset Gaucher disease and four with mucopolysaccharidosis type I were immediately treated. Furthermore, another four Gaucher disease patients needed treatment in the first years of life. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of newborn screening for lysosomal storage diseases. Early diagnosis and treatment allow the achievement of better patient outcomes. Challenges such as false-positive rates, the diagnosis of variants of uncertain significance or late-onset forms and the lack of treatment for neuronopathic forms, should be addressed."

    "abstract": "Diagnosing and treating rare diseases pose significant challenges within global healthcare systems due to their low prevalence and varying criteria for defining them. In Albania, the absence of a dedicated registry for rare diseases exacerbates these challenges. Recognising this gap, a retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2005 to December 2022 to analyse the incidence and prevalence of rare haematologic diseases in the country, diagnosed in the Hematology Service at the University Hospital Centre \"Mother Teresa,\" which is the sole diagnostic center for blood diseases in Albania. This study aims to provide insights into the frequency of these diseases within the adult Albanian population and seeks to underscore the critical need for improved data collection and research in this field of healthcare. The primary objective of this study is to assess the incidence and prevalence of rare hematologic diseases diagnosed at the Hematology Service of the University Hospital Centre \"Mother Teresa\" in Albania from January 2005 to December 2022. This retrospective cross-sectional study employed a descriptive study design, focusing on the analysis of rare hematologic disease incidence and prevalence. The study was conducted exclusively at the University Hospital Centre \"Mother Teresa\" in Albania, the primary diagnostic center for blood-related disorders in the country. Data collection spanned a period of 18 years, from January 2005 to December 2022, encompassing patient records. Inclusion criteria encompassed adult patients aged 15 years and older who had received diagnoses of rare hematologic diseases during the specified timeframe, without specific operational definitions applied. Non-probability convenience sampling was used, including all eligible cases identified within the study's timeframe, obviating the need for formal sample size calculation. Data were extracted from the records of the Hematology Service at the University Hospital Centre \"Mother Teresa,\" primarily using medical records containing essential patient information. Data analysis utilised software such as EXCEL 16.0 and SPSS (v. 25.0), applying descriptive statistical methods, including frequencies and percentages, to assess the incidence and prevalence of rare hematologic diseases. The study's findings were summarised and presented in a tabular format to provide a clear and concise overview of the results. Our study identified 64 cases of rare hematologic diseases among adults. Notably, primary myelofibrosis (MF) exhibited the highest incidence and prevalence rate, followed by Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) and Gaucher disease (GD) emerging as the most prevalent diagnoses after MF, with 16 and 10 cases, respectively. Several ultra-rare diseases, such as Fanconi anemia and chronic eosinophilic leukemia, were also detected, indicating a significant disease burden, while diseases such as Factor X deficiency and Niemann-Pick disease type C were exceptionally rare. Diagnosing and treating rare diseases remain formidable challenges in healthcare systems worldwide. This study underscores the need for enhanced awareness, research, and the pressing need for dedicated registries, collaborative research initiatives, and heightened attention to these conditions to enhance our understanding and management of rare hematological diseases, particularly within the Albanian healthcare context."

    "abstract": "Biomarkers are molecules that can be used to observe changes in an individual's biochemical or medical status and provide information to aid diagnosis or treatment decisions. Dysregulation in lipid metabolism in the brain is a major risk factor for many neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Thus, there is a growing interest in using lipids as biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases, with the anionic phospholipid bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate and (glyco-)sphingolipids being the most promising lipid classes thus far. In this review, we provide a general overview of lipid biology, provide examples of abnormal lysosomal lipid metabolism in neurodegenerative diseases, and discuss how these insights might offer novel and promising opportunities in biomarker development and therapeutic discovery. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of lipid biomarkers and biomarker panels in diagnosis, prognosis, and/or treatment response in the clinic."

BI-hTFR1 was actively transported across a human brain endothelial cell layer and, relative to AAV9, provided 40-50 times greater reporter expression in the CNS of human <i>TFRC</i> knock-in mice. The enhanced tropism was CNS-specific and absent in wild type mice. When used to deliver <i>GBA1</i>, mutations of which cause Gaucher disease and are linked to Parkinson's disease, BI-hTFR1 substantially increased brain and cerebrospinal fluid glucocerebrosidase activity compared to AAV9.

While neuromuscular manifestations of IOPD are well-described, central nervous system (CNS) manifestations of this disorder are far less characterized. Here we describe severe CNS-related neurological manifestations including seizures and encephalopathy in six individuals with IOPD. We identified six children with IOPD who developed CNS manifestations such as seizures and/or encephalopathy. We studied their brain magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRIs) and graded the severity of white matter hyperintensities (WMHI) using the Fazekas scale scoring system as previously published. Longitudinal cognitive measures were available from 4/6 children. All six IOPD patients (4 males/2 females) had been treated with ERT for 12-15 years. Seizures and/or encephalopathy were noted at a median age at onset of 11.9 years (range 9-15 years). All were noted to have extensive WMHI in the brain MRIs and very high Fazekas scores which preceded the onset of neurological symptoms. Longitudinal IQ scores from four of these children suggested developmental plateauing. Among a subset of IOPD patients on long-term ERT, CNS manifestations including hyperreflexia, encephalopathy and seizures may become prominent, and there is likely an association between these symptoms and significant WMHI on MRI. Further study is needed to identify risk factors for CNS deterioration among children with IOPD and develop interventions to prevent neurological decline."

Here, we further characterize results from disease-specific and general patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Adults who participated in the COMET trial receiving avalglucosidase alfa or alglucosidase alfa (both 20 mg/kg biweekly) during the 49-week double-blind treatment period were included in the analysis. Proportions of patients exceeding meaningful change thresholds at Week 49 were compared post hoc between treatment groups. PROs and their meaningful change thresholds included: Pompe Disease Severity Scale (PDSS; decrease 1.0-1.5 points), Pompe Disease Impact Scale (PDIS; decrease 1.0-1.5 points), Rasch-built Pompe-specific Activity Scale (R-PAct; change from unable to able to complete activity), 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12; physical component summary [PCS] score: increase ≥6 points, mental component summary [MCS] score: increase ≥7 points), EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L; improvement of ≥1 category), and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC; any improvement). The analysis included 99 adult patients (avalglucosidase alfa n = 50; alglucosidase alfa n = 49). Patients who received avalglucosidase alfa had significantly greater odds of achieving a meaningful change versus alglucosidase alfa for the PDSS Shortness of Breath (OR [95% CI] 11.79 [2.24; 62.18]), Fatigue/Pain (6.24 [1.20; 32.54]), Morning Headache (13.98 [1.71; 114.18]), and Overall Fatigue (5.88 [1.37; 25.11]) domains, and were significantly more likely to meet meaningful change thresholds across multiple PDSS domains (all nominal p < 0.05). A numerically greater proportion of patients in the avalglucosidase alfa group were able to complete selected activities of the R-PAct compared with the alglucosidase alfa group. Significantly greater proportions of patients who received avalglucosidase alfa achieved meaningful improvements for EQ-5D-5L usual activities dimension, EQ visual analog scale, and all four PGIC domains. The proportion of patients with improvements in SF-12 PCS and MCS was greater in the avalglucosidase alfa group versus alglucosidase alfa group, but was not significant (p > 0.05). These analyses show that avalglucosidase alfa improves multiple symptoms and aspects of daily functioning, including breathing and mobility. This supports the clinical relevance of the effects of avalglucosidase alfa on HRQoL for patients with LOPD."

    "abstract": "To assess the causal relationship between a medicinal product and a reported event, relevant information needs to be present. Information elements for assessing cases of exposure to medicinal products during pregnancy were predefined and used in a new tool to assess the quality of information. However, the extent in which the presence or absence of these predefined information elements is associated with the overall clinical quality of these cases, as evaluated by pharmacovigilance experts, remains uncertain. We aimed to validate a novel method to assess the clinical quality of information in real-world pregnancy pharmacovigilance case reports. The clinical quality of case reports regarding medicinal product exposure and pregnancy-related outcomes was appraised from spontaneous reports, literature, Teratology Information Services (UK and Switzerland), The Dutch Pregnancy Drug Register, the Gilenya pregnancy registry and the Enhanced PV programme of Novartis. Assessment was done by means of the novel standardised tool based on the presence and relevance of information, and by expert judgement. The novel tool was validated compared to the expert assessment as the gold standard expressed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves, after which the sensitivity and specificity were calculated using cross-tabulations. Inter-rater variability was determined by means of weighted Cohen's kappa. One hundred and eighty-six case reports were included. The clinical quality score as assessed by the novel method was divided into three categories with cut-off values of 45% (poor to intermediate) and 65% (intermediate to excellent). Sensitivity was 0.93 and 0.96 for poor to intermediate and intermediate to excellent, respectively. Specificity was respectively 0.52 and 0.73. Inter-rater variability was 0.65 (95% confidence interval 0.53-0.78) for the newly developed approach, and 0.40 (95% confidence interval 0.28-0.52) for the gold standard assessment. The tool described in this study using the presence and relevance of elements of information is the first designed, validated and standardised method for the assessment of the quality of information of case reports in pregnancy pharmacovigilance data. This method confers less inter-rater variability compared with a quality assessment by experts of pregnancy-related pharmacovigilance data."

A patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for HRQOL developed for type 1 GD (GD1) is not appropriate for patients with neuronopathic GD (nGD) types 2 (GD2) and 3 (GD3). In this study, we developed a new PROM for use in all GD types. We previously reported the qualitative analysis of interviews with Japanese patients with nGD, which was used to create nGD-specific PROM items. Here we evaluated the full PROM combining the type 1 questionnaire with the new nGD-specific items. Patients with confirmed GD were recruited (Association of Gaucher Disease Patients in Japan or leading doctors) for pre-testing (May 2021) or the main survey (October-December 2021). The PROM had three parts: Parts 1 and 2 were translated into Japanese from the pre-existing GD1 PROM, whereas Part 3 was newly developed. Patients (or their caregivers, where necessary) completed the PROM questionnaire on paper and returned it by mail. Mean scores were determined overall and by GD type. Inter-item correlations, content consistency (Cronbach's alpha), and test-retest reliability (Cohen's kappa; main survey only, taken 2 weeks apart) were calculated. Sixteen patients (three with GD1; six with GD2; seven with GD3) and 33 patients (nine with GD1; 13 with GD2; 11 with GD3) participated in the pre-test and main survey, respectively. All GD2 patients and one-third (6/18) of GD3 patients required caregivers to complete the questionnaire. Mean scores indicated that the burden was highest in GD2 and lowest in GD1. In the main survey, internal consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.898 overall, 0.916 for Part 3), and test-retest reliability was high for Part 3 (kappa > 0.60 for 13/16 items) but low for Part 1 (kappa < 0.60 for 12/15 items). We have developed a flexible and reliable PROM that can be tailored for use in all types of GD and propose using Parts 1 and 2 for GD1, Parts 2 and 3 for GD2, and Parts 1, 2, and 3 for GD3."

    "abstract": "People with autosomal recessive disorders often were born without awareness of the carrier status of their parents. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends screening 113 genes known to cause autosomal recessive and X-linked conditions in couples seeking to learn about their risk of having children with these disorders to have an appropriate reproductive plan. We analyzed the exome sequencing data of 1,642 unrelated Thai individuals to identify the pathogenic variant (PV) frequencies in genes recommended by ACMG. In the 113 ACMG-recommended genes, 165 PV and likely PVs in 60 genes of 559 exomes (34%, 559/1642) were identified. The carrier rate was increased to 39% when glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was added. The carrier rate was still as high as 14.7% when thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies were excluded. In addition to thalassemia, hemoglobinopathies, and G6PD deficiency, carrier frequencies of > 1% were found for Gaucher disease, primary hyperoxaluria, Pendred syndrome, and Wilson disease. Nearly 2% of the couples were at risk of having offsprings with the tested autosomal recessive conditions. Based on the study samples, the expanded carrier screening, which specifically targeted common autosomal recessive conditions in Thai individuals, will benefit clinical outcomes, regarding preconception/prenatal genetic carrier screening."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by inborn errors of metabolism. Globally, more than 27 million people are born each year, and approximately 19,000 neonates are born with lysosomal storage disease. We report a rare case of Gaucher disease in an adult female patient of non-consanguineous parents in a subtropical area of Jiangxi Province, China. This area has a high prevalence of schistosomiasis. The diagnosis of this case posed a great challenge because of the possible differential diagnoses of pancytopenia with hepatomegaly and giant splenomegaly. The key component of the patient's diagnosis was her medical history in which it was documented that her brother had died of hepatocellular carcinoma of unknown origin. We diagnosed the patient through a combination of a pathological biopsy and imaging plus the patient's medical history."

    "abstract": "Plants are increasingly used for the production of high-quality biological molecules for use as pharmaceuticals and biomaterials in industry. Plants have proved that they can produce life-saving therapeutic proteins (Elelyso™-Gaucher's disease treatment, ZMapp™-anti-Ebola monoclonal antibodies, seasonal flu vaccine, Covifenz™-SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle vaccine); however, some of these therapeutic proteins are difficult to bring to market, which leads to serious difficulties for the manufacturing companies. The closure of one of the leading companies in the sector (the Canadian biotech company Medicago Inc., producer of Covifenz) as a result of the withdrawal of investments from the parent company has led to the serious question: What is hindering the exploitation of plant-made biologics to improve health outcomes? Exploring the vast potential of plants as biological factories, this review provides an updated perspective on plant-derived biologics (PDB). A key focus is placed on the advancements in plant-based expression systems and highlighting cutting-edge technologies that streamline the production of complex protein-based biologics. The versatility of plant-derived biologics across diverse fields, such as human and animal health, industry, and agriculture, is emphasized. This review also meticulously examines regulatory considerations specific to plant-derived biologics, shedding light on the disparities faced compared to biologics produced in other systems."

    "abstract": "The association between GD and cancer has been uncertain due to ascertainment bias in previously published studies. We analyzed cancer incidence using the Maccabi Healthcare Service (MHS) electronic health records among 264 patients with GD compared to 3440 matched controls. We ascertained cancers diagnosed before and after the index date (i.e., the first documentation of GD in cases and the corresponding date for controls). Before the index date, cancers were diagnosed in 18 individuals, with 11 (4.2%) in the GD group and 7 (0.2%) in the control group. After the index date, cancers were diagnosed in 57 individuals, with 20 (7.9%) in the GD group and 37 (1.1%) in the control group, with a median follow-up of almost 13 years in both groups. The most common cancers diagnosed in GD were non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and hematological malignancies, with a clustering of diagnoses around the time of GD diagnosis. The incidence of cancers (excluding MNSC) was 4.1 (95% CI 2.2-7.1) and 0.7 (95% CI 0.4-0.9) per 1000 patient-years in the GD and control groups, respectively, with an incidence rate ratio of 6.37 (95% CI 3-12.7). Patients with GD underwent more cancer screening tests than their counterparts in the control group. While our study revealed an increased occurrence of cancers in patients with GD, this finding might be partly attributed to the more rigorous surveillance procedures employed in this patient population."

    "abstract": "Mutations in the GBA1 gene cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD) and are the greatest known genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). Communication between the gut and brain and immune dysregulation are increasingly being implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as PD. Here, we show that flies lacking the Gba1b gene, the main fly orthologue of GBA1, display widespread NF-kB signalling activation, including gut inflammation, and brain glial activation. We also demonstrate intestinal autophagic defects, gut dysfunction, and microbiome dysbiosis. Remarkably, modulating the microbiome of Gba1b knockout flies, by raising them under germ-free conditions, partially ameliorates lifespan, locomotor and immune phenotypes. Moreover, we show that modulation of the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway is detrimental to the survival of Gba1 deficient flies. We also reveal that direct stimulation of autophagy by rapamycin treatment achieves similar benefits to germ-free conditions independent of gut bacterial load. Consistent with this, we show that pharmacologically blocking autophagosomal-lysosomal fusion, mimicking the autophagy defects of Gba1 depleted cells, is sufficient to stimulate intestinal immune activation. Overall, our data elucidate a mechanism whereby an altered microbiome, coupled with defects in autophagy, drive chronic activation of NF-kB signaling in a Gba1 loss-of-function model. It also highlights that elimination of the microbiota or stimulation of autophagy to remove immune mediators, rather than prolonged immunosuppression, may represent effective therapeutic avenues for GBA1-associated disorders."

    "abstract": "Ever since the second world symposium on pulmonary hypertension (PH) held in Evian, France, in 1998, PH has been classified into five major clinical groups. Group 5 PH includes a variety of distinct conditions with unclear and/or multifactorial underlying pathologies. Management of these patients is challenging as the number of patients within these groups is often small, not all individuals with certain underlying conditions are affected by PH and patients exhibit distinct symptoms due to different underlying diseases. Studies and clinical trials in these groups are largely lacking and mostly restricted to case series and registry reports. Nonetheless, the worldwide burden of group 5 PH is estimated to be significant in terms of the prevalence of some associated diseases. Group 5 PH encompasses six subgroups, including haematological disorders (inherited and acquired chronic haemolytic anaemia and chronic myeloproliferative disorders), systemic disorders (sarcoidosis, pulmonary Langerhans's cell histiocytosis and neurofibromatosis type 1), metabolic disorders (glycogen storage diseases and Gaucher disease), chronic renal failure with or without haemodialysis, pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy and fibrosing mediastinitis."

    "abstract": "The ConcePTION project aims to improve the way medication use during pregnancy is studied. This includes exploring the possibility of developing a distributed data processing and analysis infrastructure using a common data model that could form a foundational platform for future surveillance and research. A prerequisite would be that data from various data access providers (DAPs) can be harmonised according to an agreed set of standard rules concerning the structure and content of the data. To do so, a reference framework of core data elements (CDEs) recommended for primary data studies on drug safety during pregnancy was previously developed. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of several public and private DAPs using different primary data sources focusing on multiple sclerosis, as a pilot, to map their respective data variables and definitions with the CDE recommendations framework. Four pregnancy registries (Gilenya, Novartis; Aubagio, Sanofi; the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists [OTIS]; Aubagio, Sanofi; the Dutch Pregnancy Drug Register, Lareb), two enhanced pharmacovigilance programmes (Gilenya PRIM, Novartis; MAPLE-MS, Merck Healthcare KGaA) and four Teratology Information Services (UK TIS, Jerusalem TIS, Zerifin TIS, Swiss TIS) participated in the study. The ConcePTION primary data source CDE includes 51 items covering administrative functions, the description of pregnancy, maternal medical history, maternal illnesses arising in pregnancy, delivery details, and pregnancy and infant outcomes. For each variable in the CDE, the DAPs identified whether their variables were: identical to the one mentioned in the CDE; derived; similar but with a divergent definition; or not available. The majority of the DAP data variables were either directly taken (85%, n = 305/357, range 73-94% between DAPs) or derived by combining different variables (12%, n = 42/357, range 0-24% between DAPs) to conform to the CDE variables and definitions. For very few of the DAP variables, alignment with the CDE items was not possible, either because of divergent definitions (1%, n = 3/357, range 0-2% between DAPs) or because the variables were not available (2%, n = 7/357, range 0-4% between DAPs). Data access providers participating in this study presented a very high proportion of variables matching the CDE items, indicating that alignment of definitions and harmonisation of data analysis by different stakeholders to accelerate and strengthen pregnancy pharmacovigilance safety data analyses could be feasible."

To determine whether treatment with eliglustat produces, in adult GD1 patients, ans optimal response in daily clinical practice. We designed a real-life study with 2 years of follow-up (TRAZELGA [GEE-ELI-2017-01]) to uniformly evaluate the response and adverse events to eliglustat treatment. This study, conducted in 30 patients across Spain and previously treated with other therapies, included the evaluation of safety and efficacy by assessing visceral enlargement, bone disease (DEXA and T and Z scores), concomitant treatments and adverse events, as well as a quality of life evaluation (SF-36). In addition, the quantification of classical biomarkers (chitotriosidase activity, CCL18/PARC and glucosylsphingosine (GluSph)) and new candidates for GD biomarkers (YKL-40, cathepsin S, hepcidin and lipocalin-2 determined by immunoassay) were also assessed. Non-parametric statistical analysis was performed and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Thirty patients were enrolled in the study. The median age was 41.5 years and the male-female ratio was 1.1:1. 84% of the patients had received ERT and 16% SRT as previous treatment. The most common symptoms at baseline were fatigue (42%) and bone pain (38%), no patient had a bone crisis during the study, and two years after switching, 37% had reduced their use of analgesics. Patient-reported outcomes showed a significant increase in physical function scores (p = 0.027) and physical pain scores (p = 0.010). None of the enrolled patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events, which were mild and transient in nature, mainly gastrointestinal and skin dryness. None of the biomarkers show a significant increase or decompensation after switching. CCL18/PARC (p = 0.0012), YKL-40 (p = 0.00004) and lipocalin-2 (p = 0.0155) improved after two years and GluSph after one year (p = 0.0008) and two years (p = 0.0245) of oral therapy. In summary, this real-life study, showed that eliglustat maintains stability and can improve quality of life with few side effects. Significant reductions in classic and other novel biomarkers were observed after two years of therapy."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is a rare, genetic lysosomal disorder leading to lipid accumulation and dysfunctions in multiple organs. Bone involvement is one of the most prevalent aspects of Gaucher disease. Pain, disability, and reduced quality of life remain the most frequent characteristics of bone involvement in Gaucher patients. <i>Patients and Method</i>. In this study, we will take into consideration data from 24 patients diagnosed with type 1 Gaucher disease. We followed them closely for six years in progress. At baseline, all patients started therapy with taliglucerase alfa at a mean dosage of 45 UI/kg; later, during the study, two of them switched their cure toward velaglucerase alfa. Before baseline evaluations, 12 patients had been treated with imiglucerase at variable duration times. At baseline, we performed an X-ray of long bones and the spine, and each year, different standard assessments were performed, such as bone pain, MRI of the vertebral spine and pelvis, and DEXA for bone density. Four patients left the study for various reasons, two of them at baseline and two others during year 3 (FU3). <i>Results</i>. At baseline, we had 8 children and 16 adults. The average age was 28.7 ± 16.5 SD years. The most frequent skeletal manifestations in our patients were reduction of tibial femoral space (40%), osteonecrosis (36%), and body vertebral reduction (32%). At baseline, 15 patients presented with bone pain to different degrees. Over the years, bone pain in our patients had a gradual improvement. The most dramatic bone pain improvement was seen in a patient who presented bone crises. Another impressive finding was a significant BMD improvement during six years of treatment. Our study showed a significant improvement in BMD comparing FU5 and baseline values (<i>p</i> = 0.0007). Especially children demonstrated a significant improvement in BMD (<i>p</i> = 0.00061) compared to adults (<i>p</i> = 0.3673). Mean BMD change was more indicative in switched patients (<i>p</i> = 0.0142) compared to naïve patients (<i>p</i> = 0.147). <i>Conclusions</i>. Skeletal manifestations are very different in Gaucher type 1 patients. In our study, as a result of long-term evaluations, it was noticed that the most frequent skeletal manifestation was a reduction of tibiofemoral space. Bone pain has gradually improved in all patients. Also, BMD values have been enhanced over six years of treatment, especially in children."

This deficiency results in the accumulation of its substrate, glucosylceramide (GlcCer), within lysosomes. Here, we investigated lysosomal abnormalities in fibroblasts derived from patients with GD. It is noteworthy that the cellular distribution of lysosomes and lysosomal proteolytic activity remained largely unaffected in GD fibroblasts. However, we found that lysosomal membranes of GD fibroblasts were susceptible to damage when exposed to a lysosomotropic agent. Moreover, the susceptibility of lysosomal membranes to a lysosomotropic agent could be partly restored by exogenous expression of wild-type GBA1. Here, we report that the lysosomal membrane integrity is altered in GD fibroblasts, but lysosomal distribution and proteolytic activity is not significantly altered.Key words: glucosylceramide, lysosome, Gaucher disease, lysosomotropic agent."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by the defective activity of acid β-glucosidase (GCase) which results from mutations in GBA1. Neurological forms of GD (nGD) can be generated in mice by intra-peritoneal injection of conduritol B-epoxide (CBE) which irreversibly inhibits GCase. Using this approach, a number of pathological pathways have been identified in mouse brain by RNAseq. However, unlike transcriptomics, proteomics gives direct information about protein expression which is more likely to provide insight into which cellular pathways are impacted in disease. We now perform non-targeted, mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics on brains from mice injected with 50 mg/kg body weight CBE for 13 days. Of the 5038 detected proteins, 472 were differentially expressed between control and CBE-injected mice of which 104 were selected for further analysis based on higher stringency criteria. We also compared these proteins with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified by RNAseq. Some lysosomal proteins were up-regulated as was interferon signaling, whereas levels of ion channel related proteins and some proteins associated with neurotransmitter signaling were reduced, as was cholesterol metabolism. One protein, transglutaminase 1 (TGM1), which is elevated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, was absent from the control group but was found at high levels in CBE-injected mice, and located in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in layer V of the cortex and intracellularly in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Together, the proteomics data confirm previous RNAseq data and add additional mechanistic understanding about cellular pathways that may play a role in nGD pathology."

In this study, we achieved highly efficient COL7A1 editing in primary RDEB keratinocytes and fibroblasts from 2 patients homozygous for the c.6508C>T (p.Gln2170∗) variant through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair. Three guide RNAs targeting the c.6508C>T variant or harboring sequences were delivered together with high-fidelity Cas9 as a ribonucleoprotein complex. Among them, one achieved 73% cleavage activity in primary RDEB keratinocytes and RDEB fibroblasts. Then, we treated RDEB keratinocytes and RDEB fibroblasts with this specific ribonucleoprotein complex and the corresponding donor template delivered as single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide and achieved up to 58% of genetic correction as well as type VII Collagen rescue. Finally, grafting of corrected 3-dimensional skin onto nude mice induced re-expression and normal localization of type VII Collagen as well as anchoring fibril formation at the dermal-epidermal junction 5 and 10 weeks after grafting. With this promising nonviral approach, we achieved therapeutically relevant specific gene editing that could be applicable to all variants in exon 80 of COL7A1 in primary RDEB cells."

    "abstract": "In Gaucher disease (GD), a relatively common sphingolipidosis, the mutant lysosomal enzyme acid β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), encoded by the <i>GBA1</i> gene, fails to properly hydrolyze the sphingolipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer) in lysosomes, particularly of tissue macrophages. As a result, GlcCer accumulates, which, to a certain extent, is converted to its deacylated form, glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph), by lysosomal acid ceramidase. The inability of mutant GCase to degrade GlcSph further promotes its accumulation. The amount of mutant GCase in lysosomes depends on the amount of mutant ER enzyme that shuttles to them. In the case of many mutant GCase forms, the enzyme is largely misfolded in the ER. Only a fraction correctly folds and is subsequently trafficked to the lysosomes, while the rest of the misfolded mutant GCase protein undergoes ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The retention of misfolded mutant GCase in the ER induces ER stress, which evokes a stress response known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). GD is remarkably heterogeneous in clinical manifestation, including the variant without CNS involvement (type 1), and acute and subacute neuronopathic variants (types 2 and 3). The present review discusses animal models developed to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying GD."

    "abstract": "The recently presented Azalea Hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease asserts that iron becomes sequestered, leading to a functional iron deficiency that contributes to neurodegeneration. Iron sequestration can occur by iron being bound to protein aggregates, such as amyloid β and tau, iron-rich structures not undergoing recycling (e.g., due to disrupted ferritinophagy and impaired mitophagy), and diminished delivery of iron from the lysosome to the cytosol. Reduced iron availability for biochemical reactions causes cells to respond to acquire additional iron, resulting in an elevation in the total iron level within affected brain regions. As the amount of unavailable iron increases, the level of available iron decreases until eventually it is unable to meet cellular demands, which leads to a functional iron deficiency. Normally, the lysosome plays an integral role in cellular iron homeostasis by facilitating both the delivery of iron to the cytosol (e.g., after endocytosis of the iron-transferrin-transferrin receptor complex) and the cellular recycling of iron. During a lysosomal storage disorder, an enzyme deficiency causes undigested substrates to accumulate, causing a sequelae of pathogenic events that may include cellular iron dyshomeostasis. Thus, a functional deficiency of iron may be a pathogenic mechanism occurring within several lysosomal storage diseases and Alzheimer's disease."

The first is a 56-year-old female with bone lesions, splenomegaly, hypochromic microcytic anemia and Gaucher-like cells in the bone marrow, with a final diagnosis of TI, and the second is a 69-year-old male with TI, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) that accelerated to multiple myeloma (MM) requiring treatment, bone disease and Gaucher-like cells in the bone marrow and the spleen, and heterozygoty of Gaucher disease (GD). Gaucher-like cells are difficult to differentiate from true Gaucher cells, that are the hallmark of GD suspicion. These cells are usually reported in the lymphohematopoietic system. They have been described in myeloproliferative disorders, hematological malignancies, infectious diseases, hemoglobinopathies and other hemolytic anemias. The presence of Gaucher-like cells in patients with thalassemia major has been well documented, whereas there are limited references regarding cases with thalassemia intermedia. The identification of these cells in thalassemia probably reflects the high cell turnover. The bony complications in GD and TIare not yet fully explained in the literature, and this raises the question of whether Gaucher-like cells could play a pathogenetic role in the bone disease of thalassemia, as Gaucher cells are considered to play a similar role in bone complications of GD. Moreover, given the rarity and similarity of Gaucher and Gaucher-like cells, we would like to highlight that the presence of Gaucher-like cells in the bone marrow should not be overlooked, as they might be obscuring an underlying pathology, in order to ensure that hematologists, internists and hematopathologists will be promptly and accurately diagnosed."

    "abstract": "Biallelic mutations in <i>GBA1</i> result in Gaucher disease (GD), the inherited deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. Variants in <i>GBA1</i> are also a common genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). Currently, some PD centers screen for mutant <i>GBA1</i> alleles to stratify patients who may ultimately benefit from <i>GBA1</i>-targeted therapeutics. However, accurately detecting variants, especially recombinant alleles resulting from a crossover between <i>GBA1</i> and its pseudogene, is challenging, impacting studies of both GD and <i>GBA1</i>-associated parkinsonism. Recently, the software tool Gauchian was introduced to identify <i>GBA1</i> variants from whole genome sequencing. We evaluated Gauchian in 90 Sanger-sequenced patients with GD and five <i>GBA1</i> heterozygotes. While Gauchian genotyped most patients correctly, it missed some rare or <i>de novo</i> mutations due to its limited internal database and over-reliance on intergenic structural variants. This resulted in misreported homozygosity, incomplete genotypes, and undetected recombination events, limiting Gauchian's utility in variant screening and precluding its use in diagnostics."

    "title": "Lysoglycosphingolipids have the ability to induce cell death through direct PI3K inhibition.",
    "abstract": "Sphingolipidoses are inherited metabolic disorders associated with glycosphingolipids accumulation, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation leading to severe neurological symptoms. Lysoglycosphingolipids (lysoGSLs), also known to accumulate in the tissues of sphingolipidosis patients, exhibit cytotoxicity. LysoGSLs are the possible pathogenic cause, but the mechanisms are still unknown in detail. Here, we first show that lysoGSLs are potential inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to reduce cell survival signaling. We found that phosphorylated Akt was commonly reduced in fibroblasts from patients with sphingolipidoses, including GM1/GM2 gangliosidoses and Gaucher's disease, suggesting the contribution of lysoGSLs to the pathogenesis. LysoGSLs caused cell death and decreased the level of phosphorylated Akt as in the patient fibroblasts. Extracellularly administered lysoGM1 permeated the cell membrane to diffusely distribute in the cytoplasm. LysoGM1 and lysoGM2 also inhibited the production of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-triphosphate and the translocation of Akt from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. We also predicted that lysoGSLs could directly bind to the catalytic domain of PI3K by in silico docking study, suggesting that lysoGSLs could inhibit PI3K by directly interacting with PI3K in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we revealed that the increment of lysoGSLs amounts in the brain of sphingolipidosis model mice correlated with the neurodegenerative progression. Our findings suggest that the down-regulation of PI3K/Akt signaling by direct interaction of lysoGSLs with PI3K in the brains is a neurodegenerative mechanism in sphingolipidoses. Moreover, we could propose the intracellular PI3K activation or inhibition of lysoGSLs biosynthesis as novel therapeutic approaches for sphingolipidoses because lysoGSLs should be cell death mediators by directly inhibiting PI3K, especially in neurons."

    "abstract": "Avian necrotic enteritis is an enteric disease of broiler chickens caused by certain pathogenic strains of <i>Clostridium perfringens</i> in combination with predisposing factors. A vaccine offering complete protection against the disease has not yet been commercialized. In a previous study, we produced five recombinant proteins predicted to be surface-exposed and unique to necrotic enteritis-causing <i>C. perfringens</i> and the immunogenicity of these potential vaccine candidates was assessed in broiler chickens. In the current work, the relative contribution of the antibodies raised by these putative antigens to protect broiler chickens was evaluated using an experimental necrotic enteritis induction model. Additionally, the link between the immune response elicited and the gut microbiota profiles in immunized birds subjected to infection with virulent <i>C. perfringens</i> was studied. The ELISA results showed that the IgY antibody titers in vaccinated birds on days 21 and 33 were significantly higher than those on days 7 and 14 and those in birds receiving the adjuvant alone, while the relative contribution of the specific immunity attributed to these antibodies could not be precisely determined using this experimental necrotic enteritis induction model. In addition, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that immunization of birds with recombinant proteins had a low impact on the chicken caecal microbiota."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of monogenic condition, with many characterized by an enzyme deficiency leading to the accumulation of an undegraded substrate within the lysosomes. For those LSDs, postnatal enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) represents the standard of care, but this treatment has limitations when administered only postnatally because, at that point, prenatal disease sequelae may be irreversible. Furthermore, most forms of ERT, specifically those administered systemically, are currently unable to access certain tissues, such as the central nervous system (CNS), and furthermore, may initiate an immune response. In utero enzyme replacement therapy (IUERT) is a novel approach to address these challenges evaluated in a first-in-human clinical trial for IUERT in LSDs (NCT04532047). IUERT has numerous advantages: in-utero intervention may prevent early pathology; the CNS can be accessed before the blood-brain barrier forms; and the unique fetal immune system enables exposure to new proteins with the potential to prevent an immune response and may induce sustained tolerance. However, there are challenges and limitations for any fetal procedure that involves two patients. This article reviews the current state of IUERT for LSDs, including its advantages, limitations, and potential future directions for definitive therapies."

More than 500 mutations have been reported on the GBA gene so far. In this study, we aimed to investigate more on the genotype of less known mutations through haplotype analysis to explain their disease-causing inheritance. Eight patients and three carriers from nine different families were enrolled in the study. DNA sequencing of all GBA gene's exons was performed and pathogenicity of the mutations was investigated. Using GBA gene-linked STR markers, allele segregations were determined in some families. A total of six different mutations were determined. Five and three patients were identified to carry mutations in homozygous and compound heterozygote patterns respectively, three participants also were identified as carriers. The most prevalent mutations were c.1448 T>C and RecNcil, however, three less common mutations were identified (i.e., c.1223 C>T, c.1315 A>G, and c.1214 G>C). In conclusion, we evaluated six different mutations in Iranian patients and elucidated the inheritance of the three less-known mutations by linkage analysis."

Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive 1 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta every 2 weeks for 2 years. The primary efficacy analysis assessed non-inferiority based on median annualised eGFR slope differences between treatment arms. Seventy-seven patients received either pegunigalsidase alfa (n=52) or agalsidase beta (n=25). At baseline, mean (range) age was 44 (18-60) years, 47 (61%) patients were male, median eGFR was 74.5 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and median (range) eGFR slope was -7.3 (-30.5, 6.3) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year. At 2 years, the difference between median eGFR slopes was -0.36 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year, meeting the prespecified non-inferiority margin. Minimal changes were observed in lyso-Gb3 concentrations in both treatment arms at 2 years. Proportions of patients experiencing treatment-related adverse events and mild or moderate infusion-related reactions were similar in both groups, yet exposure-adjusted rates were 3.6-fold and 7.8-fold higher, respectively, with agalsidase beta than pegunigalsidase alfa. At the end of the study, neutralising antibodies were detected in 7 out of 47 (15%) pegunigalsidase alfa-treated patients and 6 out of 23 (26%) agalsidase beta-treated patients. There were no deaths. Based on rate of eGFR decline over 2 years, pegunigalsidase alfa was non-inferior to agalsidase beta. Pegunigalsidase alfa had lower rates of treatment-emergent adverse events and mild or moderate infusion-related reactions. NCT02795676."

We present the cross-sectional results of the baseline assessment from the RAPSODI study, an online assessment tool for PD patients and GBA1 variant carriers. The assessment includes clinically validated questionnaires, a tap-test, the University of Pennsyllvania Smell Identification Test and cognitive tests. Additional, homogeneous data from the PREDICT-PD cohort were included. A total of 379 participants completed all parts of the RAPSODI assessment (89 GBA1-negative controls, 169 GBA1-negative PD, 47 GBA1-positive PD, 47 non-affected GBA1 carriers, 27 GD). Eighty-six participants were recruited through PREDICT-PD (43 non-affected GBA1 carriers and 43 GBA1-negative controls). GBA1-positive PD patients showed worse performance in visual cognitive tasks and olfaction compared to GBA1-negative PD patients. No differences were detected between non-affected GBA1 carriers carriers and GBA1-negative controls. No phenotypic differences were observed between any of the non-PD groups. Our results support previous evidence that GBA1-positive PD has a specific phenotype with more severe non-motor symptoms. However, we did not reproduce previous findings of more frequent prodromal PD signs in non-affected GBA1 carriers."

However, it is not fully elucidated how quantitatively the change in glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) correlates with that in the brain, which is expected to be clinically informative. Herein, we aimed to investigate the correlation with successfully quantified GlcSph in monkey CSF by developing highly sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods. The GlcSph in normal monkey CSF was 0.635 ± 0.177 pg/mL at baseline and increased by CBE treatment at 3 mg/kg daily for five days up to a moderate level, comparable to that in GD patients. The balance between GlcSph and galactosylsphingosine (GalSph) in the CSF matched that in the brain rather than plasma. In addition, GlcSph in the CSF was increased, accompanied by that in the brain at a dose of 3 mg/kg daily. These results indicate that GlcSph in the CSF is worth evaluating for concentration changes in the brain. Thus, this model can be useful for evaluating GBA-related diseases such as GD and GBA-PD."

A total of 19 patients with GD3 from 10 Spanish hospitals were enrolled in the study (14 men, 5 women). The median age at disease onset and diagnosis was 1 and 1.2 years, respectively, and the mean age at follow-up completion was 12.37 years (range: 1-25 years). Most patients exhibited splenomegaly (18/19) and hepatomegaly (17/19) at the time of diagnosis. The most frequent neurological abnormalities at onset were psychomotor retardation (14/19) and extrinsic muscle disorders (11/19), including oculomotor apraxia, supranuclear palsy, and strabismus. The L444P (c.1448T>C) allele was predominant, with the L444P (c.1448T>C) homozygous genotype mainly associated with visceral manifestations like hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. All patients received enzyme replacement therapy (ERT); other treatments included miglustat and the chaperone (ambroxol). Visceral manifestations, including hepatosplenomegaly and hematological and bone manifestations, were mostly controlled with ERT, except for kyphosis. The data from this study may help to increase the evidence base on this rare disease and contribute to improving the clinical management of GD3 patients."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism, belonging to the group of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). GD is caused by a defect in lysosomal glucocerebrosidase, responsible for glucosylceramide breakdown into glucose and ceramide. Because of this dysfunction, glucosylceramide progressively accumulates in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, bones, and in other tissues and organs, also causing anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and bone symptoms. Depending on neurological symptoms, GD is classified into three main types. Treatment options for LSDs, including enzyme replacement therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, small molecular weight pharmacologic chaperones, and, for some LSDs, gene therapy, are increasingly available. For this reason, many efforts are aimed at implementing newborn screening for LSDs since early detection accompanied by a prompt intervention has been demonstrated to be essential for reducing morbidity and mortality and for improved clinical outcomes. Herein, we report two siblings of preschool age, presenting with hepatosplenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. The initial suspicion of GD based on the clinical picture was further supported by biochemical confirmation, through newborn screening workflow, including first- and second-level testing on the same dried blood spot samples, and finally by molecular testing."

This research intends to evaluate the safety, treatment satisfaction, and compliance of MPS I patients treated with laronidase (Aldurazyme®) and Pompe Disease patients treated with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme®) in a homecare setting. We report herein an early interim analysis of the HomERT (Home infusions of ERT) study, a multicenter, non-interventional, double-cohort study that retrospectively analyzed 38 patients from 14 sites in Italy: cohort A (Pompe disease - 32 patients) and cohort B (MPS I - 6 patients). Among the selected patients who started home therapy before enrollment, the average number of missed home-based infusions was 0.7 (1.3) in cohort A and 3.8 (6.4) in cohort B with no return to the hospital setting. Irrespective of the treatment location, 3 prior ADRs per cohort were reported. The majority of patients preferred home-based infusions (cohort A: 96.9%; cohort B: 100%): the main reason was attributed to treatment convenience (cohort A: 81.3%; cohort B: 83.3%). Despite the underlying conditions, most patients self-evaluated their health as \"good\" (cohort A: 50%; cohort B: 83.3%). Evidence of favorable safety profile, improved treatment compliance and personal satisfaction validates the use of ERT with laronidase and alglucosidase alfa as a strong candidate for home therapy."

Gaucher's disease affects all racial and ethnic groups, while type 1 GD is most prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews.

The ALP is involved in the degradation of intracellular macromolecules including protein aggregates. ALP dysfunction due to inherited defects in lysosomal or non-lysosomal proteins causes a group of diseases called lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) because of abnormal accumulation of lysosomal degradation substrates. Supporting the contribution of ALP defects in neurodegenerative diseases, deposition of amyloidogenic proteins occurs in LSD. Moreover, heterozygous mutations of several ALP genes represent risk factors for Parkinson's disease. The reciprocal contribution of α-synuclein accumulation and lysosomal dysfunction have been extensively studied. However, whether this adverse crosstalk also embraces Tau pathology needs more investigation. Here, we show in human primary fibroblasts that Tau seeds isolated from the brain of Alzheimer's disease induce Tau accumulation in acidic degradative organelles and lysosomal stress. Furthermore, inhibition of glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal enzyme mutated in Gaucher's disease and a main risk for Parkinson's disease, causes lysosomal dysfunction in primary fibroblasts and contributes to the accumulation of Tau. Considering the presence of Tau lesions in Parkinson's disease as well as in multiple neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, our data call for further studies on strategies to alleviate ALP dysfunction as new therapeutic opportunity for neurodegenerative diseases and LSD."

Loss of function mutations in the gene <i>GBA</i> encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher's disease (GD) and are the most common genetic risk factor for synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). GCase degrades the membrane lipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and mutations in <i>GBA</i>, or inhibiting its activity, results in the accumulation of GlcCer and disturbs the composition of the lysosomal membrane. The lysosomal membrane serves as the platform to which intracellular trafficking complexes are recruited and activated. Here, we investigated whether lysosomal trafficking in axons was altered by inhibition of GCase with the pharmacological agent Conduritol B Epoxide (CBE). Using live cell imaging in human male induced pluripotent human stem cell (iPSC)-derived forebrain neurons, we demonstrated that lysosomal transport was similar in both control and CBE-treated neurons. Furthermore, we tested whether lysosomal rupture, a process implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders, was affected by inhibition of GCase. Using L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLoME) to induce lysosomal membrane damage and immunocytochemical staining for markers of lysosomal rupture, we found no difference in susceptibility to rupture between control and CBE-treated neurons. These results suggest the loss of GCase activity does not contribute to neurodegenerative disease by disrupting either lysosomal transport or rupture."

This leads to the accumulation of glucosyl sphingosine and glucosyl ceramide in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Gaucher disease has two major types: nonneuropathic (Type 1) and neuropathic (Type 2 and Type 3). Gaucher disease can have various ophthalmologic manifestations, particularly in Type 3, including posterior segment abnormalities, such as vitreous opacities, condensations, and/or preretinal white dots. We present a case of a patient with Gaucher disease Type 3 who had severe bilateral vitreous and extensive retinal deposits, leading to challenges during surgery. This video reports surgical outcomes for an uncommon ophthalmologic manifestation in a patient with Gaucher disease Type 3. We focus on the challenges and results of surgery for severe bilateral vitreous and extensive retinal deposits. A 16-year-old female patient with a history of Gaucher's disease since birth presented with a one-year history of blurred vision in both eyes. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye, as measured by Snellen's chart. Intraocular pressure was normal in both eyes, and anterior segment examinations were unremarkable. However, fundus evaluation revealed extensive vitreous deposits that obscured the details of the fundus. Additionally, an epiretinal membrane was observed over the macula in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) confirmed the presence of deposits in the vitreous cavity and on the surface of the retina. The patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy with epiretinal membrane removal. A transconjunctival 23-G pars plana vitrectomy was performed to the extent possible. Multiple instruments were used to remove the fluffy vitreous deposits, as they were extremely adherent to the underlying surface of the retina, and brilliant blue dye was used to stain the internal limiting membrane. The epiretinal membrane and internal limiting membrane were removed from the macular area, and the entire cassette fluid was sent for histopathological examination to identify Gaucher cells. At one week postoperative, the patient's visual acuity improved to 20/125 in the right eye, and the fundus picture showed a cleared macular area. OCT showed a reduction in deposits over the retina. The histopathological examination revealed crumpled, barrel-like cytoplasm with an oval nucleus in a hemorrhagic background, suggestive of Gaucher cells. Early detection and treatment of ocular manifestations of Gaucher's disease are important to prevent permanent damage to vision. An ophthalmological assessment involving a dilated fundus examination and optical coherence tomography can facilitate early diagnosis and follow-up of ocular manifestations. Timely surgery may be required to preserve functional vision in patients with severe ocular disease. https://youtu.be/KR-kfgfDoqM."

Cognition was evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) questionnaire, daytime sleepiness by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), depression by Beck´s Inventory, constipation by the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) scale, and REM sleep behavior disorder by the single-question screen. Hyposmia was assessed with Sniffin' Sticks (SST). Nineteen patients completed the follow-up (mean age of the sample was 44 years; range, 26-71). The patient with the highest number of NMS at the baseline (4 including the lowest SST score) was diagnosed with PD four years later. Apart from an improvement in the ESS score, no other statistical significance was found between the number of NMS between the first and second evaluation, nor between patients with one L444P variant (n = 5) and the rest of the cohort. CSF was collected in five patients (mean age of the sample was 40 years, range 30-53. A significant difference was found in the mean CSF activity levels of beta-hexosaminidases and beta-glucuronidase between GD1 and MLD patients. Mean ChT (CSF) was 62 nmol/h/mL in GD patients and 142 in MLD (n = 6) patients. The patient with the highest number of NMS in our 2018 cohort was the one that developed PD, corroborating with the importance of this longitudinal follow-up. CSF and plasma analysis might allow a better understanding of the neurodegenerative processes connecting PD and the lysosomal environment. Further analysis is needed to understand this relationship."

    "abstract": "This report presents a case of childhood Gaucher disease type 1, a rare inherited metabolic disorder. Although the clinical symptoms were classical, the histological findings in this case were atypical and initially led to diagnostic uncertainty. The pathognomonic histological finding on bone marrow is Gaucher cells, which are lipid-engorged phagocytes secondary to the accumulation of glucosylceramide. These cells typically demonstrate diffuse and avid iron staining using a Prussian blue iron stain. In this case, although the histiocytes seen on bone marrow were abnormal, the absence of iron staining on bone marrow led to a large range of other diagnoses being considered. In retrospect, this anomaly was likely in the setting of prolonged iron deficiency and anaemia as a result of the insidious nature of this presentation. The prognosis of type 1 Gaucher disease is favourable, with current treatments significantly improving duration and quality of life. We explore the utility of a collaborative multidisciplinary approach in addressing diagnostic uncertainty and the importance in making a diagnosis for Gaucher disease type 1 in order to provide appropriate and targeted treatment."

    "abstract": "Glucosylceramides (GlcCer) are lipids that impact signaling pathways, serve as critical components of cellular membranes, and act as precursors for hundreds of other complex glycolipid species. Abnormal GlcCer metabolism is linked to many diseases, including cancers, diabetes, Gaucher disease, neurological disorders, and skin disorders. A key hurdle to fully understanding the role of GlcCer in disease is the development of methods to accurately detect and quantify these lipid species in a model organism. This will allow for the dissection of the role of this pool <i>in vivo</i> with a focus on all the individual types of GlcCer. In this review, we will discuss the analysis of the GlcCer population specifically in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, focusing on the mass spectrometry-based methods available for GlcCer quantification. We will also consider the combination of these approaches with genetic interrogation of GlcCer metabolic genes to define the biological role of these unique lipids. Furthermore, we will explore the implications and obstacles for future research."

Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration confirmed the presence of characteristic Gaucher's cells. The patient underwent the Bentall procedure and mitral valve replacement and was discharged in good condition. Gaucher's disease exhibits three clinical phenotypes, and cardiovascular involvement is commonly seen in GD Type III. Valvular calcification and ascending aorta involvement are frequent cardiovascular manifestations. Although severe valvular heart involvement is rare in GD, cardiac valve surgery has shown favourable outcomes in previous studies and our case."

The treatment duration/compliance study included 173 patients (Israel, 58; US, 61; Brazil, 48; Australia, 6) who received ≥1 taliglucerase alfa home infusion through 6/2021. The median age at home therapy initiation was 38 (range, 2-87) years; 58% were females. The median treatment duration (at home) was 2.7 (range, 0.04-9.0) years. The annual compliance rate was stable (≥95%) throughout the study period. A search of the Pfizer global safety database (through 6/2021), identified 19 adverse events (AEs) as related to \"definite home use\" and 14 to \"possible home use\" of taliglucerase alfa; 42.4% of these AEs were serious; none were fatal. Twelve serious AEs in five separate case reports were considered treatment related: one case of chest discomfort/pain and hypertension and one case of erythema associated with a toe blister, for which causality could not be excluded; pain in extremity; projectile vomiting and chills, alongside excessive eye blinking; and an infusion-related AE (pruritus). In conclusion, this real-life global study demonstrated that taliglucerase alfa home infusions are safe with high compliance rates."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by the lysosomal enzyme acid β-glucosidase deficiency. Many patients experience a critical delay in the diagnosis of up to 8-10 years due to its rarity and variability in signs and symptoms, with the consultation of several specialists. This prospective observational study analyzed the prevalence of GD in 600 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) from January 2018 until February 2022. The mean age of participants was 66 years, with a mean monoclonal component of 0.58 g/dL. In 433 MGUS patients with available data, anemia (hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL) was present in 31 patients (7%), and thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100.000/mm<sup>3</sup> ) in 24 (5.5%). Of 600 MGUS patients tested for acid β-glucosidase enzyme activity, 7 patients (1.2%) had activity below 2.5 nmol/h/mL. In comparison, GBA gene analysis was executed in 110 patients. It revealed 4 patients (0.7%) affected by GD (3 patients with compound heterozygous mutation and 1 with homozygous mutation), with a prevalence of 1 every 150 MGUS patients. Furthermore, 12 out of the remaining 106 evaluated patients (11%) were carriers of a single heterozygous mutation while having regular enzyme activity. The clinical heterogeneity of GD and frequent lack of awareness among physicians often lead to diagnostic delays and severe clinical manifestations. The role of MGUS in the presence of at least one clinical sign, such as low platelet count, organomegaly, bone pain, or bleeding tendency, could aid in initiating GD screening with DBS, thus reducing the period between symptom onset and the diagnosis of this rare disease."

To assess the therapeutic potential of known inhibitors, the X-ray structure of TxGH116 in complex with isofagomine (IFG) was determined at 2.0 Å resolution and showed the IFG bound in a relaxed chair conformation. The binding of IFG and 7 other iminosugar inhibitors to wild-type and mutant enzymes (Asp508His and Arg786His) mimicking GBA2 pathogenic variants was then evaluated computationally by two-layered ONIOM calculations (at the B3LYP:PM7 level). Calculations showed that six charged residues, Glu441, Asp452, His507, Asp593, Glu777, and Arg786 influence inhibitor binding most. His507, Glu777 and Arg786, form strong hydrogen bonds with the inhibitors (∼1.4-1.6 Å). Thus, the missense mutation of one of these residues in Arg786His has a greater effect on the interaction energies for all inhibitors compared to Asp508His. In line with the experimental data for the inhibitors that have been tested, the favorable interaction energy between the inhibitors and the TxGH116 protein followed the trend: isofagomine > 1-deoxynojirimycin > glucoimidazole > N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin ≈ N-nonyl-deoxynojirimycin > conduritol B epoxide ≈ azepane 1 > azepane 2. The obtained structural and energetic properties and comparison to the GBA2 model can lead to understanding of structural requirement for inhibitor binding in GH116 to aid the design of high potency GBA2 inhibitors."

The rarity of GD and the limited use of eliglustat outside clinical trials require further study of its strengths and weaknesses. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness and safety of eliglustat in a cohort of 12 patients with GD followed up in our center, reporting a reduction in both chitotriosidase (394.3 vs 181.1 nmol/h/mL, P = 0.027) and glucosylsphingosine values (45.1 vs 18.9 ng/mL, P <0.001) after at least 12 months of therapy compared with baseline, regardless of patient demographic characteristics and GD characteristics. There were no drug-related serious adverse effects and no drug-related cardiac events. Most adverse events were mild and transient, mainly dyspepsia and abdominal pain. Of interest, we reported an absence of statistical difference in terms of response regarding glucosylsphingosine reduction in relation to naive or prior exposure to ERT (P = 0.296), which was confirmed also when patients were placed in naive and treated groups for <5 vs >5 years (P = 0.667). The use of eliglustat immediately after diagnosis may guarantee the best treatment for patients with milder phenotypes or with aggressive disease after an initial stabilization with ERT compared with ERT, which cannot adequately remove the disease burden despite the apparent response, thus potentially reducing future complications caused by substrate deposits."

Despite frequent use by clinicians, CDT is criticized for its poor predictive value in mild cases of impairment. To evaluate CDT as a screening tool for early stage of cognitive impairment in biomarker-verified Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depressive disorder (DD). We analyzed CDT of 172 patients with verified AD, 70 patients with DD, in whom neurodegenerative disorder was excluded using cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and 58 healthy older adults. CDT was scored using the semi-quantitative (Shulman) and itemized criteria (adapted from Mendez). Logistic regression showed that for both DD and AD patients with high Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (27 and above) the significant predicting variable is uneven number spacing. As MMSE deteriorates (24-26 points), an additional error of setting clock hands is predictive of the disease. In the low MMSE condition, CDT showed an acceptable discrimination for AD (AUC itemized 0.740, Shulman 0.741) and DD (AUC itemized 0.827, Shulman 0.739) using both scoring methods. In the high MMSE condition, discrimination rates were acceptable using itemized scoring but poor using Shulman scoring for both AD (AUC itemized 0.707, Shulman 0.677) and DD (AUC itemized 0.755, Shulman 0.667) groups. Ideally, modern diagnostic process should take place before the cognitive performance drops beneath the healthy range. This makes CDT of little use when screening patients with very mild cognitive deficits."

Its phenotypic variability allows GD to be classified into 3 subtypes based on the presence and extent of neurological manifestations. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been available for all patients with GD in Taiwan since 1998. Newborn screening (NBS) for GD has been available since 2015. This study attempted to unveil the clinical features of patients diagnosed with GD during different eras in Taiwan. Data from the health records of two tertiary hospitals responsible for two-thirds of the patients with GD in Taiwan were used. The study population included all patients identified as having GD between 1998, and April 2022, in these two hospitals for review. A total of 42 individuals were included, six of whom were diagnosed by NBS. Our cohort presented a higher proportion of GD3 individuals, both by clinical suspicion and by NBS diagnosis, than that reported worldwide. The major subtypes that were recognized following NBS diagnosis were GD2 and GD3. The majority of GD patients carry at least one p.Leu483Pro variant. The 5-year survival rates were 0% for GD2 patients and 100% for patients with other subtypes. Patients diagnosed during the post-NBS era were free of symptoms on initial presentation, except for those with the GD2 subtype. For those diagnosed earlier, ERT was shown to be effective in terms of improved hemograms and prevented bone crises. However, the neurological symptoms in GD3 patients progressed despite ERT intervention. ERT is essential in reversing the hematological presentations and preventing the skeletal complications of GD. Timely diagnosis of GD with NBS allows for early intervention with ERT to prevent disease progression and complications. However, the need for effective intervention for neurological dysfunction remains unmet."

Recently, it has been shown that certain erythrocyte pathologies could be linked to an abnormal lipid composition. In this work, we have developed a simple and fast method using online sample preparation with liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (SPE-HPLC-MS/MS), to identify a large number of sphingolipids (SL) and phospholipids (PL). The use of online sample preparation considerably reduces analysis times (15 min including extraction and separation of lipids + 2 min for system re-equilibration) and facilitates experimentation while ensuring very good extraction yields. This method was then successfully applied to the quantification of 30 sphingolipids and phospholipids in plasma and erythrocyte extracts from a cohort of individuals with Gaucher disease, treated or not by enzymotherapy. Our results for the study of this disease, led us to establish the lipid profile of the healthy red blood cells, still not very well-known to date. For this, we adopted a semi-targeted approach, based on the use of a triple-quadrupole analyzer and identified more than two hundred different lipid species. These promising results will hopefully enable us to enrich our knowledge of the normal red blood cells lipidome."

While skeletal diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and reduced quality of life in GD, the pathophysiology of bone involvement is not yet fully understood, partly due to lack of relevant human model systems. In this work, we present the first 3D human model of GD using aspiration-assisted freeform bioprinting, which enables a platform tool with a potential for decoding the cellular basis of the developmental bone abnormalities in GD. In this regard, human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (obtained commercially) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from a cohort of GD patients, at different severities, were co-cultured to form spheroids and differentiated into osteoblast and osteoclast lineages, respectively. Co-differentiated spheroids were then 3D bioprinted into rectangular tissue patches as a bone tissue model for GD. The results revealed positive alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tartrate-resistant ALP activities, with multi-nucleated cells demonstrating the efficacy of the model, corroborating with gene expression studies. There were no significant changes in differentiation to osteogenic cells but pronounced morphological deformities in spheroid formation, more evident in the 'severe' cohort, were observed. Overall, the presented GD model has the potential to be adapted to personalized medicine not only for understanding the GD pathophysiology but also for personalized drug screening and development."

We present clinical parameters and AAV antibody titers for 19 individuals with LOPD undergoing screening for a Phase I clinical trial with an AAV serotype 8 vector targeting hepatic transduction (AAV2/8-LSPhGAA). Reported clinical parameters included <i>GAA</i> genotype, assessments of muscle function, upright and supine spirometry, anti-recombinant human GAA antibody titers, and biomarkers. Variability in measured parameters and phenotypes of screened individuals was evident. Eligibility criteria required that all participants have six-minute walk test (6MWT) and upright forced vital capacity (FVC) below the expected range for normal individuals, and were stably treated with ERT for >2 years. All participants had Pompe disease diagnosed by enzyme deficiency, and all had the common c.-32-13T>G LOPD pathogenic variant. Screening identified 14 patients (74%) with no or minimal detectable neutralizing antibodies against AAV8 (titer ≤1:5). 6MWT distance varied significantly (percent of expected distance ranging from 24% to 91% with an average of 60 and standard deviation of 21). Upright FVC percent predicted ranged from 35% predicted to 91% predicted with an average of 66 and standard deviation of 18. None of the participants had significantly elevated alanine transaminase, which has been associated with LOPD and could complicate screening for hepatitis related to AAV gene therapy.

Yet, many endure years-long diagnostic odysseys. We report the development of a machine learning algorithm to identify patients with GD from electronic health records. We utilized Optum's de-identified Integrated Claims-Clinical dataset (2007-2019) for feature engineering and algorithm training/testing, based on clinical characteristics of GD. Two algorithms were selected: one based on age of feature occurrence (age-based), and one based on occurrence of features (prevalence-based). Performance was compared with an adaptation of the available clinical diagnostic algorithm for identifying patients with diagnosed GD. Undiagnosed patients highly-ranked by the algorithms were compared with diagnosed GD patients. Splenomegaly was the most important predictor for diagnosed GD with both algorithms, followed by geographical location (northeast USA), thrombocytopenia, osteonecrosis, bone density disorders, and bone pain. Overall, 1204 and 2862 patients, respectively, would need to be assessed with the age- and prevalence-based algorithms, compared with 20,743 with the clinical diagnostic algorithm, to identify 28 patients with diagnosed GD in the integrated dataset. Undiagnosed patients highly-ranked by the algorithms had similar clinical manifestations as diagnosed GD patients. The age-based algorithm identified younger patients, while the prevalence-based identified patients with advanced clinical manifestations. Their combined use better captures GD heterogeneity. The two algorithms were about 10-20-fold more efficient at identifying GD patients than the clinical diagnostic algorithm. Application of these algorithms could shorten diagnostic delay by identifying undiagnosed GD patients."

GD may be associated with monoclonal and polyclonal gammopathies; however, the mechanism of association of GD with multiple myeloma (MM) remains uncertain. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been shown to improve patients' cytopenia and it seems to facilitate anti-myeloma therapy in patients with co-occurring GD and MM. Although it is necessary to demonstrate the deficiency of enzymatic activity, as well as using genetic tests to finally diagnose GD, due to changes in the blood count image, bone marrow biopsy is still a frequent element of the GD diagnosis procedure. The diagnosis of GD is often delayed, mainly due to the heterogeneity of the histopathological picture of bone marrow biopsy or overlapping hematological abnormalities. Unrecognized and untreated GD worsens the response of a patient with an oncological disease to targeted treatment. We present a literature review, inspired by the case of a Caucasian patient initially diagnosed with MM and later confirmed with comorbid GD type 1 (GD1).

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) - a lysosomal enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing glycogen. GAA deficiency leads to accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes, causing cellular disruption. The severity of PD is directly related to the extent of GAA deficiency - if no or minimal GAA is produced, symptoms are severe and manifest in infancy, known as infantile onset PD (IOPD). If left untreated, infants with IOPD experience muscle hypotonia and cardio-respiratory failure leading to significant morbidity and mortality in the first year of life. In contrast, late-onset PD (LOPD) patients have more GAA activity and present later in life, but also have significant respiratory function decline. Despite FDA-approved enzyme replacement therapy, respiratory insufficiency remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, emphasizing the importance of early detection and management of respiratory complications. These complications include impaired cough and airway clearance, respiratory muscle weakness, sleep-related breathing issues, and pulmonary infections. This review aims to provide an overview of the respiratory pathology, monitoring, and management of PD patients. In addition, we discuss the impact of novel approaches and therapies on respiratory function in PD."

The long-term effects of GD on respiratory health remain unclear due to limited data on the natural history of this disease. We analyzed electronic health records for 11,004 patients with GD over 10-20 years to determine the incidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH), lung disease, and other respiratory comorbidities and better understand disease course to guide management. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX research database of 130 million international patients. The incidence of primary/secondary PH, pulmonary heart disease, interstitial/obstructive/restrictive lung disease, pulmonary hemorrhage, and pulmonary embolism was assessed in patients with GD from 2000-2020. Incidence rates of all conditions assessed increased from 10 to 20 years of follow-up. Excess risk of PH, lung disease, and pulmonary hemorrhage was significantly higher in GD patients after 20 versus 10 years. Extended follow-up in GD is associated with substantially higher risks of PH, lung disease and other respiratory comorbidities, highlighting the need for close monitoring and early intervention to mitigate long-term pulmonary decline. Improved understanding of mechanisms driving respiratory deterioration can support the development of novel treatments to optimize outcomes in this population at high risk of pulmonary morbidity and mortality."

Early detection is important, because timely initiation of treatments can improve the disease status and prevent complications. However disease manifestations develop in childhood, diagnosis is delayed until adulthood partly due to the limitations of the currently used diagnostic pathway. The aim of this research is to develop and validate a multiplex assay and defining reference ranges, which do not exist at this moment, to improve and facilitate the entire diagnostic work up and enable treatment in an earlier stage of disease. Biomarkers glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) and globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3) were detected and quantified using LC-MS/MS on dried blood spots. We developed an improved and new extraction method that allowed to measure GlcSph and Lyso-Gb3 in a multiplex analytical platform. After validation of the method, samples of 1480 individuals with normal enzymatic activity were collected to determine age and gender-related reference ranges.Our combination method showed a good linearity, precision, accuracy and limit of quantification with lack of carry-over following the specific international CLSI guidelines. The suggested protocol is robust, efficient, sensitive, specific, comprehensive and relatively cheap in order to accelerate the diagnostic process for both lysosomal storage diseases. The samples, with normal enzymatic activity, defined statistical relevant and clinical correct reference ranges for each specific age group by gender. We report a multiplex LC-MS/MS method and relevant reference ranges that are appropriate for the targeted screening, diagnosis and follow-up of Fabry and Gaucher disease."

    "title": "Dual diagnosis of trisomy 21 and lethal perinatal Gaucher disease as a cause of non-immune hydrops fetalis in a twin pregnancy for a consanguineous couple.",
    "abstract": "Non-immune hydrops is a prenatal finding which can occur due to an underlying genetic diagnosis such as common chromosomal aneuploidy (Trisomy 21, Turner syndrome etc.). It is extremely rare to have more than one genetic cause of hydrops fetalis in a single pregnancy. This report describes a dichorionic diamniotic pregnancy for a consanguineous couple where noninvasive prenatal testing was \"high risk\" for Trisomy 21. Family declined amniocentesis and opted for postnatal genetic testing. The pregnancy was later complicated with severe hydrops fetalis leading to demise for one of the twins, and a premature delivery of the other twin who had remarkable collodion not in keeping with Trisomy 21. Postnatal genetic investigations confirmed both Trisomy 21 and prenatal lethal Gaucher disease in the survivor twin. This case report highlights some of the prenatal diagnostic challenges for a consanguineous couple where a rare cause of fetal hydrops was concealed in a setting of a common chromosomal aneuploidy. The prompt postnatal diagnosis of perinatal lethal Gaucher disease, confirmed with undetectable glucocerebrosidase enzyme activity, assisted the family in the decision of providing palliative care for their infant who was quickly deteriorating. The importance of postnatal genetic evaluation and its impact on immediate patient management in an NICU setting is emphasized. This dual diagnosis was significant for the couple as it explained pervious pregnancy losses and has important future recurrence risk implications."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the GLA gene encoding α-galactosidase (α-Gal)-A. We evaluated long-term safety/efficacy of pegunigalsidase alfa, a novel PEGylated α-Gal-A enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) now approved for FD. In a phase-1/2 dose-ranging study, 15 ERT-naive adults with FD completed 12 months of pegunigalsidase alfa and enrolled in this 60-month open-label extension of 1 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa infusions every 2 weeks. Fifteen patients enrolled (8 males; 7 females); 10 completed ≥48 months (60 months total treatment), and 2 completed 60 months (72 months total treatment). During treatment, most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild/moderate in severity and all infusion-related reactions were mild/moderate in severity. Four patients were transiently positive for anti-pegunigalsidase alfa IgG. Patients showed continuous reduction in plasma lyso-Gb3 concentrations with mean (standard error) reduction of 76.1 [25.1] ng/mL from baseline to month 24. At 60 months, the estimated glomerular filtration rate slope was comparable to that observed in patients treated with other ERTs. Cardiac function assessments revealed stability; no cardiac fibrosis was observed. In this first long-term assessment of pegunigalsidase alfa administration in patients with FD, we found favorable safety/efficacy. Our data suggest long-term continuous benefits of pegunigalsidase alfa treatment in adults with FD."

    "title": "Double Trouble: Association of Malignant Melanoma with Sporadic and Genetic Forms of Parkinson's Disease and Asymptomatic Carriers of Related Genes: A Brief Report.",
    "abstract": "<i>Introduction:</i> Previous epidemiological evidence has established the co-occurrence of malignant melanoma (MM) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Shared molecular mechanisms have been proposed to be implicated in this relationship. The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of MM in patients with sporadic and genetic types of PD, as well as in asymptomatic carriers of PD-related genes. <i>Methods:</i> Data regarding past medical history and concomitant disease of 1416 patients with PD (including 20 participants with prodromal disease who phenoconverted to PD), 275 healthy controls (HCs) and 670 asymptomatic carriers of PD-related genes were obtained from the database of the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Focus was placed on information about a medical record of MM. We also retrieved data regarding the genetic status of selected PPMI participants with a positive MM history. <i>Results:</i> In total, 46 patients with PD reported a positive MM history. Concerning the genetic forms of PD, nine of these PD patients (2.47%) carried a Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene mutation (mainly the G2019S), while eight (4.49%) harbored a Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene mutation (mainly the N370S). No alpha-synuclein (SNCA) gene mutation was identified in patients with an MM history. The remaining 29 PD patients (3.5%) were genetically undetermined. In total, 18 asymptomatic carriers of PD-related genes had a positive medical history for MM: among them, 10 carried an LRRK2 gene mutation (2.69%) and 10 a GBA gene mutation (3.51%) (2 were dual carriers). MM history was identified for seven HCs (2.5%). <i>Conclusions:</i> We replicated the previously reported association between genetically undetermined PD (GU-PD) and MM. A correlation of LRRK2 mutations with the development of MM could not be verified in either symptomatic PD patients or asymptomatic carriers, implicating distinct pathogenetic mechanisms as compared to GU-PD. Importantly, despite the limited literature evidence on Gaucher disease, this study highlights for the first time the relatively high prevalence of MM among asymptomatic and symptomatic PD GBA mutation carriers, with potential clinical implications."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease's (GD) pathophysiology generates anesthetic concerns in total hip joint arthroplasty (THA), and due to its rareness, data on perioperative risks are scarce. This 22-year study at a large reference center addresses anesthetic management and perioperative outcomes in GD. This retrospective-cohort study assessed anesthetic success and safety in 30 THA patients, comparing them with a control-matched group. Data on clinical characteristics, perioperative events, and outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was the success rate of anesthesia induction performance at first attempt. Secondary outcomes were difficult intraoperative course and hemodynamic management, and the development of postoperative complications. The age, sex, weight, body mass index, and primary-to-revision hip arthroplasty ratio were similar in both groups. There was no significant difference at all-type anesthesia first initiation attempt success. No particular preference by staff anesthetists for general anesthesia or neuraxial procedures was observed. The GD group showed a significantly higher mean of intraoperative packed Red Blood Cell units administered ((0.73 vs. 0.18); (<i>p</i> = 0.038)), higher intraoperative and postoperative platelet transfusion incidence ((5/30 [16.7%] vs. 0/56 [0.00%]; <i>p</i> = 0.004) and (3/30 [10%] vs. 0/56 [0%]; <i>p</i> = 0.040)), and longer mean recovery room length of stay (426 ± 412 vs. 175 ± 140; <i>p</i> = 0.004).

    "title": "A Deep-Learning Approach to Spleen Volume Estimation in Patients with Gaucher Disease.",
    "abstract": "The enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) is a common manifestation of Gaucher disease (GD). An accurate estimation of the liver and spleen volumes in patients with GD, using imaging tools such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is crucial for the baseline assessment and monitoring of the response to treatment. A commonly used method in clinical practice to estimate the spleen volume is the employment of a formula that uses the measurements of the craniocaudal length, diameter, and thickness of the spleen in MRI. However, the inaccuracy of this formula is significant, which, in turn, emphasizes the need for a more precise and reliable alternative. To this end, we employed deep-learning techniques, to achieve a more accurate spleen segmentation and, subsequently, calculate the resulting spleen volume with higher accuracy on a testing set cohort of 20 patients with GD. Our results indicate that the mean error obtained using the deep-learning approach to spleen volume estimation is 3.6 ± 2.7%, which is significantly lower than the common formula approach, which resulted in a mean error of 13.9 ± 9.6%. These findings suggest that the integration of deep-learning methods into the clinical routine practice for spleen volume calculation could lead to improved diagnostic and monitoring outcomes."

    "abstract": "The treatment landscape for lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) is rapidly evolving. An increase in the number of preclinical and clinical studies in the last decade has demonstrated that pharmacological chaperones are a feasible alternative to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for individuals with LSDs. A systematic search was performed to retrieve and critically assess the evidence from preclinical and clinical applications of pharmacological chaperones in the treatment of LSDs and to elucidate the mechanisms by which they could be effective in clinical practice. Publications were screened according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Fifty-two articles evaluating 12 small molecules for the treatment of seven LSDs are included in this review. Overall, a substantial amount of preclinical and clinical data support the potential of pharmacological chaperones as treatments for Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, and Pompe disease. Most of the available clinical evidence evaluated migalastat for the treatment of Fabry disease. There was a lack of consistency in the terminology used to describe pharmacological chaperones in the literature. Therefore, the new small molecule chaperone (SMC) classification system is proposed to inform a standardized approach for new, emerging small molecule therapies in LSDs."

    "title": "Patient-reported outcomes in Gaucher's disease: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher's disease (GD), a rare condition, represents the most common lysosomal storage disorder. The cardinal manifestations of GD are fatigue, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone pain, and bone infarction, thereby culminating in a marked deterioration of patients' quality of life (QoL). Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) offer valuable insights into the impact of GD on patients' QoL and symptoms. This systematic review aimed to identify and analyze PROs and outcome measures in GD patients. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science Core Collections, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Wan Fang Data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM). The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using a mixed methods assessment tool. A total of 33 studies were identified, encompassing 24 distinct patient-reported outcome instruments, with the most frequently employed instrument being the SF-36. The study designs included eighteen cross-sectional studies, seven pre- and post-intervention investigations, three randomized controlled trials, two cohort studies, two qualitative inquiries, and one validation study. These studies explored diverse domains such as the QoL and cardinal symptoms (e.g., fatigue, pain, bleeding, cognition, social relationships, and psychological functioning) in patients with GD. Furthermore, significant attention was directed towards the appraisal of the therapeutic benefits of various interventions in patients with GD. A novel GD-specific instrument has also been developed, which has two applied versions: a 24-item variant for routine clinical monitoring and a 17-item form for use in clinical trials. PROs have garnered increased attention and concern in the realm of GD. Despite this progress, it is noteworthy that the instruments used to measure PROs in GD are still predominantly generic instruments. While researchers have endeavored to develop and validate a disease-specific instrument, currently the use of this instrument is limited. Owing to several challenges, including the small number of patients, heterogeneity of the disease, and cross-regional discrepancies in study findings, GD poses substantial difficulties in the measurement of QoL and development of instruments. Consequently, patients with GD require more dependable measurement instruments that accurately reflect their QoL, efficacy of treatment, and facilitate healthcare decision-making."

    "title": "Management goals of type 1 Gaucher disease in South Africa: An expert Delphi consensus document on good clinical practice.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is a rare autosomal recessive glycosphingolipid storage disease that ultimately leads to reduced life expectancy. Management of Gaucher disease is challenging due to its wide genotypic and phenotypic variability and changing clinical manifestations due to effective treatment. Deliberation between experts is essential to discuss daily clinical practice and identify controversies regarding the management of Gaucher disease. The usefulness of methods like Delphi surveys is suitable for setting up consensus recommendations for different clinical scenarios. The goal of this study was to develop an expert consensus document for the management of type 1 Gaucher disease by local experts. A modified e-Delphi was carried out to develop an expert consensus document on the management goals of type 1 Gaucher disease in South Africa. Following a literature review and input from the steering committee, 205 management goals and best practice statements were e-mailed to an independent panel for consensus development using three rounds of voting. The panel consisted of five local healthcare practitioners with expertise in Gaucher disease. Each panelist provided independent evaluations of statements sent to them via a dedicated survey platform. Panelists indicated their level of agreement on a 9-point Likert scale (1 = absolute disagreement to 9 = absolute agreement) during each round of voting. The criteria to retain a statement in the final round were ≥80% high agreement (7-9). 193 statements met the consensus threshold after three rounds of voting and were included in the final guidance document. In general, the management goals presented in this paper are in line with existing literature on the subject. Additional management goals and general recommendations on sound clinical practice, obtained from more recent research and the panelists' own clinical experience, have been included to develop a comprehensive consensus document on the management goals of type 1 Gaucher disease. This paper provides high-level guidance with respect to management goals, and the use of current therapies and adjunctive interventions in type 1 Gaucher disease to assist clinicians in their decisions about the appropriate management of patients in everyday clinical practice. These management goals and best practice statements might be used to inform an update to future South African guidelines on the disease."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disorder. Eliglustat is a first-line oral therapy for adult patients with GD1. The aim of the ELIPRO (ELIglustat Patient Reported Outcomes) study was to assess real-world outcomes of eliglustat treatment for over 1 year in patients with GD1, with a focus on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including treatment adherence. This was a non-interventional, prospective, multicentric study. Patients were stratified according to their previous time on eliglustat: >6 months (Group1) and ≤ 6 months (Group2). The primary endpoint was adherence to eliglustat, measured by the eight-items Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8; scale of 0-8) at 6 months in Group2. Secondary endpoints were quality of life (QoL) measured by patient input using the European Quality of Life five-dimensional three-level [EQ-5D-3L] questionnaire, fatigue and pain measured by numeric rating scale [NRS; on a scale of 0-10], the evaluation of patient satisfaction level regarding eliglustat treatment measured by Likert scale [scale of 0-7] and treatment adherence at 12 months in both groups. The study also evaluated the safety and effectiveness of eliglustat in the adult GD1 population. Sixty patients with GD1 (approximatively 52% male, mean age: 46.6 ± 13.9 years) were analyzed: 29 in Group1 and 31 in Group2. GD1 was mostly of mild severity (90%) and 95% of patients had extensive CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype. Fifty-seven patients had previously received treatment for GD1 (91% enzyme replacement therapy) and 15% were splenectomized. Groups1 and 2 were not necessarily matching for all characteristics. At 6 months, 58% of Group2 patients showed medium adherence (6 < MMAS-8 < 7.75) while 21% showed high adherence (MMAS-8: 8) (mean MMAS-8: 6.7 ± 1.0); similar results were obtained in Group1 (50% showed high compliance, 35% showed medium compliance; mean MMAS-8: 6.8 ± 1.4). The mean MMAS-8 for Group1 and Group2 were 7.1 ± 1.2 (vs 7.0 ± 1.0 at baseline) and 6.5 ± 1.0, respectively, at 12 months. At 12 months, the mean NRS scores in Group1 and Group2 were 72.0 ± 18.5 and 77.3 ± 13.7 for QoL (vs. 71.7 ± 18.4 and 80.2 ± 12.4, respectively at baseline), 4.8 ± 2.6 and 3.6 ± 2.7 for fatigue (vs. 4.6 ± 2.7 and 3.6 ± 2.6, respectively at baseline) and 3.3 ± 2.7 and 2.3 ± 2.3 for pain (vs. 3.3 ± 2.7 and 2.0 ± 2.4, respectively at baseline). GD1 assessments (biological, clinical and imaging parameters) remained stable during 12 months in both groups. At the end of the study, majority (97.4%) of patients were satisfied with their treatment with eliglustat (satisfaction score over 5 out of 7). Sixty-six percent of patients (n = 41) experienced mostly mild adverse events (AE) (including four study withdrawals), of whom 27.4% (n = 17) of patients experienced eliglustat-related AEs. Treatment adherence remained stable during 12 months in both groups. Eliglustat treatment compliance was good and sustained, along with overall health state, fatigue and pain levels, which was consistent with overall patients' clinical status. Eliglustat was well tolerated, and had a good safety profile, aligned with a good patient satisfaction. Our study should encourage greater use of PROs for evaluation of impact of the GD treatment on patient's symptoms and well-being."

We examined the applicability of existing caregiver questionnaires and assessed the level of burden in caregivers of patients with GD. This cross-sectional, non-interventional study was conducted in Japan. Caregivers of patients with confirmed GD (any type) were recruited (patient association group and referral) for pre-testing (May 2021) or the main survey (October-December 2021). Caregivers completed the Caregiver Impact Questionnaire (CIQ; 30 items) and Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI; 22 items) on paper. Total CIQ and ZBI scores and subscores were determined overall and by GD type. Inter-item correlations and test-retest reliability (2 rounds, 2 weeks apart) were calculated. The relationship between caregiving duration and caregiver burden was also analyzed. Nine caregivers (type 2 [GD2]: <i>n</i> = 6; type 3 [GD3]: <i>n</i> = 3) and 25 caregivers (type 1 [GD1]: <i>n</i> = 2; GD2: <i>n</i> = 17; GD3: <i>n</i> = 6) completed the pre-test and main survey, respectively. In the main survey, mean total CIQ score, all CIQ subscores (except emotional function), and total ZBI score were highest in caregivers of patients with GD2 compared with caregivers of patients with GD1/GD3. High test-retest reliability (Kappa >0.6) was observed for 15 CIQ items and 16 ZBI items. CIQ and ZBI scores appeared to be positively correlated with each other and negatively correlated with caregiving duration. The CIQ and ZBI are applicable, reliable measures to assess burden in caregivers of patients with GD in Japan. Caregiver burden was highest in caregivers of patients with GD2 and decreased with caregiving duration."

    "abstract": "The progressive myoclonic epilepsies (PMEs) are a group of rare neurodegenerative diseases characterized by myoclonus, epileptic seizures, and progressive neurological deterioration with cerebellar involvement. They include storage diseases like Gaucher disease, Lafora disease, and forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). To date, 13 NCLs have been reported (CLN1-CLN8, CLN10-CLN14), associated with mutations in different genes. These forms, which affect both children and adults, are characterized by seizures, cognitive and motor impairments, and in most cases visual loss. In NCLs, as in other PMEs, central nervous system (CNS) neurodegeneration is widespread and involves different subpopulations of neurons. One of the most affected regions is the cerebellar cortex, where motor and non-motor information is processed and transmitted to deep cerebellar nuclei through the axons of Purkinje cells (PCs). PCs, being GABAergic, have an inhibitory effect on their target neurons, and provide the only inhibitory output of the cerebellum. Degeneration of PCs has been linked to motor impairments and epileptic seizures. Seizures occur when some insult upsets the normal balance in the CNS between excitatory and inhibitory impulses, causing hyperexcitability. Here we review the role of PCs in epilepsy onset and progression following their PME-related loss. In particular, we focus on the involvement of PCs in seizure phenotype in NCLs, highlighting findings from case reports and studies of animal models in which epilepsy can be linked to PC loss."

Patients with IMD may have joint symptoms and the challenge is to establish an early diagnosis in order to institute appropriate treatment and prevent irreversible damage. This review describes the joint manifestations of IMD that may be encountered in adults. The clinical settings considered were arthralgia and joint stiffness as well as arthritis. Unspecific arthralgias are often the first symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis, chronic low back pain may reveal an intervertebral disc calcification in relation with alkaptonuria, and progressive joint stiffness may correspond to a mucopolysaccharidosis or mucolipidosis. Gaucher disease is initially revealed by painful acute attacks mimicking joint pain described as \"bone crises\". Some IMD may induce microcrystalline arthropathy. Beyond classical gout, there are also gouts in connection with purine metabolism disorders known as \"enzymopathic gouts\". Pyrophosphate arthropathy can also be part of the clinical spectrum of Gitelman syndrome or hypophosphatasia. Oxalate crystals arthritis can reveal a primary hyperoxaluria. Destructive arthritis may be indicative of Wilson's disease. Non-destructive arthritis may be seen in mevalonate kinase deficiency and familial hypercholesterolemia."

    "abstract": "The Pompe Disease Symptom Scale (PDSS) and Impact Scale (PDIS) were created to measure the severity of symptoms and functional limitations experienced by patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). The objectives of this analysis were to establish a scoring algorithm and to examine the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the measures using data from the COMET clinical trial. The COMET trial was a randomized, double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa in patients with LOPD aged 16-78 years at baseline. Adult participants (18 years or older) completed the PDSS and PDIS daily for 14 days at baseline and for 2 weeks before quarterly clinic visits for 1 year after randomization using an electronic diary. Data were pooled across treatment groups for the current analyses. Factor analysis and inter-item correlations were used to derive a scoring algorithm. Test-retest and internal consistency analyses examined the reliability of the measures. Correlations with criterion measures were used to evaluate validity and sensitivity to change. Anchor and distribution-based analyses were conducted to estimate thresholds for meaningful change. Five multi-item domain scores were derived from the PDSS (Shortness of Breath, Overall Fatigue, Fatigue/Pain, Upper Extremity Weakness, Pain) and 2 from the PDIS (Mood, Difficulty Performing Activities). Internal consistency (Cronbach α > 0.90) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation >0.60) of the scores were supported. Cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations with the criterion measures generally supported the validity of the scores (<i>r</i> > 0.40). Within-patient meaningful change estimates ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 points were generated for the PDSS and PDIS domain scores. The PDSS and PDIS are reliable and valid measures of LOPD symptoms and functional impacts. The measures can be used to evaluate burden of LOPD and effects of treatments in clinical trials, observational research, and clinical practice. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02782741."

The diverse clinico-etiological spectrum, high risk of recurrence, and residual disabilities complicate functional outcomes. We aim to describe the clinico-etiological spectrum, radiology, therapeutic options, and follow-up of patients with pre-status dystonicus (pre-SD) and SD. A cross-sectional retrospective study was carried out in a tertiary care referral center. The clinical, laboratory, and radiology data of all patients aged less than 18 years with pre-SD and SD from January 2010 to December 2020 were collected. The Dystonia Severity Assessment Plan (DSAP) scale for grading severity and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for assessing outcome were used at the last follow-up visit. Twenty-eight patients (male:female: 2.1:1) experiencing 33 episodes of acute dystonia exacerbation were identified. The median age at the onset of dystonia and SD presentation was 8.71 (range: 0.25-15.75) and 9.12 (range: 1-16.75) years, respectively. Four patients experienced more than one episode of SD. The etiological spectrum of SD includes metabolic (Wilson's disease-13, L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase deficiency-one, and Gaucher's disease-one), genetic (neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation-three and KMT2B and THAP 1 gene-related-one each), structural-three, post-encephalitic sequelae (PES)-four, and immune-mediated (anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis-one). Five patients had pre-SD (DSAP grade 3), and 23 patients had established SD (DSAP grade 4-17 and DSAP grade 5-six). The Rapid escalation of chelation therapy precipitated SD in 11 patients with Wilson's disease. Febrile illness or pneumonia precipitated SD in nine patients. Twenty-three episodes of SD required midazolam infusion in addition to anti-dystonic medications. The median duration of hospital stay was 10 days (range: 3-29). Twenty-three patients had resolution of SD but residual dystonia persisted, while two patients had no residual dystonia at follow-up. Three patients succumbed owing to refractory SD and its complications. Early identification of triggers, etiology, and appropriate management are essential to calm the dystonic storm."

    "abstract": "Amyloids were conventionally referred to as extracellular and intracellular accumulation of Aβ42 peptide, which causes the formation of plaques and neurofibrillary tangles inside the brain leading to the pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease. Subsequently, amyloid-like deposition was found in the etiology of prion diseases, Parkinson's disease, type II diabetes, and cancer, which was attributed to the aggregation of prion protein, α-Synuclein, islet amyloid polypeptide protein, and p53 protein, respectively. Hence, traditionally amyloids were considered aggregates formed exclusively by proteins or peptides. However, since the last decade, it has been discovered that other metabolites, like single amino acids, nucleobases, lipids, glucose derivatives, etc., have a propensity to form amyloid-like toxic assemblies. Several studies suggest direct implications of these metabolite assemblies in the patho-physiology of various inborn errors of metabolisms like phenylketonuria, tyrosinemia, cystinuria, and Gaucher's disease, to name a few. In this review, we present a comprehensive literature overview that suggests amyloid-like structure formation as a common phenomenon for disease progression and pathogenesis in multiple syndromes. The review is devoted to providing readers with a broad knowledge of the structure, mode of formation, propagation, and transmission of different extracellular amyloids and their implications in the pathogenesis of diseases. We strongly believe a review on this topic is urgently required to create awareness about the understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanism behind the origin of diseases from an amyloid perspective and possibly look for a common therapeutic strategy for the treatment of these maladies by designing generic amyloid inhibitors."

    "abstract": "Multiple Myeloma (MM) and its preexisting stage, termed Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS), have long been considered mainly as genomic diseases. However, the bone changes observed in both conditions have led to a reassessment of the role of the bone microenvironment, mainly the endosteal niche in their genesis. Here, we consider the disruption of the endosteal niche in the bone marrow, that is, the shift of the endosteal niche from an osteoblastic to an osteoclastic profile produced by bone senescence and inflammaging, as the key element. Thus, this disrupted endosteal niche is proposed to represent the permissive microenvironment necessary not only for the emergence of MM from MGUS but also for the emergence and maintenance of MGUS. Moreover, the excess of osteoclasts would favor the presentation of antigens (Ag) into the endosteal niche because osteoclasts are Ag-presenting cells. As such, they could significantly stimulate the presentation of some specific Ag and the clonal expansion of the stimulated cells as well as favor the expansion of such selected clones because osteoclasts are immunosuppressive. We also discuss this scenario in the Gaucher disease, in which the high incidence of MGUS and MM makes it a good model both at the bone level and the immunological level. Finally, we envisage that this endosteal niche disruption would increase the stochasticity (epigenetic and genetic instability) in the selected clones, according to our Tissue Disruption-induced cell Stochasticity (TiDiS) theory."

    "abstract": "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has revolutionised the management of patients with Gaucher disease (GD). In 2018, we published the safety and efficacy of rapid 10-min infusion of velaglucerase alfa in previously treated patients, mostly on low-dose therapy. To improve quality of life (QoL) for patients needing lifelong bi-weekly infusions by introducing a 10-min infusion instead of 1 h per label in patients naive to ERT and on high-dose therapy. Fifteen naive patients were enrolled; all received bi-weekly infusions of 60 units/kgBW velaglucerase alfa; the infusion rate was gradually reduced in the hospital, followed by home infusions. Each infusion was followed for safety. Efficacy parameters were assessed every 3 months. Patient-reported outcome questionnaires were collected at baseline and follow-up. Ten-minute rapid infusions were well tolerated without related severe adverse events (SAEs). Two patients experienced a non-related SAE and another a possibly related AE. In three patients, the infusion rate was increased to 30 or 60 min (two because of suboptimal response and one because of AE). Two patients dropped out because of an unwillingness to attend follow-up visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. All 13 remaining patients reached the 24-month end-point. The platelet counts increased by a median (range) of 68.38% (12.5-300%) and the lyso-Gb1 levels decreased by 62.6% (32.9-89.9%). Home therapy with rapid infusion of high-dose velaglucerase alfa was a safe, effective and preferable alternative for patients with GD naïve to treatment. We believe that shortening the infusion time improves the QoL of patients with GD who have a lifelong commitment to intravenous therapy."

    "title": "Restoration of β-GC trafficking improves the lysosome function in Gaucher disease.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomes function as a primary site for catabolism and cellular signaling. These organelles digest a variety of substrates received through endocytosis, secretion and autophagy with the help of resident acid hydrolases. Lysosomal enzymes are folded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and trafficked to lysosomes via Golgi and endocytic routes. The inability of hydrolase trafficking due to mutations or mutations in its receptor or cofactor leads to cargo accumulation (storage) in lysosomes, resulting in lysosome storage disorder (LSD). In Gaucher disease (GD), the lysosomes accumulate glucosylceramide because of low β-glucocerebrosidase (β-GC) activity that causes lysosome enlargement/dysfunction. We hypothesize that improving the trafficking of mutant β-GC to lysosomes may improve the lysosome function in GD. RNAi screen using high throughput based β-GC activity assay followed by reporter trafficking assay utilizing β-GC-mCherry led to the identification of nine potential phosphatases. Depletion of these phosphatases in HeLa cells enhanced the β-GC activity by increasing the folding and trafficking of Gaucher mutants to the lysosomes. Consistently, the lysosomes in primary fibroblasts from GD patients restored their β-GC activity upon the knockdown of these phosphatases. Thus, these studies provide evidence that altering phosphatome activity is an alternative therapeutic strategy to restore the lysosome function in GD."

    "title": "Economic Burden of Gaucher Disease at a Tertiary Care Public Hospital in Mumbai.",
    "abstract": "To estimate the economic burden of patients diagnosed with Gaucher disease at a public hospital from a societal perspective. Data from 30 Gaucher patients visiting the Genetic Clinic of the Department of Pediatrics at the study site in Mumbai was analyzed between January 2019 and January 2021. A cost of illness analysis was undertaken to estimate direct, indirect and intangible costs. Costs in treated and treatment naive groups were compared. The total cost (direct and indirect) for 30 patients was ₹25,45,74,743/- (3440199.2 USD). Majority of this cost (99.8%) was due to direct costs of which medications [Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and Substrate reduction therapy (SRT)] constituted 98.8%. The notional cost was ₹1,43,94,695. Total costs of 14 treated patients were ₹25,29,67,279 and 16 treatment naive patients were ₹16,15,064 with a ratio of 157:1. Direct costs and cost of school absenteeism were significantly higher in the treated subgroup. Overall, direct, total costs and costs of school absenteeism were significantly associated with age and disease duration. The economic burden of Gaucher disease is a staggering amount. This is an underestimate, as the expenses are highly subsidized in a public health facility. The highest contributor to cost component was direct costs, especially medication costs. Against the backdrop of the National Policy for Rare Diseases, resource allocation towards Gaucher disease should consider short term measures for judicious funding or reimbursement of disease-specific therapy and long-term cost-effective measures for promoting preventive strategies as the most practically feasible solution to reduce this economic burden."

    "title": "A global neuronopathic gaucher disease registry (GARDIAN): a patient-led initiative.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder. GD types 2 and 3 are known as neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD) because they have brain involvement that progresses over time. Implementing a systematic approach to the collection of real-world clinical and patient-relevant outcomes data in nGD presents an opportunity to fill critical knowledge gaps and ultimately help healthcare providers in the management of this patient population. This paper summarizes the development of a patient-initiated Gaucher Registry for Development Innovation and Analysis of Neuronopathic Disease (GARDIAN). The International Gaucher Alliance led the GARDIAN planning, including governance, scope, stakeholder involvement, platform, and reporting. Registry element input was determined in a series of meetings with clinical experts, patients, and caregivers, who identified key clinical variables and the draft content of nGD patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and observer-reported outcomes (ObsRO) focusing on symptoms, patient physical and emotional functioning. These were then tested in cognitive interviews with patients with nGD (> 12 years of age) and caregivers. Core registry data elements (n = 138) were identified by seven global clinical experts from Egypt, Germany, Israel, Japan, United Kingdom (UK), and United State (US) and reviewed via online Delphi method by 14 additional clinicians with experience of nGD from six countries and three pharmaceutical representatives. The elements were consistent with those identified via interviews with 10 patients/caregivers with nGD from Japan, Sweden, UK, and US. Key domains identified were demographics, diagnostic information, health status, clinical symptomatology, laboratory testing, treatment, healthcare resource utilization, aids/home improvements, and patient/caregiver burden and quality of life, specifically physical functioning, self-care, daily and social activities, emotional impacts, support services, and caregiver-specific impacts. Nine caregivers and six patients from the US, UK, China, Mexico, Egypt, and Japan participated in the cognitive interviews that informed revisions to ensure that all items are understandable and interpreted as intended. The comprehensive set of clinical and patient relevant outcomes data, developed collaboratively among all stakeholders, to be reported using GARDIAN will bridge the many gaps in the understanding of nGD and align with regulatory frameworks on real-world data needs."

    "abstract": "GD and ASMD are lysosomal storage disorders that enter into differential diagnosis due to the possible overlap in their clinical manifestations. The availability of safe and effective enzymatic therapies has recently led many investigators to develop and validate new screening tools, such as algorithms, for the diagnosis of LSDs where the lack of disease awareness or failure to implement newborn screening results in a delayed diagnosis. the proposed algorithm allows for the clinical and biochemical differentiation between GD and ASMD. It is based on enzyme activity assessed on dried blood spots by multiplexed tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) coupled to specific biomarkers as second-tier analysis. we believe that this method will provide a simple, convenient and sensitive tool for the screening of a selected population that can be used by pediatricians and other specialists (such as pediatric hematologists and pediatric hepatologists) often engaged in diagnosing these disorders."

    "abstract": "Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is a rare LSD characterized by lysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin, primarily in macrophages. With the recent availability of enzyme replacement therapy, the need for biomarkers to assess severity of disease has increased. Glycoprotein non-metastatic protein B (GPNMB) plasma levels were demonstrated to be elevated in Gaucher disease. Given the similarities between Gaucher disease and ASMD, the hypothesis was that GPNMB might be a potential biochemical marker for ASMD as well. Plasma samples of ASMD patients were analyzed and GPNMB plasma levels were compared to those of healthy volunteers. Visceral disease severity was classified as severe when splenic, hepatic and pulmonary manifestations were all present and as mild to moderate if this was not the case. Median GPNMB levels in 67 samples of 19 ASMD patients were 185 ng/ml (range 70-811 ng/ml) and were increased compared to 10 healthy controls (median 36 ng/ml, range 9-175 ng/ml, p < 0.001). Median plasma GPNMB levels of ASMD patients with mild to moderate visceral disease compared to patients with severe visceral disease differed significantly and did not overlap (respectively 109 ng/ml, range 70-304 ng/ml and 325 ng/ml, range 165-811 ng/ml, p < 0.001). Correlations with other biochemical markers of ASMD (i.e. chitotriosidase activity, CCL18 and lysosphingomyelin, respectively R = 0.28, p = 0.270; R = 0.34, p = 0.180; R = 0.39, p = 0.100) and clinical parameters (i.e. spleen volume, liver volume, diffusion capacity and forced vital capacity, respectively R = 0.59, p = 0.061, R = 0.5, p = 0.100, R = 0.065, p = 0.810, R = -0.38, p = 0.160) could not be established within this study. The results of this study suggest that GPNMB might be suitable as a biomarker of visceral disease severity in ASMD. Correlations between GPNMB and biochemical or clinical markers of ASMD and response to therapy have to be studied in a larger cohort."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the acid β-glucosidase gene (<i>GBA1</i>), leading to a deficiency in the β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme activity resulting in the intracellular accumulation of sphingolipids. Skeletal alterations are one of the most disabling features in GD patients. Although both defective bone formation and increased bone resorption due to osteoblast and osteoclast dysfunction contribute to GD bone pathology, the molecular bases are not fully understood, and bone disease is not completely resolved with currently available specific therapies. For this reason, using editing technology, our group has developed a reliable, isogenic, and easy-to-handle cellular model of GD monocytes (GBAKO-THP1) to facilitate GD pathophysiology studies and high-throughput drug screenings. In this work, we further characterized the model showing an increase in proinflammatory cytokines (Interleukin-1β and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α) release and activation of osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, our data suggest that GD monocytes would display an increased osteoclastogenic potential, independent of their interaction with the GD microenvironment or other GD cells. Both proinflammatory cytokine production and osteoclastogenesis were restored at least, in part, by treating cells with the recombinant human GCase, a substrate synthase inhibitor, a pharmacological chaperone, and an anti-inflammatory compound. Besides confirming that this model would be suitable to perform high-throughput screening of therapeutic molecules that act via different mechanisms and on different phenotypic features, our data provided insights into the pathogenic cascade, leading to osteoclastogenesis exacerbation and its contribution to bone pathology in GD."

This literature review summarizes the development of gene therapy for the GSDs. The abnormal accumulation of glycogen and deficiency of glucose production in GSDs lead to unique symptoms based upon the enzyme step and tissues involved, such as liver and kidney involvement associated with severe hypoglycemia during fasting and the risk of long-term complications including hepatic adenoma/carcinoma and end stage kidney disease in GSD Ia from glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency, and cardiac/skeletal/smooth muscle involvement associated with myopathy +/- cardiomyopathy and the risk for cardiorespiratory failure in Pompe disease. These symptoms are present to a variable degree in animal models for the GSDs, which have been utilized to evaluate new therapies including gene therapy and genome editing. Gene therapy for Pompe disease and GSD Ia has progressed to Phase I and Phase III clinical trials, respectively, and are evaluating the safety and bioactivity of adeno-associated virus vectors. Clinical research to understand the natural history and progression of the GSDs provides invaluable outcome measures that serve as endpoints to evaluate benefits in clinical trials. While promising, gene therapy and genome editing face challenges with regard to clinical implementation, including immune responses and toxicities that have been revealed during clinical trials of gene therapy that are underway. Gene therapy for the glycogen storage diseases is under development, addressing an unmet need for specific, stable therapy for these conditions."

    "title": "Genome-wide Association Identifies Novel Etiological Insights Associated with Parkinson's Disease in African and African Admixed Populations.",
    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying diseases in ancestrally diverse populations is a critical step towards the realization of the global application of precision medicine. The African and African admixed populations enable mapping of complex traits given their greater levels of genetic diversity, extensive population substructure, and distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns. Here we perform a comprehensive genome-wide assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) in 197,918 individuals (1,488 cases; 196,430 controls) of African and African admixed ancestry, characterizing population-specific risk, differential haplotype structure and admixture, coding and structural genetic variation and polygenic risk profiling. We identified a novel common risk factor for PD and age at onset at the <i>GBA1</i> locus (risk, rs3115534-G; OR=1.58, 95% CI = 1.37 - 1.80, P=2.397E-14; age at onset, BETA =-2.004, SE =0.57, P = 0.0005), that was found to be rare in non-African/African admixed populations. Downstream short- and long-read whole genome sequencing analyses did not reveal any coding or structural variant underlying the GWAS signal. However, we identified that this signal mediates PD risk via expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mechanisms. While previously identified <i>GBA1</i> associated disease risk variants are coding mutations, here we suggest a novel functional mechanism consistent with a trend in decreasing glucocerebrosidase activity levels. Given the high population frequency of the underlying signal and the phenotypic characteristics of the homozygous carriers, we hypothesize that this variant may not cause Gaucher disease. Additionally, the prevalence of Gaucher's disease in Africa is low. The present study identifies a novel African-ancestry genetic risk factor in <i>GBA1</i> as a major mechanistic basis of PD in the African and African admixed populations. This striking result contrasts to previous work in Northern European populations, both in terms of mechanism and attributable risk. This finding highlights the importance of understanding population-specific genetic risk in complex diseases, a particularly crucial point as the field moves toward precision medicine in PD clinical trials and while recognizing the need for equitable inclusion of ancestrally diverse groups in such trials. Given the distinctive genetics of these underrepresented populations, their inclusion represents a valuable step towards insights into novel genetic determinants underlying PD etiology. This opens new avenues towards RNA-based and other therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing lifetime risk. Our current understanding of Parkinson's disease (PD) is disproportionately based on studying populations of European ancestry, leading to a significant gap in our knowledge about the genetics, clinical characteristics, and pathophysiology in underrepresented populations. This is particularly notable in individuals of African and African admixed ancestries. Over the last two decades, we have witnessed a revolution in the research area of complex genetic diseases. In the PD field, large-scale genome-wide association studies in the European, Asian, and Latin American populations have identified multiple risk loci associated with disease. These include 78 loci and 90 independent signals associated with PD risk in the European population, nine replicated loci and two novel population-specific signals in the Asian population, and a total of 11 novel loci recently nominated through multi-ancestry GWAS efforts.Nevertheless, the African and African admixed populations remain completely unexplored in the context of PD genetics. To address the lack of diversity in our research field, this study aimed to conduct the first genome-wide assessment of PD genetics in the African and African admixed populations. Here, we identified a genetic risk factor linked to PD etiology, dissected African-specific differences in risk and age at onset, characterized known genetic risk factors, and highlighted the utility of the African and African admixed risk haplotype substructure for future fine-mapping efforts. We identified a novel disease mechanism via expression changes consistent with decreased <i>GBA1</i> activity levels. Future large scale single cell expression studies should investigate the neuronal populations in which expression differences are most prominent. This novel mechanism may hold promise for future efficient RNA-based therapeutic strategies such as antisense oligonucleotides or short interfering RNAs aimed at preventing and decreasing disease risk. We envisage that these data generated under the umbrella of the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program (GP2) will shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in the disease process and might pave the way for future clinical trials and therapeutic interventions. This work represents a valuable resource in an underserved population, supporting pioneering research within GP2 and beyond. Deciphering causal and genetic risk factors in all these ancestries will help determine whether interventions, potential targets for disease modifying treatment, and prevention strategies that are being studied in the European populations are relevant to the African and African admixed populations. We nominate a novel signal impacting <i>GBA1</i> as the major genetic risk factor for PD in the African and African admixed populations. The present study could inform future <i>GBA1</i> clinical trials, improving patient stratification. In this regard, genetic testing can help to design trials likely to provide meaningful and actionable answers. It is our hope that these findings may ultimately have clinical utility for this underrepresented population."

Bilateral femora of 23 patients with type 1 GD receiving low-dose imiglucerase treatment were prospectively scanned using structural magnetic resonance imaging sequences and an IDEAL-IQ sequence. Femoral bone marrow involvement was evaluated by both semiquantification (bone marrow burden [BMB] score based on magnetic resonance imaging structural images) and quantification (FF derived from IDEAL-IQ) methods. These patients were further divided into subgroups according to whether they underwent splenectomy or had bone complications. The interreader agreement of measurements and the correlation between FF and clinical status were statistically analyzed. In patients with GD, both BMB and FF evaluation of femora showed good interreader concordance (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.98 and 0.99, respectively), and FF highly correlated with BMB score ( P < 0.001). The longer the duration of disease, the lower the FF ( P = 0.026).

To determine the specificity and utility of glycosphingolipidoses biomarkers against other LSDs, we applied a multiplexed lipid liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay to a DBS cohort of healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 10) and Gaucher (<i>n</i> = 4), Fabry (<i>n</i> = 10), Pompe (<i>n</i> = 2), mucopolysaccharidosis types I-VI (<i>n</i> = 52), and Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) (<i>n</i> = 5) patients. We observed no complete disease specificity for any of the markers tested. However, comparison among the different LSDs highlighted new applications and perspectives of the existing biomarkers. We observed elevations in glucosylceramide isoforms in the NPC and Gaucher patients relative to the controls. In NPC, there was a greater proportion of C24 isoforms, giving a specificity of 96-97% for NPC, higher than 92% for the NPC biomarker N-palmitoyl-O-phosphocholineserine ratio to lyso-sphingomyelin. We also observed significantly elevated levels of lyso-dihexosylceramide in Gaucher and Fabry disease as well as elevated lyso-globotriaosylceramide (Lyso-Gb3) in Gaucher disease and the neuronopathic forms of Mucopolysaccharidoses. In conclusion, DBS glucosylceramide isoform profiling has increased the specificity for the detection of NPC, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. Low levels of lyso-lipids can be observed in other LSDs, which may have implications in their disease pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "The beta-glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) gene encodes the lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) that metabolizes the lipids glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph). Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in GBA1 such as L444P cause Gaucher disease (GD), which is the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease and is histopathologically characterized by abnormal accumulation of the GCase substrates GlcCer and GlcSph. GD with neurological symptoms is associated with severe mutations in the GBA1 gene, most of which cause impairment in the process of GCase trafficking to lysosomes. Given that recombinant GCase protein cannot cross the blood-brain barrier due to its high molecular weight, it is invaluable to develop a brain-penetrant small-molecule pharmacological chaperone as a viable therapeutic strategy to boost GCase activity in the central nervous system. Despite considerable efforts to screen potent GCase activators/chaperones, cell-free assays using recombinant GCase protein have yielded compounds with only marginal efficacy and micromolar EC<sub>50</sub> that would not have sufficient clinical efficacy or an acceptable safety margin. Therefore, we utilized a fluorescence-labeled GCase suicide inhibitor, MDW933, to directly monitor lysosomal GCase activity and performed a cell-based screening in fibroblasts from a GD patient with homozygotic L444P mutations. Here, we identified novel compounds that increase the fluorescence signal from labeled GCase with L444P mutations in a dose-dependent manner. Secondary assays using an artificial cell-permeable lysosomal GCase substrate also demonstrated that the identified compounds augment lysosomal GCase L444P in the fibroblast. Moreover, those compounds increased the total GCase L444P protein levels, suggesting the pharmacological chaperone-like mechanism of action. To further elucidate the effect of the compounds on the endogenous GCase substrate GlcSph, we generated iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons with a GBA1 L444P mutation that exhibit GlcSph accumulation in vitro. Importantly, the identified compounds reduce GlcSph in iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons with a GBA1 L444P mutation, indicating that the increase in lysosomal GCase resulting from application of the compounds leads to the clearance of pathologically-accumulated GlcSph. Together, our findings pave the way for developing potent and efficacious GCase chaperone compounds as a potential therapeutic approach for neurological GD."

To assess hematologic and visceral outcomes, biomarker changes, and safety of ambroxol therapy for patients with Gaucher disease (GD) without disease-specific treatment. Patients with GD who could not afford enzyme replacement therapy were enrolled and received oral ambroxol from May 6, 2015, to November 9, 2022, at Xinhua Hospital, affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. Thirty-two patients with GD (29 with GD type 1, 2 with GD type 3, and 1 with GD intermediate types 2-3) were enrolled. Of those, 28 patients were followed up for longer than 6 months; 4 were excluded due to loss of follow-up. Data analyses were performed from May 2015 to November 2022. An escalating dose of oral ambroxol (mean [SD] dose, 12.7 [3.9] mg/kg/d). Patients with GD receiving ambroxol were followed up in a genetic metabolism center.

Patients were divided into subgroups according to age when initiating treatment; those who received treatment at a younger age (mean [SD] age, 6.3 [2.7] years) experienced more rapid improvements: hemoglobin concentration increased by 16.5% (from 10.3 [1.5] to 12.0 [1.5] g/dL; mean [SD] change, 1.6 [1.6] g/dL; 95% CI, 0.7-2.5 g/dL; P = .002), and platelet count increased by 12.0% (from 75 [24] to 84 [33] × 103/µL; mean [SD] change, 9 [26] × 103/µL; 95% CI, -5 to 24 × 103/µL; P = .17); whereas chitotriosidase activity decreased by 64.0% (from 15 710 [range, 4092-28 422] to 5658 [range, 1146-16 843] nmol/mL/h; z = -2.803; P = .005), and glucosylsphingosine level decreased by 47.3% (from 248.5 [range, 122.8-674.9] to 131.0 [range, 41.1-448.5] ng/mL; z = -2.385; P = .02). Three of the 28 patients experienced mild and transient adverse events. In this case series of ambroxol repurposing among patients with GD, long-term treatment with ambroxol was safe and associated with patient improvement. Improvements in hematologic parameters, visceral volumes, and plasma biomarkers were larger among patients with relatively mild symptoms of GD and patients who received initial treatment at younger ages."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) diagnosis can be delayed due to non-specific symptoms and lack of awareness, leading to unnecessary procedures and irreversible complications. GAU-PED study aims to assess GD prevalence in a high-risk pediatric population and the presence, if any, of novel clinical or biochemical markers associated with GD. DBS samples were collected and tested for β-glucocerebrosidase enzyme activity for 154 patients selected through the algorithm proposed by Di Rocco et al. Patients showing β-glucocerebrosidase activity below normal values were recalled to confirm the enzyme deficiency with the gold standard essay on cellular homogenate. Patients tested positive at the gold standard analysis were evaluated through GBA1 gene sequencing. 14 out of 154 patients were diagnosed with GD, with a prevalence of 9.09% (5.06-14.78%, CI 95%). Hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia, growth delay/deceleration, elevated serum ferritin, elevated Lyso-Gb1 and chitotriosidase were significantly associated with GD. GD prevalence in a pediatric population at high-risk appeared to be higher compared to high-risk adults. Lyso-Gb1 was associated with GD diagnosis. The algorithm proposed by Di Rocco et al. can potentially improve the diagnostic accuracy of pediatric GD, allowing the prompt start of therapy, aiming to reduce irreversible complications."

A simple stirring allowed the grafting of N-hexyl deoxynojirimycin inhitopes onto their surface by copper-free strain promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition click reaction. The synthesized iminosugars clusters were tested as multivalent inhibitors of the biologically relevant enzymes β-glucocerebrosidase and acid α-glucosidase, involved in Gaucher and Pompe lysosomal storage diseases, respectively. For both enzymes, all the multivalent compounds were more potent than the reference N-hexyl deoxynojirimycin. Remarkably, the final dodecavalent compound proved to be one of the best β-glucocerebrosidase inhibitors described to date. These cyclotriphosphazene-based deoxynojirimycin dendrimers were then evaluated as pharmacological chaperones against Gaucher disease. Not only did these multivalent constructs cross the cell membranes but they were also able to increase β-glucocerebrosidase activity in Gaucher cells. Notably, dodecavalent compound allowed a 1.4-fold enzyme activity enhancement at a concentration as low as 100 nM. These new monofluorocyclooctyne-presenting dendrimers may further find numerous applications in the synthesis of multivalent objects for biological and pharmacological purposes."

She developed severe dystonia in all extremities and a bilateral pill-rolling tremor that did not respond to levodopa treatment. Despite the abrupt onset of symptoms, neither Sanger nor whole genome sequencing revealed pathogenic variants in ATP1A3 associated with rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP).

A substantial correlation between GBA1 genotypes and PD phenotypes could inform the prediction of disease progression and promote the development of a preventive intervention for individuals at a higher risk of a worse disease prognosis. Moreover, the GBA1-regulated pathway provides new perspectives on the pathogenesis of PD, such as dysregulated sphingolipid metabolism, impaired protein quality control, and disrupted endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi trafficking. These perspectives have led to the development of novel disease-modifying therapies for PD targeting the GBA1-regulated pathway by repositioning treatment strategies for Gaucher's disease. This review summarizes the current hypotheses on a mechanistic link between GBA1 variants and PD and possible therapeutic options for modulating GBA1-regulated pathways in PD patients."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in <i>GBA1</i> gene that encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Up to now, specific treatment for GD cannot completely reverse bone complications. Bone is composed of different cell types; including osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are present on bone surfaces and are derived from local mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Depending on environment conditions, MSCs could differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes. Mature adipocytes-secreted adipokines and free fatty acids affect both osteoblasts and osteoclasts formation/activity and therefore mediate skeletal homeostasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate possible alterations in GD adipocyte (GD Ad) that could contribute to bone complications. MSCs were grown in adipogenic media in order to evaluate expression of differentiation markers as PPAR-γ. PPAR-γ was observed into the nucleus of GD Ad, indicating that these cells are properly stimulated. However, these cells accumulate lesser lipid droplets (LDs) than Control Ad. In order to study lipid droplet metabolism, we evaluated the lipolysis of these structures by the measurement of free glycerol in culture supernatant. Our results indicated that GD Ad had an alteration in this process, evidenced by an increase in glycerol release. We have also evaluated two enzymes involved in LDs synthesis: fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1). The transcription of these genes was decreased in GD Ad, suggesting a dysfunction in the synthesis of LDs. In conclusion, our results show an alteration in LDs metabolism of GD Ad, independent of adipocyte differentiation process. This alteration would be caused by an increase in lipolysis in early stages of differentiation and also by a reduction of lipid synthesis, which could contribute with the skeletal imbalance in GD."

This study aimed to apply machine-learning techniques in a cohort of Spanish GD patients by a structured bone marrow MRI reporting model at diagnosis and follow-up to predict the evolution of the bone disease. In total, 441 digitalized MRI studies from 131 patients (M: 69, F:62) were reevaluated by a blinded expert radiologist who applied a structured report template. The studies were classified into categories carried out at different stages as follows: A: baseline; B: between 1 and 4 y of follow-up; C: between 5 and 9 y; and D: after 10 years of follow-up. Demographics, genetics, biomarkers, clinical data, and cumulative years of therapy were included in the model. At the baseline study, the mean age was 37.3 years (1-80), and the median Spanish MRI score (S-MRI) was 8.40 (male patients: 9.10 vs. female patients: 7.71) (<i>p</i> < 0.001). BM clearance was faster and deeper in women during follow-up. Genotypes that do not include the c.1226A>G variant have a higher degree of infiltration and complications (<i>p</i> = 0.017). A random forest machine-learning model identified that BM infiltration degree, age at the start of therapy, and femur infiltration were the most important factors to predict the risk and severity of the bone disease. In conclusion, a structured bone marrow MRI reporting in GD is useful to standardize the collected data and facilitate clinical management and academic collaboration. Artificial intelligence methods applied to these studies can help to predict bone disease complications."

    "abstract": "A salutary effect of treatments for Gaucher disease (GD) has been a reduction in the incidence of avascular osteonecrosis (AVN). However, there are reports of AVN in patients receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) , and it is not known whether it is related to individual treatments, <i>GBA</i> genotypes, phenotypes, biomarkers of residual disease activity, or anti-drug antibodies. Prompted by development of AVN in several patients receiving ERT, we aimed to delineate the determinants of AVN in patients receiving ERT or eliglustat substrate reduction therapy (SRT) during 20 years in a tertiary referral center. Longitudinal follow-ups of 155 GD patients between 2001 and 2021 were analyzed for episodes of AVN on therapy, type of therapy, <i>GBA1</i> genotype, spleen status, biomarkers, and other disease indicators. We applied mixed-effects logistic model to delineate the independent correlates of AVN while receiving treatment. The patients received cumulative 1382 years of treatment. There were 16 episodes of AVN in 14 patients, with two episodes, each occurring in two patients. Heteroallelic p.Asn409Ser GD1 patients were 10 times (95% CI, 1.5-67.2) more likely than p.Asn409Ser homozygous patients to develop osteonecrosis during treatment. History of AVN prior to treatment initiation was associated with 4.8-fold increased risk of AVN on treatment (95% CI, 1.5-15.2). The risk of AVN among patients receiving velaglucerase ERT was 4.68 times higher compared to patients receiving imiglucerase ERT (95% CI, 1.67-13). No patient receiving eliglustat SRT suffered AVN. There was a significant correlation between GlcSph levels and AVN. Together, these biomarkers reliably predicted risk of AVN during therapy (ROC AUC 0.894, p<0.001). There is a low, but significant risk of AVN in GD in the era of ERT/SRT. We found that increased risk of AVN was related to <i>GBA</i> genotype, history of AVN prior to treatment initiation, residual serum GlcSph level, and the type of ERT. No patient receiving SRT developed AVN. These findings exemplify a new approach to biomarker applications in a rare inborn error of metabolism to evaluate clinical outcomes in comprehensively followed patients and will aid identification of GD patients at higher risk of AVN who will benefit from closer monitoring and treatment optimization.

Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) are being developed as an alternative treatment approach for GD and PD. To date, NCGC00241607 (NCGC607) is one of the most promising PCs. Using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation we identified and characterized six allosteric binding sites on the GCase surface suitable for PCs. Two sites were energetically more preferable for NCGC607 and located nearby to the active site of the enzyme. We evaluated the effects of NCGC607 treatment on GCase activity and protein levels, glycolipids concentration in cultured macrophages from GD (<i>n</i> = 9) and GBA-PD (<i>n</i> = 5) patients as well as in induced human pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived dopaminergic (DA) neurons from GBA-PD patient. The results showed that NCGC607 treatment increased GCase activity (by 1.3-fold) and protein levels (by 1.5-fold), decreased glycolipids concentration (by 4.0-fold) in cultured macrophages derived from GD patients and also enhanced GCase activity (by 1.5-fold) in cultured macrophages derived from GBA-PD patients with N370S mutation (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In iPSC-derived DA neurons from GBA-PD patients with N370S mutation NCGC607 treatment increased GCase activity and protein levels by 1.1-fold and 1.7-fold (<i>p</i> < 0.05).

No study has yet specifically explored the spectrum of neuropsychiatric and sensory abnormalities in GD patients through a multidisciplinary approach. Abnormalities involving the nervous system, including sensory abnormalities, cognitive disturbances, and psychiatric comorbidities, have been identified in GD1 and GD3 patients. In this prospective study, named SENOPRO, we performed neurological, neuroradiological, neuropsychological, ophthalmological, and hearing assessments in 22 GD patients: 19 GD1 and 3 GD3. First, we highlighted a high rate of parkinsonian motor and non-motor symptoms (including high rates of excessive daytime sleepiness), especially in GD1 patients harboring severe glucocerebrosidase variants. Secondly, neuropsychological evaluations revealed a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and psychiatric disturbances, both in patients initially classified as GD1 and GD3. Thirdly, hippocampal brain volume reduction was associated with impaired short- and long-term performance in an episodic memory test. Fourthly, audiometric assessment showed an impaired speech perception in noise in the majority of patients, indicative of an impaired central processing of hearing, associated with high rates of slight hearing loss both in GD1 and GD3 patients. Finally, relevant structural and functional abnormalities along the visual system were found both in GD1 and GD3 patients by means of visual evoked potentials and optical coherence tomography. Overall, our findings support the concept of GD as a spectrum of disease subtypes, and support the importance of in-depth periodic monitoring of cognitive and motor performances, mood, sleep patterns, and sensory abnormalities in all patients with GD, independently from the patient's initial classification."

    "abstract": "Gaucher Disease (GD) is a condition resulting from an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, characterized by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase. This leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside and other glycolipids in multiple tissues, causing damage to various organ systems. The diagnosis of GD can be challenging due to its heterogeneity, non-specific symptoms, and variability across different geographic regions and age groups. Although GD is suspected based on symptoms or signs, the diagnosis is confirmed through the measurement of deficient b-glucocerebrosidase activity and the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in the <i>GBA</i> gene. Intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is recommended for GD patients. In this paper, we report a case of a 2-year and 8-month-old girl with massive splenomegaly and radiological finding of hepatic gaucheroma, in whom a genetic study showed homozygous mutation on the <i>GBA</i> gene at c.1448T>C (p.Leu483Pro) and certified the diagnosis of GD. This patient represents the youngest child reported to have gaucheroma and also the first one presenting with gaucheroma at the diagnosis and not during the follow up, highlighting that GD should be routinely included in the differential diagnosis of children presenting with splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, taking into account that the early start of ERT can change the natural history of the disease-preventing serious complications."

    "abstract": "There is a pressing need to improve the accuracy of rare disease clinical study endpoints. Neutral theory, first described here, can be used to assess the accuracy of endpoints and improve their selection in rare disease clinical studies, reducing the risk of patient misclassification. Neutral theory was used to assess the accuracy of rare disease clinical study endpoints and the resulting probability of false positive and false negative classifications at different disease prevalence rates. Search strings were extracted from the Orphanet Register of Rare Diseases using a proprietary algorithm to conduct a systematic review of studies published until January 2021. Overall, 11 rare diseases with one disease-specific disease severity scale (133 studies) and 12 rare diseases with more than one disease-specific disease severity scale (483 studies) were included. All indicators from clinical studies were extracted, and Neutral theory was used to calculate their match to disease-specific disease severity scales, which were used as surrogates for the disease phenotype. For those with more than one disease-severity scale, endpoints were compared with the first disease-specific disease severity scale and a composite of all later scales. A Neutrality score of > 1.50 was considered acceptable. Around half the clinical studies for half the rare diseases with one disease-specific disease severity score (palmoplantar psoriasis, achalasia, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis and Fournier's gangrene) met the threshold for an acceptable match to the disease phenotype, one rare disease (Guillain-Barré syndrome) had one study with an acceptable match, and four diseases (Behcet's syndrome, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome) had no studies. Clinical study endpoints in almost half the rare diseases with more than one disease-specific DSS (acromegaly, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, Fabry disease and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis) were a better match to the composite, while endpoints in the remaining rare diseases (Charcot Marie Tooth disease, Gaucher disease Type I, Huntington's disease, Sjogren's syndrome and Tourette syndrome) were a worse match. Misclassifications varied with increasing disease prevalence. Neutral theory confirmed that disease-severity measurement needs improvement in rare disease clinical studies, especially for some diseases, and suggested that the potential for accuracy increases as the body of knowledge on a disease increases. Using Neutral theory to benchmark disease-severity measurement in rare disease clinical studies may reduce the risk of misclassification, ensuring that recruitment and treatment effect assessment optimise medicine adoption and benefit patients."

GBA also causes the autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder (LSD), Gaucher disease, and emerging evidence from human genetics implicates many other LSD genes in PD susceptibility. We have systemically tested 86 conserved fly homologs of 37 human LSD genes for requirements in the aging adult Drosophila brain and for potential genetic interactions with neurodegeneration caused by α-synuclein (αSyn), which forms Lewy body pathology in PD. Our screen identifies 15 genetic enhancers of αSyn-induced progressive locomotor dysfunction, including knockdown of fly homologs of GBA and other LSD genes with independent support as PD susceptibility factors from human genetics (SCARB2, SMPD1, CTSD, GNPTAB, SLC17A5). For several genes, results from multiple alleles suggest dose-sensitivity and context-dependent pleiotropy in the presence or absence of αSyn. Homologs of two genes causing cholesterol storage disorders, Npc1a / NPC1 and Lip4 / LIPA, were independently confirmed as loss-of-function enhancers of αSyn-induced retinal degeneration. The enzymes encoded by several modifier genes are upregulated in αSyn transgenic flies, based on unbiased proteomics, revealing a possible, albeit ineffective, compensatory response. Overall, our results reinforce the important role of lysosomal genes in brain health and PD pathogenesis, and implicate several metabolic pathways, including cholesterol homeostasis, in αSyn-mediated neurotoxicity."

    "abstract": "Pseudophosphatases are catalytically inactive but share sequence and structural similarities with classical phosphatases. STYXL1 is a pseudophosphatase that belongs to the family of dual-specificity phosphatases and is known to regulate stress granule formation, neurite formation and apoptosis in different cell types. However, the role of STYXL1 in regulating cellular trafficking or the lysosome function has not been elucidated. Here, we show that the knockdown of STYXL1 enhances the trafficking of β-glucocerebrosidase (β-GC) and its lysosomal activity in HeLa cells. Importantly, the STYXL1-depleted cells display enhanced distribution of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), late endosome and lysosome compartments. Further, knockdown of STYXL1 causes the nuclear translocation of unfolded protein response (UPR) and lysosomal biogenesis transcription factors. However, the upregulated β-GC activity in the lysosomes is independent of TFEB/TFE3 nuclear localization in STYXL1 knockdown cells. The treatment of STYXL1 knockdown cells with 4-PBA (ER stress attenuator) significantly reduces the β-GC activity equivalent to control cells but not additive with thapsigargin, an ER stress activator. Additionally, STYXL1-depleted cells show the enhanced contact of lysosomes with ER, possibly via increased UPR. The depletion of STYXL1 in human primary fibroblasts derived from Gaucher patients showed moderately enhanced lysosomal enzyme activity. Overall, these studies illustrated the unique role of pseudophosphatase STYXL1 in modulating the lysosome function both in normal and lysosome-storage disorder cell types. Thus, designing small molecules against STYXL1 possibly can restore the lysosome activity by enhancing ER stress in Gaucher disease."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) GBA gene, which result in macrophage dysfunction. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) editing of the homozygous L444P (1448T→C) GBA mutation in type 2 GD (GBA-/-) human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) yielded both heterozygous (GBA+/-) and homozygous (GBA+/+) isogenic lines. Macrophages derived from GBA-/-, GBA+/- and GBA+/+ hiPSCs showed that GBA mutation correction restores normal macrophage functions: GCase activity, motility, and phagocytosis. Furthermore, infection of GBA-/-, GBA+/- and GBA+/+ macrophages with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strain showed that impaired mobility and phagocytic activity were correlated with reduced levels of bacterial engulfment and replication suggesting that GD may be protective against tuberculosis."

    "title": "Case Report: Novel Pathogenic Variant Detected in Two Siblings with Type 1 Gaucher Disease.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease. The disease develops due to glucocerebrosidase enzyme deficiency caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the glucosylceramidase beta 1 (GBA1) gene, which encodes the glucocerebrosidase enzyme. The GBA1 gene is located at chromosomal location 1q22 and consists of 11 exons. In this article, we report a novel pathogenic variant in the GBA1 gene. A 32-year-old female patient with no known chronic disease was admitted with complaints of weakness, bone pain, and abdominal pain. Her evaluation included hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, osteoporosis, and anemia. The clinical suspicion of Gaucher disease was confirmed by glucocerebrosidase enzyme level and genetic testing. In her family screening, her sister also had hepato-splenomegaly, osteoporosis, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Both sisters had no neurological symptoms. As a result of GBA1 gene sequence analysis in two of our patients, a missense variant was detected in the c.593C > A homozygous genotype. This variant has not been reported in any previously published case. In this case report, we aimed to contribute to the literature by reporting a new novel pathogenic variant in the GBA1 gene leading to type 1 Gaucher disease that has not been described before."

There is not enough information about the course of coronavirus disease in lysosomal storage diseases. This study aimed to evaluate coronavirus disease vaccination status and the impact of coronavirus disease on lysosomal storage disease. The study included 87 lysosomal storage disease patients. The patients' diagnoses were Gaucher, mucopolysaccharidosis I, II, IVA, VI, VII, Fabry, and Pompe. A questionnaire assessing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure, coronavirus disease symptoms, and vaccine status was administered in person or by phone calls. The number of coronavirus disease positive patients was 8 (9.1%). Only 2 patients were treated in the intensive care unit. Other coronavirus disease patients had mild symptoms and stayed in-home quarantine. Patients over 12 years of age could receive a COVID-19 vaccine. 63.5% of those aged ≥12 years were vaccinated. Lysosomal storage disease patients did not have an increased risk of COVID-19 compared to the healthy population, despite the chronic inflammatory disease. Vaccination of lysosomal storage disease patients will be protective against severe coronavirus disease."

Bone involvement is a prevalent finding in Gaucher disease. It causes deformity and limits daily activities and the quality of life. In 75% of patients, there is bone involvement. This review aims to evaluate the principal findings in the jaw by a Cone-beam computed tomography (CBTC) and X-ray orthopantomography; <i>Materials and Methods</i>: PubMed, Web of Science, Lilacs and Scopus were systematically searched until 31 December 2022. In addition, a manual search was performed using the bibliography of selected articles and a Google Scholar search. Clinical studies were selected that considered principal radiographic findings in radiography in a group of patients affected by GD. <i>Results</i>: Out of 5079 papers, four studies were included. The main findings are generalized rarefaction and enlarged narrow space, anodontia. <i>Conclusions</i>: The exact mechanism of bone manifestation is probably due to the infiltration of Gaucher cells in the bone marrow and, consequently, the destruction of bone architecture. All long bones are a potential means of skeletal manifestation. The jaw is more affected than the maxilla, and the principal features are cortical thinning, osteosclerosis, pseudocystic lesions, mental demineralization, flattening in the head of the condyle, effacement of anatomical structures, thickening of maxillary sinus mucosa. The dentist plays a crucial role in diagnosing and treating these patients. Sometimes the diagnosis can be made by a simple panoramic radiograph. All long bones are affected, and the mandible is particularly involved."

    "abstract": "The clinical manifestation of sphingolipidosis leads often to misclassification between acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) and Gaucher disease. In this multicenter, prospective study, we investigated a cohort of 31,838 individuals suspected to have Gaucher disease, due to clinical presentation, from 61 countries between 2017 and 2022. For all samples, both Acid-β-glucocerebrosidase and acid sphingomyelinase enzyme activities were measured in dried blood spot specimens by tandem mass spectrometry followed by genetic confirmatory testing in potential positive cases. In total, 5933 symptomatic cases showed decreased enzyme activities and were submitted for genetic confirmatory testing. 1411/5933 (24%) cases were finally identified with Gaucher disease and 550/5933 (9%) with ASMD. Most of the confirmed ASMD cases were newborns and children below 2 years of age (63%). This study reveals that one in four cases suspected for Gaucher disease is diagnosed with ASMD. An early appropriate diagnostic work-up is essential because of the availability of a recently approved enzyme replacement therapy for ASMD. In conclusion, a diagnostic strategy using differential biochemical testing including genetic confirmatory testing in clinically suspected cases for sphingolipidosis is highly recommended."

    "title": "Targeting the GBA1 pathway to slow Parkinson disease: Insights into clinical aspects, pathogenic mechanisms and new therapeutic avenues.",
    "abstract": "The GBA1 gene encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which is involved in sphingolipid metabolism. Biallelic variants in GBA1 cause Gaucher disease (GD), a lysosomal storage disorder characterised by loss of GCase activity and aberrant intracellular accumulation of GCase substrates. Carriers of GBA1 variants have an increased risk of developing Parkinson disease (PD), with odds ratio ranging from 2.2 to 30 according to variant severity. GBA1 variants which do not cause GD in homozygosis can also increase PD risk. Patients with PD carrying GBA1 variants show a more rapidly progressive phenotype compared to non-carriers, emphasising the need for disease modifying treatments targeting the GBA1 pathway. Several mechanisms secondary to GCase dysfunction are potentially responsible for the pathological changes leading to PD. Misfolded GCase proteins induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequent unfolded protein response and impair the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. This results in α-synuclein accumulation and spread, and promotes neurodegenerative changes. Preclinical evidence also shows that products of GCase activity can promote accumulation of α-synuclein, however there is no convincing evidence of substrate accumulation in GBA1-PD brains. Altered lipid homeostasis secondary to loss of GCase activity could also contribute to PD pathology. Treatments that target the GBA1 pathway could reverse these pathological processes and halt/slow the progression of PD. These range from augmentation of GCase activity via GBA1 gene therapy, restoration of normal intracellular GCase trafficking via molecular chaperones, and substrate reduction therapy. This review discusses the pathways associated with GBA1-PD and related novel GBA1-targeted interventions for PD treatment."

    "abstract": "Gaucher Disease (GD), the most common lysosomal disorder, arises from mutations in the GBA1 gene and is characterized by a wide spectrum of phenotypes, ranging from mild hematological and visceral involvement to severe neurological disease. Neuronopathic patients display dramatic neuronal loss and increased neuroinflammation, whose molecular basis are still unclear. Using a combination of Drosophila dGBA1b loss-of-function models and GD patient-derived iPSCs differentiated towards neuronal precursors and mature neurons we showed that different GD- tissues and neuronal cells display an impairment of growth mechanisms with an increased cell death and reduced proliferation. These phenotypes are coupled with the downregulation of several Hippo transcriptional targets, mainly involved in cells and tissue growth, and YAP exclusion from nuclei. Interestingly, Hippo knock-down in the GBA-KO flies rescues the proliferative defect, suggesting that targeting the Hippo pathway can be a promising therapeutic approach to neuronopathic GD."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), metabolic disorders resulting in build-up of endogenous waste and progressive organ damage, can be treated with intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). ERT can be administered either in specialized clinics, at a physician's office or in the home care setting. Legislative goals in Germany strive to shift to more outpatient care while maintaining treatment objectives. This study investigates the patient perspective on home-based ERT in terms of acceptance, safety, and treatment satisfaction in LSD patients. This was a longitudinal observational study, carried out under real-world conditions in patients' home environment, covering 30 months from January 2019 to June 2021. Patients with LSDs who were deemed suitable for home-based ERT by their physicians were recruited to the study. Patients were interviewed before the start of the first home-based ERT and then at regular intervals thereafter using standardized questionnaires. Data from 30 patients were analyzed: 18 with Fabry disease, 5 with Gaucher disease, 6 with Pompe disease and 1 with Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). Age ranged from 8 to 77 years (mean age 40). The reported average waiting time prior to infusion of more than half an hour decreased from 30% of the patients affected at baseline to 5% across all follow-up time points. All patients felt adequately informed about home-based ERT throughout follow-ups and reported that they would choose home-based ERT again. At almost each time point, patients indicated that home-based ERT had improved their ability to cope with the disease. All but one patient indicated feeling safe at each follow-up time point. Compared to 36.7% at baseline, only 6.9% of patients reported a need for improvement in their care after 6 months of home-based ERT. Mean treatment satisfaction increased by approximately 1.6 scale points after 6 months of home-based ERT compared to baseline, and by another 0.2 scale points after 18 months. In terms of quality of care, all but one patient rated home-based ERT as an equivalent alternative throughout follow-ups. Patients would recommend home-based ERT to other suitable LSD-patients. Home-based ERT increases patients' treatment satisfaction, and patients perceive the quality of care as an equivalent alternative, compared to ERT in a center, clinic, or at a physician's office."

    "abstract": "Ambroxol is a well-known mucolytic expectorant, which has gained much attention in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's and Gaucher's disease. A specific focus has been placed on ambroxol's glucocerebrosidase-stimulating activity, on grounds that the point mutation of the <i>gba1</i> gene, which codes for this enzyme, is a risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease. However, ambroxol has been attributed other characteristics, such as the potent inhibition of sodium channels, modification of calcium homeostasis, anti-inflammatory effects and modifications of oxygen radical scavengers. We hypothesized that ambroxol could have a direct impact on neuronal rescue if administered directly after ischaemic stroke induction. We longitudinally evaluated 53 rats using magnetic resonance imaging to examine stroke volume, oedema, white matter integrity, resting state functional MRI and behaviour for 1 month after ischemic stroke onset. For closer mechanistic insights, we evaluated tissue metabolomics of different brain regions in a subgroup of animals using <i>ex vivo</i> nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Ambroxol-treated animals presented reduced stroke volumes, reduced cytotoxic oedema, reduced white matter degeneration, reduced necrosis, improved behavioural outcomes and complex changes in functional brain connectivity. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy tissue metabolomic data at 24 h post-stroke proposes several metabolites that are capable of minimizing post-ischaemic damage and that presented prominent shifts during ambroxol treatment in comparison to controls. Taking everything together, we propose that ambroxol catalyzes recovery in energy metabolism, cellular homeostasis, membrane repair mechanisms and redox balance. One week of ambroxol administration following stroke onset reduced ischaemic stroke severity and improved functional outcome in the subacute phase followed by reduced necrosis in the chronic stroke phase."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an inherited lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene. The decrease of glucocerebrosidase activity in lysosomes results in the accumulation of its substrate glucocerebroside in the lysosomes of macrophages in organs such as the liver, spleen, bones, lungs, brain and eyes, and the formation of typical storage cells, namely \"Gaucher cells\", leading to lesions in the affected tissues and organs. Hepatosplenomegaly, bone pain, cytopenia, neurological symptoms, and other systemic manifestations are common in clinical practice. Most pediatric patients have severe symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to improve the curative effect and prognosis. However, due to the low incidence of this disease, multi-system involvement in patients, and diverse clinical manifestations, multidisciplinary teamwork is needed for comprehensive evaluation, diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we reported 2 cases of different types of GD who were diagnosed, treated and followed up by multidisciplinary collaboration in infancy."

Both nGD and PD lack disease-modifying treatments and are critical unmet medical needs. In this study, we evaluated a cell therapy treatment using mouse iPSC-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs) engineered to overexpress GCase (termed hGBA1-NPCs). The hGBA1-NPCs secreted GCase that was taken up by adjacent mouse <i>Gba</i> <sup>-/-</sup> neurons and improved GCase activity, reduced GCase substrate accumulation, and improved mitochondrial function. Short-term <i>in vivo</i> effects were evaluated in 9H/PS-NA mice, an nGD mouse model exhibiting neuropathology and α-synuclein aggregation, the typical PD phenotypes. Intravenously administrated hGBA1-NPCs were engrafted throughout the brain and differentiated into neural lineages. GCase activity was increased in various brain regions of treated 9H/PS-NA mice. Compared with vehicle, hGBA1-NPC-transplanted mice showed ∼50% reduction of α-synuclein aggregates in the substantia nigra, significant reduction of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the regions of NPC migration, and increased expression of neurotrophic factors that support neural cell function. Together, these results support the therapeutic benefit of intravenous delivery of iPSC-derived NPCs overexpressing GCase in mitigating nGD and PD phenotypes and establish the feasibility of combined cell and gene therapy for <i>GBA1</i>-associated PD."

Only homozygous D409H variant has been associated with the cardiovascular phenotype which is also known as Gaucher disease type 3c. In this descriptive study, we presented phenotypic heterogeneity and a novel clinical finding among 13 patients with GD type 3c. Patients presented with varying degrees of cardiac valve and/or aortic calcifications (84,6%) and corneal opacities (76,9%) in addition to visceral (100%), hematological (92,3%), neurological (92,3%), and skeletal (30%) manifestations. Also, cervical dystonia (38,4%) and psychiatric disorders (46,1%) were not infrequent entities with respect to neurological involvement in GD type 3c. In this report, we highlight transient neonatal cholestasis (38,4%) as a novel finding in GD type 3c. Neonatal cholestasis is a finding associated with Gaucher type 2, but transient neonatal cholestasis has not been reported in GD patients, so far. The clinical features of GD type 3c are highly heterogeneous, from disease severity or age of onset to disease progression. Also, we concluded that phenotypic spectrum may be associated with age at onset of clinical symptoms. As, patients presenting in infancy or childhood had mainly visceral and hematological involvement and patients presenting in adolescence and adulthood had mainly cardiac, neurological involvement, and psychiatric behavioral disorders. Identifying the heterogeneous clinical course of these patients in this fatal disease, may lead a sufficient understanding of the pathophysiology which will enable targeted therapeutic interventions."

An advisory board of epidemiologists with expertise in health disparities, equity, diversity, and social determinants of health was convened to evaluate and strengthen the initial goal-setting framework. Data sources used were the epidemiologic literature, US Census, and real-world data (RWD); limitations were considered and addressed where appropriate. A framework was designed to safeguard against the underrepresentation of historically medically underserved groups. A stepwise approach was created with Y/N decisions based on empirical data. We compared race and ethnicity distributions in the RWD of six diseases from Pfizer's portfolio chosen to represent different therapeutic areas (multiple myeloma, fungal infections, Crohn's disease, Gaucher disease, COVID-19, and Lyme disease) to the distributions in the US Census and established trial enrollment goals. Enrollment goals for potential CTs were based on RWD for multiple myeloma, Gaucher disease, and COVID-19; enrollment goals were based on the Census for fungal infections, Crohn's disease, and Lyme disease. We developed a transparent and reproducible framework for setting CT diversity enrollment goals. We note how limitations due to data sources can be mitigated and consider several ethical decisions in setting equitable enrollment goals."

Here, we assess the safety and efficacy of 12 months of 600 mg ambroxol per day in three groups of Type 1 GD patients with a suboptimal response to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT), defined as platelet count < 100 × 10<sup>3</sup>/L, lumbar spine bone density T-score < -2.0, and/or LysoGb1 > 200 ng/mL, and for a group of naïve patients who had abnormal values in two of these three parameters. We enrolled 40 patients: 28 ERT- or SRT-treated, and 12 naïve. There were no severe adverse effects (AEs). There were 24 dropouts, mostly due to AEs (<i>n</i> = 12), all transient, and COVID-19 (<i>n</i> = 7). Among the 16 completers, 5 (31.2%) had a >20% increase in platelet count, 6 (37.5%) had a >0.2 increase in T-score, and 3 (18.7%) had a >20% decrease in Lyso-Gb1. This study expands the number of patients exposed to high-dose ABX, showing good safety and satisfactory efficacy, and provides an additional rationale for adding off-label ABX to the arsenal of therapies that could be offered to patients with GD1 and a suboptimal response or those unable to receive ERT or SRT."

    "abstract": "Mutations in glucocerebrosidase cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher's disease and are the most common risk factor for Parkinson's disease. Therapies to restore the enzyme's function in the brain hold great promise for treating the neurological implications. Thus, we developed blood-brain barrier penetrant therapeutic molecules by fusing transferrin receptor-binding moieties to β-glucocerebrosidase (referred to as GCase-BS). We demonstrate that these fusion proteins show significantly increased uptake and lysosomal efficiency compared to the enzyme alone. In a cellular disease model, GCase-BS rapidly rescues the lysosomal proteome and lipid accumulations beyond known substrates. In a mouse disease model, intravenous injection of GCase-BS leads to a sustained reduction of glucosylsphingosine and can lower neurofilament-light chain plasma levels. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of GCase-BS for treating GBA1-associated lysosomal dysfunction, provide insight into candidate biomarkers, and may ultimately open a promising treatment paradigm for lysosomal storage diseases extending beyond the central nervous system."

While clinically heterogeneous, GD encompasses three types, non-neuronopathic (GD1), acute neuronopathic (GD2), and chronic neuronopathic (GD3). Newborn screening (NBS), which has made remarkable inroads in detecting certain diseases before detrimental health consequences and fatality ensues, is now being piloted for GD in several states and countries. Early on, clinical features of GD2 can overlap with GD3; hence, predicting outcome is challenging. As NBS for GD becomes more available, the increased detection of GD in neonates is inevitable. As a result, health care providers and families will be faced with uncertainty with respect to clinical management. Since more severe GBA1 variants are generally associated with neuronopathic GD, there has been an increased dependence on genotypic information. We present an infant detected by NBS with genotype D409H(p.Asp448His)/RecNciI (p.Leu483Pro; p.Ala495Pro;p.Val499=). To assist in genetic counseling, we performed a retrospective review of other patients in our cohort carrying D409H and reviewed the literature.

Monitoring intervals were prolonged in 8/11 centres from a median of 9 to 12 months. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was changed to home ERT in 4 patients and substituted by oral substrate reduction therapy (SRT) in 6 patients. From March 2020 to October 2021, no serious complications of GD were documented. Only 4 SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported (1.6%). Two infections were asymptomatic and two mild; all occurred in adult type 1, non-splenectomized patients on ERT. Vaccination rate in adult GD was 79.5% (95.3% mRNA vaccines). Serious vaccination complications were not reported. The COVID-19 pandemic has lowered the threshold for switching from practice- or hospital-based ERT to home therapy or to SRT. No major GD complication was documented during the pandemic. Infection rate with SARS-CoV-2 in GD may rather be lower than expected, and its severity is mild. Vaccination rates are high in GD patients and vaccination was well tolerated."

Here, we employ global proteomic and single-cell genomic approaches in stable cell lines as well as induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and midbrain organoids to dissect the mechanisms underlying GCase-related neurodegeneration. We demonstrate that GCase can be imported from the cytosol into the mitochondria via recognition of internal mitochondrial targeting sequence-like signals. In mitochondria, GCase promotes the maintenance of mitochondrial complex I (CI) integrity and function. Furthermore, GCase interacts with the mitochondrial quality control proteins HSP60 and LONP1. Disease-associated mutations impair CI stability and function and enhance the interaction with the mitochondrial quality control machinery. These findings reveal a mitochondrial role of GCase and suggest that defective CI activity and energy metabolism may drive the pathogenesis of GCase-linked neurodegeneration."

At the most severe end there is the perinatal form with onset in utero or during the neonatal period. The very few reported cases of neonatal onset Gaucher disease presented high and early mortality, due to neurological or visceral involvement, including liver failure. We report our experience treating a patient with the neonatal form of Gaucher disease who presented at birth with thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly and cholestasis. Despite early enzyme replacement therapy, liver disease was progressive. Liver biopsy showed hepatocellular giant-cell transformation, a nonspecific finding consistent with inflammation. The lack of response to enzyme replacement therapy and the microscopic findings suggested that mechanisms apart from substrate accumulation and Gaucher cells may play a role in the hepatic pathogenesis in Gaucher disease. An attempt to use corticosteroids at the age of 3 months resulted in a dramatic improvement in liver function and resulted in long-term survival. The patient is alive and 2 years old at this writing. Our case suggests that inflammatory processes may be important in the early pathogenesis of Gaucher disease and that early use of corticosteroids may open the way to a new therapeutic approach."

In the literature, 10 articles reported Gaucheromas, most of them in the liver and spleen in type 1 GD patients. All our patients were also type 1 GD, and the ultrasound aspect did not change during the 5 years follow-up. Gaucheromas can be found in any patient with GD. Malignancies have to be considered unless proven otherwise. Imaging characterization (ultrasound and MRI) are useful as histopathologic examination is difficult to obtain in all cases."

    "abstract": "Since the ban or reduction on the use of antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) in commercial broiler chickens in many countries, avian necrotic enteritis (NE) caused by Clostridium perfringens has re-emerged as one of the biggest threats for the poultry industry worldwide. While the toolbox for controlling NE in the absence of antibiotics consists of a limited number of alternatives for which the overall effectiveness has yet proven to be suboptimal, an effective vaccine would represent the best control strategy for this often-deadly disease. Using a comparative and subtractive reverse vaccinology approach, we previously identified 14 putative antigenic proteins unique to NE-causing strains of C. perfringens. In the current work, the in silico findings were confirmed by PCR and sequencing, and five vaccine candidate proteins were produced and purified subsequently. Among them, two candidates were hypothetical proteins, two candidates were prepilin proteins which are predicted to form the subunits of a pilus structure, and one candidate was a non-heme iron protein. Western blotting and ELISA results showed that immunization of broiler chickens with five of these proteins raised antibodies which can specifically recognize both the recombinant and native forms of the protein in pathogenic C. perfringens."

    "title": "Nature-Inspired Bioactive Compounds: A Promising Approach for Ferroptosis-Linked Human Diseases?",
    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a type of cell death driven by iron overload and lipid peroxidation. It is considered a key mechanism in the development of various diseases such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer, diabetes, cancer, and renal failure. The redox status of cells, such as the balance between intracellular oxidants (lipid peroxides, reactive oxygen species, free iron ions) and antioxidants (glutathione, glutathione Peroxidase 4), plays a major role in ferroptosis regulation and constitutes its principal biomarkers. Therefore, the induction and inhibition of ferroptosis are promising strategies for disease treatments such as cancer or neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, respectively. Many drugs have been developed to exert ferroptosis-inducing and/or inhibiting reactions, such as erastin and iron-chelating compounds, respectively. In addition, many natural bioactive compounds have significantly contributed to regulating ferroptosis and ferroptosis-induced oxidative stress. Natural bioactive compounds are largely abundant in food and plants and have been for a long time, inspiring the development of various low-toxic therapeutic drugs. Currently, functional bioactive peptides are widely reported for their antioxidant properties and application in human disease treatment. The scientific evidence from biochemical and in vitro tests of these peptides strongly supports the existence of a relationship between their antioxidant properties (such as iron chelation) and ferroptosis regulation. In this review, we answer questions concerning ferroptosis milestones, its importance in physiopathology mechanisms, and its downstream regulatory mechanisms. We also address ferroptosis regulatory natural compounds as well as provide promising thoughts about bioactive peptides."

    "abstract": "Quantitative chemical shift imaging (QCSI) is the most sensitive imaging biomarker to assess bone marrow involvement in Gaucher disease. Widespread QCSI use is limited by test availability. Anecdotal reports describe two patients demonstrating significant improvement in fat fraction (FF) assessed by QCSI following a switch from imiglucerase to taliglucerase alfa. This analysis evaluated bone marrow involvement in adults with Type 1 Gaucher disease receiving low-dose enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with imiglucerase and/or velaglucerase alfa. We report baseline data for 30 patients meeting eligibility criteria. Median (range) duration and dose of ERT were 18 (5-26) years and 30 (30-60) U/kg/month, respectively. Low FF scores (<0.30) were observed for seven patients (23%; 95% confidence interval, 10-42%) and were more common in females (<i>n</i> = 6) versus males (<i>n</i> = 1; <i>p</i> < 0.025); one female was menopausal. These baseline data demonstrate that prolonged low-dose ERT with imiglucerase or velaglucerase alfa led to an adequate bone response, assessed by QCSI, in the majority of patients. A minority of such patients with suboptimal bone response require therapeutic change. The next phase of the study will address the effect of switching to taliglucerase alfa on bone status for patients with less than optimal QCSI scores (<0.30)."

    "title": "A 20-Year Longitudinal Study of Plasma Chitotriosidase Activity in Treated Gaucher Disease Type 1 and 3 Patients-A Qualitative and Quantitative Approach.",
    "abstract": "Chitotriosidase is an enzyme produced and secreted in large amounts by activated macrophages, especially macrophages loaded with phagocytozed glycosphingolipid in Gaucher disease. Macrophages phagocytose decayed blood cells that contain a lot of sphingolipid-rich cell membranes. In Gaucher disease, due to a deficit in beta-glucocerebrosidase activity, the phagocytozed substrate glucocerebroside cannot undergo further catabolism. In such a situation, macrophages secrete chitotriosidase in proportion to the degree of overload. Gaucher disease (GD) is a recessively inherited disorder resulting in storage of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) in lysosomes of tissue macrophages. It is directly caused by the deficiency of beta-glucocerebrosidase (GBA) activity. Chitotriosidase has been measured systematically each year in the same group of 49 patients with type 1 and 3 GD for over 20 years. Our analysis showed that chitotriosidase is very sensitive biomarker to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). The response to treatment introduction is of an almost immediate nature, lowering pathologically high chitotriosidase levels by a factor of 2 in a time scale of 8 months, on average. Long term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) brings chitotriosidase activity close to reference values. Finally, reducing the dose of ERT quickly boosts chitotriosidase activity, but restoring the initial dose of treatment brings chitotriosidase level of activity back onto the decreasing time trajectory."

    "abstract": "The risks and benefits of medication use in pregnancy are typically established through post-marketing observational studies. As there is currently no standardised or systematic approach to the post-marketing assessment of medication safety in pregnancy, data generated through pregnancy pharmacovigilance (PregPV) research can be heterogenous and difficult to interpret. The aim of this article is to describe the development of a reference framework of core data elements (CDEs) for collection in primary source PregPV studies that can be used to standardise data collection procedures and, thereby, improve data harmonisation and evidence synthesis capabilities. This CDE reference framework was developed within the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) ConcePTION project by experts in pharmacovigilance, pharmacoepidemiology, medical statistics, risk-benefit communication, clinical teratology, reproductive toxicology, genetics, obstetrics, paediatrics, and child psychology. The framework was produced through a scoping review of data collection systems used by established PregPV datasets, followed by extensive discussion and debate around the value, definition, and derivation of each data item identified from these systems. The finalised listing of CDEs comprises 98 individual data elements, arranged into 14 tables of related fields. These data elements are openly available on the European Network of Teratology Information Services (ENTIS) website ( http://www.entis-org.eu/cde ). With this set of recommendations, we aim to standardise PregPV primary source data collection processes to improve the speed at which high-quality evidence-based statements can be provided about the safety of medication use in pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare and very dangerous condition characterized by abnormal activation of the immune system, causing hemophagocytosis, inflammation, and potentially widespread organ damage. The primary (genetic) form, caused by mutations affecting lymphocyte cytotoxicity, is most commonly seen in children. Secondary HLH is commonly associated with infections, malignancies, and rheumatologic disorders. Most current information on diagnosis and treatment is based on pediatric populations. HLH is a disease that should be diagnosed and treated promptly, otherwise it is fatal. Treatment is directed at treating the triggering disorder, along with symptomatic treatment with dexamethasone and etoposide. We present a 56-year-old patient who was admitted with worsening weakness, exertional dyspnea, dry and nonproductive cough, and a 5-pound weight loss associated with loss of appetite. This is among the rare disorders that are not commonly encountered in day-to-day practice. Our differential diagnoses were broad, including infection, such as visceral leishmaniasis, atypical/tuberculous mycobacteria, histoplasmosis, Ehrlichia, Bartonella, Brucella, Adenovirus, disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV), hematological-like Langerhans cell histiocytosis, or multicentric Castleman disease; drug reaction, such as drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS); and metabolic disorder, including Wolman's disease (infantile lysosomal acid lipase deficiency) or Gaucher's disease. Based on our investigations as described in our case report, it was narrowed down to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and COVID-19. Two COVID-19 tests were negative. His lab abnormalities and diagnostic testing revealed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. He was empirically started on antibiotics and dexamethasone, to be continued for 2 weeks then tapered if the patient showed continued improvement. Dexamethasone was tapered over 8 weeks. He improved on just one of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications, proving that treatment should be tailored to the patient. In addition, in this case study, we included the background, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of HLH."

    "abstract": "We wished to determine whether rare diseases patients from India had been enrolled in international trials to develop novel orphan drugs. There are two reasons to be interested in this. (a) Different ethnic or racial groups may respond differently to a particular drug. India has huge ethnic diversity, and to exclude such participants is to severely limit the diversity of any trial; (b) Even if a suitable drug for a rare disease is available in India, it may be astronomically priced, in a country where most healthcare expenditure is out-of-pocket. We identified 63 orphan drugs, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after 2008, for which there were 202 trials in the US government's clinical trial registry, ClinicalTrials.gov. Only nine of these trials had run in India. These trials pertained to six drugs. The drugs were for the conditions B-cell Lymphoma, Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, Gaucher disease Type 1, Malaria, Myeloma and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. Further research is required as to why patients from India are not part of foreign drug development programmes for rare diseases. We then asked how many of the remaining 193 trials had recruited people of Indian origin, residing in other countries, and found that not more than 1% of these trials had done so. Also, only 11 of the 193 trials had recruited from other lower income countries. Participation from low-income countries in trials for orphan drugs is poor."

Due to the decrease or lack of glucocerebrosidase (<i>GBA</i>) activity in lysosome caused by the mutation of <i>GBA</i> gene, its substrate glucocerebroside is detained in lysosome, resulting in clinical manifestations of liver, spleen, kidney, bone, hematopoietic system and even nervous system involvement. Here, we report a case of elderly patient presenting marked multiple bone destruction, with childhood medical history of splenectomy and \"osteomyelitis\". The patient has a significantly enlarged liver, accompanied by anemia, thrombocytopenia and osteopenia. Laboratory studies show this patient has low blood GBA activity and high glucosyl sphingosine level and increased chitotriosidase activity. Genetic testing revealed a homozygous missense variant NM_001005741.2 c.770A>G (p.Asp257Gly) in the patient's <i>GBA</i> gene. After 6 months of enzyme replacement therapy, the patient's platelets returned to normal, anemia improved, and liver volume decreased. Further detections show that the mother and brothers of the patient have heterozygous mutations at this locus, which is consistent with Mendelian inheritance law. Although this variant has not been reported in literatures or database, both clinical manifestations, characteristics of enzymology and biomarkers, and the effect of enzyme replacement therapy support the diagnosis of Gaucher's disease. The Asp257Gly variant is therefore assessed as a clinical pathogenic variant. This study expands the spectrum of the <i>GBA</i> gene variants. The diagnosis and treatment process of this case also provide reference for the early identification, diagnosis and early treatment of this kind of patients."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD), one of the most common lysosomal storage diseases, is caused by GBA1 mutations resulting in defective glucocerebrosidase (GCase) and consequent accumulation of its substrates β-glucosylceramide (β-GlcCer). We reported progranulin (PGRN), a secretary growth factor-like molecule and an intracellular lysosomal protein was a crucial co-factor of GCase. PGRN binds to GCase and recruits Heat Shock Protein 70 (Hsp70) to GCase through its C-terminal Granulin (Grn) E domain, termed as ND7. In addition, both PGRN and ND7 are therapeutic against GD. Herein we found that both PGRN and its derived ND7 still displayed significant protective effects against GD in Hsp70 deficient cells. To delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying PGRN's Hsp70-independent regulation of GD, we performed a biochemical co-purification and mass spectrometry with His-tagged PGRN and His-tagged ND7 in Hsp70 deficient cells, which led to the identification of ERp57, also referred to as protein disulfide isomerase A3 (PDIA3), as a protein that binds to both PGRN and ND7. Within type 2 neuropathic GD patient fibroblasts L444P, bearing GBA1 L444P mutation, deletion of ERp57 largely abolished the therapeutic effects of PGRN and ND7, as manifested by loss of effects on lysosomal storage, GCase activity, and β-GlcCer accumulation. Additionally, recombinant ERp57 effectively restored the therapeutic effects of PGRN and ND7 in ERp57 knockout L444P fibroblasts. Collectively, this study reports ERp57 as a previously unrecognized binding partner of PGRN that contributes to PGRN regulation of GD."

Heterozygous GBA1 variants are also a common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). GD manifests with considerable clinical heterogeneity and is also associated with an increased risk for PD. The objective of this study was to investigate the contribution of PD risk variants to risk for PD in patients with GD1. We studied 225 patients with GD1, including 199 without PD and 26 with PD. All cases were genotyped, and the genetic data were imputed using common pipelines. On average, patients with GD1 with PD have a significantly higher PD genetic risk score than those without PD (P = 0.021). Our results indicate that variants included in the PD genetic risk score were more frequent in patients with GD1 who developed PD, suggesting that common risk variants may affect underlying biological pathways. © 2023 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), the deacylated form of glucocerebroside, was shown to be the most specific and sensitive biomarker for diagnosing Gaucher disease (GD). The aim of this study is to assess the contribution of lyso-Gb1 at the time of diagnosis for treatment decisions in naïve patients with GD. Newly diagnosed patients from July 2014 to November 2022 were included in this retrospective cohort study. The diagnosis was done by sending a dry blood spot (DBS) sample for <i>GBA1</i> molecular sequencing and lyso-Gb1 quantification. Treatment decisions were based on symptoms, signs, and routine laboratory tests. We diagnosed 97 patients (41 males), both type 1 (<i>n</i> = 87), and neuronopathic (<i>n</i> = 10). The median (range) age at diagnosis was 22 (1-78), with 36 children. In 65 patients, GD-specific therapy was started with a median (range) lyso-Gb1, 337 (60-1340) ng/mL, significantly higher than in patients who did not go on to treatment, 153.5 (9-442) ng/mL. Using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, a cutoff of lyso-Gb1 > 250 ng/mL was associated with treatment with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 87.5%. Predictors of treatment were thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated lyso-Gb1 (>250 ng/mL). In conclusion, lyso-Gb1 levels contribute to the medical decision related to the initiation of treatment, mainly among mildly affected newly diagnosed patients. For patients with a severe phenotype, as for all patients, the main value of lyso-Gb1 would be to monitor response to therapy. The variable methodology and differences in the units of lyso-Gb1 measurements between laboratories prevent the adaptation of the exact cut-off we found in general practice. However, the concept is that a significant elevation, i.e., a several-fold increase from the diagnostic lyso-Gb1 cutoff, is related to a more severe phenotype and, accordingly, to the decision regarding the initiation of GD-specific therapy."

Biallelic mutations in GBA1 cause the human inherited metabolic disorder, Gaucher disease (GD), in which GlcCer accumulates, while heterozygous GBA1 mutations are the highest genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Recombinant GCase (e.g., Cerezyme<sup>®</sup> ) is produced for use in enzyme replacement therapy for GD and is largely successful in relieving disease symptoms, except for the neurological symptoms observed in a subset of patients. As a first step toward developing an alternative to the recombinant human enzymes used to treat GD, we applied the PROSS stability-design algorithm to generate GCase variants with enhanced stability. One of the designs, containing 55 mutations compared to wild-type human GCase, exhibits improved secretion and thermal stability. Furthermore, the design has higher enzymatic activity than the clinically used human enzyme when incorporated into an AAV vector, resulting in a larger decrease in the accumulation of lipid substrates in cultured cells. Based on stability-design calculations, we also developed a machine learning-based approach to distinguish benign from deleterious (i.e., disease-causing) GBA1 mutations. This approach gave remarkably accurate predictions of the enzymatic activity of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the GBA1 gene that are not currently associated with GD or PD. This latter approach could be applied to other diseases to determine risk factors in patients carrying rare mutations."

All subjects demonstrated sustained serum GAA activities from 101% to 235% of baseline trough activity 2 weeks following the preceding ERT dose. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. No subject had anti-capsid T cell responses that decreased transgene expression.

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease. The disease involves excessive accumulation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, and myofibroblasts differentiated by pro-fibrotic factors promote the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and fibronectin. Transforming growth factor-β1 is a pro-fibrotic factor that promotes fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD). Therefore, inhibition of FMD may be an effective strategy for IPF treatment. In this study, we screened the anti-FMD effects of various iminosugars and showed that some compounds, including N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ, miglustat, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)), a clinically approved drug for treating Niemann-Pick disease type C and Gaucher disease type 1, inhibited TGF-β1-induced FMD by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of Smad2/3. N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin having GCS inhibitory effect did not attenuate the TGF-β1-induced FMD, suggesting that NB-DNJ exerts the anti-FMD effects by GCS inhibitory effect independent manner. N-butyldeoxynojirimycin did not inhibit TGF-β1-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation. In a mouse model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis, intratracheal or oral administration of NB-DNJ at an early fibrotic stage markedly ameliorated lung injury and deterioration of respiratory functions, such as specific airway resistance, tidal volume, and peak expiratory flow. Furthermore, the anti-fibrotic effects of NB-DNJ in the BLM-induced lung injury model were similar to those of pirfenidone and nintedanib, which are clinically approved drugs for the treatment of IPF. These results suggest that NB-DNJ may be effective for IPF treatment."

    "abstract": "Genetic variants in GBA, encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), are common risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). Genotype-phenotype studies have demonstrated that different types of GBA variants have differential effects on the phenotype. Variants could be classified as mild or severe depending on the type of Gaucher disease they cause in the biallelic state. It was shown that severe GBA variants, as compared to mild variants, are associated with higher risk of PD, earlier age at onset, and faster progression of motor and nonmotor symptoms. The observed difference in phenotype might be caused by a diversity of cellular mechanisms related to the particular variants. The lysosomal function of GCase is thought to play a significant role in the development of GBA-associated PD, and other mechanisms such as endoplasmic reticulum retention, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation have also been suggested. Moreover, genetic modifiers such as LRRK2, TMEM175, SNCA, and CTSB can either affect GCase activity or modulate risk and age at onset of GBA-associated PD. To achieve ideal outcomes with precision medicine, therapies will have to be tailored to individuals with specific variants, potentially in combination with known modifiers."

Currently, several biomarkers are available for disease monitoring. Chitotriosidase has been used over the last 20 years to assess the severity of GD, but lacks specificity in GD patients. Conversely, the deacylated form of glucosylceramide, glucosylsphingosine (also known as lyso-Gb1), represents a more reliable biomarker characterized by its high sensitivity and specificity in GD. Herein, we review the current literature on lyso-Gb1 and describe evidence supporting its usefulness as a biomarker for diagnosing and evaluating disease severity in GD and monitoring treatment efficacy. Lyso-Gb1 is the most promising biomarker of GD, as demonstrated by its reliability in reflecting disease burden and monitoring treatment response. Furthermore, lyso-Gb1 may play an important role in the onset of monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance, multiple myeloma, and Parkinson's disease in GD patients."

    "abstract": "Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) A/B is a lysosomal storage disease (LSD), caused by an autosomal recessive disorder that causes variation in sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase-1 (SMPD1). Systemic signs are cholestatic jaundice in the neonatal period or hepatosplenomegaly in infancy. The clinical course experienced by our patient did not correspond to the classic phenotypes. The diagnosis was effectively made at four years and three months of age when different signs such as abdominal distension, hepatosplenomegaly, and chronic malnutrition were present. Given the high suspicion of metabolic storage disease, an enzyme activity study, liver and bone marrow biopsies, and molecular studies were performed. In the bone marrow biopsy, pseudo-Gaucher foam cells were observed. Additionally, the liver biopsy showed dispersed ballooned cells with deposit material and nested cells with granular material. The double enzymatic assay was ordered to determine if the cause of these findings was due to Niemann-Pick or Gaucher disease; decreased sphingomyelinase activity values were obtained (0.28 mcoml/L/h). Subsequently, the molecular genetics study reported a double alteration in the sequence that encodes the SMPD1 gene, located on chromosome 11p15.4, which confirmed NPD type A or B. The overlap and the lack of some findings made the diagnosis very difficult. Diagnosis is crucial due to the multisystem involvement that this LSD can have."

Here, we report a patient with GD who carried the heterozygous c.1240G > C (p.Val414Leu) mutation and the heterozygous pathogenic c.1342G > C (p.Asp448His) mutation in <i>GBA1</i>. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the two mutations are pathogenic. Functional studies showed that <i>GBA1</i> mRNA and GCase protein levels of mutant types were significantly less than the wild-type. In the cell lysates, the two mutations of <i>GBA1</i> c.1240G > C and c.1342G > C caused a decreased GCase concentration, while the two mutations did not change the distribution in the cell. The pathogenicity of the compound heterozygous mutations was verified. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the quality of life and prevent unnecessary procedures in patients with GD."

    "title": "<i>GBA1</i> Gene Mutations in α-Synucleinopathies-Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Pathology and Their Clinical Significance.",
    "abstract": "α-Synucleinopathies comprise a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by altered accumulation of a protein called α-synuclein inside neurons and glial cells. This aggregation leads to the formation of intraneuronal inclusions, Lewy bodies, that constitute the hallmark of α-synuclein pathology. The most prevalent α-synucleinopathies are Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). To date, only symptomatic treatment is available for these disorders, hence new approaches to their therapy are needed. It has been observed that <i>GBA1</i> mutations are one of the most impactful risk factors for developing α-synucleinopathies such as PD and DLB. Mutations in the <i>GBA1</i> gene, which encodes a lysosomal hydrolase β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), cause a reduction in GCase activity and impaired α-synuclein metabolism. The most abundant <i>GBA1</i> gene mutations are N370S or N409S, L444P/L483P and E326K/E365K. The mechanisms by which GCase impacts α-synuclein aggregation are poorly understood and need to be further investigated. Here, we discuss some of the potential interactions between α-synuclein and GCase and show how <i>GBA1</i> mutations may impact the course of the most prevalent α-synucleinopathies."

    "abstract": "Induction of lipid-laden foamy macrophages is a cellular hallmark of tuberculosis (TB) disease, which involves the transformation of infected phagolysosomes from a site of killing into a nutrient-rich replicative niche. Here, we show that a terpenyl nucleoside shed from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 1-tuberculosinyladenosine (1-TbAd), caused lysosomal maturation arrest and autophagy blockade, leading to lipid storage in M1 macrophages. Pure 1-TbAd, or infection with terpenyl nucleoside-producing M. tuberculosis, caused intralysosomal and peribacillary lipid storage patterns that matched both the molecules and subcellular locations known in foamy macrophages. Lipidomics showed that 1-TbAd induced storage of triacylglycerides and cholesterylesters and that 1-TbAd increased M. tuberculosis growth under conditions of restricted lipid access in macrophages. Furthermore, lipidomics identified 1-TbAd-induced lipid substrates that define Gaucher's disease, Wolman's disease, and other inborn lysosomal storage diseases. These data identify genetic and molecular causes of M. tuberculosis-induced lysosomal failure, leading to successful testing of an agonist of TRPML1 calcium channels that reverses lipid storage in cells. These data establish the host-directed cellular functions of an orphan effector molecule that promotes survival in macrophages, providing both an upstream cause and detailed picture of lysosome failure in foamy macrophages."

    "abstract": "Bi-allelic mutations in GBA1, the gene that encodes β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), cause Gaucher disease (GD), whereas mono-allelic mutations do not cause overt pathology. Yet mono- or bi-allelic GBA1 mutations are the highest known risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). GCase deficiency results in the accumulation of glucosylceramide (GluCer) and its deacylated metabolite glucosylsphingosine (GluSph). Brains from patients with neuronopathic GD have high levels of GluSph, and elevation of this lipid in GBA1-associated PD has been reported. To uncover the mechanisms involved in GBA1-associated PD, we used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic (DA) neurons from patients harboring heterozygote mutations in GBA1 (GBA1/PD-DA neurons). We found that compared with gene-edited isogenic controls, GBA1/PD-DA neurons exhibit mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) hyperactivity, a block in autophagy, an increase in the levels of phosphorylated α-synuclein (129) and α-synuclein aggregation. These alterations were prevented by incubation with mTOR inhibitors. Inhibition of acid ceramidase, the lysosomal enzyme that deacylates GluCer to GluSph, prevented mTOR hyperactivity, restored autophagic flux and lowered α-synuclein levels, suggesting that GluSph was responsible for these alterations. Incubation of gene-edited wild type (WT) controls with exogenous GluSph recapitulated the mTOR/α-synuclein abnormalities of GBA1/PD neurons, and these phenotypic alterations were prevented when GluSph treatment was in the presence of mTOR inhibitors. We conclude that GluSph causes an aberrant activation of mTORC1, suppressing normal lysosomal functions, including the clearance of pathogenic α-synuclein species. Our results implicate acid ceramidase in the pathogenesis of GBA1-associated PD, suggesting that this enzyme is a potential therapeutic target for treating synucleinopathies caused by GCase deficiency."

    "abstract": "Biallelic mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (<i>GBA1</i>) gene cause Gaucher disease, characterized by lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine in macrophages. Gaucher and other lysosomal diseases occur with high frequency in Ashkenazi Jews. It has been proposed that the underlying mutations confer a selective advantage, in particular conferring protection against tuberculosis. Here, using a zebrafish Gaucher disease model, we find that the mutation <i>GBA1</i> N370S, predominant among Ashkenazi Jews, increases resistance to tuberculosis through the microbicidal activity of glucosylsphingosine in macrophage lysosomes. Consistent with lysosomal accumulation occurring only in homozygotes, heterozygotes remain susceptible to tuberculosis. Thus, our findings reveal a mechanistic basis for protection against tuberculosis by <i>GBA1</i> N370S and provide biological plausibility for its selection if the relatively mild deleterious effects in homozygotes were offset by significant protection against tuberculosis, a rampant killer of the young in Europe through the Middle Ages into the 19th century."

    "abstract": "In Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1), accumulation of the lipid substrates glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine (lyso-GL-1 or lyso-Gb1), primarily in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, leads to progressive hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and skeletal disease. Plasma glucosylceramide elevations are modest, variable, and normalize within weeks of starting treatment before clinical changes are evident, and therefore, have limited value for monitoring treatment responses. Serum chitotriosidase activity, a widely used GD biomarker, is also elevated in many other conditions but is not measurable in 5-10% of individuals due to a common CHIT1 null variant. Plasma glucosylsphingosine is increasingly recognized as a useful biomarker for GD1: elevations are highly specific to the disease and show no overlap with normal controls, it is in the causal pathway of disease, and levels are reliably measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We report correlations of plasma glucosylsphingosine with baseline disease burden and eliglustat treatment response in previously untreated adults with GD1 in the Phase 2 (NCT00358150), open-label, single-arm trial of 26 patients with up to 8 years of follow-up and the placebo-controlled Phase 3 ENGAGE trial (NCT00891202) of 40 patients with up to 4.5 years of follow-up. At baseline, untreated patients showed moderate to strong correlations between plasma glucosylsphingosine and spleen volume, liver volume, and hemoglobin level. Organ volumes and hematologic parameters improved in parallel with reductions in plasma glucosylsphingosine during eliglustat treatment in both trials. Moderate correlations were seen between plasma glucosylsphingosine reduction and spleen and liver volume reductions during eliglustat treatment. These clinical trial data add to the growing body of evidence supporting plasma glucosylsphingosine as both a diagnostic and pharmacodynamic/response biomarker for GD1."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is the most common lysosomal storage disease caused by recessive mutations in the degrading enzyme of β-glucosylceramide (β-GlcCer). However, it remains unclear how β-GlcCer causes severe neuronopathic symptoms, which are not fully treated by current therapies. We herein found that β-GlcCer accumulating in GD activated microglia through macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) to induce phagocytosis of living neurons, which exacerbated Gaucher symptoms. This process was augmented by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) secreted from activated microglia that sensitized neurons for phagocytosis. This characteristic pathology was also observed in human neuronopathic GD. Blockade of these pathways in mice with a combination of FDA-approved drugs, minocycline (microglia activation inhibitor) and etanercept (TNF blocker), effectively protected neurons and ameliorated neuronopathic symptoms. In this study, we propose that limiting unrestrained microglia activation using drug repurposing provides a quickly applicable therapeutic option for fatal neuronopathic GD."

    "abstract": "It is well established that patients with Gaucher disease, as well as carriers of the disease have an increased risk for developing Parkinson's disease. A plethora of evidence suggests that disturbed α-Synuclein homeostasis is the link between Gaucher disease and Parkinson's disease. The pathogenic mechanism linking these entities is still a topic of debate and both gain- and loss-of-function theories have been put forward, which however are not mutually exclusive. In the present study we expanded our previous studies to include not only Gaucher disease patients but also Gaucher disease carriers and Gaucher disease patients following Enzyme Replacement Therapy. In these groups we investigated α-Synuclein in red blood cell membranes in association with lipid abnormalities described in Gaucher disease. These included glucosylceramide and its species, glucosylsphingosine, glucosylcholesterol and plasmalogens. Increased oligomerization of α-Synuclein in red blood cell membranes was observed not only in Gaucher disease patients but also in carriers of the disease. There were no qualitative differences in the lipids identified in the groups studied. However, significant quantitative differences compared to controls were observed in Gaucher disease patients but not in Gaucher disease carriers. Enzyme Replacement Therapy reversed the biochemical defects and normalized α-Synuclein homeostasis, providing for the first time evidence in human subjects that such homeostatic dysregulation is reversible. Further studies investigating α-Synuclein status during the differentiation of erythroid progenitors could provide new data on the pathogenic mechanism of α-Synuclein oligomerization in this system."

Patients experience progressive decline in neurological function, with onset typically within the first three-to-six months of life and premature death before two years. Mice and drosophila with GD have been described, however little is known about the brain pathology observed in the naturally occurring ovine model of GD. We have characterised pathological changes in GD lamb brain and compared the histological findings to those in GD patient post-mortem tissue, to determine the validity of the sheep as a model of this disease. Five GD and five age-matched unaffected lamb brains were examined. We observed significant expansion of the endo/lysosomal system in GD lamb cingulate gyrus however TPP1 and cathepsin D levels were unchanged or reduced. H&E staining revealed neurons with shrunken, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic or pyknotic nuclei (red neurons) that were also shrunken and deeply Nissl stain positive. Amoeboid microglia were noted throughout GD brain. Spheroidal inclusions reactive for TOMM20, ubiquitin and most strikingly, p-Tau were observed in many brain regions in GD lamb brain, potentially indicating disturbed axonal trafficking. Our findings suggest that the ovine model of GD exhibits similar pathological changes to human, mouse, and drosophila type II GD brain, and represents a model suitable for evaluating therapeutic intervention, particularly in utero-targeted approaches."

We used an online questionnaire to conduct a descriptive cross-sectional survey from May to July 2021. All districts in mainland France. Midwife supervisor of each maternity unit. Primary outcomes were \"banning of visits\" in the postnatal department during the first lockdown (March-May 2020), and \"mandated mask-wearing in birth rooms\" during the survey period (May-July 2021); the independent variables were maternity unit characteristics and location in a crisis area. Co-parent visits were considered only during the first lockdown as they were mostly allowed afterwards, and the wearing of masks was studied only during the survey period, as masks were unavailable for the population during the first lockdown. We obtained 343 responses, i.e., 75.2% of French maternity units. Visits to the postnatal department were forbidden in 39.3% of the maternity units during the first lockdown and in none during the study period. Maternity hospitals with neonatal intensive care units were the most likely to ban co-parent hospital visits (adjusted OR 2.34 [1.12; 4.96]). However, those were the maternity units least likely to encourage or require women to wear masks while pushing (adjusted OR, 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.77). Maternity units in crisis areas (i.e., with very high case counts) during the first lockdown banned visits significantly more often (adjusted OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.05-2.70). Our study showed that barrier measures evolved during the course of the pandemic but remained extremely variable between facilities. Maternity units implemented drastic barrier measures at the beginning of the pandemic but were able to adapt these measures over time. It is now time to learn from this experience to ensure that women and infants are no longer harmed by these measures."

Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, cytopenias (anemia, thrombocytopenia) and bone disorders are the main symptoms. The diagnosis is often delayed, leading to unnecessary investigations and treatments, and delaying the specific treatment. The primary objective of our study was to establish, in patients who had a diagnostic delay of more than one year, the reported misdiagnoses before the final diagnosis. The secondary objectives were to investigate the risk factors associated with error and delayed diagnosis. Retrospective study including patients with Gaucher disease from the French Gaucher Disease Registry. Collection of data by a single investigator from a standardized form. Among 83 patients with a known diagnostic delay, 13 patients (15 %) had one or two misdiagnoses. These included osteo-articular diagnoses (osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, arthritis, osteochondritis, rheumatic fever, n=8), haematological diagnoses (gestational thrombocytopenia, immunological thrombocytopenia, n=4), infectious diagnoses (visceral leishmaniasis, mononucleosis, n=2) and hemochromatosis. The osteo-articular and infectious diagnoses concerned the child and the adolescent while the haematological diagnoses and the hemochromatosis concerned the adult. No factors were found associated with misdiagnoses. Patients with a diagnostic delay greater than one year were less likely to have hepatosplenomegaly as the first symptom. There is a risk of diagnostic error related to phenotypic heterogeneity and lack of specificity of Gaucher disease symptoms. This study helps to better identify the misdiagnoses associated with Gaucher disease."

This retrospective study includes 32 BM specimens morphologically diagnosed as LSDs at our institute, in the last 10 years. Subsequently, they were subclassified into GD and NP/NP-like diseases. Further, we have compared and analyzed the clinical, hematological, and biochemical parameters for the two groups of LSDs. Based on BM morphology, 59.4% (n = 19) cases were diagnosed as NP/NP-like diseases and 40.6% (n = 13) cases as GD. Abdominal distension and failure to thrive were the most common clinical manifestations in both groups of LSDs. Anemia and thrombocytopenia were frequently seen in either of the LSDs. On the assessment of metabolic profile, elevated total/direct bilirubin and liver enzymes were more commonly seen in NP/NP-like diseases when compared with GD. We have classified LSDs into GD and NP/NP-like diseases based on the morphology of the storage cells in the BM specimen. The hallmark findings on BM biopsy annexed with the comparative features of the two proposed categories can aid the clinician in clinching the diagnosis.

    "abstract": "Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) is a lysosomal enzyme encoded by the GBA1 gene, loss of function variants of which cause an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher disease (GD). Heterozygous variants of GBA1 are also known as the strongest common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Restoration of GCase enzymatic function using a pharmacological chaperone strategy is considered a promising therapeutic approach for PD and GD. We identified compound 4 as a GCase pharmacological chaperone with sub-micromolar activity from a high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign. Compound 4 was further optimised to ER-001230194 (compound 25). ER-001230194 shows improved ADME and physicochemical properties and therefore represents a novel pharmacological chaperone with which to investigate GCase pharmacology further."

    "title": "The spectrum of neurological manifestations and genotype-phenotype correlation in Indian children with Gaucher disease.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD), one of the most frequent autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorders, occurs due to bi-allelic pathogenic variants in the GBA1. Worldwide, the c.1448T>C (L483P) homozygous pathogenic variant is reported to be associated with neurological GD phenotype. Clinical distinction between GD1 and GD3 may be challenging due to subtle neurological features. Objective methods to evaluate neurological signs and saccades may help in early diagnosis. This study was conducted to assess the neurological phenotype, and its severity using a modified severity scoring tool (mSST), and the genotype-phenotype correlation. A total of 45 children aged 2 years 6 months to 15 years with a confirmed enzymatic and molecular diagnosis of GD with or without therapy were recruited. mSST tool was used to assess the severity of the neurological phenotype. A digital eye movement tracker (View Point Tracker) was used to assess eye movements. Clinical and genetic findings were analyzed. Out of 45 patients, 39 (86.7%) had at least one neurological phenotype detected using the mSST tool, with impairment of cognitive function (68.8%, 31/45) being the commonest feature. Thirty-two of 45 (71%) were assessed for saccadic eye movements using the eye tracker. Of these, 62.5% (20/32) had absent saccades. Four children (8.9%, 4/32) without clinical oculomotor apraxia had absent saccades on the viewpoint eye tracker. Overall, 77.7% (35/45), had homozygosity for c.1448T>C in GBA1 of which 91.4% (32/35) had neurological manifestations. Other alleles associated with neurological phenotype included c.1603C>T(p.R535C), c.1184C>T (p.S395F), c.115+1G>A (g.4234G>A), c.260G>A (p.R87Q) and c.1352A>G (p.Y451C). To conclude, in India, the c.1448T>C pathogenic variant in GBA1 is the commonest and is associated with neurological phenotype of GD. Therefore, every patient of GD should be assessed using the mSST scoring tool for an early pick up of neurological features. The routine use of a viewpoint eye tracker in children with GD would be useful for early recognition of saccadic abnormalities."

    "abstract": "Eliglustat is an orphan medicine used for long-term treatment of Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) in adults. GD1 is a genetic condition, in which glucosylceramide builds up in the body, typically in liver, spleen, and bone. Clinical signs and symptoms of the disease are anemia, tiredness, easy bruising, hepatosplenomegaly, bone pain, and fractures. Eliglustat works by blocking glucosylceramide synthase (substrate reduction therapy). This medicine is subject to additional safety monitoring by regulatory authorities in the European Union. Scientific literature on eliglustat overdose is not available. We herein describe successful treatment of a suicidal attempt with massive eliglustat overdose. A 29-year-old female with GD1, a poor metabolizer of cytochrome P450 2D6 on a recommended daily dose of 84 mg of eliglustat, had taken 94 capsules of eliglustat (84 mg per capsule). One hour after ingestion of almost 8 g of eliglustat, the patient suffered from somnolence, severe bradycardia (37 bpm), and hypotension (systolic blood pressure of 70 mm Hg). After intravenous administration of atropine (1 mg) and cafedrine/theoadrenaline (100 mg/5 mg) by the called emergency physician, the patient resolved gradually. She remained 24 h with stable hemodynamics at a nearby intensive care unit. During continuous ECG monitoring, increased frequency of supraventricular ectopic activity and a first-degree atrioventricular block were observed. To our knowledge, this is the first case report on a suicidal attempt with eliglustat."

    "abstract": "Management of Gaucher disease (GD) is challenging due to its wide genotypic and phenotypic variability and changing clinical manifestations due to effective treatment. Sixteen face-to-face meetings with experts were held in order to discuss daily clinical practice and identify controversies regarding the management of GD. With this information, a questionnaire with 93 recommendations for different clinical scenarios was designed, and a Delphi survey among 86 physicians with experience in GD was conducted. Consensus was reached on 73 out of the 93 items. Recommendations on follow-up of adult and pediatric patients were in line with current guidelines, and underscored the importance of a patient-tailored approach. For the follow-up of stable patients receiving long-term treatment, consensus was reached on the importance of multidisciplinary care that involves pediatricians, internal medicine, and primary care, specialized radiologists, orthopedic surgeons, and hematologists when required. Degree of pain, use of painkillers and antidepressants, and quality of life should be evaluated at every follow-up visit or at least once per year. In general, a closer follow-up was recommended for untreated patients or patients who underwent a treatment change (every 3 months during the first year) and during pregnancy. For pregnant patients, hemostasis and risk of hemorrhage should be assessed, but no consensus was reached for initiation of treatment in asymptomatic pregnant patients. Lastly, recommendations on how to adapt GD management during a COVID-19 pandemic were collected. This expert consensus may help decision-making during the management of GD in specific clinical scenarios."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme (glucocerebrosidase/β-glucosidase) that leads to the accumulation of its substrate in lysosomal macrophages. GD remains rare and delayed diagnosis is common due its gradual onset. It is important to include this differential diagnosis in cases of massive splenomegaly and/or thrombocytopenia, in order to avoid potentially harmful splenectomy. This case report describes a 25-year-old female patient with a 10-year medical history of anaemia and thrombocytopenia, who presented with symptoms of haemorrhagic dyscrasia, pancytopenia and massive splenomegaly. The differential diagnosis of massive splenomegaly included several conditions which were considered but ruled out. Because of a lack of resources, the patient was forwarded to a reference centre where the diagnosis of GD was made. Many diseases are associated with splenomegaly but massive splenomegaly is seen in only a few conditions.While some causes of splenomegaly are obvious (malaria, infection), the aetiological diagnosis of splenomegaly may involve extensive history taking, serum testing and imaging studies.Infiltrative disorders such as Gaucher disease are a rare cause of splenomegaly and should be considered when other more common causes have been ruled out.The authors hope to raise awareness of this diagnosis in order to encourage early treatment."

A targeted literature search was conducted across multiple databases from January 2011 to September 2020, including web-based sources and congress proceedings to May 2021. Searches yielded 490 publications, with 31 analyzed: 20 cohort studies (15 prospective, 5 retrospective), 6 cross-sectional studies, 5 online reports (most from Europe (<i>n</i> = 11) or North America (<i>n</i> = 11); one multiregional). Across all GD types, incidence estimates ranged 0.45-25.0/100,000 live births (16 studies), lowest for Asia-Pacific. Incidence of GD1: 0.45-22.9/100,000 live births (Europe and North America) and GD3: 1.36/100,000 live births (Asia-Pacific only). GD type-specific prevalence estimates per 100,000 population were GD1: 0.26-0.63; GD2 and GD3: 0.02-0.08 (Europe only); estimates for GD type unspecified or overall ranged 0.11-139.0/100,000 inhabitants (17 studies), highest for North America. Generalizability was assessed as \"adequate\"or \"intermediate\" for all regions with data. GD incidence and prevalence estimates for the last 10 years varied considerably between regions and were poorly documented outside Europe and North America. Data for GD2 and GD3 were limited."

    "title": "The Consequences of GBA Deficiency in the Autophagy-Lysosome System in Parkinson's Disease Associated with GBA.",
    "abstract": "<i>GBA</i> gene variants were the first genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease. <i>GBA</i> encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GBA), which is involved in sphingolipid metabolism. GBA exhibits a complex physiological function that includes not only the degradation of its substrate glucosylceramide but also the metabolism of other sphingolipids and additional lipids such as cholesterol, particularly when glucocerebrosidase activity is deficient. In the context of Parkinson's disease associated with GBA, the loss of GBA activity has been associated with the accumulation of α-synuclein species. In recent years, several hypotheses have proposed alternative and complementary pathological mechanisms to explain why lysosomal enzyme mutations lead to α-synuclein accumulation and become important risk factors in Parkinson's disease etiology. Classically, loss of GBA activity has been linked to a dysfunctional autophagy-lysosome system and to a subsequent decrease in autophagy-dependent α-synuclein turnover; however, several other pathological mechanisms underlying GBA-associated parkinsonism have been proposed. This review summarizes and discusses the different hypotheses with a special focus on autophagy-dependent mechanisms, as well as autophagy-independent mechanisms, where the role of other players such as sphingolipids, cholesterol and other GBA-related proteins make important contributions to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis."

    "title": "Understanding patient and parent/caregiver perceptions on gene therapy in Gaucher disease: an international survey.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder. It is caused by a lack of sufficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme known as glucocerebrosidase, which leads to an accumulation of glucocerebroside, a fatty substance, in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and rarely, the lungs or central nervous system. While there are several treatments available for people with Type 1 Gaucher disease and the visceral aspects of Type 3 Gaucher disease, no cure is present for any type of Gaucher disease. Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate the safety and efficacy of gene therapy in Gaucher disease, which has the potential to become a new type of (curative) treatment in the future. Gene therapy is a relatively new therapeutic approach, and with the desire to keep the community informed about new treatment developments, the International Gaucher Alliance (IGA) set-up a Gaucher disease specific survey to gauge current perceptions. The survey aimed to benchmark understanding of, and the educational needs surrounding, gene therapy among the Gaucher disease community. BODY: An international, online survey was developed, comprising twelve questions ranging from multiple choice, Likert scale, single tick-box, ranking and open questions. The survey was developed following three patient and caregiver focus groups and underwent review from members of the IGA for readability and accuracy before going live to respondents. The survey was available for two months and shared to audiences via specific Gaucher community channels. Over 100 patients and parents/caregivers from the Gaucher disease community completed the survey, including people living with Type 1 Gaucher disease (52.88%), people living with Type 3 Gaucher disease (3.85%), parents/caregivers of people living with Type 1, 2 or 3 Gaucher disease (39.42%), and other (3.85%) who were defined as parents of multiple people with Gaucher disease. The survey uncovered various commonalities in perception of gene therapy among all groups, with large knowledge gaps identified on the mode of action, the usefulness of gene therapy and overall understanding of the therapeutic area. This survey provides an overview of the type of information that could be valuable to the Gaucher disease community when developing educational materials."

GBA1 variants can be classified into three categories based on their role in Gaucher's disease (GD) or PD: severe, mild, and risk variant (for PD). This review aims to generate and share a comprehensive database for GBA1 variants reported in PD to support future research and clinical trials. We performed a literature search for all GBA1 variants that have been reported in PD. The data have been standardized and complemented with variant classification, odds ratio if available, and other data. We found 371 GBA1 variants reported in PD: 22 mild, 84 severe, 3 risk variants, and 262 of unknown status. We created a browser containing up-to-date information on these variants (https://pdgenetics.shinyapps.io/GBA1Browser/).

The structure-activity study revealed that both the iminosugar and the light-sensitive azobenzene are essential features to exert inhibitory activity towards human GCase and a system with the correct inhibition trend (IC<sub>50</sub> of the light-activated form lower than IC<sub>50</sub> of the dark form) was identified. Kinetic analyses showed that all compounds are non-competitive inhibitors (mixed or pure) of GCase and the enzyme allosteric site involved in the interaction was identified by means of MD simulations. A moderate activity enhancement of mutant GCase assessed in GD patients' fibroblasts (ex vivo experiments) carrying the most common mutation was recorded. This promising observation paves the way for further studies to improve the benefit of the light-to-dark thermal conversion for chaperoning activity."

    "abstract": "Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are not just a matter of scarring or inflammation in the lung tissue. The lungs can also serve as a repository for products that can be produced in excessive amounts in the human body as a result of disease. Geneticaly based dysfunctions of lysosomal enzymes, which leads to an unefficient degradation and transport of various macromolecules from lysosomes, are considered to be storage diseases sensu stricto. ILDs were described in patients with Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick disease and Fabry disease. In a broader context, however, the accumulation of various substances in the lung tissue is also encountered in cases of pediatric pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (PIG), alveolar lipoproteinosis or pulmonary amyloidosis. The cause of PIG is not clear. The disease was first described in 2002 and a lung tissue sample is required to establish this diagnosis. Even though PIG usually goes well in childhood and the patients difficulties spontaneously subside over time, the long-term prognosis of the patients is unknown. Alveolar lipoproteinoses can be acquired (e.g. after massive exposure to silica dust), autoimmune, but also genetically determined. Unlike lysosomal storage diseases, in the case of pulmonary alveolar lipoproteinosis, accumulation of abnormal macromolecules occurs only in the lungs of affected individuals. Similarly, amyloidosis is not a single disease, but a group of diseases with different etiopathogenesis, as a result of which amyloid - a group of different proteins with a distinctvive conformation, which can be deposited in various organs, including the lungs - is formed. The diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar lipoproteinosis is based on the typical appearance and biochemical composition of the fluid obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage, the diagnosis of amyloidosis is histological."

Plasma glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a highly sensitive and specific biomarker for GD, has been used for diagnosis and monitoring the response to treatment. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is an effective treatment for the non-neurologic symptoms of GD. Neuronopathic GD (type 2 and 3) accounts for 60%-70% of the Asian affected population. We explored combination therapy of ERT followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and its long-term outcomes in patients with GD type 3 (GD3). Four patients with GD3 and one with GD type 1 (GD1) underwent HSCT. The types of donor were one matched-related, one matched-unrelated, and three haploidentical. The age at disease onset was 6-18 months and the age at HSCT was 3.8-15 years in the patients with GD3. The latest age at follow-up was 8-22 years, with a post-HSCT duration of 3-14 years. All patients had successful HSCT. Chronic graft-versus-host disease occurred in one patient. The enzyme activities were normalized at 2 weeks post HSCT. Lyso-Gb1 concentrations became lower than the pathological value. All of the patients are still alive and physically independent. Most of them (4/5) returned to school. None of the patients with GD3 had seizures or additional neurological symptoms after HSCT, but showed varying degrees of cognitive impairment. ERT followed by HSCT could be considered as an alternative treatment for patients with GD3 who have a high risk of fatal neurological progression."

Research in this area has largely focused on the cerebrovascular manifestations of the disease, and very little has been described about further neurological manifestations, which are known in other lysosomal diseases, such as Gaucher disease. In particular, a clinical and neuroimaging phenotype suggesting neurodegeneration as a putative mechanism has never been fully described for AFD, but the increased survival of affected patients with early diagnosis and the possibility of treatment have given rise to some isolated reports in the literature on the association of AFD with a clinical phenotype of Parkinson disease (PD). The data are currently scarce, but it is possible to hypothesize the molecular mechanisms of cell damage that support this association; this topic is worthy of further study in particular in relation to the therapeutic possibilities, which have significantly modified the natural history of the disease but which are not specifically dedicated to the CNS. In this review, the molecular mechanisms underlying this association will be proposed, and the available data with implications for future research and treatment will be rewritten."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder due to the deficient activity of the acid beta-glucosidase (GCase) enzyme, resulting in the progressive lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and its deacylated derivate, glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph). GCase is encoded by the GBA1 gene, located on chromosome 1q21 16 kb upstream from a highly homologous pseudogene. To date, more than 400 GBA1 pathogenic variants have been reported, many of them derived from recombination events between the gene and the pseudogene. In the last years, the increased access to new technologies has led to an exponential growth in the number of diagnostic laboratories offering GD testing. However, both biochemical and genetic diagnosis of GD are challenging and to date no specific evidence-based guidelines for the laboratory diagnosis of GD have been published. The objective of the guidelines presented here is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the technical implementation and interpretation of biochemical and genetic testing for the diagnosis of GD to ensure a timely and accurate diagnosis for patients with GD worldwide. The guidelines have been developed by members of the Diagnostic Working group of the International Working Group of Gaucher Disease (IWGGD), a non-profit network established to promote clinical and basic research into GD for the ultimate purpose of improving the lives of patients with this disease. One of the goals of the IWGGD is to support equitable access to diagnosis of GD and to standardize procedures to ensure an accurate diagnosis. Therefore, a guideline development group consisting of biochemists and geneticists working in the field of GD diagnosis was established and a list of topics to be discussed was selected. In these guidelines, twenty recommendations are provided based on information gathered through a systematic review of the literature and two different diagnostic algorithms are presented, considering the geographical differences in the access to diagnostic services. Besides, several gaps in the current diagnostic workflow were identified and actions to fulfill them were taken within the IWGGD. We believe that the implementation of recommendations provided in these guidelines will promote an equitable, timely and accurate diagnosis for patients with GD worldwide."

Routine evaluation of bone involvement in these patients includes radiography and repeated dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, osteonecrosis and bone fracture may affect the accuracy of DXA. Purpose To assess the utility of DXA and radiographic femoral cortical thickness measurements as predictors of fragility fracture in patients with GD with long-term follow-up (up to 30 years). Materials and Methods Patients with GD age 16 years and older with a detailed medical history, at least one bone image (DXA and/or radiographs), and minimum 2 years follow-up were retrospectively identified using three merged UK-based registries (Gaucherite study, enrollment 2015-2017; Clinical Bone Registry, enrollment 2003-2006; and Mortality Registry, enrollment 1993-2019). Cortical thickness index (CTI) and canal-to-calcar ratio (CCR) were measured by two independent observers, and inter- and intraobserver reliability was calculated. The fracture-predictive value of DXA, CTI, CCR, and cutoff values were calculated using receiver operating characteristic curves. Statistical differences were assessed using univariable and multivariable analysis. Results Bone imaging in 247 patients (123 men, 124 women; baseline median age, 39 years; IQR, 27-50 years) was reviewed. The median follow-up period was 11 years (IQR, 7-19 years; range, 2-30 years). Thirty-five patients had fractures before or at first bone imaging, 23 patients had fractures after first bone imaging, and 189 patients remained fracture-free. Inter- and intraobserver reproducibility for CTI/CCR measurements was substantial (range, 0.96-0.98). In the 212 patients with no baseline fracture, CTI (cutoff, ≤0.50) predicted future fractures with higher sensitivity and specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.96; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.99; sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 96%) than DXA T-score at total hip (AUC, 0.78; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.91; sensitivity, 64%; specificity, 93%), femoral neck (AUC, 0.73; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.86; sensitivity, 64%; specificity, 73%), lumbar spine (AUC, 0.69; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.82; sensitivity, 57%; specificity, 63%), and forearm (AUC, 0.78; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.89; sensitivity, 70%; specificity, 70%).

    "abstract": "Patients with Gaucher disease (GD) have progressive bone involvement that clinically presents with debilitating bone pain, structural bone changes, bone marrow infiltration (BMI), Erlenmeyer (EM) flask deformity, and osteoporosis. Pain is referred by the majority of GD patients and continues to persist despite the type of therapy. The pain in GD is described as chronic deep penetrating pain; however, sometimes, patients experience severe acute pain. The source of bone pain is mainly debated as nociceptive pain secondary to bone pathology or neuropathic or inflammatory origins. Osteocytes constitute a significant source of secreted molecules that coordinate bone remodeling. Osteocyte markers, sclerostin (SOST) and Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), inactivate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and lead to the inhibition of bone formation. Thus, circulated sclerostin and DKK-1 are potential biomarkers of skeletal abnormalities. This study aimed to assess the circulating levels of sclerostin and DKK-1 in patients with GD and their correlation with clinical bone pathology parameters: pain, bone mineral density (BMD), and EM deformity. Thirty-nine patients with GD were classified into cohorts based on the presence and severity of bone manifestations. The serum levels of sclerostin and DKK-1 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The highest level of sclerostin was measured in GD patients with pain, BMI, and EM deformity. The multiparameter analysis demonstrated that 95% of GD patients with pain, BMI, and EM deformity had increased levels of sclerostin. The majority of patients with elevated sclerostin also have osteopenia or osteoporosis. Moreover, circulating sclerostin level increase with age, and GD patients have elevated sclerostin levels when compared with healthy control from the same age group. Pearson's linear correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between serum DKK-1 and sclerostin in healthy controls and GD patients with normal bone mineral density. However, the balance between sclerostin and DKK-1 waned in GD patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis. In conclusion, the osteocyte marker, sclerostin, when elevated, is associated with bone pain, BMI, and EM flask deformity in GD patients. The altered sclerostin/DKK-1 ratio correlates with the reduction of bone mineral density. These data confirm that the Wnt signaling pathway plays a role in GD-associated bone disease. Sclerostin and bone pain could be used as biomarkers to assess patients with a high risk of BMI and EM flask deformities."

The method enabled us to determine the kinetic parameters of UGGC and the effect of the inhibitor GZ667161 on the enzyme activity expressed in model cells, as well as to measure UGCG specific activity in human fibroblasts using a simple crude cell homogenate. This novel approach may be useful in determining the actual UGCG activity levels in patient cells and tissues of animal models of diseases, and to study novel drugs targeting glycosphingolipid metabolism."

    "abstract": "Historically, disease burden and treatment responses in patients with Gaucher disease (GD) was assessed by monitoring clinical data, laboratory, imaging, chitotriosidase (CHITO), and other biomarkers; however, these biomarkers lack specificity and CHITO is uninformative in patients heterozygous or homozygous for the <i>CHIT1</i> c.1049_1072dup24 variant. Recently, glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub>), a sensitive and specific GD biomarker, has been recommended for patient monitoring. Furthermore, studies measuring lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub> and CHITO in patients on long-term treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and/or substrate reduction therapy (SRT) reported as group data show a reduction in both analytes, yet individualized patient data are generally unavailable. We describe seven patients on long-term treatment with longitudinal clinical data with monitoring based on current treatment guidelines. We present four patients who exhibit stable disease with normalized CHITO despite elevated lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub>. We present one patient who transitioned from ERT to SRT due to lack of a clinical response with life-threatening thrombocytopenia who responded with marked improvement in platelets, and normalized levels of both CHITO and lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub>. Finally, we present two ERT to SRT switch patients with stable disease on ERT who exhibited non-compliance on SRT, one with mirrored marked elevations of CHITO and lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub>; and another with normal CHITO and platelets, but increasing lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub> levels and enlarged spleen. These clinical vignettes highlight the role of lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub> as a sensitive biomarker in management of patients with GD, and its further value when CHITO is normal and thus uninformative. We highlight the personalized medicine approach needed to optimize treatment outcomes and recommendations for these patients."

    "title": "Hemostatic Abnormalities in Gaucher Disease: Mechanisms and Clinical Implications.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare inherited lysosomal metabolism disorder, characterized by an accumulation into lysosomes of reticuloendothelial cells, especially in the bone marrow, spleen, and liver of β-glucosylceramide and glucosyl sphingosine, which is its deacylated product. Impaired storage is responsible for a chronic inflammatory state at the sites of accumulation and together represents the pathophysiological cause of GD. GD is a progressive, multi-organ chronic disorder. Type 1 GD is the most prevalent form, with heterogeneous multisystem involvement and different severity of symptoms at any age. Hematological involvement is consistent, and a bleeding tendency is frequent, particularly at diagnosis. Several coagulation and primary hemostasis abnormalities are observed in GD. Bleeding manifestations are rarely severe and usually mucocutaneous. Post-operative, delivery, and post-partum hemorrhages are also common. Thrombocytopenia, platelet function defects, and clotting abnormalities, alone or variably associated, contribute to increase the risk of bleeding in GD. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT) are the two specific available treatments effective in improving typical hematological symptoms and abnormalities, including those of hemostasis. However, the use of medication to potentiate hemostasis may be also useful in defined clinical situations: recent starting of ERT/SRT, surgery, delivery, and life-threatening bleeding."

    "abstract": "Genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 has become a powerful tool in zebrafish to generate targeted gene knockouts models. However, its use for targeted knock-in remains challenging due to inefficient homology directed repair (HDR) pathway in zebrafish, highlighting the need for efficient and cost-effective screening methods. RESULTS: Here, we present our fluorescent PCR and capillary electrophoresis based screening approach for knock-in using a single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide donor (ssODN) as a repair template for the targeted insertion of epitope tags, or single nucleotide changes to recapitulate pathogenic human alleles. For the insertion of epitope tags, we took advantage of the expected change in size of the PCR product. For point mutations, we combined fluorescent PCR with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis to distinguish the fish with the knock-in allele. As a proof-of-principle, we present our data on the generation of fish lines with insertion of a FLAG tag at the tcnba locus, an HA tag at the gata2b locus, and a point mutation observed in Gaucher disease patients in the gba gene. Despite the low number of germline transmitting founders (1-5%), combining our screening methods with prioritization of founder fish by fin biopsies allowed us to establish stable knock-in lines by screening 12 or less fish per gene. We have established a robust pipeline for the generation of zebrafish models with precise integration of small DNA sequences and point mutations at the desired sites in the genome. Our screening method is very efficient and easy to implement as it is PCR-based and only requires access to a capillary sequencer."

We examined the long-term effect of eliglustat treatment on bone outcomes in clinical trials in adults with Gaucher disease type 1. Data from 4 completed phase 2 and 3 trials were evaluated in treatment-naïve patients or patients switching to eliglustat from enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Overall, 319 of 393 (81%) eliglustat-treated patients remained in their trials until completion or commercial eliglustat became available. Mean eliglustat treatment duration ranged from 3.3 to 6.5 years. In treatment-naïve patients and ERT-switch patients, frequency and severity of bone pain decreased during eliglustat treatment. Mean lumbar spine T-scores shifted from abnormal to normal in treatment-naïve patients and remained in the healthy reference range or improved modestly in ERT-switch patients. Mean total bone marrow burden score shifted from marked-to-severe to moderate in treatment-naïve patients and remained moderate in ERT-switch patients. MIP-1β (marker of active bone disease) was elevated at baseline and decreased to the healthy reference range in treatment-naïve patients and remained in the healthy reference range among ERT-switch patients. These findings confirm the long-term efficacy of eliglustat on skeletal complications of Gaucher disease in treatment-naïve and ERT-switch patients."

This retrospective, single-center, observational study was conducted on patients who had at least one episode of AON of the hip or shoulder at the Hospital de Poniente (Almería, Spain) from January 2010 to December 2019. Clinical and analytical data were collected. Patients whose medical record described no etiological factors for this disease were screened for Gaucher disease. The study sample consisted of 81 patients, of whom 58 were male. The mean age at presentation of AON was 45.9 years. They presented with unilateral hip necrosis (n=43), bilateral hip necrosis (n=34), bilateral hip and unilateral shoulder necrosis (n=3), and unilateral shoulder necrosis (n=1). The most frequent potential etiological factors were smoking (46.9%) and obesity (17.3%). Screening for Gaucher disease was performed in ten patients, all of whom tested negative. In our study population, the main potential etiological factors the onset of AON of the shoulder or hip were smoking and obesity. A high percentage of patients were diagnosed with idiopathic AON.

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders are a group of inborn errors of metabolism due to defects in proteins crucial for lysosomal function. Gaucher disease is the most common autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder due to mutations in the GBA1 gene, resulting in the lysosomal deficiency of glucocerebrosidase activity. Gaucher disease is characterized by the toxic accumulation of glucosylceramide in the reticuloendothelial system. Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), previously known as Niemann Pick A/B disease, is also an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder due to mutations in the SMPD1 gene, which result in acid sphingomyelinase deficiency and the accumulation of sphingomyelin in mononuclear phagocytic system and hepatocytes. The phenotypic expression of Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1), the most common type, and chronic visceral ASMD may overlap for several signs or symptoms. Splenomegaly is detectable in approximately 90% of the patients in both conditions; however, since GD1 is more frequent than ASMD, clinicians are more prone to suspect it, often neglecting the diagnosis of ASMD. Based on previous experience, a group of experts in the clinical and laboratory diagnosis, management, and treatment of lysosomal storage disorders developed an algorithm for both GD1 and ASMD to support physicians, including primary care providers, internists, and specialists (e.g., hepatologists, hematologists, and pulmonologists) to suspect and differentiate GD1 and ASMD and to provide the appropriate referral."

    "abstract": "Osteonecrosis is defined as bone death due to inadequate vascular supply. It is sometimes also called \"avascular necrosis\" and \"aseptic necrosis\" when involving epiphysis, or \"bone infarct\" when involving metadiaphysis. Common sites include femoral head, humeral head, tibial metadiaphysis, femoral metadiaphysis, scaphoid, lunate, and talus. Osteonecrosis is thought to be a common condition most commonly affecting adults in third to fifth decades of life. Risk factors for osteonecrosis are numerous and include trauma, corticosteroid therapy, alcohol use, HIV, lymphoma/leukemia, blood dyscrasias, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, Gaucher disease, and Caisson disease. Epiphyseal osteonecrosis can lead to subchondral fracture and secondary osteoarthritis whereas metadiaphyseal cases do not, likely explaining their lack of long-term sequelae. Early diagnosis of osteonecrosis is important: 1) to exclude other causes of patient's pain and 2) to allow for possible early surgical prevention to prevent articular collapse and need for joint replacements. Imaging is also important for preoperative planning. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation."

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced disease (COVID-19) and Gaucher disease (GD) exhibit upregulation of complement 5a (C5a) and its C5aR1 receptor, and excess synthesis of glycosphingolipids that lead to increased infiltration and activation of innate and adaptive immune cells, resulting in massive generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. This C5a-C5aR1-glycosphingolipid pathway- induced pro-inflammatory environment causes the tissue damage in COVID-19 and GD. Strikingly, pharmaceutically targeting the C5a-C5aR1 axis or the glycosphingolipid synthesis pathway led to a reduction in glycosphingolipid synthesis and innate and adaptive immune inflammation, and protection from the tissue destruction in both COVID-19 and GD. These results reveal a common involvement of the complement and glycosphingolipid systems driving immune inflammation and tissue damage in COVID-19 and GD, respectively. It is therefore expected that combined targeting of the complement and sphingolipid pathways could ameliorate the tissue destruction, organ failure, and death in patients at high-risk of developing severe cases of COVID-19."

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a protein with neuroprotective potential stored in alpha granules of circulating platelets. Here we studied BDNF levels in 50 patients with type I GD (GD1) and their correlation with platelet activity and bleeding tendency. Flow cytometry was used to test unstimulated and stimulated measurement of platelet surface-activated expression of αIIbβ3 integrin, P-selectin and lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP3/CD63). Serum and plasma BDNF levels were quantified using ELISA. The bleeding history was recorded by a bleeding questionnaire. Serum BDNF levels were positively correlated with platelet count and moderately correlated with unstimulated and stimulated platelet P-selectin expression. Patients with more than one bleeding manifestation were shown to have lower serum BDNF levels, albeit similar platelet count. Plasma BDNF levels were significantly elevated in splenectomized patients and showed a moderate positive correlation with stimulated platelet CD63 expression. These observations demonstrate the first association between BDNF levels in the peripheral blood with platelet dysfunction and increased bleeding manifestation. The role of measuring serum BDNF for assessing platelet alpha degranulation defects and bleeding risk in patients with GD and the general population needs further study."

    "abstract": "Isomeric lysosphingolipids, galactosylsphingosine (GalSph) and glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph), are present in only minute levels in healthy cells. Due to defects in their lysosomal hydrolysis, they accumulate at high levels and cause cytotoxicity in patients with Krabbe and Gaucher diseases, respectively. Here, we show that GalSph and GlcSph induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization, a hallmark of lysosome-dependent cell death, in human breast cancer cells (MCF7) and primary fibroblasts. Supporting lysosomal leakage as a causative event in lysosphingolipid-induced cytotoxicity, treatment of MCF7 cells with lysosome-stabilizing cholesterol prevented GalSph- and GlcSph-induced cell death almost completely. In line with this, fibroblasts from a patient with Niemann-Pick type C disease, which is caused by defective lysosomal cholesterol efflux, were significantly less sensitive to lysosphingolipid-induced lysosomal leakage and cell death. Prompted by the data showing that MCF7 cells with acquired resistance to lysosome-destabilizing cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) were partially resistant to the cell death induced by GalSph and GlcSph, we compared these cell death pathways with each other. Like CADs, GalSph and GlcSph activated the cyclic AMP (cAMP) signalling pathway, and cAMP-inducing forskolin sensitized cells to cell death induced by low concentrations of lysosphingolipids. Contrary to CADs, lysosphingolipid-induced cell death was independent of lysosomal Ca2+ efflux through P2X purinerigic receptor 4. These data reveal GalSph and GlcSph as lysosome-destabilizing lipids, whose putative use in cancer therapy should be further investigated. Furthermore, the data supports the development of lysosome stabilizing drugs for the treatment of Krabbe and Gaucher diseases and possibly other sphingolipidoses."

Noteworthy features of lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) include facial features such as prominent brows, wide noses, thickened lips, mouth, and chin, resulting in coarse and rounded facial features. We evaluated and report the prevalence of facial phenotypes in patients with different LSDs, noting two current examples when artificial intelligence strategies have been utilized to identify distinctive facies. Specific LSDs, including Gaucher disease, Mucolipidosis IV and Fabry disease have recently been distinguished using facial recognition software. Additional lysosomal disorders LSDs lysosomal storage disorders with unique and distinguishable facial features also merit evaluation using this technology.

Eliglustat is the second SRT approved, yet the first to be approved as first-line therapy for any adult patients with compatible CYP2D6 metabolizer genotype. Herein we report safety and efficacy data of the first 29 patients switched from ERT to eliglustat from the Gaucher Unit at Shaare Zedek Medical Center (SZMC) between 07/2017 and 06/2022; the median (range) time on ERT was 13 (0.66-30) years, and the median (range) time on eliglustat was 7 (1-52) months. Most patients switched due to oral preference or sub-optimal response to low-dose ERT. Twelve patients stopped eliglustat after a median (range) of 4 (1-18) months; 11 due to adverse events (AEs) and one due to personal request. There were no drug-related serious AEs and no drug-related cardiac events. Most AEs were mild and transient, mainly dyspepsia. Efficacy achievements were reflected by maintaining stability. We concluded that switching from ERT to eliglustat is safe if choosing the appropriate patients. Reassuring patients to tolerate early AEs may reduce discontinuation. Following the response and compliance to therapy is important to ensure long-term efficacy."

A total of 22 patients were suspected to be having Gaucher disease based on clinical findings of hepatosplenomegaly with bicytopenia or isolated thrombocytopenia.

Among the 22 patients, nine (40.9%) patients were confirmed to be suffering from Gaucher disease with six based on enzyme assay on dry blood spot and three based on DNA mutation analysis. One patient among the screen positives received ERT for two months and was noted to have an improvement in hemoglobin and platelet count, a reduction in liver size, and better general well-being. High-suspicion targeted screening of Gaucher disease in patients with splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia based on a dry blood spot enzyme assay is high yielding, effective strategy in identifying Gaucher disease patients.

The major LSDs that cause liver dysfunction are disorders of sphingolipid lipid storage [Gaucher disease (GD) and Niemann-Pick disease] and lysosomal acid lipase deficiency [cholesteryl ester storage disease and Wolman disease (WD)]. These diseases can cause significant liver problems ranging from asymptomatic hepatomegaly to cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Abnormal storage cells initiate hepatic fibrosis in sphingolipid disorders. Dyslipidemia causes micronodular cirrhosis in lipid storage disorders. These disorders must be keenly differentiated from other chronic liver diseases and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis that affect children and young adults. GD, Niemann-Pick type C, and WD also cause neonatal cholestasis and infantile liver failure. Genotype and liver phenotype correlation is variable in these conditions. Patients with LSD may survive up to 4-5 decades except for those with neonatal onset disease. The diagnosis of all LSD is based on enzymatic activity, tissue histology, and genetic testing. Enzyme replacement is possible in GD and Niemann-Pick types A and B though there are major limitations in the outcome. Those that progress invariably require liver transplantation with variable outcomes. The prognosis of Niemann-Pick type C and WD is universally poor.

GD is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone complications, and neurological complications. Glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a deacylated form of glucosylceramide, has been identified as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment response in GD. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between plasma lyso-Gb1 and therapeutic goals for GD (improvements in hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone pain, and bone crisis), as well as disease type and GBA1 mutation type, in Japanese patients with GD receiving velaglucerase alfa, an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Furthermore, this study compared the plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration observed in Japanese patients included in this study with that observed in a previous non-Japanese clinical study. This non-interventional, open-label, multicenter observational cohort study (October 2020 to March 2021) included a total of 20 patients (of any age) with GD (type 1: n = 8; type 2: n = 9; type 3: n = 3) treated with velaglucerase alfa for ≥ 3 months. Median (minimum-maximum) duration of velaglucerase alfa treatment was 49.5 (3-107) months. A total of 14 (70.0%) patients achieved all therapeutic goals (i.e., 100% achievement; improvements in hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone pain, and bone crisis). Overall, median (minimum-maximum) lyso-Gb1 concentration was 24.3 (2.1-150) ng/mL. Although not statistically significant, numerically lower plasma lyso-Gb1 concentrations were observed in patients with 100% achievement compared with those without; no statistically significant difference in plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration was observed between patients with different disease type or mutation type. Furthermore, lyso-Gb1 concentrations observed in Japanese patients were numerically lower than that observed in a previous study of non-Japanese patients with GD receiving ERT. In this study, high achievement rates of therapeutic goals with low lyso-Gb1 concentration were observed, demonstrating a correlation between therapeutic goals and lower plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration in Japanese patients with GD treated with velaglucerase alfa. This study further suggests that plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration may be a useful biomarker for treatment response in patients with GD."

Our study suggests that the management of GD in Italy, with regards to imiglucerase dosage, is suboptimal and confirms the need for clinicians to monitor and correctly treat bone disease according to best practice guidelines."

Three first-in-human open-label ascending single-dose phase 1/2 studies were performed in parallel (starting November 2017) primarily to assess safety and tolerability of ZFN in vivo editing therapy in mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) (n = 3), MPS II (n = 9), and hemophilia B (n = 1). Treatment was well tolerated with no serious treatment-related adverse events. At the 1e13 vg/kg dose, evidence of genome editing was detected through albumin-transgene fusion transcripts in liver for MPS II (n = 2) and MPS I (n = 1) subjects. The MPS I subject also had a transient increase in leukocyte iduronidase activity to the lower normal range. At the 5e13 vg/kg dose, one MPS II subject had a transient increase in plasma iduronate-2-sulfatase approaching normal levels and one MPS I subject approached mid-normal levels of leukocyte iduronidase activity with no evidence of genome editing. The hemophilia B subject was not able to decrease use of factor IX concentrate; genome editing could not be assessed. Overall, ZFN in vivo editing therapy had a favorable safety profile with evidence of targeted genome editing in liver, but no long-term enzyme expression in blood."

    "abstract": "Carriers of GBA1 gene variants have a significant risk of developing Parkinson’s disease (PD). A cohort study of GBA carriers between 40−75 years of age was initiated to study the presence of prodromal PD features. Participants underwent non-invasive tests to assess different domains of PD. Ninety-eight unrelated GBA carriers were enrolled (43 males) at a median age (range) of 51 (40−74) years; 71 carried the N370S variant (c.1226A > G) and 25 had a positive family history of PD. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was the most frequently abnormal (23.7%, 95% CI 15.7−33.4%), followed by the ultrasound hyperechogenicity (22%, 95% CI 14−32%), Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) (17.2%, 95% CI 10.2−26.4%), smell assessment (12.4%, 95% CI 6.6−20.6%) and abnormalities in sleep questionnaires (11%, 95% CI 5.7−19.4%). Significant correlations were found between tests from different domains. To define the risk for PD, we assessed the bottom 10th percentile of each prodromal test, defining this level as “abnormal”. Then we calculated the percentage of “abnormal” tests for each subject; the median (range) was 4.55 (0−43.5%). Twenty-two subjects had more than 15% “abnormal” tests. The limitations of the study included ascertainment bias of individuals with GBA-related PD in relatives, some incomplete data due to technical issues, and a lack of well-characterized normal value ranges in some tests. We plan to enroll additional participants and conduct longitudinal follow-up assessments to build a model for identifying individuals at risk for PD and investigate interventions aiming to delay the onset or perhaps to prevent full-blown PD."

    "abstract": "Several new treatment modalities are being developed for lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), including gene therapy. As the currently available treatment options and their influence on disease progression differ greatly within the spectrum of LSDs, willingness to undergo gene therapy might vary among patients with LSDs and/or their representatives. The width of the LSD spectrum is illustrated by the differences between type 1 Gaucher disease, Fabry disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III). For type 1 Gaucher and Fabry disease several therapies are available, resulting in a near normal or improved, but individually varying, prognosis. No treatment options are available for MPS III. To identify factors influencing patients' and/or their representatives' decisions regarding undergoing gene therapy. Focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, Fabry disease and MPS III. Parents of MPS III patients were included as patients' representatives. Nine Gaucher patients, 23 Fabry patients, two adult MPS III patients and five parents of MPS III patients participated in the study. The five main themes that arose were: outcome of gene therapy, risks and side effects, burden of gene therapy treatment, current situation and ethical aspects. Participants' views ranged from hesitance to eagerness to undergo gene therapy, which seemed to be mostly related to disease severity and currently available treatment options. Severe disease, limited treatment options and limited effectiveness of current treatment augmented the willingness to choose gene therapy. Gaucher and Fabry patients deemed the burden of treatment important. Fabry and MPS III patients and parents considered outcome important, suggesting hope for improvement. When asked to rank the factors discussed in the focus group discussions, Gaucher patients ranked outcome low, which could indicate a more cautious attitude towards gene therapy. This study underlines the importance of exploring patients' needs and expectations before using limited resources in the development of therapies for patient groups of which a significant subset may not be willing to undergo that specific therapy."

We recently reported that an adeno-associated virus vector expressing a bacterial debranching enzyme (pullulanase) driven by the ubiquitous CMV enhancer/chicken β-actin (CB) promoter cleared glycogen in major affected tissues of infant GSD IIIa mice. In this study, we developed a potentially novel dual promoter consisting of a liver-specific promoter (LSP) and the CB promoter for gene therapy in adult GSD IIIa mice. Ten-week treatment with an adeno-associated virus vector containing the LSP-CB dual promoter in adult GSD IIIa mice significantly increased pullulanase expression and reduced glycogen contents in the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle, accompanied by the reversal of liver fibrosis, improved muscle function, and a significant decrease in plasma biomarkers alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine kinase. Compared with the CB promoter, the dual promoter effectively decreased pullulanase-induced cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and enabled persistent therapeutic gene expression in adult GSD IIIa mice. Future studies are needed to determine the long-term durability of dual promoter-mediated expression of pullulanase in adult GSD IIIa mice and in large animal models."

This accumulation may induce oxidative stress, resulting in DNA damage in patients with GD. The aim of this study was to assess plasma 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels and cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-cyt) assay parameters in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with GD and carriers, evaluate the possible associations of these values with GD, and determine whether they can be used as potential biomarkers in GD. This study included 20 patients with type 1 GD, six carriers, and 27 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. CBMN-cyt assay parameters in peripheral blood lymphocytes of the patients with GD, carriers, and controls were evaluated and 8-OHdG levels in their plasma samples were measured. CBMN-cyt assay parameters in patients with GD and carriers were not significantly different when compared with controls (p > 0.05). However, plasma 8-OHdG levels were found to be higher in both patients with GD and carriers than in control subjects (p < 0.01). Oxidative DNA damage may be a useful prognostic tool, whereas the CBMN-cyt assay cannot be used as a predictive biomarker of GD."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease type 3 is a chronic neuronopathic disorder with wide-ranging effects, including hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, skeletal disease and diverse neurological manifestations. Biallelic mutations in GBA1 reduce lysosomal acid β-glucosidase activity, and its substrates, glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine, accumulate. Enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy ameliorate systemic features of Gaucher disease, but no therapies are approved for neurological manifestations. Venglustat is an investigational, brain-penetrant, glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor with potential to improve the disease by rebalancing influx of glucosylceramide with impaired lysosomal recycling. The Phase 2, open-label LEAP trial (NCT02843035) evaluated orally administered venglustat 15 mg once-daily in combination with maintenance dose of imiglucerase enzyme replacement therapy during 1 year of treatment in 11 adults with Gaucher disease type 3. Primary endpoints were venglustat safety and tolerability and change in concentration of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine in CSF from baseline to Weeks 26 and 52. Secondary endpoints included change in plasma concentrations of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine, venglustat pharmacokinetics in plasma and CSF, neurologic function, infiltrative lung disease and systemic disease parameters. Exploratory endpoints included changes in brain volume assessed with volumetric MRI using tensor-based morphometry, and resting functional MRI analysis of regional brain activity and connectivity between resting state networks. Mean (SD) plasma venglustat AUC0-24 on Day 1 was 851 (282) ng•h/ml; Cmax of 58.1 (26.4) ng/ml was achieved at a median tmax 2.00 h. After once-daily venglustat, plasma concentrations (4 h post-dose) were higher compared with Day 1, indicating ∼2-fold accumulation. One participant (Patient 9) had low-to-undetectable venglustat exposure at Weeks 26 and 52. Based on mean plasma and CSF venglustat concentrations (excluding Patient 9), steady state appeared to be reached on or before Week 4. Mean (SD) venglustat concentration at Week 52 was 114 (65.8) ng/ml in plasma and 6.14 (3.44) ng/ml in CSF. After 1 year of treatment, median (inter-quartile range) glucosylceramide decreased 78% (72, 84) in plasma and 81% (77, 83) in CSF; median (inter-quartile range) glucosylsphingosine decreased 56% (41, 60) in plasma and 70% (46, 76) in CSF. Ataxia improved slightly in nine patients: mean (SD, range) total modified Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score decreased from 2.68 [1.54 (0.0 to 5.5)] at baseline to 1.55 [1.88 (0.0 to 5.0)] at Week 52 [mean change: -1.14 (95% CI: -2.06 to -0.21)]. Whole brain volume increased slightly in patients with venglustat exposure and biomarker reduction in CSF (306.7 ± 4253.3 mm3) and declined markedly in Patient 9 (-13894.8 mm3). Functional MRI indicated stronger connectivity at Weeks 26 and 52 relative to baseline between a broadly distributed set of brain regions in patients with venglustat exposure and biomarker reduction but not Patient 9, although neurocognition, assessed by Vineland II, deteriorated in all domains over time, which illustrates disease progression despite the intervention. There were no deaths, serious adverse events or discontinuations. In adults with Gaucher disease type 3 receiving imiglucerase, addition of once-daily venglustat showed acceptable safety and tolerability and preliminary evidence of clinical stability with intriguing but intrinsically inconsistent signals in selected biomarkers, which need to be validated and confirmed in future research."

    "abstract": "<b>Purpose:</b> The addition of Pompe disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type II) to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel in the United States has led to an increase in the number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) and novel variants identified in the <i>GAA</i> gene. This presents a diagnostic challenge, especially in the setting of late-onset Pompe disease when symptoms are rarely apparent at birth. There is an unmet need for validated functional studies to aid in classification of <i>GAA</i> variants. <b>Methods:</b> We developed an <i>in vitro</i> mammalian cell expression and functional analysis system based on guidelines established by the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Sequence Variant Interpretation Working Group for PS3/BS3. We validated the assay with 12 control variants and subsequently analyzed eight VUS or novel variants in <i>GAA</i> identified in patients with a positive newborn screen for Pompe disease without phenotypic evidence of infantile-onset disease. <b>Results:</b> The control variants were analyzed in our expression system and an activity range was established. The pathogenic controls had GAA activity between 0% and 11% of normal. The benign or likely benign controls had an activity range of 54%-100%. The pseudodeficiency variant had activity of 17%. These ranges were then applied to the variants selected for functional studies. Using the threshold of <11%, we were able to apply PS3_ supporting to classify two variants as likely pathogenic (c.316C > T and c.1103G > A) and provide further evidence to support the classification of likely pathogenic for two variants (c.1721T > C and c.1048G > A). One variant (c.1123C > T) was able to be reclassified based on other supporting evidence. We were unable to reclassify three variants (c.664G > A, c.2450A > G, and c.1378G > A) due to insufficient or conflicting evidence. <b>Conclusion:</b> We investigated eight <i>GAA</i> variants as proof of concept using our validated and reproducible <i>in vitro</i> expression and functional analysis system. While additional work is needed to further refine our system with additional controls and different variant types in order to apply the PS3/BS3 criteria at a higher level, this tool can be utilized for variant classification to meet the growing need for novel <i>GAA</i> variant classification in the era of newborn screening for Pompe disease."

Individuals with LSDs face long diagnostic journeys during which debilitating and life-threatening events can occur. Clinical trials and classical descriptions of LSDs typically focus on common manifestations, which are not representative of the vast phenotypic heterogeneity encountered in real-world experience. Additionally, recognizing that there was a limited understanding of the natural history, disease progression, and real-world clinical outcomes of rare LSDs, a collaborative partnership was pioneered 30 years ago to address these gaps. The Rare Disease Registries (RDR) (for Gaucher, Fabry, Mucopolysaccharidosis type I, and Pompe), represent the largest observational database for these LSDs. Over the past thirty years, data from the RDRs have helped to inform scientific understanding and the development of comprehensive monitoring and treatment guidelines by creating a framework for data collection and establishing a standard of care, with an overarching goal to improve the quality of life of affected patients. Here, we highlight the history, process, and impact of the RDRs, and discuss the lessons learned and future directions."

    "abstract": "Sphingolipids play a key structural role in cellular membranes and/or act as signaling molecules. Inherited defects of their catabolism lead to lysosomal storage diseases called sphingolipidoses. Although progress has been made toward a better understanding of their pathophysiology, several issues still remain unsolved. In particular, whether lysosphingolipids, the deacylated form of sphingolipids, both of which accumulate in these diseases, are simple biomarkers or play an instrumental role is unclear. In the meanwhile, evidence has been provided for a high risk of developing malignancies in patients affected with Gaucher disease, the most common sphingolipidosis. This article aims at analyzing the potential involvement of lysosphingolipids in cancer. Knowledge about lysosphingolipids in the context of lysosomal storage diseases is summarized. Available data on the nature and prevalence of cancers in patients affected with sphingolipidoses are also reviewed. Then, studies investigating the biological effects of lysosphingolipids toward pro or antitumor pathways are discussed. Finally, original findings exploring the role of glucosylsphingosine in the development of melanoma are presented. While this lysosphingolipid may behave like a protumorigenic agent, further investigations in appropriate models are needed to elucidate the role of these peculiar lipids, not only in sphingolipidoses but also in malignant diseases in general."

In this review, we focus on different metabolic diseases with respiratory symptoms in adults: lysosomal glycosphingolipidoses such as acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (Niemann-Pick types A and B disease), Gaucher, Fabry, Pompe diseases and mucopolysaccharidoses in general. We also address classical homocystinuria, which is a monogenic vascular disease, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, which is associated with disorders in the lysosomal-related-organelles, and lysinuric protein intolerance, which is due to an amino-acid transporter defect. Presentation and prognosis of these diseases are highly heterogeneous, and respiratory impairment may be central and prognostic. Many are primarily pediatric, and diagnoses are often delivered during childhood. Improved pediatric management has enabled better prognosis and new phenotype of the diseases in the adulthood. Some others can be diagnosed during adulthood. While some diseases call for specific, specialized treatment, all necessitate systematic multidisciplinary management. It is of paramount importance that a pneumologist be familiar with these phenotypes, most of which can benefit from early diagnosis and early therapeutic management with dedicated innovative treatments."

Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis which is characterized by microgliosis, reactive astrocytosis, and neuron loss, although molecular mechanisms leading to neuroinflammation are not well-understood. In this report, we developed a convenient tool to quantify microglia proliferation and activation independently and uncovered abnormal proliferation of microglia (∼2-fold) in an adult genetic nGD model. The nGD-associated pattern of inflammatory mediators pertinent to microglia phenotypes was determined, showing a unique signature favoring pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. Moreover, highly polarized (up or down) dysregulations of mTORC1 signaling with varying lysosome dysfunctions (numbers and volume) were observed among three major cell types of nGD brain. Specifically, hyperactive mTORC1 signaling was detected in all disease-associated microglia (Iba1<sup>high</sup>) with concurrent increase in lysosome function. Conversely, the reduction of neurons presenting high mTORC1 activity was implicated (including Purkinje-like cells) which was accompanied by inconsistent changes of lysosome function in nGD mice. Undetectable levels of mTORC1 activity and low Lamp1 puncta were noticed in astrocytes of both diseased and normal mice, suggesting a minor involvement of mTORC1 pathway and lysosome function in disease-associated astrocytes. These findings highlight the differences and complexity of molecular mechanisms that are involved within various cell types of the brain. The quantifiable parameters established and nGD-associated pattern of neuroinflammatory mediators identified would facilitate the efficacy evaluation on microgliosis and further discovery of novel therapeutic target(s) in treating neuronopathic Gaucher disease."

We present a case of 38-year-old male with a painless solitary soft-tissue swelling over the left proximal tibia, eventually diagnosed it to be a case of Gaucher's disease. This case is unique in the literature, because this subcutaneous Gaucher mass was not associated with a significant past history and was being evaluated as a standard approach to a bone tumor. A 38-year-old man presented to our outpatient department with a solitary, painless soft-tissue swelling of the left proximal tibia noticed 6 months back, which has gradually progressed to a present size of 9x5 cm over a period of 6 months. General physical examination revealed moderate splenomegaly. Radiographs showed an osteolytic lesion in the left proximal tibia without cortical erosion. Radiographs for skeletal survey revealed similar osteolytic lesions elsewhere. Hematological investigations revealed thrombocytopenia. A serum protein electrophoresis was found to be normal and the urine was negative for myeloma proteins. Blood workup for endocrine abnormalities was within normal limits. MRI of the lesion suggests bone infarct. Biopsy from the lesion showed a giant binucleate storage cell filled with glucocerebrosides suggestive of Gaucher's disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by elevated plasma levels of glucocerebrosidases. Gaucher's disease is a rare metabolic disease of the bone which may mimic a primary bone tumor or metastasis. A step-wise meticulous approach with biopsy and elevated plasma levels of glucocerebrosidase helps establish the diagnosis. Once must have a high index of suspicion for Gaucher's disease in an adult with multiple osteolytic lesions without any significant past medical and surgical history."

It is an autosomal recessive disorder caused due to deficiency of lysosome enzyme glucocerebrosidase resulting in accumulation of its substrate in macrophages. The activated macrophages or the Gaucher cells causes hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Extensive marrow involvement causes bony deformity, necrosis, and pathological fractures in non-neuropathic GD. Total hip replacement (THR) for young adult with secondary arthritis due to avascular necrosis (AVN) of femoral head in GD is complex and has high failure rate. As the abnormal cell infiltration involves both femoral head and the acetabulum. It becomes even more challenging, when associated spinopelvic fusion preexists. The altered biomechanics needs special attention to the anteversion of the cup placement and deciding the combined ante-version angle (CAVA). We report a case of GD with avascular necrosis of the femoral head, who underwent spinopelvic fusion to address his osteonecrosis of lumbar vertebra. Previously unreported, here we will discuss the pre-operative radiological evaluation and other intra-operative challenges in the management of GD post-enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with secondary hip arthritis by THR. Hip replacement surgery in patients with Gaucher disease related to secondary arthritis restores pain free mobility. Despite the young age of the patients with GD, prognosis remains better with THR after enzyme replacement therapy. The pre-operative planning, anticipation of complications in metabolically abnormal hip joints makes it a complex primary THR. However, in patients with the spinopelvic fusion placement of the cup, at the narrow range of angle of version with altered spinopelvic rhythm plays an important role in post-operative prosthetic hip stability and patient mobility."

The clinical condition of the neonate deteriorated and due to laboratory evidence of hyperinflammation, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was suspected, and treatment with etoposide and dexamethasone was initiated with temporary stabilization. Gaucher disease type 2 was eventually diagnosed. Gaucher disease can rarely present in neonates as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis."

    "title": "Secondary Mitochondrial Dysfunction as a Cause of Neurodegenerative Dysfunction in Lysosomal Storage Diseases and an Overview of Potential Therapies.",
    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has been recognised a major contributory factor to the pathophysiology of a number of lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). The cause of mitochondrial dysfunction in LSDs is as yet uncertain, but appears to be triggered by a number of different factors, although oxidative stress and impaired mitophagy appear to be common inhibitory mechanisms shared amongst this group of disorders, including Gaucher's disease, Niemann-Pick disease, type C, and mucopolysaccharidosis. Many LSDs resulting from defects in lysosomal hydrolase activity show neurodegeneration, which remains challenging to treat. Currently available curative therapies are not sufficient to meet patients' needs. In view of the documented evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in the neurodegeneration of LSDs, along with the reciprocal interaction between the mitochondrion and the lysosome, novel therapeutic strategies that target the impairment in both of these organelles could be considered in the clinical management of the long-term neurodegenerative complications of these diseases. The purpose of this review is to outline the putative mechanisms that may be responsible for the reported mitochondrial dysfunction in LSDs and to discuss the new potential therapeutic developments."

    "title": "Serum Phospholipid Profile Changes in Gaucher Disease and Parkinson's Disease.",
    "abstract": "Alterations in the levels of serum sphingolipids and phospholipids have been reported in Gaucher disease and in Parkinson's disease, suggesting a potential role of these lipids as biomarkers. This project's objective is to detect novel associations and novel candidate biomarkers in the largest Spanish Gaucher and Parkinson diseases of the Iberian Peninsula. For that, 278 participants were included: 100 sporadic Parkinson's patients, 70 Gaucher patients, 15 <i>GBA1</i>-mutation-carrier Parkinson's patients and 93 controls. A serum lipidomics array including 10 phospholipid groups, 368 species, was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Lipid levels were compared between groups via multiple-regression analyses controlling for clinical and demographic parameters. Additionally, lipid levels were compared within the Gaucher and Parkinson's groups controlling for medication and/or disease severity. Results were controlled for robustness by filtering of non-detectable lipid values. There was an increase in the levels of phosphatidylcholine, with a simultaneous decrease in lyso-phosphatidylcholine, in the Gaucher, Parkinson's and <i>GBA1</i>-mutation-carrier Parkinson's patients vs. controls. Phosphatidylethanolamine, lyso- and plasmalogen-phosphatidylethanolamine were also increased in Gaucher and Parkinson's. Gaucher patients also showed an increase in lyso-phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylglycerol. While in the Gaucher and Parkinson's groups, velaglucerase alpha and dopamine agonists, respectively, showed positive associations with the lipid changes, miglustat treatment in Gaucher patients normalized the altered phosphatidylcholine/lyso-phosphatidylcholine ratio. In conclusion, Gaucher and Parkinson's patients showed changes in various serum phospholipid levels when compared with healthy controls, further supporting the role of such lipids in disease development and, possibly, as putative biomarkers. This hypothesis was reinforced by the normalizing effect of miglustat, and by controlling for data robustness, even though the limited number of participants, especially in the sub-distribution by treatment groups in GD requires validation in a larger number of patients."

    "abstract": "Plasma lysosphingolipids are highly elevated in patients with Gaucher, Krabbe, Fabry, and Niemann-Pick diseases and tend to accumulate to a greater extent than their respective primary sphingolipids in the plasma of affected patients. In this chapter, we describe two liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods to measure plasma concentrations of four lysosphingolipids species. The first method described measures glucosylsphingosine (lyso-GL1) and galactosylsphingosine (psychosine), biomarkers that accumulate in Gaucher and Krabbe diseases, respectively. The second method measures globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) and sphingosylphosphorylcholine (lyso-SPM), biomarkers for Fabry and Niemann-Pick diseases, respectively. Each method utilizes isotope-labeled internal standards and multipoint calibration curves to quantify the analytes of interest. Briefly, plasma samples are mixed with five volumes of LC-MS grade methanol containing internal standard, and protein is removed via centrifugation. Supernatant is dried and resuspended in initial mobile phase. Samples are separated by liquid chromatography using either a BEH amide column (lyso-GL1 + psychosine) or a C18 column (lyso-Gb3 + lyso-SPM). Protonated analytes are measured by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) in positive electrospray ionization mode. Using these methods, we have observed elevations of these lyso- species in Gaucher, Fabry, and Niemann-Pick and successfully distinguished different subtypes reflecting the disease severity."

    "abstract": "This case reports concomitant use of enzyme and substrate reduction therapy to improve chemotherapy adherence in a pediatric patient diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma (ES) and type 1 Gaucher disease (GD). The 17-year-old female presented with 5 months of right knee pain with associated mass on exam. She was diagnosed with ES with pulmonary metastasis. The patient was treated with 17 alternating cycles of vincristine-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide and etoposide chemotherapy followed by tumor resection and radiation per standard protocol. As part of her staging work-up, bone marrow biopsy was performed, significant for Gaucher cells. After the second cycle of chemotherapy the patient began to experience severe delays averaging 30 days between cycles compared to 17.29 days observed in Children's Oncology Group data. Given her bone marrow biopsy findings and chemotherapy delays GD screening was obtained and the patient was diagnosed with GD following genetic confirmation. Due to delays in chemotherapy decreasing chance of remission, the patient was referred to Genetics for aggressive management with imiglucerase and eliglustat. After initiation of therapy the period between chemotherapy cycles decreased to 23 days on average, with a 21% increase in platelet count during therapy. The patient was able to complete ES therapy achieving remission. GD is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, as seen in our patient with ES. GD patients experience prolonged hematologic cytopenia during cancer treatment. Combining Enzyme and Substrate Reduction Therapies should be investigated as an option to improve chemotherapy adherence in GD patients."

    "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to assess the economic profile of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to symptomatic patients with Pompe, Fabry, Gaucher disease and Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency. A systematic search was performed to retrieve and critically assess economic evaluations of enzyme replacement therapy. Publications were screened according to predefined criteria and evaluated according to the Quality of Economic Studies. Data were narratively synthesized. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio greatly exceeded willingness to pay thresholds. The cost of the medication dominated the sensitivity analysis. For Infantile-onset Pompe's disease, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated at €1.043.868 per Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) based on the dose of alglucosidase 40 mg/kg/ week, and €286.114 per QALY for 20 mg of alglucosidase/kg/2 weeks. For adults patients presenting with Pompe disease the reported was ICER € 1.8 million/ QALY. In the case of Fabry disease, the ICER per QALY amounts to 6.1 million Euros/QALY. Respectively for Gaucher's disease, the ICER /QALY was estimated at € 884,994 per QALY. Finally, for patients presenting LAL deficiency NCPE perpetuated an ICER of €2,701,000/QALY. ERT comprise a promising treatment modality for orphan diseases; nevertheless, it is interlaced with a substantial economic burden. Moreover, the available data on the cost-effectiveness ratio are scarce. For certain diseases, such as Fabry, a thorough selection of patients could exert a beneficial effect on the reported ICER. Steep price reductions are imperative for these products, in the conventional reimbursement pathway or a new assessment framework should be elaborated, which in principle, should target uncertainty."

    "abstract": "α-Synuclein (αSyn) aggregation in Lewy bodies and neurites defines both familial and 'sporadic' Parkinson's disease. We previously identified α-helically folded αSyn tetramers, in addition to the long-known unfolded monomers, in normal cells. PD-causing αSyn mutations decrease the tetramer:monomer (T:M) ratio, associated with αSyn hyperphosphorylation and cytotoxicity in neurons and a motor syndrome of tremor and gait deficits in transgenic mice that responds in part to L-DOPA. Here, we asked whether LRRK2 mutations, the most common genetic cause of cases previously considered sporadic PD, also alter tetramer homeostasis. Patient neurons carrying G2019S, the most prevalent LRRK2 mutation, or R1441C each had decreased T:M ratios and pSer129 hyperphosphorylation of their endogenous αSyn along with increased phosphorylation of Rab10, a widely reported substrate of LRRK2 kinase activity. Two LRRK2 kinase inhibitors normalized the T:M ratio and the hyperphosphorylation in the G2019S and R1441C patient neurons. An inhibitor of stearoyl-CoA desaturase, the rate-limiting enzyme for monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis, also restored the αSyn T:M ratio and reversed pSer129 hyperphosphorylation in both mutants. Coupled with the recent discovery that PD-causing mutations of glucocerebrosidase in Gaucher's neurons also decrease T:M ratios, our findings indicate that three dominant genetic forms of PD involve life-long destabilization of αSyn physiological tetramers as a common pathogenic mechanism that can occur upstream of progressive neuronal synucleinopathy. Based on αSyn's finely-tuned interaction with certain vesicles, we hypothesize that the fatty acid composition and fluidity of membranes regulate αSyn's correct binding to highly curved membranes and subsequent assembly into metastable tetramers."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal disorder characterized by the storage of glucosylceramide in macrophages (\"Gaucher cells\"), particularly in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. The most common phenotype, GD type 1, usually presents with hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, and sometimes bone involvement at variable age. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is available and effective, but some severe manifestations are irreversible (e.g., osteonecrosis), so that early treatment is crucial. We describe a 4-year-old Albanian male with GD type 1, diagnosed through newborn screening (NBS), presented during follow up with multiple osteonecrotic areas in both femurs. He had no other symptoms or signs of disease, except for increasing of lyso-Gb1 biomarker. Early initiation of ERT allowed a partial improvement of bone lesions. Our case highlights the importance of NBS for GD and of close follow-up of presymptomatic patients, especially if biomarker levels are increasing. In the absence of NBS, GD should be considered in patients who present with bone lesions, also isolated. Early diagnosis and treatment improve the course of disease and avoid irreversible sequelae."

    "abstract": "While multiple system atrophy (MSA) has been considered a sporadic disease, there were previously reported multiplex families with MSA. Furthermore, several families with multiple patients with MSA and Parkinson's disease (PD) have been reported. As genetic risk factors for MSA, functionally impaired variants in COQ2 and Gaucher-disease-causing GBA variants have been reported. While it has been established that GBA variants are associated with PD, COQ2 may also be associated with PD. In 672 patients with MSA, we identified 12 multiplex families of patients with MSA and PD in first-degree relatives. We conducted a detailed analysis of the clinical presentations of these patients and genetic analyses of GBA and COQ2. In the multiplex families, a patient with MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) was observed in nine families, while a patient with MSA cerebellar subtype (MSA-C) was observed in three families. Six families had siblings with MSA and PD, five families had a parent-offspring pair with MSA and PD, and in one family, a sibling and a parent of an MSA patient had PD. In genetic analyses of these patients, GBA variants were identified in one of the 12 MSA patients and two of the seven PD patients. Functionally impaired variants of COQ2 were identified in two of the 12 MSA patients and not identified in the seven PD patients. This study further emphasizes the occurrence of MSA and PD in first-degree relatives, raising the possibility that a common genetic basis underlies MSA and PD. Even though variants of COQ2 and GBA were identified in some patients in multiplex families with MSA and PD, it is necessary to further explore as yet unidentified genetic risk factors shared by MSA and PD."

    "abstract": "Autosomal recessive Gaucher disease (GD) is likely underdiagnosed in many countries. Because the number of diagnosed GD patients in Finland is relatively low, and the true prevalence is currently not known, it was hypothesized that undiagnosed GD patients may exist in Finland. Our previous study demonstrated the applicability of Gaucher Earlier Diagnosis Consensus point-scoring system (GED-C PSS; Mehta et al., 2019) and Finnish biobank data and specimens in the automated point scoring of large populations. An indicative point-score range for Finnish GD patients was determined, but undiagnosed patients were not identified partly due to high number of high-score subjects in combination with a lack of suitable samples for diagnostics in the assessed biobank population. The current study extended the screening to another biobank and evaluated the feasibility of utilising the automated GED-C PSS in conjunction with small nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip genotype data from the FinnGen study of biobank sample donors in the identification of undiagnosed GD patients in Finland. Furthermore, the applicability of FFPE tissues and DNA restoration in the next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the <i>GBA</i> gene were tested. Previously diagnosed Finnish GD patients eligible to the study, and up to 45,100 sample donors in Helsinki Biobank (HBB) were point scored. The GED-C point scoring, adjusted to local data, was automated, but also partly manually verified for GD patients. The SNP chip genotype data for rare <i>GBA</i> variants was visually assessed. FFPE tissues of GD patients were obtained from HBB and Biobank Borealis of Northern Finland (BB). Three previously diagnosed GD patients and one patient previously treated for GD-related features were included. A genetic diagnosis was confirmed for the patient treated for GD-related features. The GED-C point score of the GD patients was 12.5-22.5 in the current study. The score in eight Finnish GD patients of the previous and the current study is thus 6-22.5 points per patient. In the automated point scoring of the HBB subpopulation (N ≈ 45,100), the overall scores ranged from 0 to 17.5, with 0.77% (346/45,100) of the subjects having ≥10 points. The analysis of SNP chip genotype data was able to identify the diagnosed GD patients, but potential undiagnosed patients with the GED-C score and/or the <i>GBA</i> genotype indicative of GD were not discovered. Restoration of the FFPE tissue DNA improved the quality of the <i>GBA</i> NGS, and pathogenic <i>GBA</i> variants were confirmed in five out of six unrestored and in all four restored FFPE DNA samples. These findings imply that the prevalence of diagnosed patients (~1:325,000) may indeed correspond the true prevalence of GD in Finland. The SNP chip genotype data is a valuable tool that complements the screening with the GED-C PSS, especially if the genotyping pipeline is tuned for rare variants. These proof-of-concept biobank tools can be adapted to other rare genetic diseases."

Data from the Gaucher Outcome Survey (GOS), an international registry for patients with confirmed GD, were used to evaluate the reasons for, and consequences of, switching between these treatment types. Of the 1843 patients enrolled in GOS on 25 February 2020, 245 had undergone a treatment switch: 222 from initial ERT to SRT (of whom 88 later switched back to ERT) and 23 from initial SRT to ERT. The most common reasons for ERT-SRT switching were duration of infusion (25.4%), drug shortage (22.0%), and adverse events (AEs; 11.9%), and for SRT-ERT switching, AEs (63.6%), lack of beneficial effect (16.4%), and participation in a clinical trial (9.1%). Bodyweight and hematologic parameters largely remained stable before and after switching between ERT and SRT, although with substantial variation between patients. These findings contribute to understanding why treatment switching occurs in patients with GD, and may help physicians recognize the real-world impact of treatment switching between ERT and SRT for patients with GD."

It is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), and variants in the gene encoding this enzyme are important determinants of eliglustat pharmacokinetics (PK) and drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The existing drug label addresses the DDIs to some extent but has omitted scenarios where both metabolizing CYPs (2D6 and 3A4) are mildly or moderately inhibited. The objectives of this study were (i) to develop and validate an eliglustat physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model with and without drug interactions, (ii) to simulate untested DDI scenarios, and (iii) to explore potential dosing flexibility using lower dose strength of eliglustat (commercially not available). PK data from healthy adults receiving eliglustat with or without interacting drugs were obtained from literature and used for the PBPK model development and validation. The model-predicted single-dose and steady-state maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub> ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of eliglustat were within 50-150% of the observed values when eliglustat was administered alone or coadministered with ketoconazole or paroxetine. Then as model-based simulations, we illustrated eliglustat exposure as a victim of interaction when coadministered with fluvoxamine following the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dosing recommendations. Second, we showed that with lower eliglustat doses (21 mg, 42 mg once daily) the exposure in participants of intermediate and poor metabolizer phenotypes was within the outlined safety margin (C<sub>max</sub> <250 ng/mL) when eliglustat was administered with ketoconazole, where the current recommendation is a contraindication of coadministration (84 mg). The present study demonstrated that patients with CYP2D6 deficiency may benefit from lower doses of eliglustat."

We conducted a study involving 2123 patients with GD type 1 (GD1) to assess the incidence of hematological malignancies, gammopathies, and solid tumors in an international observational study, the International Cooperative Gaucher Group Gaucher Registry (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00358943). Risk for cancer overall and for each type of malignancy was compared to the United States (US) population using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Natural history of gammopathy was determined through assessing the progression from a diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) to multiple myeloma (MM). Risk for hematological malignancies was more than four times higher than expected compared to the general population: non-Hodgkin lymphoma was approximately three times higher; MM was approximately nine times higher. Age-specific incidence rates of MGUS were unexpectedly high among younger patients. The 10-year cumulative incidence of MM after diagnosis of MGUS was 7.9%, comparable to the general population. Compared to the general US population, GD1 patients were at higher risk for solid malignancies of liver (2.9 times), kidney (2.8 times), melanoma (2.5 times), and breast (1.4 times). Colorectal, prostate, and lung cancer risks were lower than expected. These findings help advance care of patients with GD1 by supporting recommendations for individualized monitoring for malignancies and antecedents such as MGUS for MM and provoke important questions of the role of glucosylceramide and related sphingolipids in cancer biology."

For appropriate interpretation of intervention-based results or for evaluating candidate biomarkers, other things being equal, lower variability in biomarker measurement would be helpful. However, variability in rare disease biomarkers is often poorly understood. Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1) is one such rare lysosomal storage disorder. Oxidative stress and inflammation have been linked to the pathophysiology of GD1 and validated measures of these processes can provide predictive value for treatment success or disease progression. This study was undertaken to investigate and compare the extent of longitudinal biological variation over a three-month period for various blood-based oxidative stress and inflammation markers in participants with GD1 on stable standard-of-care therapy (N = 13), treatment-naïve participants with GD1 (N = 5), and in age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers (N = 18). We utilized Bland-Altman plots for visual comparison of the biological variability among the three measurements. We also report group-wise means and the percentage of coefficient of variation (%CV) for 15 biomarkers. Qualitatively, we show specific markers (IL-1Ra, IL-8, and MIP-1b) to be consistently altered in GD1, irrespective of therapy status, highlighting the need for adjunctive therapies that can target and modulate these biomarkers. This information can help guide the selection of candidate biomarkers for future intervention-based studies in GD1 patients."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an inherited disorder caused by recessive mutations in the <i>GBA1</i> gene that encodes the lysosomal enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (β-GC). β-GC hydrolyzes glucosylceramide (GluCer) into glucose and ceramide in the lysosome, and the loss of its activity leads to GluCer accumulation in different tissues. In severe cases, enzymatic deficiency triggers inflammation, organomegaly, bone disease, and neurodegeneration. Neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD) encompasses two different forms of the disease, characterized by chronic or acute damage to the central nervous system (CNS). The cellular and molecular studies that uncover the pathological mechanisms of nGD mainly focus on lysosomal dysfunction since the lysosome is the key organelle affected in GD. However, new studies show alterations in other organelles that contribute to nGD pathology. For instance, abnormal accumulation of GluCer in lysosomes due to the loss of β-GC activity leads to excessive calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), activating the ER-associated degradation pathway and the unfolded protein response. Recent evidence indicates mitophagy is altered in nGD, resulting in the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, a critical factor in disease progression. Additionally, nGD patients present alterations in mitochondrial morphology, membrane potential, ATP production, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Little is known about potential dysfunction in other organelles of the secretory pathway, such as the Golgi apparatus and exosomes. This review focuses on collecting evidence regarding organelle dysfunction beyond lysosomes in nGD. We briefly describe cellular and animal models and signaling pathways relevant to uncovering the pathological mechanisms and new therapeutic targets in GD."

    "abstract": "Neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by biallelic mutations in <i>GBA</i> and buildup of glycosphingolipids in lysosomes. Neuronal injury and cell death are prominent pathological features; however, the role of <i>GBA</i> in individual cell types and involvement of microglia, blood-derived macrophages, and immune infiltrates in nGD pathophysiology remains enigmatic. Here, using single-cell resolution of mouse nGD brains, lipidomics, and newly generated biomarkers, we found induction of neuroinflammation pathways involving microglia, NK cells, astrocytes, and neurons. Targeted rescue of <i>Gba</i> in microglia and neurons, respectively, in <i>Gba</i>-deficient, nGD mice reversed the buildup of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph), concomitant with amelioration of neuroinflammation, reduced serum neurofilament light chain (Nf-L), and improved survival. Serum GlcSph concentration was correlated with serum Nf-L and ApoE in nGD mouse models as well as in GD patients. <i>Gba</i> rescue in microglia/macrophage compartment prolonged survival, which was further enhanced upon treatment with brain-permeant inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, effects mediated via improved glycosphingolipid homeostasis, and reversal of neuroinflammation involving activation of microglia, brain macrophages, and NK cells. Together, our study delineates individual cellular effects of <i>Gba</i> deficiency in nGD brains, highlighting the central role of neuroinflammation driven by microglia activation. Brain-permeant small-molecule inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase reduced the accumulation of bioactive glycosphingolipids, concomitant with amelioration of neuroinflammation involving microglia, NK cells, astrocytes, and neurons. Our findings advance nGD disease biology whilst identifying compelling biomarkers of nGD to improve patient management, enrich clinical trials, and illuminate therapeutic targets.

The few studies analyzing Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) in GD involved mainly untreated patients and supported a hypermetabolic condition possibly due to the associated inflammatory state. Definitive conclusions could not be drawn also because of the heterogeneity and the small size of the samples investigated. In order to expand current knowledge concerning, in particular the condition of patients under Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), we evaluated the nutritional status of a relatively large sample of GD patients followed at Federico II University Hospital in Naples, Italy. (2) Methods: The study, having a cross-sectional design and involving 26 patients on ERT, included routine biochemical analyses, bioelectrical impedance analysis, indirect calorimetry, and administration of food frequency and physical activity questionnaires. The results in GD patients were compared with those from an appropriate control group. (3) Results: GD patients had normal biochemical parameters in 80% of cases, except for HDL-cholesterol, consumed a hyper-lipidic diet, and had a 60% prevalence of overweight/obesity. Body composition did not differ between patients and controls; however, measured REE was significantly lower than predicted and was reduced in comparison with the healthy controls. (4) Conclusions: This study provided novel elements to the present knowledge about REE and the nutritional status of GD patients under ERT. Its results warrant confirmation in even larger GD population samples and a more in-depth investigation of the long-term effects of treatment superimposed on the basic pathophysiological disease condition."

    "abstract": "Deficiency in scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2) is related to both Gaucher disease (GD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), which are both neurodegenerative-related diseases without cure. Although both diseases lead to weight loss, which affects the quality of life and the progress of diseases, the underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we found that <i>Scarb2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice showed significantly reduced lipid storage in white fat tissues (WAT) compared to WT mice on a regular chow diet. However, the phenotype is independent of heat production, activity, food intake or energy absorption. Furthermore, adipocyte differentiation and cholesterol homeostasis were unaffected. We found that the impaired lipid accumulation of <i>Adiponectin-cre; Scarb2<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice was due to the imbalance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Mechanistically, the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/ eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) pathway was down-regulated in Scarb2 deficient adipocytes, leading to impaired mitochondrial respiration and enhanced glycolysis. Altogether, we reveal the role of SCARB2 in metabolism regulation besides the nervous system, which provides a theoretical basis for weight loss treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "β-glucocerebrosidase is a lysosomal hydrolase involved in the catabolism of the sphingolipid glucosylceramide. Biallelic loss of function mutations in this enzyme are responsible for the onset of Gaucher disease, while monoallelic β-glucocerebrosidase mutations represent the first genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease. Despite this evidence, the molecular mechanism linking the impairment in β-glucocerebrosidase activity with the onset of neurodegeneration in still unknown. In this frame, we developed two in vitro neuronal models of β-glucocerebrosidase deficiency, represented by mouse cerebellar granule neurons and human-induced pluripotent stem cells-derived dopaminergic neurons treated with the specific β-glucocerebrosidase inhibitor conduritol B epoxide. Neurons deficient for β-glucocerebrosidase activity showed a lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide and the onset of neuronal damage. Moreover, we found that neurons react to the lysosomal impairment by the induction of their biogenesis and exocytosis. This latter event was responsible for glucosylceramide accumulation also at the plasma membrane level, with an alteration in lipid and protein composition of specific signaling microdomains. Collectively, our data suggest that β-glucocerebrosidase loss of function impairs the lysosomal compartment, establishing a lysosome-plasma membrane axis responsible for modifications in the plasma membrane architecture and possible alterations of intracellular signaling pathways, leading to neuronal damage."

Respiratory complaints were associated with a higher risk of psychiatric disorder and new-onset psychiatric disorder, and cognitive complaints were associated with a higher risk of psychiatric disorder. Long COVID is associated with psychiatric disorders, new-onset psychiatric disorders and suicide risk. Psychiatric disorders and suicide risk should be systematically assessed in patients with long COVID."

However, majority of the GD patients have not revealed the expansion of severe form of the COVID-19. This study suggests that the pre-existing humoral immunity influence the devlopment of strong network of antibodies to different structural proteins of SARS-CoV2 in GD patients with COVID-19. Such antibodies and virus proteins interaction cause the comprehensive neutralization of SARS-CoV2 and provides protection from the development of severe form of COVID-19 in GD patients. This information could be helpful for better understanding of the disease mechanism as well as the development of additional potential therapy that could stop the growth of the severe symptoms and/or death in GD patients with COVID-19."

    "abstract": "A number of genetic risk factors have been identified over the past decade for Parkinson's Disease (PD), with variants in GBA prominent among them. GBA encodes the lysosomal enzyme that degrades the glycosphingolipid, glucosylceramide (GlcCer), with the activity of this enzyme defective in Gaucher disease. Based on the ill-defined relationship between glycosphingolipid metabolism and PD, we now analyze levels of various lipids by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry in four brain regions from age- and sex-matched patient samples, including idiopathic PD, PD patients with a GBA mutation and compare both to control brains (n = 21 for each group) obtained from individuals who died from a cause unrelated to PD. Of all the glycerolipids, sterols, and (glyco)sphingolipids (251 lipids in total), the only lipid class which showed significant differences were the gangliosides (sialic acid-containing complex glycosphingolipids), which were elevated in 3 of the 4 PD-GBA brain regions. There was no clear correlation between levels of individual gangliosides and the genetic variant in Gaucher disease [9 samples of severe (neuronopathic), 4 samples of mild (non-neuronopathic) GBA variants, and 8 samples with low ﻿pathogenicity variants which have a higher risk for development of PD]. Most brain regions, i.e. occipital cortex, cingulate gyrus, and striatum, did not show a statistically significant elevation of GlcCer in PD-GBA. Only one region, the middle temporal gyrus, showed a small, but significant elevation in GlcCer concentration in PD-GBA. We conclude that changes in ganglioside, but not in GlcCer levels, may contribute to the association between PD and GBA mutations."

Efforts to elucidate the mechanisms behind GBA1-associated PD have highlighted shared pathways in idiopathic PD including the loss and gain-of-function hypotheses, endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipid metabolism, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and altered autophagy-lysosomal pathway responsible for degradation of aggregated and misfolded a-synuclein. GBA1-associated PD exhibits subtle differences in phenotype and disease progression compared to idiopathic counterparts notably an earlier age of onset, faster motor decline and greater frequency of non-motor symptoms (which also constitute a significant aspect of the prodromal phase of the disease). GBA1-targeted therapies have been developed and are being investigated in clinical trials. The most notable are Ambroxol, a small molecule chaperone, and Venglustat, a blood-brain-barrier-penetrant substrate reduction therapy agent. It is imperative that further studies clarify the aetiology of GBA1-associated PD, enabling the development of a greater abundance of targeted therapies in this new era of precision medicine."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is a genetic disorder and the most common lysosomal disease caused by the deficiency of enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Although enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is successfully applied using mannose-exposed conjugated glucocerebrosidase, the lower stability of the enzyme in blood demands periodic intravenous administration that adds to the high cost of treatment. In this work, the enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase was encapsulated inside virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) from brome mosaic virus (BMV), and their surface was functionalized with mannose groups for targeting to macrophages. The VLP nanoreactors showed significant GCase catalytic activity. Moreover, the Michaelis-Menten constants for the free GCase enzyme (K<sub>M</sub> =0.29 mM) and the functionalized nanoreactors (K<sub>M</sub> =0.32 mM) were similar even after chemical modification. Importantly, the stability of enzymes under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 °C) was enhanced by ≈11-fold after encapsulation; this is beneficial for obtaining a higher blood circulation half-life, which may decrease the cost of therapy by reducing the requirement of multiple intravenous injections. Finally, the mannose receptor targeted enzymatic nanoreactors showed enhanced internalization into macrophage cells. Thus, the catalytic activity and cell targeting suggest the potential of these nanoreactors in ERT of Gaucher's disease."

These cells are characterized by deregulated expression of cell surface markers, abnormal secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and iron sequestration. These cells are known to infiltrate tissues resulting in hematological manifestations, splenomegaly, and bone diseases. We have already demonstrated that Gaucher red blood cells exhibit altered properties suggesting their key role in GD clinical manifestations. We hypothesized that Gaucher's erythrocytes could be prone to premature destruction by macrophages contributing to the formation of altered macrophages and Gaucher-like cells. We conducted in vitro experiments of erythrophagocytosis using erythrocytes from Gaucher's patients or healthy donors. Our results showed an enhanced erythrophagocytosis of Gaucher red blood cells compared to healthy red blood cells, which is related to erythrocyte sphingolipids overload and reduced deformability. Importantly, we showed elevated expression of the antigen-presenting molecules CD1d and MHC-II and of the iron-regulator hepcidin in macrophages, as well as enhanced secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β after phagocytosis of GD erythrocytes. These results strongly suggested that erythrophagocytosis in GD contribute to phenotypic modifications in macrophages. This present study shows that erythrocytes-macrophages interactions may be crucial in GD pathophysiology and pathogenesis."

An illustration of this challenge is an occurrence of a late diagnosis of a proband initially diagnosed with West syndrome, later revealed to be caused by Incontinentia pigmenti (IP). Furthermore, 20 years later, it was discovered that the proband was also a carrier of a heterozygous <i>GBA</i> gene mutation. The methods used in diagnostics were as follows: <i>IKBKG</i> gene analysis, the X-chromosome inactivation assay, analyses of the genes relevant for neurodegeneration, WES analysis, analysis of biochemical parameters typical for Gaucher disease (GD), and autoantibodies including IFN-α2a and IFN-ω. To avoid overlooking IP and other possible rare disease diagnoses, carefully searching for dermatological signs in these conditions is recommended. It is important that the diagnostic criteria are based on quality and extensive data from multiple studies of each rare disease. Establishing precise diagnostic criteria for as many rare diseases as possible and establishing a publicly accessible database of rare diseases with a search possibility according to phenotypic abnormalities and genetic mutations would greatly facilitate and speed up the establishment of an accurate diagnosis."

This study was performed to determine the detection rate of GD in a selected patient population with unexplained splenomegaly in Korea. This was a multicenter, observational study conducted at 18 sites in Korea between December 2016 and February 2020. Adult patients with unexplained splenomegaly were enrolled and tested for β-glucosidase enzyme activity on dried blood spots (DBS) and in peripheral blood leukocytes. Mutation analysis was performed if the test was positive or indeterminate for the enzyme assay. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with GD in patients with unexplained splenomegaly. A total of 352 patients were enrolled in this study (male patients, 199; mean age, 48.42 yr). Amongst them, 14.77% of patients had concomitant hepatomegaly. The most common sign related to GD was splenomegaly (100%), followed by thrombocytopenia (44.32%) and, anemia (40.91%). The β-glucosidase activity assay on DBS and peripheral leukocytes showed abnormal results in sixteen and six patients, respectively. Eight patients were tested for the mutation, seven of whom were negative and one patient showed a positive mutation analysis result. One female patient who presented with splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia was diagnosed with type 1 GD. The detection rate of GD was 0.2841% (exact 95% CI, 0.0072‒1.5726). The detection rate of GD in probable high-risk patients in Korea was lower than expected. However, the role of hemato-oncologists is still important in the diagnosis of GD."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a vast group of more than 50 clinically identified metabolic diseases. They are singly rare, but they affect collectively 1 on 5,000 live births. They result in most of the cases from an enzymatic defect within lysosomes, which causes the subsequent augmentation of unwanted substrates. This accumulation process leads to plenty of clinical signs, determined by the specific substrate and accumulation area. The majority of LSDs present a broad organ and tissue engagement. Brain, connective tissues, viscera and bones are usually afflicted. Among them, brain disease is markedly frequent (two-thirds of LSDs). The most clinically employed approach to treat LSDs is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which is practiced by administering systemically the missed or defective enzyme. It represents a healthful strategy for 11 LSDs at the moment, but it solves the pathology only in the case of Gaucher disease. This approach, in fact, is not efficacious in the case of LSDs that have an effect on the central nervous system (CNS) due to the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Additionally, ERT suffers from several other weak points, such as low penetration of the exogenously administered enzyme to poorly vascularized areas, the development of immunogenicity and infusion-associated reactions (IARs), and, last but not least, the very high cost and lifelong needed. To ameliorate these weaknesses lot of efforts have been recently spent around the development of innovative nanotechnology-driven ERT strategies. They may boost the power of ERT and minimize adverse reactions by loading enzymes into biodegradable nanomaterials. Enzyme encapsulation into biocompatible liposomes, micelles, and polymeric nanoparticles, for example, can protect enzymatic activity, eliminating immunologic reactions and premature enzyme degradation. It can also permit a controlled release of the payload, ameliorating pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug. Additionally, the potential to functionalize the surface of the nanocarrier with targeting agents (antibodies or peptides), could promote the passage through biological barriers. In this review we examined the clinically applied ERTs, highlighting limitations that do not allow to completely cure the specific LSD. Later, we critically consider the nanotechnology-based ERT strategies that have beenin-vitroand/orin-vivotested to improve ERT efficacy."

NMR studies confirmed the conformational change while X-ray data reveal bound conformations and binding modes. These results were further corroborated by cell studies showing increases in GCase activity when using the pH-switchable probe at low dosing.

There is significant interest into how GCase dysfunction contributes to these diseases, however, progress toward a full understanding is complicated by presence of endogenous cellular factors that influence lysosomal GCase activity. Indeed, such factors are thought to contribute to the high degree of variable penetrance of <i>GBA</i> mutations among patients. Robust methods to quantitatively measure GCase activity within lysosomes are therefore needed to advance research in this area, as well as to develop clinical assays to monitor disease progression and assess GCase-directed therapeutics. Here, we report a selective fluorescence-quenched substrate, LysoFQ-GBA, which enables measuring endogenous levels of lysosomal GCase activity within living cells. LysoFQ-GBA is a sensitive tool for studying chemical or genetic perturbations of GCase activity using either fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. We validate the quantitative nature of measurements made with LysoFQ-GBA using various cell types and demonstrate that it accurately reports on both target engagement by GCase inhibitors and the <i>GBA</i> allele status of cells. Furthermore, through comparisons of GD, PD, and control patient-derived tissues, we show there is a close correlation in the lysosomal GCase activity within monocytes, neuronal progenitor cells, and neurons.

In February and March 2021, semi-structured interviews were conducted by the authors (supported by qualified interviewers) with patients and/or their caregivers (for patients < 16 years old) who were recruited from a Japanese patient association, the Association of Gaucher Disease Patients in Japan. Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts was used to identify major themes and key topics within those themes. Hierarchical cluster analysis and co-occurrence network analysis were performed to map relationships between commonly occurring words.

Commonly used words and the relationships between words identified through the hierarchical cluster and co-occurrence network analyses supported these themes and topics. The themes and topics identified in this analysis were specific to patients with types 2 and 3 GD and will be used to inform the development of a HRQOL questionnaire specifically for patients with all GD types."

Altogether, 6 variants were detected, compounding 6 different genotypes. All genotypes contained the N370S variant, which was detected with an overall prevalence of 60.7%. Other frequent variants included the 1263del55 deletion and the double mutant allele D409H;H255Q, each with a prevalence of 14.2%. We detected two rare mutations: W92* - a pathogenic nonsense mutation and D399N - a single nucleotide variant of uncertain pathogenicity. The most common genotypes were N370S/1263del55 and H255Q;D409H/N370S, both present in 4/14 patients, followed by N370S homozygosity (3/14).

Thrombocytopenia was present in 9/14, while half of the patients had anemia. Bone pathology was demonstrated in 8 patients. Patients with different genotypes displayed a high degree of phenotypic heterogeneity, suggesting that the other allele determines the onset and severity of the disease in patients with the N370S mutation.

First, alternative uses of the two GBA gene promoters were identified in fibroblasts and HL60-derived macrophages.

One of its main features is the over-expressed chronic stimulation and activation of the immune system, which may play a crucial role in the development of some malignancies associated with GD. We describe a young woman diagnosed with GD type 1 in early adulthood who developed early-onset colorectal cancer shortly after GD diagnosis and the initiation of enzyme replacement therapy. She underwent radical surgical resection of the colon and adjuvant chemotherapy due to metastatic disease in the liver. She failed first-line therapy with capecitabine and is currently being treated with irinotecan plus the monoclonal antibody cetuximab. Although there is no evidence of an association between GD and colorectal cancer, this presentation in a young woman without a family history or risk factors may indicate a link. During anticancer treatment, only grade 3 anaemia was documented and no other haematological toxicities were observed. Enzyme replacement therapy at the recommended dose is regularly administered at scheduled intervals. The dosage may be increased in future if necessary to alleviate profound cytopenia. Anticancer treatment in patients with GD can be challenging due to the accompanying cytopenia. Optimal treatment of these patients with cancer requires greater understanding of the pathophysiology of GD and its impact on haematopoiesis. There may be a correlation between the hyperinflammatory background of untreated Gaucher disease and the development of neoplasia.Gaucher disease has rarely been described in association with colorectal cancer.Gaucher disease can be further worsened by chemotherapeutic agents."

    "title": "A Systematic Review and Meta-analyses of Longitudinal Studies on Drug Treatments for Gaucher Disease.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare disorder linked to the absence/deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. GD can be treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT). The aim of this systematic review (SR) is to assess the effectiveness of drugs used for GD treatment. Searches were conducted in PubMed and Scopus, in April 2021. The search strategies encompassed the name of the disease and of the drug treatments. Manual search was also conducted. Observational and interventional longitudinal studies evaluating ERT and SRT for GD were included. Single mean meta-analyses were conducted for each drug using R. The initial search retrieved 2246 articles after duplicates were removed. Following screening and eligibility assessment, 68 reports were included. The studies evaluated imiglucerase, velaglucerase alfa, taliglucerase alfa, miglustat, and eliglustat. The results showed that ERT is effective as a treatment in both naïve and experienced patients. Miglustat did not significantly improve blood outcomes in naïve patients and resulted in a decrease in the platelet levels of experienced patients. Eliglustat was mainly assessed for experienced patients and resulted in stable outcome values. This extensive SR confirms the effectiveness of GD treatments in short- and long-term follow-ups. The results were favorable for all ERTs and for eliglustat. Based on the assessed evidence, miglustat did not achieved expressive results. However, all evidence should be interpreted considering its limitations and does not replace well-conducted randomized trials."

    "abstract": "Infantile onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is a rare devastating disease that presents in early infancy with rapidly progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe generalized myopathy and death within the first year of life. The emergence of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human acid alpha glucosidase (rhGAA) has improved the natural course of IOPD with a significant impact on cardiomyopathy but has a more limited effect on the progression of myopathy and consequently the later deterioration of the disease. Possible reasons for reduced ERT efficacy include insufficient enzyme, partial targeting of skeletal muscle and the development of IgG rhGAA antibodies especially in patients who are cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM) negative. We report a CRIM-negative IOPD female patient who started treatment upon diagnosis at 4.5 months with ERT at 20 mg/kg every other week and a course of combined immunomodulation with rituximab, methotrexate and IVIG according to the published Duke protocol and increased ERT within a month to 40 mg/kg/week. Despite initial good clinical response to ERT and immunomodulation, monthly monitoring identified a gradual increase of serum antibody titers to rhGAA necessitating a second course of immunomodulation with bortezomib and maintenance rituximab and methotrexate. A gradual reduction in frequency of immunotherapy was instituted and over a period of 14 months was discontinued. Serum anti-rhGAA antibody titers remained negative for 5 months since cessation of immunomodulation and the patient is now immune tolerant with recovery of CD19. At the age of 30 months the patient is walking independently and has normal cardiac function and anatomy. We recommend initiating ERT at 40 mg/kg/week in CRIM-negative IOPD patients, concomitant with immunomodulation and monthly monitoring of serum anti-rhGAA IgG titers upon confirmation of the diagnosis."

The presence of pseudogene GBAP1 predisposes to structural variants, complicating genetic analysis. We present two methods to resolve recombinant alleles and other variants in GBA: Gauchian, a tool for short-read, whole-genome sequencing data analysis, and Oxford Nanopore sequencing after PCR enrichment. Both methods were concordant for 42 samples carrying a range of recombinants and GBAP1-related mutations, and Gauchian outperformed the GATK Best Practices pipeline. Applying Gauchian to sequencing of over 10,000 individuals shows that copy number variants (CNVs) spanning GBAP1 are relatively common in Africans. CNV frequencies in PD and LBD are similar to controls. Gains may coexist with other mutations in patients, and a modifying effect cannot be excluded. Gauchian detects more GBA variants in LBD than PD, especially severe ones. These findings highlight the importance of accurate GBA analysis in these patients."

In order to improve their outcome, we administrated eliglustat, a substrate reduction therapy (SRT), in combination with ERT to four patients, age ranged 9-18 years, for two years. The results revealed that patients' plasma glucosylsphingosine (lyso-GL1) level and chitotriosidase activity both decreased after adding eliglustat. In three patients who completed follow-up MRI scanning, sizes of lymph nodes all decreased. No severe adverse events were attributed to eliglustat. Therefore, our data suggest that a combined SRT and ERT treatment may improve the ERT-resistant symptoms in patients with GD3."

Such studies have traditionally sourced tissue exclusively from brain bank biorepositories, however, limited inventories signal that these facilities may not be able to keep pace with this growing research domain. Formalin fixed, whole body donors willed to academic institutions offer a potential supplemental tissue source, the lipid profiles of which have yet to be described. To determine the potential of these subjects in lipid analysis, the lipid levels of fresh and fixed frontal cortical gray matter of human donors were compared using high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Results revealed commensurate levels of specific triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, hexosyl ceramides, and hydroxy hexosyl ceramides. Baseline levels of these lipid families in human fixed tissue were identified <i>via</i> a broader survey study covering six brain regions: cerebellar gray matter, superior cerebellar peduncle, gray and subcortical white matter of the precentral gyrus, periventricular white matter, and internal capsule. Whole body donors may therefore serve as supplemental tissue sources for lipid analysis in a variety of clinical contexts, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, multiple sclerosis, and Gaucher's disease."

    "abstract": "There are multiple hematological and other entities (metastases, infections) that can affect the bone marrow (BM). The gold standard imaging technique for BM examination is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Technological advances have made it possible to digitalize image files and create applications that help to produce higher quality structured reports, facilitating the analysis of data and unifying the criteria collected, making it possible to fill an existing gap. The aim of this study is to present a structured report model applicable to BM studies by MRI. We have carried out a systematic review following the recommendations of the PRISMA checklist report to explore previous publications applying structured BM MRI reporting. Eligibility criteria: the selection of articles carried out by MeSH thesaurus. Original or review articles of BM pathology assessed by MRI. Our group with a wide experience in the evaluation of BM by MRI have designed a model for BM report using eight items: demographic data, diagnostic suspicion, technical data, type of exam initial or control, distribution and patterns involvement, complications and location, total assessment comments. We have not found articles that reflect the existence of a structured report of BM examination by MRI. Only one descriptive article has been identified on guidelines for acquisition, interpretation and reporting which refers to a single entity. With the selected parameters, a software has been developed that allows to fill in the sections of the structured report with ease and immediacy and to send the result directly to the clinician. Structured reports are the result of applying a logical structure to the radiological report, and the rules of elaboration comprise several criteria: (I) using a uniform language. The standardization of terminology avoids ambiguity in reporting and makes it easier to compare reports. (II) Accurately describe the radiological findings, following a prescribed order with review questions and answers. (III) Drafting using diagnostic screening tables. (IV) Respect the radiologists' workflow by facilitating the work and not hindering it. The final report of this work has been the product of the clinical-radiological collaboration in our working group."

The GBA1 mutations L444P, N370S and many other have been shown to associate with the disease in populations with diverse background. Some GBA1 polymorphisms have a less pronounced effect, and their pathogenicity has been debated. We have previously found associations with L444P, N370S and E326K and Parkinson's disease in Sweden. In this study we used pyrosequencing to genotype the T369M variant in a large Swedish cohort consisting of 1,131 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, and 1,594 control subjects to evaluate the possibility of this variant conferring an increased risk for Parkinson's disease. The minor allele frequency was 2.15% in patients and 1.76% in controls. Statistical analysis showed that there was no significant difference in allele frequency between patients and control subjects, p-value 0.37, Odds Ratio 1.23 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.82-1.83. Our results suggest that T369M is not a risk factor for Parkinson's disease in the Swedish population."

    "title": "Lysosomal functions and dysfunctions: Molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Gaucher disease and its association with Parkinson disease.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomes have a critical role in maintaining normal cellular homeostasis mediated by their involvement in secretion, plasma membrane repair, cell signaling and energy metabolism. Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of approximately 50 rare disorders caused by lysosomal dysfunction that occur due to mutations in a gene of a lysosomal protein. Gaucher disease (GD), an autosomal recessive disorder and one of the most common LSDs, is caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid-β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), due to biallelic mutations in the GBA1 gene. Reduced GCase activity leads to the accumulation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), which is deacylated by lysosomal acid ceramidase to a toxic metabolite, glucosylshpingosine (GlcSph). Most GBA1 variants are recognized as misfolded in the ER, where the retention for refolding attempts initiates stress and activates the stress response known as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). The distinct clinical subtypes of GD are based on whether there is primary involvement of the central nervous system. Type 1 GD (GD1) is the nonneuropathic type, however, the recent recognition of the association of GD with the development of parkinsonism defies this classification. Patients with GD1 and carriers of GBA1 mutations are at risk for the development of parkinsonian manifestations. Parkinson disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, culminates in a movement disorder with the premature death of the patients. In PD and related disorders, collectively called synucleinopathies, the hallmark pathology is α-synuclein positive aggregates referred to as Lewy bodies or Lewy neurites and the death of dopaminergic neurons. While PD is mostly sporadic, in ∼5-10% of cases, the disease results from pathogenic variants in a growing number of genes. The most common genetic cause of PD is mutations in GBA1. Two mechanisms have been proposed for this link: (A) a \"gain of function\" mechanism, in which mutant GCase (protein) contributes to aggregate formation and to the development of PD, and the (B) \"haploinsufficiency\" (\"loss of function\") model, suggesting that one normal GBA1 allele is insufficient to carry adequate GCase activity and functional deficiency of GCase impedes α-synuclein metabolism. Lysosomal dysfunction, compromised autophagy and mitophagy further enhance the accumulation of α-synuclein, which results in the development of PD pathology. The present review will elaborate on the biology of GD, its association with PD and related disorders, and discuss the possible mechanisms underlying this association."

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging is used for evaluation of bone in Gaucher disease (GD), but a widely available quantitative scoring method remains elusive. The study purpose was to assess the reproducibility of the LiverLab tool for assessing bone marrow fat fraction (FF) and determine whether it could differentiate GD patients from healthy subjects. Ten healthy volunteers and 18 GD patients were prospectively recruited. FF was calculated at L3, L4 and L5. GD patient bone marrow burden (BMB) score assessed by one observer. Inter and intra-rater agreement assessed with Bland-Altman data plots. Differences in FF between healthy volunteers versus GD patients and between subjects treated versus not treated assessed using two-sample t-tests. In GD patients, the relationship between FF, BMB and glucosylsphingosine was determined using the Pearson's correlation coefficient. Healthy volunteer mean FF was 0.36, standard deviation (SD) 0.10 (range 0.20-0.57). Intra and inter-rater SD were both 0.02. GD patient mean FF was 0.40, SD 0.13 (range 0.09-0.57). No statistical difference was shown between healthy volunteers and GD patients (P = 0.447) or between GD patients whether on enzyme replacement therapy or not (P = 0.090). No significant correlation between mean FF and total BMB (r = -0.525, P = 0.253) or between FF and glucosylsphingosine levels (r = 0.287, P = 0.248). Excellent reproducibility of LiverLab FF measurements across studies and observers is comparable to Dixon quantitative chemical shift imaging (QCSI). Lack of statistical difference between GD patients and controls may be explained by limited patient numbers, active treatment or mild disease severity in untreated patients."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is a disorder of lysosomes caused by a functional defect of the glucocerebrosidase enzyme. The disease is mainly due to mutations in the GBA1 gene, which determines the gradual storage of glucosylceramide substrate in the patient's macrophages. In this paper, we describe the case of a 38-year-old man who clinically presented with hyperferritinemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia and mild splenomegaly; a diagnosis of hemochromatosis was made 10 years earlier. Re-evaluation of the clinical case led to a suspicion of Gaucher disease, which was confirmed by enzymatic analysis, which was found to be below the normal range, and genetic evaluation, which identified compound heterozygosity N370S/RecNciI. We know that patients suffering from Gaucher disease can also have high ferritin levels. Even if the mechanism underlying the changes in iron metabolism is not yet elucidated, the chronic mild inflammatory state present in these patients probably causes the storage of ferritin in macrophages, resulting in hyperferritinemia. Therefore, in the presence of few typical signs and symptoms of the disease should raise an alarm bell in the clinicians, inducing clinical suspicion of Gaucher disease. Misdiagnosis and diagnostic delay in metabolic diseases could cause irreversible organ damage and delay the start of specific therapy for these patients."

Most lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub> analogs had good recovery rates and high intra- and interday precision assays. Biomarker-estimated LOD and LOQ levels ranged from 56-109 pM to 186-354 pM, respectively. Comparison between GD patients and healthy controls showed significant differences in most biomarker levels. Typically, treated GD patients presented lower biomarker levels compared to untreated patients. These data suggest that the metabolites investigated might be interesting GD biomarkers. More studies with a larger cohort of patients will be needed to better understand the clinical significance of these GD biomarkers."

    "abstract": "Neuronopathic Gaucher Disease (nGD) describes the condition of a subgroup of patients with the Lysosomal Storage Disorder (LSD), Gaucher disease with involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) which results from inherited deficiency of β-glucosylceramidase. Although systemic manifestations of disease are now corrected by augmentation with macrophage-targeted therapeutic enzyme (enzyme replacement therapy, ERT), neurological disease progresses unpredictably as a result of failure of therapeutic enzyme to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Without therapy, the systemic and neurological effects of the disease progress and shorten life: investigators, principally in Sweden and the UK, pioneered bone marrow transplantation (BMT; Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation HSCT) to supply healthy marrow-derived macrophages and other cells, to correct the peripheral disease. Here we report the first long-term follow-up (over 20 years in all cases) of nine patients in the UK and Sweden who underwent HSCT in the 1970s and 1980s. This retrospective, multicentre observational study was undertaken to determine whether there are neurological features of Gaucher disease that can be corrected by HSCT and the extent to which deterioration continues after the procedure. Since intravenous administration of ERT is approved for patients with the neuronopathic disease and ameliorates many of the important systemic manifestations but fails to correct the neurological features, we also consider the current therapeutic positioning of HSCT in this disorder. In the nine patients here reported, neurological disease continued to progress after transplantation, manifesting as seizures, cerebellar disease and abnormalities of tone and reflexes. Although neurological disease progressed in this cohort of patients, there may be a future role for HSCT in the treatment of nGD. The procedure has the unique advantage of providing a life-long source of normally functioning macrophages in the bone marrow, and possibly other sites, after a single administration. HSCT moreover, clearly ameliorates systemic disease and this may be advantageous-especially where sustained provision of high-cost ERT cannot be guaranteed. Given the remaining unmet needs of patients with neuronopathic Gaucher disease and the greatly improved safety profile of the transplant procedure, HSCT could be considered to provide permanent correction of systemic disease, including bone disease not ameliorated by ERT, when combined with emerging therapies directed at the neurological manifestations of disease; this could include ex-vivo gene therapy approaches."

We aimed to evaluate the immunity status and reveal the course of COVID-19 in patients with LSDs. The median age of 110 patients with LSDs was 129 months (range: 21-655), and all but one patient with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type III were regularly receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). In 53.6% (n = 56) of the patients (23 patients with Gaucher disease [10 type III, 13 type I], 26 patients with MPS [8 type VI, 11 type IVA, 1 type III, 3 type II, and 3 type I], and 7 patients with Pompe disease), an abnormality in at least one of the autoimmunity or immunodeficiency parameters was reported. Furthermore, 12 (57%) of 21 Gaucher cases (7 type III, 5 type I), 18 (40.9%) of 44 MPS cases (9 type IVA, 5 type VI, 1 type I, 2 type II, and 1 type III), and six (66%) of nine Pompe cases were reported to involve abnormalities in at least one of the parameters related to immunodeficiency. Immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgA levels were reported to be lower, and there were abnormalities in the lymphocyte counts and subgroups in the MPS group. ANA was reported to be positive in one patient with Gaucher type III, anti-DNA in two patients with Gaucher type I and one patient with MPS type VI, antithyroglobulin in two patients with Gaucher type I, anti-TPO in one patient with Gaucher type I, TRAB in one patient with Gaucher type I, antiphospholipid IgM in three patients with Gaucher type III and one patient with Gaucher type I, anticardiolipin IgM in one patient with Gaucher type I, one patient with Gaucher type III, and one patient with MPS type II. However, no clinical presentation was consistent with the laboratory results except for one patient with Gaucher type I disease with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Two of the four patients who survived the COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms had a diagnosis of Gaucher type I, and no abnormality was detected in their laboratory tests. The other two patients had a diagnosis of MPS types VI and II. Immune dysfunction was detected in the patient with a diagnosis of MPS type II. Four of our patients were discharged without any sequelae. Problems with immunity did not cause any noticeable clinical results. Being well protected by reducing social contact might have played a role. However, we believe that it should be borne in mind that cardiac and pulmonary involvement, as well as immune dysfunction in LSDs, may cause an increased need for intensive care because of secondary bacterial infections."

    "abstract": "This work is a review of the scientific evidence on the oral treatment of adult patients with Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) with a clinical guideline format according to the Agree II regulations. It describes the main differences between the two oral treatments currently available for treating this disease (miglustat and eliglustat). This review reminds us that the criteria for starting oral treatment in patients with GD1 must be assessed individually. Although miglustat and eliglustat are both glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) enzyme inhibitors, they have different mechanisms of action and pharmacological properties and should never be considered equivalent. Miglustat is indicated in patients with non-severe GD1 who cannot receive other first-line treatments, while eliglustat is indicated as first-line treatment for patients with GD1 of any severity without the need for prior stabilization with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). It is important to emphasize that in order to start treatment with eliglustat, we must know the CYP2D6 metabolic phenotype and its association with drugs metabolized through the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 cytochromes-or alternatively those that use P-Glycoprotein must be evaluated on an individual basis. During pregnancy, the use of eliglustat should be avoided; only ERT can be used. Unlike miglustat, whose adverse effects have limited its use, eliglustat has not only demonstrated similar efficacy to ERT but has also been shown to improve the quality of life of patients with GD1."

    "abstract": "Enantiomeric series of C-4 hydroxymethyl depleted DAB and LAB derivatives (trans, trans-2-C-aryl-3,4-dihydroxypyrrolidines), designed as β-glucosidase inhibitors by molecular docking calculations, have been synthesized in 2 steps from l- and d-tartaric acid derived enantiomeric cyclic nitrones 29L and 29D, respectively. Both series of C-4 hydroxymethyl depleted DAB and LAB derivatives 28Da-e and 28La-e, which are structurally trans, trans-2-C-aryl-3,4-dihydroxypyrrolidines, were potent and selective human lysosome acid β-glucosidase (GCase) inhibitors, of which 28Dd and 28Ld with C-4 biphenyls showed the highest potency relative to other compounds of the same series. The work provided a series of pyrrolidine-type potent and selective GCase inhibitors with minimal hydroxyl substitutions and synthetic procedures. Structure-activity relationship study revealed not only the rationality of hydrophobic and aromatic properties of the binding sites in GCase, but also the great potential of pyrrolidine family in development of new GCase inhibitors with minimized undesirable side effects. The results indicate a strategy for the development of drugs for the treatment of related diseases targeting acid β-glucosidase, such as Gaucher disease and Parkinson's disease."

    "abstract": "Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (<i>LRRK2</i>) are the most common genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). Increased LRRK2 kinase activity is thought to impair lysosomal function and may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. Thus, inhibition of LRRK2 is a potential disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for PD. DNL201 is an investigational, first-in-class, CNS-penetrant, selective, ATP-competitive, small-molecule LRRK2 kinase inhibitor. In preclinical models, DNL201 inhibited LRRK2 kinase activity as evidenced by reduced phosphorylation of both LRRK2 at serine-935 (pS935) and Rab10 at threonine-73 (pT73), a direct substrate of LRRK2. Inhibition of LRRK2 by DNL201 demonstrated improved lysosomal function in cellular models of disease, including primary mouse astrocytes and fibroblasts from patients with Gaucher disease. Chronic administration of DNL201 to cynomolgus macaques at pharmacologically relevant doses was not associated with adverse findings. In phase 1 and phase 1b clinical trials in 122 healthy volunteers and in 28 patients with PD, respectively, DNL201 at single and multiple doses inhibited LRRK2 and was well tolerated at doses demonstrating LRRK2 pathway engagement and alteration of downstream lysosomal biomarkers. Robust cerebrospinal fluid penetration of DNL201 was observed in both healthy volunteers and patients with PD. These data support the hypothesis that LRRK2 inhibition has the potential to correct lysosomal dysfunction in patients with PD at doses that are generally safe and well tolerated, warranting further clinical development of LRRK2 inhibitors as a therapeutic modality for PD."

Pompe, Gaucher and Krabbe are characterized by the deficiency of acid α-glucosidase (GAA), β-Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) and galactocerebrosidase (GALC), and treatable if detected in their early stages. Here, we present the fabrication of an electrochemical immunosensor for the multiplexed quantification and simultaneous detection of GAA, GBA and GALC. The sensor was developed by electrodepositing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on an array of carbon electrodes, followed by the immobilization of GAA, GBA and GALC specific antibodies via functionalization with cysteamine and glutaraldehyde. The multiplexed immunosensor was able to successfully detect GAA, GBA and GALC at the femtomolar level with respective low detection limits of 0.12 pg/ml, 0.31 pg/ml and 0.18 pg/ml. The immunosensor showed good selectivity, sensitivity and good recovery when spiked in human serum, which confirms its possible applicability in point-of-care testing for the early diagnosis of LSDs."

Their general conditions, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and gene variations were collected, followed by the analysis of the clinical phenotypes and genotypes. <b>Results:</b> Among 14 children diagnosed with Gaucher disease, 9 were males and 5 were females, with the age of diagnosis ranging from 0.7 to 15.8 years. There were 10 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, 2 patients with type 2, and 2 patients with type 3. The most common clinical manifestations were splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia (14 cases), hepatomegaly (8 cases) and anemia (8 cases). There were 6 patients with growth retardation, and 5 patients lag in height compared with their peers. Bone abnormalities were revealed by magnetic resonance imaging in 7 type 1 Gaucher disease patients, but only 1 patient experienced bone pain. Patients with type 2 and type 3 Gaucher disease also presented with convulsions, nystagmus and hearing loss. Gaucher cells were found in bone marrow smears in 12 patients. The glucocerebrosidase gene variations identified in 13 patients were heterozygous and in 1 type 1 patient was homozygous of L483P. L483P variation accounted for 33%(10/30) of the variation alleles, followed by V414L, D448H and R159W. The variation alleles were L483P and L422R, F252I and L483P in 2 children with severe neurological manifestations of Gaucher disease. A novel variation c.22A>G was detected. <b>Conclusions:</b> Splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia are the main clinical presentations of Gaucher disease in children and bone lesions revealed by radiologic imaging appear prior to the occurrence of bone diseases, type 2 and type 3 Gaucher disease also present growth retardation and neurological manifestation. The most frequent variant allele is L483P, which are detected in all 3 subtypes of Gaucher disease. The L422R, F252I gene variants correlated with the neuronopathic phenotype."

    "abstract": "Mutations in the GBA gene, encoding glucocerebrosidase (GCase), are linked to Gaucher disease (GD) and are the most common risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). The glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is used as a pharmacodynamic marker for GCase functionalizing therapy in GD patients. Its isobaric structural isomer, galactosylsphingosine (GalSph, psychosine), is also used as a diagnostic blood marker in Krabbe disease (KD) which is caused by a deficiency in β-galactocerebrosidase (GALC). However, there are no reports of GlcSph quantification in the CSF of GBA-PD patients and normal healthy humans due to low concentrations. In this study, we successfully quantified GlcSph in healthy human CSF using a highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method with separation of GalSph. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 0.1 pg/mL. Additionally, GlcSph and GalSph concentrations in the plasma and brain were determined using different LC-MS/MS methods. The mean concentrations of GlcSph and GalSph in normal human CSF were 1.07 and 9.44 pg/mL, respectively. The GalSph level in the CSF and brain was higher than that of GlcSph, whereas plasma GalSph was lower than GlcSph. Because GCase and GALC are expressed in the brain and the peripheral tissues, GlcSph and GalSph in CSF would be a good surrogate of concentration change in the brain by targeted therapies. This method measures normal levels of GlcSph and GalSph in healthy human CSF without accumulation of sphingolipids, and confirms whether abnormal CSF concentrations can be reduced to normal levels by therapy."

Patients with this lysosomal storage disorder exhibit a wide range of associated manifestations, spanning from virtually asymptomatic adults to infants with severe neurodegeneration. While type 1 GD (GD1) is considered non-neuronopathic, a small subset of patients develop parkinsonian features. Variants in <i>GBA1</i> are also an important risk factor for several common Lewy body disorders (LBDs). Neuropathological examinations of patients with GD, including those who developed LBDs, are rare. GD primarily affects macrophages, and perivascular infiltration of Gaucher macrophages is the most common neuropathologic finding. However, the frequency of these clusters and the affected anatomical region varies. GD affects astrocytes, and, in neuronopathic GD, neurons in cerebral cortical layers 3 and 5, layer 4b of the calcarine cortex, and hippocampal regions CA2-4. In addition, several reports describe selective degeneration of the cerebellar dentate nucleus in chronic neuronopathic GD. GD1 is characterized by astrogliosis without prominent neuronal loss. In GD-LBD, widespread Lewy body pathology is seen, often involving hippocampal regions CA2-4. Additional neuropathological examinations in GD are sorely needed to clarify disease-specific patterns and elucidate causative mechanisms relevant to GD, and potentially to more common neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "As part of a decades-long process of restructuring primary care, independent (also known as community) healthcare workers are being encouraged to work in groups to facilitate their coordination and continuity of care in France. French independent midwives perform about half of the early prenatal interviews that identify mothers' needs during pregnancy and then refer them to the appropriate resources. The French government, however, structured the COVID-19 pandemic response around public health institutions and did not directly mobilise these community healthcare workers during the lockdown phase. These responses have raised questions about their role within the healthcare system in crises. This survey's main objectives were to estimate the proportion of independent midwives who experienced new difficulties in referring women to healthcare facilities or other caregivers and in collaborating with hospitals during the first stage of this pandemic. The secondary objective was to estimate the proportion, according to their mode of practice, of independent midwives who considered that all the women under their care had risked harm due to failed or delayed referral to care. We conducted an online national survey addressed to independent midwives in France from 29 April to 15 May 2020, around the end of the first lockdown (17 March-11 May, 2020). Of the 5264 registered independent midwives in France, 1491 (28.3%) responded; 64.7% reported new or greater problems during the pandemic in referring women to health facilities or care-providers, social workers in particular, and 71.0% reported new difficulties collaborating with hospitals. Nearly half (46.2%) the respondents considered that all the women in their care had experienced, to varying degrees, a lack of or delay in care that could have affected their health. This proportion did not differ according to the midwives' form of practice: solo practice, group practice with other midwives only, or group practice with at least two types of healthcare professionals. The pandemic has degraded the quality of pregnant women's care in France and challenged the French model of care, which is highly compartmentalised between an almost exclusively independent primary care (community) sector and a predominantly salaried secondary care (hospital) sector."

    "abstract": "To present our experience using a multiomic approach, which integrates genetic and biochemical testing as a first-line diagnostic tool for patients with inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs). A cohort of 3720 patients from 62 countries was tested using a panel including 206 genes with single nucleotide and copy number variant (SNV/CNV) detection, followed by semi-automatic variant filtering and reflex biochemical testing (25 assays). In 1389 patients (37%), a genetic diagnosis was achieved. Within this cohort, the highest diagnostic yield was obtained for patients from Asia (57.5%, mainly from Pakistan). Overall, 701 pathogenic/likely pathogenic unique SNVs and 40 CNVs were identified. In 620 patients, the result of the biochemical tests guided variant classification and reporting. Top five diagnosed diseases were: Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick disease type A/B, phenylketonuria, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, and Wilson disease. We show that integrated genetic and biochemical testing facilitated the decision on clinical relevance of the variants and led to a high diagnostic yield (37%), which is comparable to exome/genome sequencing. More importantly, up to 43% of these patients (n = 610) could benefit from medical treatments (e.g., enzyme replacement therapy). This multiomic approach constitutes a unique and highly effective tool for the genetic diagnosis of IMDs."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive condition. Type 1 GD (GD1) is the most prevalent form of GD in Western countries; enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a treatment option for patients with GD1. To understand the economic value of the GD1 ERT velaglucerase alfa, a budget impact model (BIM) was developed from a United States (US) payer perspective. We estimated the budget impact of velaglucerase alfa for a 10-million-member US health plan by comparing the annual total costs of therapy between a scenario using current velaglucerase alfa uptake to a projected scenario with increased velaglucerase alfa uptake. Total drug costs for both scenarios were estimated as the sum of the product of the number of eligible patients on each treatment and the annual per-patient cost of each medication. Average per-patient costs for ERTs were calculated by adding the yearly drug acquisition, drug administration, and site-of-care markup costs. The budget impact was measured over years 1-3. An estimated 65 patients would receive velaglucerase alfa treatment in year 1, increasing to 90 patients by year 3. Across analyses, cost savings were realized with velaglucerase alfa compared with imiglucerase ($115,909) and taliglucerase alfa ($80,401). An annual total budget savings of $8.67 million could be realized for a hypothetical 10-million-member US health plan with increased velaglucerase alfa uptake. The per-member per-month costs decreased by $0.0241 across years 1-3. BIM results show that increased velaglucerase alfa uptake for GD1 treatment is cost-saving for US health plans."

    "abstract": "Phosphonate-based products have demonstrated diverse abilities to protect crops against pests, with various modes of action proposed. In this article, we specifically investigated potassium phosphonate (KHP) on apple crops. Its performance to control three major apple bioagressors (<i>Venturia inaequalis</i>, <i>Erwinia amylovora</i>, and <i>Dysaphis plantaginea</i>) was evaluated under semicontrolled conditions. The product was able to confer significant protection rates (40 to 75% for apple scab, 40% for fire blight, and 30% for rosy aphid), which can be explained by its more or less efficient biocidal activity against the three pests, and by its ability to induce apple immunity (pathogenesis-related proteins and secondary metabolites genes). A cumulative effect of treatments as well as the systemic behavior of the product was demonstrated. Fields trials against apple scab and the postharvest disease bull's eyes rot (<i>Neofabraea vagabunda</i>) were performed on different apple varieties by applying KHP combined with light pest management programs either reducing (dessert orchards) or suppressing (cider orchards) fungicide applications. KHP was able to reduce apple scab by 70 to 90% on shoots and young and harvested fruit, and bull's eyes rot by 70 to 90% on harvested fruit. Overall, our results indicate that KHP is useful for the protection of apple trees against its major pests by direct effect and by triggering the host defense system."

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes motor and nonmotor symptoms due to the loss of dopaminergic nerves and is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies, which are mainly composed of α-synuclein. Glucosylceramidase beta (GBA), which is a causative gene of autosomal recessive Gaucher disease, is also known to be a risk gene for Parkinson's disease. In this study, we tried to detect synergistic effects of α-synuclein accumulation and gba depletion on dopaminergic neurodegeneration in zebrafish. We generated a transgenic line of zebrafish overexpressing the A53T α-synuclein and gba mutant fish, and analyzed pathologies of α-synuclein aggregation and neurodegeneration. Zebrafish overexpressing the A53T α-synuclein did not exhibit α-synuclein aggregate formation. After the loss of gba function in this mutant α-synuclein transgenic line, we observed the marked presence of α-synuclein aggregates. Loss of gba function in zebrafish resulted in dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurodegeneration but this level of neurodegeneration was not exacerbated by overexpression of mutant α-synuclein. These results indicate that loss of gba function was sufficient to generate a neurodegenerative phenotype in zebrafish regardless of the expression of α-synuclein."

Low numbers of HCC patients being suitable for liver resection or transplantation and multidrug resistance development during pharmacotherapy leads to high death rates for HCC patients. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of HCC etiology may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for prevention and treatment of HCC. UDP-glucose ceramide glycosyltransferase (UGCG), a key enzyme in glycosphingolipid metabolism, generates glucosylceramide (GlcCer), which is the precursor for all glycosphingolipids (GSLs). Since UGCG gene expression is altered in 0.8% of HCC tumors, GSLs may play a role in cellular processes in liver cancer cells. Here, we discuss the current literature about GSLs and their abundance in normal liver cells, Gaucher disease and HCC. Furthermore, we review the involvement of UGCG/GlcCer in multidrug resistance development, globosides as a potential prognostic marker for HCC, gangliosides as a potential liver cancer stem cell marker, and the role of sulfatides in tumor metastasis. Only a limited number of molecular mechanisms executed by GSLs in HCC are known, which we summarize here briefly. Overall, the role GSLs play in HCC progression and their ability to serve as biomarkers or prognostic indicators for HCC, requires further investigation."

Nonmanifesting carriers of GBA mutations/variants (GBA-NMC) constitute a potential PD preclinical population, whereas PD patients carrying some GBA mutations/variants (GBA-PD) have a higher risk of a more aggressive disease course. Different neuroimaging techniques are emerging as potential biomarkers in PD and have been used to study GBA-associated parkinsonism. The aim is to critically review studies applying neuroimaging to GBA-associated parkinsonism. Literature search was performed using PubMed and EMBASE databases (last search February 7, 2022). Studies reporting neuroimaging findings in GBA-PD, GD with and without parkinsonism, and GBA-NMC were included. Thirty-five studies were included. In longitudinal studies, GBA-PD patients show a more aggressive disease than iPD at both structural magnetic resonance imaging and 123-fluoropropylcarbomethoxyiodophenylnortropane single-photon emission computed tomography. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and brain perfusion studies reported a greater cortical involvement in GBA-PD compared to iPD. Overall, contrasting evidence is available regarding GBA-NMC for imaging and clinical findings, although subtle differences have been reported compared with healthy controls with no mutations. Although results must be interpreted with caution due to limitations of the studies, in line with previous clinical observations, GBA-PD showed a more aggressive disease progression in neuroimaging longitudinal studies compared to iPD. Cognitive impairment, a \"clinical signature\" of GBA-PD, seems to find its neuroimaging correlate in the greater cortical burden displayed by these patients as compared to iPD. © 2022 The Authors.

When challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), inflammatory gene expression is unaffected. Moreover, Tollip deficiency does not aggravate swimming deficiency resulting from lysosomal dysfunction and proteotoxicity in a fish model of Gaucher disease.

Here, we focus on eight inheritable diseases, including GM1 gangliosidosis, GM2 gangliosidosis, Fabry disease, Gaucher's disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, Niemann-Pick disease A and B, and Farber disease. Mostly, pathogenic mutations in the key enzyme are loss-function, resulting in accumulation of substrates and deficiency of products. Thus, cellular overload of substrates causes lipotoxicity, which is deleterious to cellular and organ function. In the terms of clinical manifestations in sphingolipidoses, multiple systems and organs, especially central nervous system (CNS) are usually affected. As for diagnosis strategy, enzymatic activity assay and genetic sequencing are helpful. Up till now, limited treatment approaches have approved for treating sphingolipidoses, with some potential strategies for further evaluation. In general, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), substrate reduction therapy (SRT), and molecular chaperones are feasible choices for enzyme deficiency disorders, but these therapies are limited to relieve CNS lesions and symptoms due to prevention from blood-brain barrier. Other possible treatments such as gene therapy, bone marrow transplantation (BMT), and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) need further evaluation."

To measure GD awareness among Japanese haematologists and gastroenterologists, who are the specialists most likely to encounter patients with symptoms recognised in the Gaucher Earlier Diagnosis Consensus (GED-C), such as hepatosplenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. Additionally, we aimed to determine key signs from the GED-C associated with early diagnosis. A quantitative web survey assessed Japanese haematologists and gastroenterologists for their (i) basic awareness of GD, (ii) explicit awareness of GD signs, (iii) explicit awareness of GD treatments and (iv) accuracy in suspecting GD in model patients. Survey results from 160 haematologists and 166 gastroenterologists indicated that more than 50% of haematologists were aware of GD symptoms, diagnostic criteria and/or treatments, and 38% of them had experienced or suspected GD. The majority of gastroenterologists were unaware of GD or knew the disease only by name, with 20% experiencing or suspecting GD in practice. Almost 70% of haematologists knew of enzyme replacement therapy, while 47% of gastroenterologists were not aware of any treatments for GD. Of the GED-C items, an awareness of bone-associated signs was correlated with accurate GD diagnosis in model patients and this awareness was greater among haematologists than gastroenterologists. The present study showed that haematologists had greater awareness of GD than gastroenterologists, and that bone pain may be a key sign of GD to enhance early diagnosis."

    "title": "Splenic Gaucheroma Leading to Incidental Diagnosis of Gaucher Disease in a 46-Year-Old Man with a Rare GBA Mutation: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is a common lysosomal storage disease caused by the deficiency of the β-glucosidase enzyme, leading to sphingolipid accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system in Gaucher cells. Clinical findings are quite variable and some patients may remain asymptomatic lifelong. However, even when patients have mild symptoms, there is a significant increase in their quality of life with enzyme replacement therapy. We aimed to reveal the relationship between a rare mutation in the Glucosylceramidase Beta (GBA) gene and clinical signs and symptoms. Another aim of the study was to show the effect of enzyme replacement therapy on the quality of life, even in patients with mild symptoms. Here, we report a 46-year-old male diagnosed with Gaucher disease based on splenic Gaucheromas incidentally discovered in a cardiac computerized tomography scan. In GBA gene analysis, the extremely rare R87W mutation was detected in a homozygous state. In retrospect, the patient had nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and bone pain for a long time, which were substantially ameliorated by enzyme replacement therapy. In patients with adult-onset Gaucher disease, the symptoms may be mild, causing significant diagnostic delay. Gaucher disease may be included in the differential diagnosis of abdominal malignancies. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve quality of life and prevent unnecessary procedures."

    "abstract": "To establish cut-off values of lysosomal storage disease (LSD)-related enzymes by tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 26 689 newborns and 7 clinically confirmed LSD children underwent screening for LSDs (glycogen storage disease typeⅡ, Fabry disease, mucopolysaccharidosis type Ⅰ, Krabbe disease, Niemann-Pick disease A/B and Gaucher disease). The activities of LSD-related enzymes were detected by tandem mass spectrometry. The 20% of the median enzyme activity of each batch of acid β-glucocerebrosidase, acid sphingomyelinase, β-galactocerebroside, α- <i>L</i>-iduronidase and acid α-glucosidase, and the 30% of the median enzyme activity of α-galactosidase were taken as cut-off values of corresponding enzymes. The genetic diagnosis was performed in neonates whose enzyme activity was lower than 70% of the cut-off value. The enzyme activities of 7 clinically confirmed cases were all lower than the cut-off values. Among 26 689 newborns, 142 cases (0.53%) were suspected positive for LSDs, including 25 cases of β-galactocerebroside deficiency, 1 case of α- <i>L</i>-iduronidase deficiency, 19 cases of α-galactosidase deficiency, and 97 cases of acid α-glucosidase deficiency. Eight infants were genetically diagnosed with LSDs, including 3 cases of glycogen storage disease type Ⅱ, 3 cases of Krabbe disease, and 2 cases of Fabry disease, with a positive predictive value of about 5.6%. Cut-off values ​​of the 6 LSD enzyme activities all showed a downward trend from March to August, and an upward trend from September to December. There was a statistically significant difference in LSD enzyme activity among different months ( <i>P</i><0.05). The established cut-off values of LSD-related enzyme activities detected by tandem mass spectrometry can be used for screening LSDs in neonates, and the enzyme activity would be affected by temperature and humidity."

    "title": "Phenotype Expansion for Atypical Gaucher Disease Due to Homozygous Missense PSAP Variant in a Large Consanguineous Pakistani Family.",
    "abstract": "Atypical Gaucher disease is caused by variants in the PSAP gene. Saposin C is one of four homologous proteins derived from sequential cleavage of the saposin precursor protein, prosaposin. It is an essential activator for glucocerebrosidase, which is deficient in Gaucher disease. Although atypical Gaucher disease due to deficiency of saposin C is rare, it exhibits vast phenotypic heterogeneity. Here, we report on a Pakistani family that exhibits features of Gaucher disease, i.e., prelingual profound sensorineural hearing impairment, vestibular dysfunction, hepatosplenomegaly, kyphosis, and thrombocytopenia. The family was investigated using exome and Sanger sequencing. A homozygous missense variant c.1076A>C: p.(Glu359Ala) in exon 10 of the PSAP gene was observed in all affected family members. In conclusion, we identified a new likely pathogenic missense variant in PSAP in a large consanguineous Pakistani family with atypical Gaucher disease. Gaucher disease due to a deficiency of saposin C has not been previously reported within the Pakistani population. Genetic screening of patients with the aforementioned phenotypes could ensure adequate follow-up and the prevention of further complications. Our finding expands the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of atypical Gaucher disease due to a saposin C deficiency."

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G-6PD deficiency), Gaucher disease (GD), steroid-induced osteonecrosis, progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (PDD), Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) and Langerhans cell sarcoma (LCS) were included and imaging characteristics were analyzed. The rare properties of these diseases and mimicking features on 99mTc-MDP bone scans rendered differential diagnosis difficult but necessary. We believe that the rarely known imaging features of the reported diseases will undoubtedly help nuclear medicine physicians make differential diagnoses in clinical practice."

    "title": "What's new and what's next for gene therapy in Pompe disease?",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of acid-α-glucosidase (GAA), an enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing lysosomal glycogen. A lack of GAA leads to accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells, as well as in the central and peripheral nervous system. Enzyme replacement therapy has been the standard of care for 15 years and slows disease progression, particularly in the heart, and improves survival. However, there are limitations of ERT success, which gene therapy can overcome. Gene therapy offers several advantages including prolonged and consistent GAA expression and correction of skeletal muscle as well as the critical CNS pathology. We provide a systematic review of the preclinical and clinical outcomes of adeno-associated viral mediated gene therapy and alternative gene therapy strategies, highlighting what has been successful. Although the preclinical and clinical studies so far have been promising, barriers exist that need to be addressed in gene therapy for Pompe disease. New strategies including novel capsids for better targeting, optimized DNA vectors, and adjuctive therapies will allow for a lower dose, and ameliorate the immune response."

    "title": "Establishment of Cutoff Values for Newborn Screening of Six Lysosomal Storage Disorders by Tandem Mass Spectrometry.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are becoming increasingly important in newborn screening, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is widely used in newborn screening for LSDs through measurement of enzymatic activities in dried blood spots (DBSs). Overall, the determination of the cutoff value is important in such screening, and different laboratories have different methods of determining this value; most do not use a fixed cutoff value but rather calculate the corresponding batch cutoff value based on each batch of experimental data. In this study, we used MS/MS to screen for LSDs and sought to find an appropriate method to establish the cutoff value for LSD screening. A total of 38,945 samples from newborn blood tablets collected from various maternity hospitals in six cities in Shandong province, including Jinan, Dezhou, Heze, Linyi, Weifang, and Zibo, were tested using a <i>Waters Xevo TQD</i> tandem mass spectrometer; the experimental data were analyzed with <i>MassLynx V4.1</i>. The laboratory used 30% of the median GLA enzyme activity and 20% of the median ABG, ASM, GALC, IDUA, and GAA enzyme activities in every test as the cutoff values for that batch of experiments. There were 254 suspicious positives in the initial screening test, including one case of Gaucher disease, one of Niemann-Pick disease, 47 of Krabbe disease, four of MPS-I, 21 of Fabry disease, and 180 of Pompe disease. After genetic screening, 11 children were diagnosed, including three with Pompe disease, three with Fabry disease, and five with Krabbe disease. In addition, the enzyme activity cutoff value of this experiment showed seasonal variation, which was initially believed to be related to the ambient temperature, such as the effect of ambient temperature on the human body or the temperature when the blood tablets dried naturally. Overall, MS/MS can be used in LSD screening, and using different cutoff values in each batch of experiments is feasible. The ambient temperature might be a reason why the enzyme activity cutoff value has seasonal variation. More samples are needed to develop a method of determining cutoff values in laboratories."

Eliglustat treatment has been started in Austria in patients recruited to a clinical trial, followed by its long-term extension and prescription treatment overall covering up to 10 years. In this case series the experience of treating Gaucher patients with eliglustat in Vienna is summarized. Patients were either switched from enzyme replacement therapy or were therapy naïve. Significant improvements were shown in hematological (thrombocytes, hemoglobin) and visceral (spleen volume) manifestations as well as in biomarkers (chitotriosidase, glucosylsphingosine [lyso-GL1], angiotensin converting enzyme) in a routine setting in a therapy-naïve patient. Stability was found in switch patients with slight improvement in bone density. Eliglustat was generally very well tolerated. Patient selection and regular monitoring is required to ensure effective and safe use."

    "abstract": "Ambroxol (ABX) is a mucolytic agent used for the treatment of respiratory diseases. Bioactivity has been demonstrated as an enhancement effect on lysosomal acid β-glucosidase (β-Glu) activity in Gaucher disease (GD). The positive effects observed have been attributed to a mechanism of action similar to pharmacological chaperones (PCs), but an exact mechanistic description is still pending. The current study uses cell culture and in vitro assays to study the effects of ABX on β-Glu activity, processing, and stability upon ligand binding. Structural analogues bromohexine, 4-hydroxybromohexine, and norbromohexine were screened for chaperone efficacy, and in silico docking was performed. The sugar mimetic isofagomine (IFG) strongly inhibits β-Glu, while ABX exerts its inhibitory effect in the micromolar range. In GD patient fibroblasts, IFG and ABX increase mutant β-Glu activity to identical levels. However, the characteristics of the banding patterns of Endoglycosidase-H (Endo-H)-digested enzyme and a substantially lower half-life of ABX-treated β-Glu suggest different intracellular processing. In line with this observation, IFG efficiently stabilizes recombinant β-Glu against thermal denaturation in vitro, whereas ABX exerts no significant effect. Additional β-Glu enzyme activity testing using Bromohexine (BHX) and two related structures unexpectedly revealed that ABX alone can refunctionalize β-Glu in cellula. Taken together, our data indicate that ABX has little in vitro ability to act as PC, so the mode of action requires further clarification."

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by multiple motor and non-motor symptoms. Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (<i>GBA</i>) gene, which encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which hydrolyzes glucosylceramide (GlcCer) to glucose and ceramide, are the most important and common genetic PD risk factors discovered to date. Homozygous <i>GBA</i> mutations result in the most common lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher's disease (GD), which is classified according to the presence (neuronopathic types, type 2 and 3 GD) or absence (non-neuronopathic type, type 1 GD) of neurological symptoms. The clinical manifestations of PD in patients with <i>GBA</i> mutations are indistinguishable from those of sporadic PD at the individual level. However, accumulating data have indicated that <i>GBA</i>-associated PD patients exhibit a younger age of onset and a greater risk for cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms. The mechanisms underlying the increased risk of developing PD in <i>GBA</i> mutant carriers are currently unclear. Contributors to <i>GBA</i>-PD pathogenesis may include mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy-lysosomal dysfunction, altered lipid homeostasis and enhanced α-synuclein aggregation. Therapeutic strategies for PD and GD targeting mutant GCase mainly include enzyme replacement, substrate reduction, gene and pharmacological small-molecule chaperones. Emerging clinical, genetic and pathogenic studies on <i>GBA</i> mutations and PD are making significant contributions to our understanding of PD-associated pathogenetic pathways, and further elucidating the interactions between GCase activity and neurodegeneration may improve therapeutic approaches for slowing PD progression."

    "abstract": "Many pathogenic missense mutations are found in protein positions that are neither well-conserved nor fall in any known functional domains. Consequently, we lack any mechanistic underpinning of dysfunction caused by such mutations. We explored the disruption of allosteric dynamic coupling between these positions and the known functional sites as a possible mechanism for pathogenesis. In this study, we present an analysis of 591 pathogenic missense variants in 144 human enzymes that suggests that allosteric dynamic coupling of mutated positions with known active sites is a plausible biophysical mechanism and evidence of their functional importance. We illustrate this mechanism in a case study of β-Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) in which a vast majority of 94 sites harboring Gaucher disease-associated missense variants are located some distance away from the active site. An analysis of the conformational dynamics of GCase suggests that mutations on these distal sites cause changes in the flexibility of active site residues despite their distance, indicating a dynamic communication network throughout the protein. The disruption of the long-distance dynamic coupling caused by missense mutations may provide a plausible general mechanistic explanation for biological dysfunction and disease."

    "title": "<i>In Vivo</i> Dopamine Neuron Imaging-Based Small Molecule Screen Identifies Novel Neuroprotective Compounds and Targets.",
    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder with prominent dopamine (DA) neuron degeneration. PD affects millions of people worldwide, but currently available therapies are limited to temporary relief of symptoms. As an effort to discover disease-modifying therapeutics, we have conducted a screen of 1,403 bioactive small molecule compounds using an <i>in vivo</i> whole organism screening assay in transgenic larval zebrafish. The transgenic model expresses the bacterial enzyme nitroreductase (NTR) driven by the tyrosine hydroxylase (th) promotor. NTR converts the commonly used antibiotic pro-drug metronidazole (MTZ) to the toxic nitroso radical form to induce DA neuronal loss. 57 compounds were identified with a brain health score (BHS) that was significantly improved compared to the MTZ treatment alone after FDR adjustment (padj<0.05). Independently, we curated the high throughput screening (HTS) data by annotating each compound with pharmaceutical classification, known mechanism of action, indication, IC50, and target. Using the Reactome database, we performed pathway analysis, which uncovered previously unknown pathways in addition to validating previously known pathways associated with PD. Non-topology-based pathway analysis of the screening data further identified apoptosis, estrogen hormone, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4, and opioid receptor Mu1 to be potentially significant pathways and targets involved in neuroprotection. A total of 12 compounds were examined with a secondary assay that imaged DA neurons before and after compound treatment. The z'-factor of this secondary assay was determined to be 0.58, suggesting it is an excellent assay for screening. Etodolac, nepafenac, aloperine, protionamide, and olmesartan showed significant neuroprotection and was also validated by blinded manual DA neuronal counting. To determine whether these compounds are broadly relevant for neuroprotection, we tested them on a conduritol-b-epoxide (CBE)-induced Gaucher disease (GD) model, in which the activity of <i>glucocerebrosidase</i> (GBA), a commonly known genetic risk factor for PD, was inhibited. Aloperine, olmesartan, and nepafenac showed significant protection of DA neurons in this assay. Together, this work, which combines high content whole organism <i>in vivo</i> imaging-based screen and bioinformatic pathway analysis of the screening dataset, delineates a previously uncharted approach for identifying hit-to-lead candidates and for implicating previously unknown pathways and targets involved in DA neuron protection."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive inherited lysosomal storage disease that often presents in early childhood and is associated with damage to multiple organ systems. Many challenges associated with GD diagnosis and management arise from the considerable heterogeneity of disease presentations and natural history. Phenotypic classification has traditionally been based on the absence (in type 1 GD) or presence (in types 2 and 3 GD) of neurological involvement of varying severity. However, patient management and prediction of prognosis may be best served by a dynamic, evolving definition of individual phenotype rather than by a rigid system of classification. Patients may experience considerable delays in diagnosis, which can potentially be reduced by effective screening programs; however, program implementation can involve ethical and practical challenges. Variation in the clinical course of GD and an uncertain prognosis also complicate decisions concerning treatment initiation, with differing stakeholder perspectives around efficacy and acceptable cost/benefit ratio. We review the challenges faced by physicians in the diagnosis and management of GD in pediatric patients. We also consider future directions and goals, including acceleration of accurate diagnosis, improvements in the understanding of disease heterogeneity (natural history, response to treatment, and prognosis), the need for new treatments to address unmet needs for all forms of GD, and refinement of the tools for monitoring disease progression and treatment efficacy, such as specific biomarkers."

A two-phase mixed-methods approach: (1) quantitative data to measure factors determining the initiation and continuation of teleconsultation, collected by an online survey from 29 April to 15 May 2020, at the end of the first COVID-19 lockdown, followed by (2) qualitative data to understand these determinants, by interviewing some participants in May-July 2020 to explore the quantitative findings in more detail. Mainland France PARTICIPANTS: The target population comprised independent midwives currently practising in France. The primary and secondary outcomes were binary variables: implementation of teleconsultations, and intention to continue them. The qualitative results provided the themes explaining these decisions. We obtained 1491 complete responses from independent midwives, that is, 28.3% of French independent midwives, and interviewed 22 volunteers among them. Among the 1491, 88.5% implemented teleconsultations and 65.8% intended to continue them. Both individual and organisational factors favoured implementation of teleconsultations: older age (adjusted OR (aOR): 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.58), female gender (aOR: 6.88, 95% CI: 2.71 to 17.48), married or living with a partner (aOR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.10 to 2.52) and working in a group practice (midwives only-aOR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.47 to 3.72; multiprofessional group-aOR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.16 to 2.64). The qualitative analysis did not identify any new factors but helped us to understand the satisfaction better: midwives adopted telemedicine for their patients' access to and continuity of care, to maintain their professional activity and income, and to limit the risks of infection. Personal and organisational factors motivated the implementation of teleconsultation during the pandemic, but maintaining it raises technical, regulatory, and ethical issues."

We present an interim analysis of the data from the Drug Registry collected over the 5-year period from September 2013 to January 2019. A total of 106 patients with GD (15.1% children aged < 18 years; 53.8% females) treated with taliglucerase alfa have been enrolled in the Drug Registry, as of January 7, 2019. The median duration of follow-up was 795 days with quartiles (Q1, Q3) of 567 and 994 days. Fifty-three patients (50.0%) were from Israel, 28 (26.4%) were from the United States, and 25 (23.6%) were from Albania. At the time of enrollment, most patients (87.7%) had received prior enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Thirty-nine of the 106 patients had treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). Twelve of the 106 patients experienced serious AEs; two patients experienced four treatment-related serious AEs. Four patients died, although none of the deaths was considered to be related to taliglucerase alfa treatment by the treating physicians. Nine patients discontinued from the study, including the four who died. At baseline, patients with prior ERT had a higher mean hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts than treatment-naïve patients, likely reflecting the therapeutic effects of prior treatments. During follow-up, the hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts increased in the treatment-naïve patients and remained relatively constant or increased slightly in patients with prior ERT. Spleen and liver volumes decreased in treatment-naïve patients. The interim data showed no new or emergent safety signals. The overall interim data are consistent with the clinical program experience and known safety and effectiveness profile of taliglucerase alfa."

Inabilities of the Gcase to catabolize its substrate result in the accumulation of sphingolipids in macrophages, which impairs the cell functions and ultimately leads to multisystemic clinical manifestations. Important variability in symptoms and manifestations may lead to challenging diagnosis and patient care. Plasma glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub>) is a biomarker frequently used for prognosis, monitoring, and patient follow-up. While lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub> appears to be a valid biomarker, few studies have investigated other matrices for potential GD biomarkers. The main objective of this study was to investigate the urine matrix as a potential source of new GD biomarkers by performing a metabolomic study using time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Our study highlighted a significant increase of eight urinary lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub> analogues. Moreover, a novel class of biomarkers, named polycyclic lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub> analogues, was identified. These four new molecules were more elevated than lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub> and related analogues in urine specimens of GD patients.

Even though SCARB2 associated phenotype has been reported to include typical neurological characteristics, depending on the localization and the feature of the pathogenic variants, clinical course and the presentations have been shown to differ. Whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis revealed a homozygous truncating variant (p.N45MfsX88) in SCARB2 gene in the index case, and subsequent sanger sequencing analysis validated the variant in all affected family members from a Turkish family with the clinical characteristics associated with AMRF and related disorders. Intrafamilial clinical heterogeneity with common features including dysarthria, tremor and proteinuria, and distinct features such as peripheral neuropathy (PNP), myoclonus and seizures between the affected cases, was observed in the family. In-depth literature review enabled the detailed investigation of the reported variants associated with AMRF and suggested that while the type of the variant did not have a major impact on the course of the clinical characteristics, only the C terminal localization of the pathogenic variant significantly affected the clinical presentation, particularly the age at onset (AO) of the disease. In this study we showed that biallelic SCARB2 pathogenic variants might cause a spectrum of common and distinct features associated with AMRF. Of those features while the common features include myoclonus (100%), ataxia (96%), tonic clonic seizures (82%), dysarthria (68%), tremor (65%), and renal impairment (62%), the uncommon features involve PNP (17%), hearing loss (6.8%), and cognitive impairment (13.7%). AO has been found to be significantly higher in the carriers of the p.G462DfsX34 pathogenic variant. SCARB2 pathogenic variants have not been only implicated in AMRF but also in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Gaucher disease (GD), suggesting the importance of genetic and functional studies in the clinical and the diagnostic settings. Given the proven role of SCARB2 gene in the pathogenesis of AMRF, PD and GD with a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, investigation of the possible modifiers, such as progranulin and HSP7, has a great importance."

    "abstract": "The major function of the lysosome is to degrade unwanted materials such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids; therefore, deficits of the lysosomal system can result in improper degradation and trafficking of these biomolecules. Diseases associated with lysosomal failure can be lethal and are termed lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), which affect 1 in 5000 live births collectively. LSDs are inherited metabolic diseases caused by mutations in single lysosomal and non-lysosomal proteins and resulting in the subsequent accumulation of macromolecules within. Most LSD patients present with neurodegenerative clinical symptoms, as well as damage in other organs. The discovery of new biomarkers is necessary to understand and monitor these diseases and to track therapeutic progress. Over the past ten years, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has flourished in the biomarker studies in many diseases, including neurodegenerative, and more specifically, LSDs. In this review, biomarkers of disease pathophysiology and monitoring of LSDs revealed by MS-based proteomics are discussed, including examples from Niemann-Pick disease type C, Fabry disease, neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinoses, mucopolysaccharidosis, Krabbe disease, mucolipidosis, and Gaucher disease."

    "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) VII is an ultra-rare, autosomal-recessive, metabolic disease caused by a deficiency of β-glucuronidase, a lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyzes glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), including dermatan sulfate (DS), chondroitin sulfate, and heparan sulfate (HS). β-glucuronidase deficiency leads to progressive accumulation of undegraded GAGs in lysosomes of affected tissues, which may cause hydrops fetalis, short stature, hepatosplenomegaly, and cognitive impairment. An open-label, multicenter, phase II study was conducted in 8 pediatric subjects <5 years of age with MPS VII. Subjects received the recombinant human β-glucuronidase vestronidase alfa 4 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every other week for 48 weeks (treatment period). Those who completed the 48-week treatment were offered to continue treatment with vestronidase alfa 4 mg/kg for up to 240 weeks or until withdrawal of consent, discontinuation, or study termination (continuation period). The level of GAG excreted in urine (uGAG) above normal has been shown to correlate with disease severity and clinical outcomes in MPS diseases. Therefore, the primary efficacy endpoint of this study was to determine the mean percentage change in uGAG DS excretion from baseline to week 48. Statistically significant reductions in uGAG DS from baseline were observed at each visit (p < 0.0001), with a least square mean (standard error) percentage change of -60% (6.6) at week 4 (first post-baseline assessment) and -61% (6.41) at week 48 (final assessment during treatment period). Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline to week 48 in growth and hepatosplenomegaly. Positive trends were observed toward increased standing height Z-score (mean [standard deviation] at baseline, -2.630 [1.17], n = 8; at week 48, -2.045 [0.27], n = 7) and growth velocity (mean [SD] Z-score at baseline, -2.59 [1.49], n = 4; at week 48, -0.39 [2.10], n = 4; p = 0.27). Hepatomegaly was resolved in 3 of 3 subjects assessed by ultrasound and in 5 of 6 subjects assessed by physical examination; splenomegaly was resolved in 1 of 3 subjects assessed by ultrasound and in 2 of 2 subjects assessed by physical examination. There were no new safety signals identified during this study. Mild-to-moderate infusion-associated reactions occurred in 4 (50%) subjects. In conclusion, long-term vestronidase alfa treatment demonstrated a rapid and sustained reduction in uGAGs, maintained growth, and improved hepatosplenomegaly in pediatric subjects with MPS VII <5 years of age.

    "abstract": "Cytotoxic (CD8) T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells have a significant immune function role. The ongoing stimulation of immunity and the excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines observed in pediatric patients with Gaucher disease (GD) can affect immune cells. Few studies have looked at the proportion of cytotoxic CD8 T-cells and their subsets in children with GD. A prospective case-control study was performed involving twenty pediatric patients with type 1 GD and twenty healthy age-matched controls. All patients received regular enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for at least 6 months before the study. Complete blood count and flow cytometric analyses of CD8 T, Tc1, Tc2, NK, and NK T-cells were performed. GD patients showed significantly increased of CD8 T, Tc1 and significantly decreased NK cells frequencies when compared to healthy controls. However, no significant difference in Tc2 and NK T-cells was found between the studied groups. GD patients on regular ERT have increased CD8+ T-cell frequencies, predominantly Tc1, together with a reduction in NK cells than in healthy controls. These crucial immunological changes may contribute to some extent to the pathogenesis and the progression of GD."

    "abstract": "The synthesis of five new multivalent derivatives of a trihydroxypiperidine iminosugar was accomplished through copper catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction of an azido ending piperidine and several propargylated scaffolds. The resulting multivalent architectures were assayed as inhibitors of lysosomal GCase, the defective enzyme in Gaucher disease. The multivalent compounds resulted in much more potent inhibitors than a parent monovalent reference compound, thus showing a good multivalent effect. Biological investigation of these compounds as pharmacological chaperones revealed that the trivalent derivative (12) gives a 2-fold recovery of the GCase activity on Gaucher patient fibroblasts bearing the L444P/L444P mutations responsible for neuropathies. Additionally, a thermal denaturation experiment showed its ability to impart stability to the recombinant enzyme used in therapy."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is caused by glucocerebroside accumulation in different tissues due to beta-glucocerebrosidase enzyme deficiency. Genetic defects in proteins involved in beta-glucocerebrosidase processing and activation may indirectly lead to Gaucher-like phenotypes in affected individuals. Saposin C, derived from the prosaposin precursor, is a crucial activator for beta-glucocerebrosidase, and its deficiency has been linked to Gaucher-like phenotypes in several clinical reports. Here, we report two Emirati families with Gaucher-like disorder due to Saposin C deficiency. Affected patients from both families carry the homozygous state of the novel c.1005 + 1G > A splice site (first to be reported) variant in the PSAP gene. Molecular analysis showed that the underlying variant is predicted to result in the retention of intron 9-10 and the formation of a premature stop codon leading to the complete loss of Saposin C. Clinical examination of the affected patients showed a wide heterogeneity in the patients' age of onset and symptoms ranging from Gaucher-like type 3 phenotype with severe refractory myoclonic epilepsy to Gaucher-like type 1 phenotype with growth retardation and hepatosplenomegaly. Collectively, the available clinical and molecular data confirms the pathogenicity of the reported PSAP splice site variant. The reported clinical cases expand the genetic and clinical spectrum of Saposin C deficiency."

    "abstract": "In Gaucher disease (GD), the deficiency of glucocerebrosidase causes lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), which is partly converted by acid ceramidase to glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) in the lysosome. Chronically elevated blood and tissue GlcSph is thought to contribute to symptoms in GD patients as well as to increased risk for Parkinson's disease. On the other hand, formation of GlcSph may be beneficial since the water soluble sphingoid base is excreted via urine and bile. To study the role of excessive GlcSph formation during glucocerebrosidase deficiency, we studied zebrafish that have two orthologs of acid ceramidase, Asah1a and Asah1b. Only the latter is involved in the formation of GlcSph in glucocerebrosidase-deficient zebrafish as revealed by knockouts of Asah1a or Asah1b with glucocerebrosidase deficiency (either pharmacologically induced or genetic). Comparison of zebrafish with excessive GlcSph (gba1<sup>-/-</sup> fish) and without GlcSph (gba1<sup>-/-</sup>:asah1b<sup>-/-</sup> fish) allowed us to study the consequences of chronic high levels of GlcSph. Prevention of excessive GlcSph in gba1<sup>-/-</sup>:asah1b<sup>-/-</sup> fish did not restrict storage cells, GlcCer accumulation, or neuroinflammation. However, GD fish lacking excessive GlcSph show an ameliorated course of disease reflected by significantly increased lifespan, delayed locomotor abnormality, and delayed development of an abnormal curved back posture. The loss of tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) mRNA, a marker of dopaminergic neurons, is slowed down in brain of GD fish lacking excessive GlcSph. In conclusion, in the zebrafish GD model, excess GlcSph has little impact on (neuro)inflammation or the presence of GlcCer-laden macrophages but rather seems harmful to th1-positive dopaminergic neurons."

In addition, carriers of an abnormal GBA allele are at increased risk for Parkinson's disease. GCase undergoes extensive modification of its four N-glycans en route to and inside the lysosome that is reflected in changes in molecular weight as detected with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fluorescent activity-based probes (ABPs) that covalently label GCase in reaction-based manner in vivo and in vitro allow sensitive visualization of GCase molecules. Using these ABPs, we studied the life cycle of GCase in cultured fibroblasts and macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells. Specific attention was paid to the impact of 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) supplementation to bicarbonate-buffered medium. Here, we report how HEPES-buffered medium markedly influences processing of GCase, its lysosomal degradation, and the total cellular enzyme level. HEPES-containing medium was also found to reduce maturation of other lysosomal enzymes (α-glucosidase and β-glucuronidase) in cells. The presence of HEPES in bicarbonate containing medium increases GCase activity in GD-patient derived fibroblasts, illustrating how the supplementation of HEPES complicates the use of cultured cells for diagnosing GD."

We demonstrate that ex vivo lentivirus-modified, rapamycin-conditioned CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can also act as next-generation cellular delivery vehicles-that is, \"micropharmacies\"-to disseminate corrective enzymes for multiple lysosomal storage disorders. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of this treatment platform for Fabry, Gaucher, Farber, and Pompe diseases in vitro and in vivo. For example, such micropharmacies expressing α-galactosidase A for treatment of Fabry disease were transplanted in mice where they provided functional enzyme in key affected tissues such as kidney and heart, facilitating clearance of pathogenic substrate after a single administration."

    "abstract": "Sleep Apnea Syndrome (SAS) is one of the most common chronic diseases, affecting nearly one billion people worldwide. The repetitive occurrence of abnormal respiratory events generates cyclical desaturation-reoxygenation sequences known as intermittent hypoxia (IH). Among SAS metabolic sequelae, it has been established by experimental and clinical studies that SAS is an independent risk factor for the development and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The principal goal of this study was to decrypt the molecular mechanisms at the onset of IH-mediated liver injury. To address this question, we used a unique mouse model of SAS exposed to IH, employed unbiased high-throughput transcriptomics and computed network analysis. This led us to examine hepatic mitochondrial ultrastructure and function using electron microscopy, high-resolution respirometry and flux analysis in isolated mitochondria. Transcriptomics and network analysis revealed that IH reprograms Nuclear Respiratory Factor- (NRF-) dependent gene expression and showed that mitochondria play a central role. We thus demonstrated that IH boosts the oxidative capacity from fatty acids of liver mitochondria. Lastly, the unbalance between oxidative stress and antioxidant defense is tied to an increase in hepatic ROS production and DNA damage during IH. We provide a comprehensive analysis of liver metabolism during IH and reveal the key role of the mitochondria at the origin of development of liver disease. These findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying NAFLD development and progression during SAS and provide a rationale for novel therapeutic targets and biomarker discovery."

The clinical and molecular findings, endocrinological features and metabolic status of 26 patients (16 with FD, and 10 with GD1) were evaluated. The results were compared to age- and gender-matched healthy individuals. Patients with GD1 and FD were followed for 7.2 ± 4.7 and 6.4 ± 4.3 years, respectively. Calcium and magnesium levels in patients with GD1 were lower than in controls (p=0.01; p=0.002). Osteoporosis was detected in 20% (n=2) of GD1 patients and 12.5% (n=2) of FD patients. The HbA1c value of GD1 patients was significantly lower than both in control and Fabry patients (p=0.004; and p=0.007, respectively). There was a negative correlation between LysoGb3 and female gender (p=0.04; r=-0.49), but no correlation was found with any other biochemical parameters. There was a negative correlation between the LysoGb1 level and the neutrophil (p=0.03; r=-0.711) and thrombocyte levels (p=0.02; r=-0.767), and a positive correlation with ferritin levels (p<0.001; r=0.867).

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive inborn metabolic disorder caused by a glucocerebrosidase (GCase) defect. GD is classified into three main types depending on accompanying neurological symptoms. Enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy are limited in the treatment of neurological symptoms, and using genotype and GCase activity to discriminate between non-neuronopathic and neuronopathic GD may be challenging as the two sometimes phenotypically overlap. The number of patients exhibiting neurological symptoms in Japan is significantly higher than that in Europe and the United States, and newborn screening (NBS) is still not actively performed in Japan. Definitive determination of the actual frequency and proportion of the type of GD from the results of NBS remains inconclusive. We performed NBS for Fabry disease, Pompe disease, and GD, mainly in the Kyushu area in Japan. Herein, we discuss the results of NBS for GD, as well as, the insights gained from following the clinical course of patients diagnosed through NBS. A total of 155,442 newborns were screened using an enzyme activity assay using dried blood spots. We found four newborns showing lower GCase activity and were definitively diagnosed with GD by <i>GBA</i> gene analysis. The frequency of GD diagnosis through NBS was 1 in 77,720 when limited to the probands. This frequency is higher than that previously estimated in Japan. In the future, NBS for GD is expected to be performed in many regions of Japan and contribute to detecting more patients with GD. Early screening and diagnosis may have a very significant impact on the quality of life and potentially longevity in infants with GD."

The earlier the age of onset, the more severe the clinical presentation and progression, with infantile, juvenile and late-onset presentations broadly delineated into separate phenotypic subtypes. Gene and substrate reduction therapies, both of which act directly on sphingolipidosis are entering clinical trials for treatment of these disorders. Simple to use biomarkers for disease monitoring are urgently required to support and expedite these clinical trials. Here, lysosphingolipid and protein biomarkers of sphingolipidosis and neuropathology respectively, were assessed in plasma samples from 33 GM2 gangliosidosis patients, 13 GM1 gangliosidosis patients, and compared to 66 controls. LysoGM2 and lysoGM1 were detectable in 31/33 GM2 gangliosidosis and 12/13 GM1 gangliosidosis patient samples respectively, but not in any controls. Levels of the axonal damage marker Neurofilament light (NF-L) were highly elevated in both GM2 and GM1 gangliosidosis patient plasma samples, with no overlap with controls. Levels of the astrocytosis biomarker Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were also elevated in samples from both patient populations, albeit with some overlap with controls. In GM2 gangliosidosis patient plasma NF-L, Tau, GFAP and lysoGM2 were all most highly elevated in infantile onset patients, indicating a relationship to severity and phenotype. Plasma NF-L and liver lysoGM2 were also elevated in a GM2 gangliosidosis mouse model, and were lowered by treatment with a drug that slowed disease progression. These results indicate that lysosphingolipids and NF-L/GFAP have potential to monitor pharmacodynamics and pathogenic processes respectively in GM2 and GM1 gangliosidoses patients."

    "abstract": "Ferritin is the major iron-storage glycoprotein found in all tissues. Ferritin glycosylation can be assessed by the differential affinities of ferritin glycoforms for Concanavalin A (ConA), a lectin. The fraction of serum ferritin bound to ConA is called \"glycosylated ferritin\" (GF). Low GF reflects macrophagic activation and is an essential biomarker used in adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and Gaucher disease diagnosis and therapeutic management. To date, no complete assay description and method validation according to the ISO 15189 standard has been published. This study aimed to describe and validate our method used for GF measurement and describe GF values observed in patients. Ferritin glycoforms were separated based on their affinities for ConA using commercially available TRIS-barbital buffer, Sepharose and ConA/Sepharose 4B gels. Ferritin concentrations were measured on the Siemens Dimension Vista 1500®. We analysed 16,843 GF values obtained between 2000 and 2021 from our database of patients. Optimal separation of ferritin glycoforms was obtained by 15-min incubation of serum with ConA/Sepharose at pH 8. The optimized volume were 0.4 mL for total serum ferritin (TSF) 30-1000 µg/L and 0.5 mL for TSF 1000-2500 µg/L. Serum with higher TSF should be pre-diluted in the TRIS-barbital buffer. Reproducibility of ferritin measurement in the TRIS-barbital buffer matrix was excellent (intra-assay CV < 1%; inter-assay CV < 4%). Reproducibility of GF assay was good (intra-assay CV < 10% for low and high ferritin samples, respectively; and inter-assay CV < 10%). Inter-operator variability was 21.6% for GF < 20%. Ferritin was stable for up to 3 days in the TRIS-barbital buffer. An inter-laboratory exchange program conducted with another French hospital showed good agreement between results. In our database, <20% GF levels were scarce, compatible with the low prevalence of Still's disease, MAS, and Gaucher disease. The 95% confidence interval for GF was [26-58]%, lower than values described in the literature for healthy individuals. Thanks to good performances, this technique can become readily available for laboratories servicing patients with AOSD, MAS (including severe COVID-19 patients) and Gaucher disease patients."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by an insufficiency of active β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Exogenous recombinant GCase via enzyme replacement therapy is considered the most practical treatment for Gaucher disease. Mannose receptors mediate the efficient uptake of exogenous GCase into macrophages. Thus, terminal mannose residues on N-glycans are essential for the delivery of exogenous GCase. In this study, recombinant GCase was produced in root cultures of wild-type (WT) and glycoengineered transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana with downregulated N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I expression. Root cultures of WT and glycoengineered transgenic N. benthamiana plants were successfully generated by the induction of plant hormones. Recombinant GCases produced in both root cultures possessed GCase enzyme activity. Purified GCases derived from both root cultures revealed different N-glycan profiles. The WT-derived GCase possessed the predominant plant-type N-glycans, which contain plant-specific sugars-linkages, specifically β1,2-xylose and α1,3-fucose residues. Notably, the mannosidic-type N-glycans with terminal mannose residues were abundant in the purified GCase derived from glycoengineered N. benthamiana root culture. This research provides a promising plant-based system for the production of recombinant GCase with terminal mannose residues on N-glycans."

The use of dried blood spot (DBS) specimens offers many advantages, including easy collection, the need for a small amount of blood, and simpler transportation. However, DBS has limitations for measuring GCase activity. In this paper, we recount our cross-sectional study and publish seven years of experience using DBS samples and levels of the deacylated form of glucocerebroside, glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), for GD diagnosis. Of 444 screened subjects, 99 (22.3%) were diagnosed with GD at a median (range) age of 21 (1-78) years. Lyso-Gb levels for genetically confirmed GD patients vs. subjects negative to GD diagnosis were 252 (9-1340) ng/mL and 5.4 (1.5-16) ng/mL, respectively.

Lyso-Gb1 levels, median (range), were 5 (2.7-10.7) in heterozygous <i>GBA1</i> carriers with Parkinson's disease (PD), similar to lyso-Gb1 levels in subjects without PD. We call for a paradigm change for the diagnosis of GD based on lyso-Gb1 measurements and confirmatory <i>GBA1</i> mutation analyses in DBS. Lyso-Gb1 levels could not be used to differentiate between heterozygous <i>GBA1</i> carriers and wild type."

Eligible participants included board-certified or board-eligible genetic counselors who had counseled preconception/prenatal patients within the past 3 years. An online survey was distributed via the National Society of Genetic Counselors in November of 2017. One hundred twenty genetic counselors completed the quantitative survey, distributed in Fall of 2017. While the majority of respondents knew of the Gaucher-related Parkinson's link (n = 78; 65%), just over one-third reported discussing it in preconception/prenatal settings (n = 30; 38.5%). Respondents reported discussing these links more consistently when disclosing positive results or when the patient/family approached the topic. Respondents cited the lack of professional guidelines as one of the main reasons for not discussing the link. These results highlight an inconsistency in PPGCs' discussions of the Parkinson's risk in Gaucher disease carriers, and the need to develop guidelines regarding these issues to help standardize the care and education of patients."

At treatment initiation, 30.0% of patients had been splenectomised. Among patients for whom data were available, anaemia was present in one-third of non-splenectomised patients and 12.5% of those with splenectomy, and moderate or severe thrombocytopenia was reported in two-thirds of non-splenectomised patients. Bone pain was present in 30.8% and 57.1% of non- splenectomised and splenectomised patients, respectively. No bone crises were reported, and data relating to other bone complications were available for only ≤3 patients. Haematological findings and bone pain in this group are similar to those in the global ICGG Gaucher Registry cohort. Lack of baseline data for other bone complications limits interpretation in that regard.

A computed tomography scan of the abdomen showed an enlarged liver of 173 mm and massive splenomegaly of 27 mm. The diagnosis of GD was confirmed by reduced beta-glucocerebrosidase activity and heterozygous mutations in the GBA1 gene. The patient was managed at a dedicated paediatric haematology unit with enzyme replacement therapy and regular clinical, biochemical and radiological monitoring."

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable, biologically heterogeneous disease of the plasma cells, associated with older age and is more common in men. Gaucher disease, caused by mutation in acid β-glucosidase (glucocerebrosidase, <i>GBA</i>) gene, has been linked to multiple cancers, especially MM. Pathological accumulation of glucosylceramide and complex glycosphingolipids coupled with chronic inflammation may be the cause of cancer in patients with Gaucher disease. In this study, we hypothesized patients with MM have mutations in the <i>GBA</i> gene and analyzed patients with MM to determine whether they have a higher frequency of <i>GBA</i> variants. Twenty-four MM samples were acquired from the Human Biobank, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. <i>GBA</i> mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction-directed DNA sequencing. We found no mutations in the coding regions of <i>GBA</i> in any of the 24 study subjects. However, two single-nucleotide polymorphisms, rs2070679 and rs2361534, were identified. A significant difference was observed between the study and control groups (<i>p</i> = 0.0028) in rs2361534 allele distribution, with the C allele frequency being higher in patients (1/48, 2.1%) than in the control group (5/3030, 0.16%, Taiwan Biobank). In this study, the sample size was limited and GBA enzyme activity was not measured; therefore, we could not establish a direct correlation between MM and <i>GBA</i> mutations. However, the association of rs2361534 suggests that regions around this single-nucleotide polymorphism may be involved in MM. The relationship between MM and <i>GBA</i> mutations remains unclear. A large sample is required for a detailed analysis of this potential relationship."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD), one of the most common lysosomal storage diseases, is caused by mutations in the gene, GBA1, that leads to defective glucocerebrosidase activity resulting in the accumulation and storage of glycosphingolipids. However, the pathophysiology of GD is more complicated leading to various associated conditions such as skeletal manifestations and Parkinson's disease (PD). These may result from oxidative stress and inflammatory responses due to complex interconnection of downstream factors such as substrate accumulation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, unfolded protein response (UPR), calcium dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, defective autophagy, accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates, altered secretion and function of extracellular vesicles (EVs), and immunologic hyperactivity. Here we provide an overview of lysosomal storage diseases followed by a comprehensive review of the factors contributing to oxidative stress and inflammation in GD pathophysiology, mechanisms underlying the possible associated complications, current established treatments for GD, their limitations, and potential primary and adjunctive treatment options targeting these factors."

    "abstract": "The lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), encoded by the GBA1 gene, is a membrane-associated protein catalyzing the cleavage of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph). Homologous GBA1 mutations cause Gaucher disease (GD) and heterologous mutations cause Parkinson's disease (PD). Importantly, heterologous GBA1 mutations are recognized as the second risk factor of PD. The pathological features of PD are Lewy neurites (LNs) and Lewy bodies (LBs) composed of pathological α-synuclein. Oxidative stress, inflammatory response, autophagic impairment, and α-synuclein accumulation play critical roles in PD pathogenic cascades, but the pathogenesis of PD has not yet been fully elucidated. What's more, PD treatment drugs can only relieve symptoms to a certain extent, but cannot alleviate neurodegenerative progression. Therefore, it's urgent to explore new targets that can alleviate the neurodegenerative process. Deficient GCase can cause lysosomal dysfunction, obstructing the metabolism of α-synuclein. Meanwhile, GCase dysfunction causes accumulation of its substrates, leading to lipid metabolism disorders. Subsequently, astrocytes and microglia are activated, releasing amounts of pro-inflammatory mediators and causing extensive neuroinflammation. All these cascades can induce neuron damage and death, eventually promoting PD pathology. This review aims to summarize these points and the potential of GCase as an original target to provide some ideas for elucidating the pathogenesis of PD."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are rare genetic disorders caused by a disruption in cellular clearance, resulting in pathological storage of undegraded lysosomal substrates. Recent clinical and genetic studies have uncovered links between multiple LSDs and common neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we review recent literature describing the role of glia cells and neuroinflammation in PD and LSDs, including Gaucher disease (GD) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), and highlight converging inflammation pathways that lead to neuron loss. Recent data indicates that lysosomal dysfunction and accumulation of storage materials can initiate the activation of glial cells, through interaction with cell surface or cytosolic pattern recognition receptors that detect pathogenic aggregates of cellular debris. Activated glia cells could act to protect neurons through the elimination of toxic protein or lipid aggregates early in the disease process. However prolonged glial activation that occurs over several decades in chronic-age related neurodegeneration could induce the inappropriate elimination of synapses, leading to neuron loss. These studies provide mechanistic insight into the relationship between lysosomal dysfunction and glial activation, and offer novel therapeutic pathways for the treatment of PD and LSDs focused on reducing neuroinflammation and mitigating cell loss."

    "abstract": "Neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease and related brain diseases has been firmly linked to the abundant neuronal protein α-synuclein (αS). However, we have gained surprisingly little insight into how exactly αS exerts toxicity in these diseases. Hypotheses of proteotoxicity, disturbed vesicle trafficking, mitochondrial dysfunction and other toxicity mechanisms have been proposed, and it seems possible that a combination of different mechanisms may drive pathology. A toxicity mechanism that has caught increased attention in the recent years is αS-related lipotoxicity. Lipotoxicity typically occurs in a cell when fatty acids exceed the metabolic needs, triggering a flux into harmful pathways of non-oxidative metabolism. Genetic and experimental approaches have revealed a significant overlap between lipid storage disorders, most notably Gaucher's disease, and synucleinopathies. There is accumulating evidence for lipid aberrations causing synuclein misfolding as well as for αS excess and misfolding causing lipid aberration. Does that mean the key problem in synucleinopathies is lipotoxicity, the accumulation of harmful lipid species or alteration in lipid equilibrium? Here, we review the existing literature in an attempt to get closer to an answer."

While this <i>GBA</i> variant is causative for Gaucher's disease, the pathogenic role of this mutation in LBSD is unclear. Detailed neuropathologic evaluation was performed for one index case and a structured literature review of other <i>GBA</i> p.R202X carriers was conducted. Through the systematic literature search, we identified three additional reported subjects carrying the same <i>GBA</i> mutation, including one Parkinson's disease (PD) patient with early disease onset, one case with neuropathologically-verified LBSD, and one unaffected relative of a Gaucher's disease patient. Among the affected subjects carrying the <i>GBA</i> p.R202X, all males were diagnosed with Lewy body dementia, while the two females presented as PD. The clinical penetrance of <i>GBA</i> p.R202X in LBSD patients and families argues strongly for a pathogenic role for this variant, although presenting with a striking phenotypic heterogeneity of clinical and pathological features."

The Norrbottnian subtype of neuronopathic GD type 3 (GD3) is relatively frequent in the northern part of Sweden. It exhibits a wide range of neurological symptoms but is characterized by extended life expectancy compared to GD3 in other countries. The aim of our study was to describe the cognitive profile of adult patients with Norrbottnian GD3. Ten patients with GD3 (five males and five females) underwent neurocognitive testing with the Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). RBANS consists of different short tests that assess Immediate Memory, Visuospatial and Constructional function, Language, Attention, and Delayed Memory. General neurological symptoms of the patients were assessed with the modified severity scoring tool. Patients (median age 41.5 range 24-57) performed lower than average in all cognitive domains. The overall index score was low (median 58.5, Interquartile range [IQR] 25.5), with the most profound deficit in attention (median 57, IQR 32.5) and immediate memory (median 76.5, IQR 13). Higher scores were found in language (median 83, IQR 21.5), delayed memory (median 81, IQR 41), and visuospatial/constructional function (median 86, IQR 32.35). Norrbottnian GD3 patients showed a unique neurocognitive profile with low overall performance, mostly derived from low scores in attention and memory domains whereas language and visuospatial/constructional ability were relatively spared."

At least two therapies approved outside the USA and the European Union, Abcertin<sup>®</sup> and Asbroder<sup>®</sup>, have adopted the identical INN imiglucerase. Both drugs were approved via regulatory pathways not aligned with World Health Organization Similar Biotherapeutic Product guidelines. We analyzed whether the use of the identical INN \"imiglucerase\" for these drugs impacts adverse event (AE) reporting in the Sanofi Global Safety Database. First, we reviewed all imiglucerase individual case safety reports (referred to as cases) including AE data reported between January 2012 and March 2018 that contained Abcertin or Asbroder in the narrative. In a second analysis, we examined cases from Mexico reported between May 2013 and March 2018 to assess changes in imiglucerase reporting following the 2015 approval of Asbroder in Mexico. Fifty-six cases mentioning Asbroder and none mentioning Abcertin were retrieved in the first analysis. Upon close review, the AEs of 45 cases (80.4%) were attributed to Asbroder, one (1.8%) to Cerezyme; the specific drug attribution for the AEs of ten cases (17.9%) could not be determined. In the second analysis, a substantial increase in cases and AEs was observed in the period after Asbroder approval (73 cases with 150 AEs pre-approval vs 132 cases with 333 AEs post-approval). Twenty-three of 132 (17.4%) post-approval cases reported discontinuation of treatment (19 related to Asbroder AEs, and four related to Cerezyme AEs). Infusion-associated reactions occurred in 25/132 cases (17 Asbroder related, six Cerezyme related, two indeterminate). This analysis demonstrates two potential consequences of identical INN use between Cerezyme and Asbroder: (1) an aggregate safety profile for Cerezyme that includes other products using the identical INN leading to inaccurate pharmacovigilance data and (2) healthcare providers switching, substituting, or potentially assuming interchangeability between the products. Identical INN use without the brand name differentiator may compromise pharmacovigilance data, potentially masking differences in safety profiles between products."

    "abstract": "Cells have evolved sophisticated molecular control systems to maximize the efficiency of the folding process. However, any subtle alteration of the environment or the protein can lead to misfolding or affect the conformational plasticity of the native states. It has been widely demonstrated that misfolding and/or conformational instability are the underlying mechanisms of several rare disorders caused by enzymatic deficits. In fact, disease-causing mutations often lead to the substitution of amino acids that are crucial for the achievement of a folded conformation, or play a role on the equilibrium between native-state conformers. One of the promising approaches to treat conformational disorders is the use of pharmacological chaperones (PCs), small molecules that specifically bind a target protein and stabilize a functional fold, thus increasing the amount of functionally active enzyme. Molecules acting as PCs are usually coenzymes, substrate analogues behaving as competitive inhibitors, or allosteric modulators. In this review, the general features of PCs are described, along with three examples of diseases (Gaucher disease, Phenylketonuria, and Primary Hyperoxaluria) in which this approach is currently under study at preclinical and/or clinical level."

There are few patients and published studies about inborn errors of metabolism. The main objective of this study was to describe the effectiveness of orphan drugs in inborn errors of metabolism in paediatric patients. Retrospective descriptive study of 24 months on patients diagnosed with inborn errors of metabolism during childhood and who attended the pharmacy clinic or Day-Care Unit of a 630-bed general hospital. The study included 15 patients with a median age of 17.8 years and were treated with nine different drugs: sapropterin, sodium phenylbutyrate, miglustat, velaglucerase, sebelipase, idursulfase, 5-hydroxytryptophan, succinate, and riboflavin. Seven different inborn errors of metabolism were observed: phenylketonuria, defects of the urea cycle, Gaucher, Nieman-Pick, Hunter's disease, along with acid lipase deficiency, and mitochondrial diseases. Orphan drugs used for the treatment of inborn errors of metabolism accounted for 1.3% of hospital drug costs. Some orphan drugs achieved asymptomatic patients, but others just produced a modest symptomatic improvement. Most patients showed good tolerance to the treatment. Orphan drugs used in inborn errors of metabolism had an easy to manage toxicity profile, with many disparities in effectiveness. These drugs have a high economic impact. The cost-effectiveness ratio for orphan drugs is a controversial issue due to their high cost and the inconclusive clinical evidence."

Our patient's generalized tonic-clonic seizures and myoclonus did not improve despite the administration of multiple antiseizure medications and enzyme replacement therapy. The myoclonus reduced following pharmacological chaperone therapy, but this effect was temporary, and the generalized tonic-clonic seizures continued to occur. However, the generalized tonic-clonic seizures disappeared following treatment with 2 mg/day of perampanel. In addition, the decrease in myoclonus dramatically improved motor function such as talking, eating, and walking and stabilized the patient's mental status. These effects have been sustained for more than 4 years. Perampanel is expected to be effective in the treatment of progressive myoclonus epilepsy associated with Gaucher disease type 3 and should be considered the drug of choice for this condition."

Here we report the development and validation of a Gaucher disease (GD)-specific PROM for patients with type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1) a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia, bruising, bone disease, and fatigue. The questionnaire was initially developed with input from 85 patients or parents of patients with GD1 or GD3 in Israel. Owing to few participating patients with GD3, content validity was assessed for patients with GD1 only. Content validity of the revised questionnaire was assessed in 33 patients in the US, France, and Israel according to US Food and Drug Administration standards, with input from a panel of six GD experts and one patient advocate representative. Concept elicitation interviews explored patient experience of symptoms and treatments, and a cognitive debriefing exercise explored patients' understanding and relevance of instructions, items, response scales, and recall period. Two versions of the questionnaire were subsequently developed: a 24-item version for routine monitoring in clinical practice (rmGD1-PROM), and a 17-item version for use in clinical trials (ctGD1-PROM). Psychometric validation of the ctGD1-PROM was assessed in 46 adult patients with GD1 and re-administered two weeks later to examine test-retest reliability. Findings from the psychometric validation study revealed excellent internal consistency and strong evidence of convergent validity of the ctGD1-PROM based on correlations with the 36-item Short Form Health Survey. Most items were found to show moderate, good, or excellent test-retest reliability. Development of the ctGD1-PROM represents an important step forward for researchers measuring the impact of GD and its respective treatment."

Accordingly, the goal of this Delphi consensus exercise was to extend prior initiatives of this type by addressing issues related to newborn screening, diagnostic evaluations, and treatment (both disease directed and adjunctive). The iterative Delphi process involved creation of an initial slate of statements, review by a steering committee, and three rounds of consensus development by an independent panel. A preliminary set of statements was developed by the supporting agency based on literature searches covering the period from 1965 to 2020. The Delphi process reduced an initial set of 185 statements to 65 for which there was unanimous support from the panel. The statements supported may ultimately provide a framework for more detailed treatment guidelines. In addition, the statements for which unanimous support could not be achieved help to identify evidence gaps that are targets for future research."

A prospective follow-up, semi-experimental multi-centre study was conducted in four hospitals to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of ERT in GD1 patients. Twenty-five individuals with 266 glucocerebrosidase (GCase) observations in plasma and leukocytes and 14 individuals with 68 Spanish magnetic resonance imaging (S-MRI) observations were enrolled. A two concatenated compartment model with zero-order endogenous production and first-order distribution (CL<sub>1</sub> = 3.85 × 10<sup>-1</sup> L/d) and elimination (CL<sub>2</sub> = 1.25 L/d) allowed GCase observations in plasma and leukocytes to be described, respectively. An exponential time dependency (k<sub>T</sub> = 6.14 × 10<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> ) effect on CL<sub>1</sub> was incorporated. The final exposure-efficacy model was a longitudinal logistic regression model with a first-order Markov element. An E<sub>max</sub> function (EC<sub>50</sub> = 15.73 U/L and E<sub>max</sub> = 2.33) linked steady-state concentrations of GCase in leukocytes to the probability of transition across the different S-MRI stages. A population pharmacokinetic model successfully characterized the leukocyte activity-time profiles of GCase following intravenous administration of ERT in GD1 patients together with an exposure-efficacy relationship in bone marrow using Markovian elements. The information obtained from this study could be of high clinical relevance in individualization of ERT in GD1 patients, as this could lead to anticipative decision-making regarding clinical response in bone and optimal dosing strategy."

    "abstract": "Lipid-related disorders, which primarily affect metabolic tissues, including adipose tissue and the liver are associated with alterations in lysosome homeostasis. Obesity is one of the more prevalent diseases, which results in energy imbalance within metabolic tissues and lysosome dysfunction. Less frequent diseases include Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) and Gaucher diseases, both of which are known as Lysosomal Storage Diseases (LSDs), where lysosomal dysfunction within metabolic tissues remains to be fully characterized. Adipocytes and hepatocytes share common pathways involved in the lysosome-autophagic axis, which are regulated by the function of cathepsins and CD36, an immuno-metabolic receptor and display alterations in lipid diseases, and thereby impacting metabolic functions. In addition to intrinsic defects observed in metabolic tissues, cells of the immune system, such as B cells can infiltrate adipose and liver tissues, during metabolic imbalance favoring inflammation. Moreover, B cells rely on lysosomes to promote the processing and presentation of extracellular antigens and thus could also present lysosome dysfunction, consequently affecting such functions. On the other hand, growing evidence suggests that cells accumulating lipids display defective inter-organelle membrane contact sites (MCSs) established by lysosomes and other compartments, which contribute to metabolic dysfunctions at the cellular level. Overall, in this review we will discuss recent findings addressing common mechanisms that are involved in lysosome dysregulation in adipocytes and hepatocytes during obesity, NPC, and Gaucher diseases. We will discuss whether these mechanisms may modulate the function of B cells and how inter-organelle contacts, emerging as relevant cellular mechanisms in the control of lipid homeostasis, have an impact on these diseases."

To investigate the course of COVID-19 among patients with Gaucher disease (GD), the most common lysosomal storage disease. Based on the National Health System data, a retrospective cohort of patients with confirmed (polymerase chain reactionpositive) COVID-19 infection (n = 149 618) was investigated. The adverse outcomes between patients with GD (n = 39) and those without GD (n = 149 579) were compared with crude and propensity score-matched (PSM) groups. The outcomes were hospitalisation, the composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or mechanical ventilation and mortality. The patients with GD were significantly older and had a higher frequency of hypertension (HT), Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), dyslipidaemia, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, heart failure and cancer. Although hospitalisation rates in Gaucher patients were found to be higher in crude analyses, the PSM models (model 1, age and gender matched; model 2, matched for age, gender, HT, T2DM and cancer) revealed no difference for the outcomes between patients with GD and the general population.

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by glycosphingolipid accumulation and progressive damage across multiple organ systems. Due to its heterogeneous presentation, the condition is likely significantly underdiagnosed. Several approaches, including provider education efforts and newborn screening, have attempted to address underdiagnosis of FD across the age spectrum, with limited success. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods present another option for improving diagnosis. These methods isolate common health history patterns among patients using longitudinal real-world data, and can be particularly useful when patients experience nonspecific, heterogeneous symptoms over time. In this study, the performance of an AI tool in identifying patients with FD was analyzed. The tool was calibrated using de-identified health record data from a large cohort of nearly 5000 FD patients, and extracted phenotypic patterns from these records. The tool then used this FD pattern information to make individual-level estimates of FD in a testing dataset. Patterns were reviewed and confirmed with medical experts. The AI tool demonstrated strong analytic performance in identifying FD patients. In out-of-sample testing, it achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.82. Strong performance was maintained when testing on male-only and female-only cohorts, with AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82 respectively. The tool identified small segments of the population with greatly increased prevalence of FD: in the 1% of the population identified by the tool as at highest risk, FD was 23.9 times more prevalent than in the population overall. The AI algorithm used hundreds of phenotypic signals to make predictions and included both familiar symptoms associated with FD (e.g. renal manifestations) as well as less well-studied characteristics. The AI tool analyzed in this study performed very well in identifying Fabry disease patients using structured medical history data. Performance was maintained in all-male and all-female cohorts, and the phenotypic manifestations of FD highlighted by the tool were reviewed and confirmed by clinical experts in the condition. The platform's analytic performance, transparency, and ability to generate predictions based on existing real-world health data may allow it to contribute to reducing persistent underdiagnosis of Fabry disease."

The disorder is categorized into three phenotypes: GD type 1 or nonneuronopathic GD; GD type 2 or acute neuronopathic GD; and GD type 3 or chronic neuronopathic GD. The purposes of this study were to describe clinical characteristics of Thai GD in patients diagnosed and/or followed up during 2010-2018 and to perform re-genotyping including analysis of GBA recombinant alleles which had not been investigated in Thai patients before. There were 27 patients from seven medical centers, enrolled in the study. All the cases had pediatric onset. GD3 (44.5%) was the most common phenotype, followed by GD2 (40.7%) and GD1 (14.8%), with one case of neonatal GD. The median age of onset for GD1, GD2, and GD3 was 72, 4 and 12 months, respectively, suggesting relatively earlier onset of GD1 and GD3 in Thai patients. All patients with GD1 and most patients with GD3 received ERT. Four patients with GD3 had ERT followed by HSCT. Patients with GD3 who received no or late ERT showed unfavorable outcomes. We identified 14 variants including two novel (p.S384F and p.W533*) and 12 reported pathogenic variants: p.L483P, p.N409S, p.R159W, p.P305A, p.A175G, p.D448H, p.V414L, IVS2+1G>A, IVS6-1G>C, IVS7+1G>C, IVS9-3C>G, and Rec1a. The p.L483P was the most prevalent allele found in this study, at 66% (33/50 alleles), followed by IVS2+1G>A, Rec1a, and IVS6-1G>C. Twenty-four percent of patients were reassigned with validated genotypes, most of whom (4 of 6) were patients with GD2. The [p.S384F + p.W533*] being compounded with p.L483P, was found in the patient with neonatal GD, suggesting that the p.S384F could potentiate the deleterious effect of the p.W533*, and/or vice versa. Neuronopathic GD was strikingly prevalent among Thai affected population. Homozygous p.L483P was the most common genotype identified in Thai patients. Recombinant allele Rec1a and splicing mutations were associated with GD2 and severe cases of GD3. Mutation spectrum could be useful for designing stepwise molecular analysis, genetic screenings in population, and new therapeutic research for neuronopathic GD."

    "title": "Novel Management and Screening Approaches for Haematological Complications of Gaucher's Disease.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is the most common lysosomal storage disorder. The principal manifestations for its diagnosis and further monitoring include haematological manifestations such as anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, spleen enlargement, and bleeding disorders, among others. This review aims to summarise and update the role of haematological complications in GD diagnosis and follow-up, describe their management strategies, and to use these indicators as part of the diagnostic approach. A systematic review following the recommendations of PRISMA-P 2020 was carried out. Publications indexed in the databases PubMed, Embase, Science Open, Mendeley, and Web of Science were electronically searched by three independent reviewers, and publications up to June 2021 were accessed. A total of 246 publications were initially listed, of which 129 were included for further review and analysis. Case reports were considered if they were representative of a relevant hematologic complication. From the first review dated in 1974 to the latest publication in 2021, including different populations confirmed that the haematological manifestations such as thrombocytopaenia and splenomegaly at diagnosis of GD type 1 are the most frequent features of the disease. The incorporation of haematological parameters to diagnosis strategies increases their cost-effectiveness. Hematologic parameters are part of the scoring system for disease assessment and the evaluation of therapeutic outcomes, providing reliable and accessible data to improve the management of GD. However, cytopaenia, underlying coagulation disorders, and platelet dysfunction need to be addressed, especially during pregnancy or surgery. Long-term haematological complications include the risk of neoplasia and immune impairment, an area of unmet need that is currently under research. Haematological features are key for GD suspicion, diagnosis, and management. Normalization of hematological parameters is achieved with the treatment; however, there are unmet needs such as the underlying inflammatory status and the long-term risk of hematologic neoplasia."

    "title": "Two cases of neuronopathic form of Gaucher disease - diagnostic difficulties.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is one of the most common inherited lysosomal storage diseases caused by the deficiency of the enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase, leading to the accumulation of glucocerebroside. Depending on the clinical manifestations, two different forms of the disease are distinguished - the non-neuronopathic form (type 1) with a variety of presentations - from asymptomatic to symptomatic patients (characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia and osteopenia), and the neuronopathic form (known as types 2 and 3). Besides visceral, osseous, and hematopoietic organ lesions, neuronopathic forms are associated with central nervous system involvement (bulbar and pyramidal signs, horizontal saccadic eye movements, myoclonic epilepsy, progressive development delay). In type 2, the neurological symptoms appear earlier and are more severe, the survival time is shorter. In type 3, the neurological symptoms are milder and allow patients to live a fully productive life. This article includes a review of two cases of neuronopathic Gaucher disease: type 2 and severe type 3. Both patients presented symptoms during infancy and the manifestations were similar but varied in intensity and the dynamics of progress. Enzyme replacement therapy was started in both cases, which decreased visceral symptoms. Both described cases indicate the lack of knowledge and the tendency of doctors to disregard the possibility of Gaucher disease in their paediatrics patients."

    "abstract": "Pathenogenesis-related (PR) proteins are extensively used as molecular markers to dissect the signaling cascades leading to plant defense responses. However, studies focusing on the biochemical or biological properties of these proteins remain rare. Here, we identify and characterize a class of apple (Malus domestica) PR proteins, named M. domestica AGGLUTININS (MdAGGs), belonging to the amaranthin-like lectin family. By combining molecular and biochemical approaches, we show that abundant production of MdAGGs in leaf tissues corresponds with enhanced resistance to the bacterium Erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of the disease fire blight. We also show that E. amylovora represses the expression of MdAGG genes by injecting the type 3 effector DspA/E into host cells and by secreting bacterial exopolysaccharides. Using a purified recombinant MdAGG, we show that the protein agglutinates E. amylovora cells in vitro and binds bacterial lipopolysaccharides at low pH, conditions reminiscent of the intercellular pH occurring in planta upon E. amylovora infection. We finally provide evidence that negatively charged polysaccharides, such as the free exopolysaccharide amylovoran progressively released by the bacteria, act as decoys relying on charge-charge interaction with the MdAGG to inhibit agglutination. Overall, our results suggest that the production of this particular class of PR proteins may contribute to apple innate immunity mechanisms active against E. amylovora."

    "abstract": "Avian necrotic enteritis (NE) caused by Clostridium perfringens is a disease with a major economic impact, generating losses estimated to 6 billion of dollars annually for the poultry industry worldwide. The incidence of the disease is particularly on the rise in broiler chicken flocks eliminating the preventive use of antibiotics. To date, no alternative allows for the efficient prevention of NE and a control of the disease using a vaccinal strategy would be mostly prized. For this purpose, comparative and subtractive reverse vaccinology identifying putative immunogenic bacterial surface proteins is one of the most promising approaches. A comparative genomic study was performed on 16 C. perfringens strains isolated from healthy broiler chickens and from broilers affected with necrotic enteritis. Results showed that the analyzed genomes were composed of 155,700 distinct proteins from which 13% were identified as extracellular, 65% as cytoplasmic and 22% as part of the bacterial membrane. The evaluation of the immunogenicity of these proteins was determined using the prediction software VaxiJen®. For the most part, proteins with the highest scores were associated with an extracellular localisation. For all the proteins analyzed, the combination of both the immunogenicity score and the localisation prediction led to the selection of 12 candidate proteins that were mostly annotated as hypothetical proteins. We describe 6 potential candidates of higher interest due to their antigenic potential, their extracellular localisation, and their possible role in virulence of C. perfringens."

    "abstract": "<i>GBA1</i> mutations that encode lysosomal β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD) and are strong risk factors for synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. Only a subset of subjects with <i>GBA1</i> mutations exhibit neurodegeneration, and the factors that influence neurological phenotypes are unknown. We find that α-synuclein (α-syn) neuropathology induced by GCase depletion depends on neuronal maturity, the physiological state of α-syn, and specific accumulation of long-chain glycosphingolipid (GSL) GCase substrates. Reduced GCase activity does not initiate α-syn aggregation in neonatal mice or immature human midbrain cultures; however, adult mice or mature midbrain cultures that express physiological α-syn oligomers are aggregation prone. Accumulation of long-chain GSLs (≥C22), but not short-chain species, induced α-syn pathology and neurological dysfunction. Selective reduction of long-chain GSLs ameliorated α-syn pathology through lysosomal cathepsins. We identify specific requirements that dictate synuclein pathology in GD models, providing possible explanations for the phenotypic variability in subjects with GCase deficiency."

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder, and the strongest genetic risk factor for PD is mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (<i>GBA</i>). Mutations in <i>GBA</i> also lead to the development of Gaucher Disease (GD), the most common type of lysosomal storage disorder. Current therapeutic approaches fail to address neurological GD symptoms. Therefore, identifying therapeutic strategies that improve the phenotypic traits associated with GD/PD in animal models may provide an opportunity for treating neurological manifestations of GD/PD. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs, also called glitazones) are a class of compounds targeted for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and have also shown promise for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease, including PD. Here, we tested the efficacy of glitazone administration during development in a fly GD model with deletions in the <i>GBA</i> homolog, <i>dGBA1b (GBA1</i><sup>ΔTT/ΔTT</sup>). We observed an optimal dose of pioglitazone (PGZ) at a concentration of 1 μM that reduced sleep deficits, locomotor impairments, climbing defects, and restoration of normal protein levels of Ref(2)P, a marker of autophagic flux, in <i>GBA1</i><sup>ΔTT/ΔTT</sup> mutant flies, compared to <i>GBA1</i><sup>+/+</sup> control flies. These data suggest that PGZ may represent a potential compound with which to treat GD/PD by improving function of lysosomal-autophagy pathways, a cellular process that removes misfolded or aggregated proteins."

    "title": "C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 9 and Its CXCR3 Receptor Are the Salt and Pepper for T Cells Trafficking in a Mouse Model of Gaucher Disease.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disease, which happens due to mutations in <i>GBA1</i>/<i>Gba1</i> that encodes the enzyme termed as lysosomal acid β-glucosidase. The major function of this enzyme is to catalyze glucosylceramide (GC) into glucose and ceramide. The deficiency of this enzyme and resultant abnormal accumulation of GC cause altered function of several of the innate and adaptive immune cells. For example, augmented infiltration of T cells contributes to the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, (e.g., IFNγ, TNFα, IL6, IL12p40, IL12p70, IL23, and IL17A/F). This leads to tissue damage in a genetic mouse model (<i>Gba1</i><sup>9V/-</sup>) of Gaucher disease. The cellular mechanism(s) by which increased tissue infiltration of T cells occurs in this disease is not fully understood. Here, we delineate role of the CXCR3 receptor and its exogenous C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) in induction of increased tissue recruitment of CD4<sup>+</sup> T and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in Gaucher disease. Intracellular FACS staining of macrophages (Mϕs) and dendritic cells (DCs) from <i>Gba1</i><sup>9V/-</sup> mice showed elevated production of CXCL9. Purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from <i>Gba1</i><sup>9V/-</sup> mice showed increased expression of CXCR3. Ex vivo and in vivo chemotaxis experiments showed CXCL9 involvement in the recruitment of <i>Gba1</i><sup>9V/-</sup> T cells. Furthermore, antibody blockade of the CXCL9 receptor (CXCR3) on T cells caused marked reduction in CXCL9- mediated chemotaxis of T cells in <i>Gba1</i><sup>9V/-</sup> mice. These data implicate abnormalities of the CXCL9-CXCR3 axis leading to enhanced tissue recruitment of T cells in Gaucher disease. Such results provide a rationale for blockade of the CXCL9/CXCR3 axis as potential new therapeutic targets for the treatment of inflammation in Gaucher disease."

The purpose of this study was to analyse ocular features in Spanish patients with Gaucher's disease type I, and to investigate their possible correlation with phenotypic and burden parameters of this entity. This cross-sectional observational study compared parameters belonging to 18 eyes from 9 Spanish patients with Gaucher's disease Type I with 80 eyes from 40 healthy controls. Complete ophthalmological examination included choroidal and retinal thickness maps with swept source optical coherence tomography. Systemic analysis included genotype, plasmatic biomarkers, [ferritin, chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) and chitotriosidase (ChT)] and severity scoring systems results [\"Gaucher Disease Severity Score Index Type I\" (GauSSI-I) and \"Gaucher disease severity scoring system\" (GD-DS3)]. Nine subjects (18 eyes) were cases (female: 55.5%, mean age 45 years; male: 44.5%, mean age 36 years) and 40 subjects (80 eyes) were controls (female: 49%, mean age 50 years; male: 51%, mean age 55 years). There were no statistically significant differences when comparing ocular parameters (visual acuity; axial length, refractive errors, corneal parameters, lens, retinal and choroidal thickness) between case and control subjects (p>0.05). A statistically significant moderate correlation was observed between lower retinal thickness and choroidal quadrants thickness and greater disease severity scores. A lower central retinal thickness also correlates with higher biological plasmatic levels, and has a statistically significant association with the most affected patient with genotype N370S/Del 55pb. Conversely, higher pachymetry involves a more severe plasmatic concentration of biomarkers. Our results suggest that pachymetry, and retinal and choroidal thickness, are associated with burden biomarkers and disease severity index scores in Spanish patients with Gaucher's disease Type I."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by reduced lysosomal enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase activity. Heterogeneous genotypes and phenotypes have been observed within GD types and across ethnicities. Enzyme replacement therapy is generally recommended for patients with type 1 GD, the least severe form of GD. In Japan, velaglucerase alfa has a broad indication covering type 1, 2 or 3 GD. METHODS: All patients with type 1, 2, or 3 GD administered velaglucerase alfa 60 U/kg every 2 weeks via intravenous infusion after its launch date in Japan in 2014, were enrolled in a non-interventional, observational post-marketing surveillance (PMS). Individual patient data were reported via case report forms (CRFs). Key safety endpoints investigated included the incidence of infusion-related reactions (IRRs), the safety of velaglucerase alfa in patients with types 2 and 3 GD, from patients under one year of age to elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age). Long-term efficacy was also assessed. RESULTS: In total, 53 patients with GD were registered. CRFs were available for 41 (77.4%) patients at the 6-year interim analysis. Fourteen adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in seven patients. All reported ADRs occurred in patients with type 2 GD. ADRs were reported by 63.6% (7/11) of patients with type 2 GD. Ten ADRs were reported in five patients aged < 4 years. No elderly patients experienced any ADR during the surveillance period. Five ADRs occurring in three (10.0%) patients were classified as IRRs, with one case of vomiting (moderate severity) resulting in treatment discontinuation. Ten serious adverse events were reported in five (16.7%) patients. Three fatal events were considered to be unrelated to treatment with velaglucerase alfa. Platelet counts increased after the administration of velaglucerase alfa and were generally maintained within the normal range over the administration period. Among eleven patients tested for neutralizing anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies, two (18.2%) were assessed as positive results. CONCLUSION: PMS data from patients with types 1-3 GD in Japan indicate that long-term treatment with velaglucerase alfa was well-tolerated and associated with increased platelet counts, which is consistent with observations made in studies outside of Japan.

    "abstract": "From ancient times, studies on herbal medicine and pharmacognosy have increased gradually worldwide, due to the increased side effects, adverse drug reactions, and charge lines of modern medicines. Plants are well known for their medicinal effects and nutritional values. They contain bioactive compounds which display a wide spectrum of therapeutic effects. Gaucher's disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessively inherited metabolic disorder caused due to the defect in Glucosylceramidase beta gene coding for the enzyme acid-β-glucosidase in humans. We revealed the profound binding efficiency of five selected bioactive compounds from different plants against the main enzyme acid-β-glucosidase responsible for GD through molecular docking. An in silico approach along with the ADMET profiles of phytocompounds was done using the Schrodinger software. The preventive measure of GD leads to side effects, inaccessible and unaffordable which put forth the emergence of phytocompounds which have fewer toxic effects, and one such compound is β-D-Glucopyranose with the best docking score (-10.28 kcal/mol) and an excellent binding affinity than other ligands, which could be further analyzed for stability using molecular dynamics study and in vitro. Being a dietary supplement, these compounds could be prepared in any form of formulation as a drug."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by β-glucosidase enzyme deficiency and substrate accumulation, especially in cells of the reticuloendothelial system. Typical features of the disease are the unrestrained activation of inflammatory mechanisms, whose molecular pathways are still unclear. To investigate biological mechanisms underlying the macrophage activation in GD, we derived iPSCs from a healthy donor and a GD patient line and differentiated them into hematopoietic progenitors. While GD iPSCs are able to efficiently give rise to CD33+/CD45+ myeloid progenitors, the maturation towards the CD14+/CD163+ monocyte/macrophages fate resulted enhanced in the GD lines, that in addition displayed a decreased growth potential compared to control cells either in semisolid or in liquid culture. The GD lines growth impairment was associated with a significant upregulation of RIPK3 and MLKL, two key effectors of necroptosis, the inflammation related cell death pathway. The activation of necroptosis, which has already been linked to neuronopathic GD, may play a role in the disease proinflammatory condition and in the identified cell growth defects. Understanding the GD macrophage role in the alteration of mechanisms linked to cellular metabolism imbalance, cell death and inflammation are crucial in identifying new ways to approach the disease."

Physical examination was remarkable for dysmorphism including plagiocephaly, low set and abnormally shaped ears, up slanted palpebral fissures, hypoplastic alae nasi, and a head circumference two standard deviations below the 3<sup>rd</sup> percentile (microcephaly). Other characteristics include wrinkled skin, a broad forehead, sparse eyelashes in lower eyelid, short palpebral fissures, upturned nares, thick lips, right occipital plagiocephaly, overfolded helix and prominent anti-helix, protuberant chest, scaphoid abdomen, digitalized thumbs, and kyphosis due to low muscle tone. The patient presented abnormal EEG with evidence of epileptic discharges. A temporal bone CT showed plagiocephaly with flattening of the right occipital bone. Brain MRI showed callosal agenesis with bilateral colpocephaly with temporal horn dilatation, parahippocampal atrophy, lissencephaly and midbrain hypoplasia. The combination of <i>de novo</i> gene variants mentioned above has never been reported nor correlated as the result of haploinsufficiency mechanisms.

Moreover, it is even involved in the central nervous system. GD is classified into three phenotypes on the ground of neurologic involvement: type 1 (GD1), the commonly adult-onset, non-neuropathic variant; type 2 (GD2), the acute neuropathic form; and type 3 (GD3), the severe chronic neuro-visceral form. Recently, several studies have shown a promising outcome of ambroxol chaperone therapy for the treatment of GD, but its therapeutic role in GD1-associated liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension was not verified. A 36-year-old male patient was admitted for esophageal varices lasting for one year with a 34-year history of liver and spleen enlargement. The patient was diagnosed with GD1 with cirrhosis and portal hypertension based on the identification of Gaucher cells and advanced fibrosis in the liver biopsy tissue and two known pathogenic mutations on the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene. The patient received 660 mg/d of ambroxol for up to two years. At his six-month follow- up, the patient exhibited a remarkable increase in GBA activity (+35.5%) and decrease in liver stiffness (-19.5%) and portal vein diameter (-41.2%) as examined by ultrasound elastography and computer tomography, respectively. At two-year follow-up, the liver stiffness was further reduced (-55.5%) in comparison with untreated patients.

A meta-analysis was also performed. Of 1601 articles identified, 22 were included. Studies were heterogeneous and with very low certainty of evidence for most outcomes. The following outcomes showed improvements associated with GAA ERT, over a mean follow-up of 32.5 months: distance walked in the 6-min walking test (6MWT) (mean change 35.7 m (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.78, 63.75)), physical domain of the SF-36 quality of life (QOL) questionnaire (mean change 1.96 (95% CI 0.33, 3.59)), and time on ventilation (TOV) (mean change -2.64 h (95% CI -5.28, 0.00)). There were no differences between the pre- and post-ERT period for functional vital capacity (FVC), Walton and Gardner-Medwin Scale score, upper-limb strength, or total SF-36 QOL score. Adverse events (AEs) after ERT were mild in most cases. Considering the limitations imposed by the rarity of PD, our data suggest that GAA ERT improves 6MWT, physical QOL, and TOV in LOPD patients.

Larger nigral echogenic areas and reduced striatal K<sub>i</sub> were exclusively observed in parkinsonian patients. Sonographic and PET measurements showed strong inverse correlations but only in individuals with clinical parkinsonism. Close correspondence between nigral echogenicity and striatal presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity observed only in GBA1 carriers with parkinsonism provides validation that these two modalities may conjointly capture aspects of the biology underlying clinical parkinsonism but raises questions about their utility as predictive tools in at-risk subjects. © 2022 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."

    "title": "Lipid-mimicking phosphorus-based glycosidase inactivators as pharmacological chaperones for the treatment of Gaucher's disease.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher's disease, the most prevalent lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by missense mutation of the GBA gene, ultimately resulting in deficient GCase activity, hence the excessive build-up of cellular glucosylceramide. Among different therapeutic strategies, pharmacological chaperoning of mutant GCase represents an attractive approach that relies on small organic molecules acting as protein stabilizers. Herein, we expand upon a new class of transient GCase inactivators based on a reactive 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-glucoside tethered to an array of lipid-mimicking phosphorus-based aglycones, which not only improve the selectivity and inactivation efficiency, but also the stability of these compounds in aqueous media. This hypothesis was further validated with kinetic and cellular studies confirming restoration of catalytic activity in Gaucher cells after treatment with these pharmacological chaperones."

    "abstract": "Biallelic mutations in the GBA1 gene encoding glucocerebrosidase cause Gaucher's disease, whereas heterozygous carriers are at risk for Parkinson's disease (PD). Glucosylsphingosine is a clinically meaningful biomarker of Gaucher's disease but could not be assayed previously in heterozygous GBA1 carriers. The aim of this study was to assess plasma glucosylsphingosine levels in GBA1 N370S carriers with and without PD. Glucosylsphingosine, glucosylceramide, and four other lipids were quantified in plasma from N370S heterozygotes with (n = 20) or without (n = 20) PD, healthy controls (n = 20), idiopathic PD (n = 20), and four N370S homozygotes (positive controls; Gaucher's/PD) using quantitative ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma glucosylsphingosine was significantly higher in N370S heterozygotes compared with noncarriers, independent of disease status. As expected, Gaucher's/PD cases showed increases in both glucocerebrosidase substrates, glucosylsphingosine and glucosylceramide. Plasma glucosylsphingosine accumulation in N370S heterozygotes shown in this study opens up its future assessment as a clinically meaningful biomarker of GBA1-PD. © 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."

The involvement of ACE in regulation of blood pressure forms its central action but it has a role to play in a variety of physiological processes occurring in the organs in which it is localized like the lungs, macrophages, brain, pancreas, liver etc. It has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases including COVID-19. More studies need to be carried out in order to validate the use of ACE levels in the diagnosis and monitoring of the diseases associated, and facilitate the use of ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers in the management of the same, so this wonder molecule can be utilized to its full potential."

We report here the case of a 31-year-old male Japanese patient with Gaucher disease who switched from enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to substrate reducing therapy (SRT). Liver dysfunction was identified at a routine medical checkup, and the patient was referred to our hospital with \"idiopathic liver disease.\" Clinical laboratory tests indicated thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly, which are characteristic symptoms of Gaucher disease. To definitively diagnose Gaucher disease, a bone marrow biopsy and acid β-glucosidase activity measurement were conducted; the results supported a diagnosis of Gaucher disease. This case emphasizes that it is possible for periodic medical checkups in adults to lead to the diagnosis of rare genetic disorders. The patient underwent ERT treatment with imiglucerase for 5 years; the platelet count rapidly increased and the spleen size rapidly decreased, indicating a good response to the drug. However, the patient increasingly felt the burden of visiting the hospital for 2 h of infusion ERT every 2 weeks. Consequently, it was jointly decided that he should switch from ERT to SRT with an oral drug. This switch was successful with no deterioration of laboratory data. This case report is the first to describe a Japanese Gaucher disease patient treated with eliglustat for >2 years. We showed that SRT is a well-tolerated and effective option for the treatment of Gaucher disease."

    "title": "Cellular and biochemical response to chaperone versus substrate reduction therapies in neuropathic Gaucher disease.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by deficiency of the lysosomal membrane enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) and the subsequent accumulation of its substrate, glucosylceramide (GC). Mostly missense mutations of the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) cause GCase misfolding and inhibition of proper lysosomal trafficking. The accumulated GC leads to lysosomal dysfunction and impairs the autophagy pathway. GD types 2 and 3 (GD2-3), or the neuronopathic forms, affect not only the Central Nervous System (CNS) but also have severe systemic involvement and progressive bone disease. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) successfully treats the hematologic manifestations; however, due to the lack of equal distribution of the recombinant enzyme in different organs, it has no direct impact on the nervous system and has minimal effect on bone involvement. Small molecules have the potential for better tissue distribution. Ambroxol (AMB) is a pharmacologic chaperone that partially recovers the mutated GCase activity and crosses the blood-brain barrier. Eliglustat (EGT) works by inhibiting UDP-glucosylceramide synthase, an enzyme that catalyzes GC biosynthesis, reducing GC influx load into the lysosome. Substrate reduction therapy (SRT) using EGT is associated with improvement in GD bone marrow burden score and bone mineral density parallel with the improvement in hematological parameters. We assessed the effects of EGT and AMB on GCase activity and autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) in primary cell lines derived from patients with GD2-3 and compared to cell lines from healthy controls. We found that EGT, same as AMB, enhanced GCase activity in control cells and that an individualized response, that varied with GBA mutations, was observed in cells from patients with GD2-3. EGT and AMB enhanced the formation of lysosomal/late endosomal compartments and improved autophagy, independent of GBA mutations. Both AMB and EGT increased mitochondrial mass and density in GD2-3 fibroblasts, suggesting enhancement of mitochondrial function by activating the mitochondrial membrane potential. These results demonstrate that EGT and AMB, with different molecular mechanisms of action, enhance GCase activity and improve autophagy-lysosome dynamics and mitochondrial functions."

The most frequent symptoms are asthenia, spleen and liver enlargement, bone abnormalities and cytopenia due to bone marrow infiltration. Lung involvement in GD is a rare finding, and it is unclear whether it may regress under enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT).

Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD) is the most common type of GD diagnosed in adulthood, and is characterized by great clinical heterogeneity.Pulmonary involvement is rare, mostly characterized by infiltrative lung disease and pulmonary hypertension, and typically unresponsive to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT).Type 1 GD should be included in the differential diagnosis of infiltrative lung disease of unclear origin in patients with cytopenia and/or splenomegaly.Infiltrative lung disease due to type 1 GD may respond to ERT even in elderly patients."

However, it's prevalence among Gaucher population, clinical implications and potential biomarkers are unknown. Hence this study aims to assess the prevalence of ALN among children with GD & to correlate it to neutrophil-lymphocytic-ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocytic-ratio (PLR) and glucosylsphingosine (Lyso-GL1). Fifty children with GD (14 type-1 and 36 type-3) on enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT) were compared to 50 matched healthy controls, focusing on history of pressure manifestations by ALN (diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction), and history of splenectomy, with calculation of severity scoring index (SSI). NLR, PLR and Lyso-GL1 were measured. Abdominal-ultrasound was done with assessment of liver and spleen volumes and ALN. CT-scan was done for those having significant lymphadenopathy. Twenty-six children with GD had ALN (52%). The most common presentations were abdominal-pain (22%) & constipation (18%), with intestinal-obstruction in 3 children (6%). Children with GD had significantly higher NLR (<i>p</i> < .001) and decreased PLR (<i>p</i> = .024) compared to controls. Interestingly, children with GD having ALN had significantly higher SSI (.012), Lyso-GL1 (<i>p</i> = .002) and NLR (<i>p</i> = .001) than those without ALN. Multivariate-logistic regression showed that ALN was independently related to Lyso-GL1 (<i>p</i> = .027), NLR (<i>p</i> = .023) and SSI (<i>p</i> = .032). Thus, ALN is a prevalent GD morbidity with wide clinical-spectrum ranging from asymptomatic cases to intestinal obstruction. ALN is related to SSI, NLR and Lyso-GL1 in children with GD.HighlightsChildren with GD had significantly higher NLR and lower PLR compared to controls.Children with GD having ALN had significantly higher SSI, Lyso-GL1 and NLR than those without ALN.ALN was independently related to Lyso-GL1, NLR and SSI in children with GD."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder that is divided into three subtypes based on presentation of neurological manifestations. Distinguishing between the types has important implications for treatment and counseling. Yet, patients with neuronopathic forms of GD, types 2 and 3, often present at young ages and can have overlapping phenotypes. It has been shown that new technologies employing artificial intelligence and facial recognition software can assist with dysmorphology assessments. Though classically not associated nor previously described with a dysmorphic facial phenotype, this study investigated whether a facial recognition platform could distinguish between photos of patients with GD2 and GD3 and discriminate between them and photos of healthy controls. Each cohort included over 100 photos. A cross validation scheme including a series of binary comparisons between groups was used. Outputs included a composite photo of each cohort and either a receiver operating characteristic curve or a confusion matrix. Binary comparisons showed that the software could correctly group photos at least 89% of the time. Multiclass comparison between GD2, GD3, and healthy controls demonstrated a mean accuracy of 76.6%, compared to a 37.7% chance for random comparison. Both GD2 and GD3 have now been added to the facial recognition platform as established syndromes that can be identified by the algorithm. These results suggest that facial recognition and artificial intelligence, though no substitute for other diagnostic methods, may aid in the recognition of neuronopathic GD. The algorithm, in concert with other clinical features, also appears to distinguish between young patients with GD2 and GD3, suggesting that this tool can help facilitate earlier implementation of appropriate management."

To inform clinical decision-making and improve pathophysiological understanding, we characterized the course of Gaucher disease and explored the influence of costly innovative medication and other interventions. Retrospective and prospective clinical, laboratory and radiological information including molecular analysis of the GBA1 gene and comprising > 2500 variables were collected systematically into a relational database with banking of collated biological samples in a central bioresource. Data for deep phenotyping and life-quality evaluation, including skeletal, visceral, haematological and neurological manifestations were recorded for a median of 17.3 years; the skeletal and neurological manifestations are the main focus of this study. At baseline, 223 of the 250 patients were classified as type 1 Gaucher disease. Skeletal manifestations occurred in most patients in the cohort (131 of 201 specifically reported bone pain). Symptomatic osteonecrosis and fragility fractures occurred respectively in 76 and 37 of all 250 patients and the first osseous events occurred significantly earlier in those with neuronopathic disease. Intensive phenotyping in a subgroup of 40 patients originally considered to have only systemic features, revealed neurological involvement in 18: two had Parkinson disease and 16 had clinical signs compatible with neuronopathic Gaucher disease-indicating a greater than expected prevalence of neurological features. Analysis of longitudinal real-world data enabled Gaucher disease to be stratified with respect to advanced therapies and splenectomy. Splenectomy was associated with an increased hazard of fragility fractures, in addition to osteonecrosis and orthopaedic surgery; there were marked gender differences in fracture risk over time since splenectomy. Skeletal disease was a heavy burden of illness, especially where access to specific therapy was delayed and in patients requiring orthopaedic surgery. Gaucher disease has been explored using real-world data obtained in an era of therapeutic transformation. Introduction of advanced therapies and repeated longitudinal measures enabled this heterogeneous condition to be stratified into obvious clinical endotypes. The study reveals diverse and changing phenotypic manifestations with systemic, skeletal and neurological disease as inter-related sources of disability."

    "abstract": "Elevated serum chitotriosidase (CHITO) is an indication of macrophage activation, and its capacity have been explored as a marker of inflammation in a number of disease states. For over a decade, CHITO plasma levels have been used by clinicians as a biomarker of inflammation in the lysosomal disease, Gaucher disease, including monitoring response to therapies in patients with Gaucher disease type I. Although it is becoming increasingly recognized that inflammation is a prominent component of many lysosomal diseases, the relation of CHITO levels to disease burden has not been well-characterized in the large majority of lysosomal diseases. Moreover, the role of CHITO in lysosomal diseases that affect the central nervous system (CNS) has not been systematically studied. In this study, one hundred and thirty-four specimens of CSF and serum were collected from 34 patients with lysosomal diseases affecting the CNS. This study included patients with GM1-gangliosidosis, GM2-gangliosidosis, mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), multiple sulfatase deficiency and Gaucher disease. CHITO levels in the CSF were significantly higher in patients with more rapidly progressing severe neurological impairment: GM1-gangliosidosis vs MPS (<i>p</i> < 0.0001); GM2-gangliosidosis vs MPS (p < 0.0001). CHITO levels were higher in patients with the more severe phenotypes compared to milder phenotypes in GM1-gangliosidosis and GM2-gangliosidosis (serum CHITO in GM1-gangliosidosis infantile vs juvenile <i>p</i> = 0.025; CSF CHITO in Tay-Sachs infantile vs Tay-Sachs late-onset <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Moreover, higher CHITO levels in the CSF were significantly associated with lower cognitive test scores in patients with GM1-gangliosidosis, GM2-gangliosidosis, and MPS (<i>p</i> = 1.12*10<sup>-5</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.72). Patients with infantile GM1-gangliosidosis showed increasing CSF CHITO over time, suggesting that CSF CHITO reflects disease progression and a possible surrogate endpoint for future clinical trials with infantile GM1-gangliosidosis. In summary, these results support the use of CSF CHITO to diagnose between different disease phenotypes and as a valuable tool for monitoring disease progression in patients. These results necessitate the inclusion of CHITO as an exploratory biomarker for clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Impairment in glucocerebrosidase (GCase) is strongly associated with the development of Parkinson's disease (PD), yet the regulators responsible for its impairment remain elusive. In this paper, we identify the E3 ligase Thyroid Hormone Receptor Interacting Protein 12 (TRIP12) as a key regulator of GCase. TRIP12 interacts with and ubiquitinates GCase at lysine 293 to control its degradation via ubiquitin proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitinated GCase by TRIP12 leads to its functional impairment through premature degradation and subsequent accumulation of α-synuclein. TRIP12 overexpression causes mitochondrial dysfunction, which is ameliorated by GCase overexpression. Further, conditional TRIP12 knockout in vitro and knockdown in vivo promotes the expression of GCase, which blocks α-synuclein preformed fibrils (α-syn PFFs)-provoked dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Moreover, TRIP12 accumulates in human PD brain and α-synuclein-based mouse models. The identification of TRIP12 as a regulator of GCase provides a new perspective on the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunctional GCase-driven neurodegeneration in PD."

Retinal layers in 19 patients with PKU, 15 patients with GD3, and 93 healthy individuals were measured using peripapillary ring scan and macular SD-OCT. Linear mixed models were computed including an adjustment for age, sex, and spherical equivalent. We calculated Spearman's rank correlations between retinal layer measurements and clinical and/or laboratory parameters. Thinning of total retinal thickness was found in the macular inner ring (p = 0.002), and outer ring (p = 0.012), sparing the fovea (p = 0.12) in PKU, while in GD3, all subfields were thinned (fovea p < 0.001, inner ring p = 0.047, outer ring 0.07). In both conditions, thinning was most evident in the NFL, GCL, and IPL, while OPL (outer plexiform layer) was thickened. Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer measurements remained normal. GCL and IPL in PKU correlated with tyrosine serum concentration. Thinning of the NFL, GCL, and IPL, with thickened OPL, are both found in PKU and in GD3. Low dopamine concentrations in the retina might promote these effects. However, these data do not give evidence that retinal measurements can be used as a biomarker for disease severity in patients with GD3."

GBA1 variants are linked to a reduction in GCase activity in the brain. Variants in Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2), such as the gain-of-kinase-function variant G2019S, cause the most common familial form of PD. In patients without GBA1 and LRRK2 mutations, GCase and LRRK2 activity are also altered, suggesting that these two genes are implicated in all forms of PD and that they may play a broader role in PD pathogenesis. In this review, we review the proposed roles of GBA1 and LRRK2 in PD, focussing on the endolysosomal pathway. In particular, we highlight the discovery of Ras-related in brain (Rab) guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) as LRRK2 kinase substrates and explore the links between increased LRRK2 activity and Rab protein function, lysosomal dysfunction, alpha-synuclein accumulation and GCase activity. We also discuss the discovery of RAB10 as a potential mediator of LRRK2 and GBA1 interaction in PD. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic implications of these findings, including current approaches and future perspectives related to novel drugs targeting LRRK2 and GBA1."

However, no hemophagocytosis was noted in the bone marrow aspirate or trephine biopsy. Instead, it showed aggregates of large histiocyte-like cells, scattered erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes. These cells were confused to be some form of storage cells, but did not resemble storage cells seen in Gaucher's disease or Niemann Pick disease. Myeloid precursors were very few in number. Reticular dysgenesis was not suspected during admission due to a lack of awareness of this entity. Testing for sensorineural deafness in neonates with severe agranulocytosis and lymphopenia would facilitate an early diagnosis of reticular dysgenesis. To the best of our knowledge, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis has not been previously reported in association with reticular dysgenesis."

The use of CRISPR to \"design\" the outcomes of biology is challenged by both specialized ethicists and the general public. Less of a focus, however, is the ability of CRISPR to provide metabolic supplements or prophylactic molecules that improve long-term human health by overwriting ancient evolutionary events. Here, we use CRISPR to genomically integrate a functional uricase gene that encodes an enzymatically active protein into the human genome. These uricase-producing cells are able to reduce or even eliminate high concentrations of exogenous uric acid despite the enzyme being localized to peroxisomes. Our evolutionary engineered cells represent the first instance of the primate ape lineage expressing a functional uricase encoded in the genome within the last 20 million years. We anticipate that human cells expressing uricase will help prevent hyperuricemia (including gout) as well as hypertension and will help protect against fatty liver disease in the future."

Several COVID-19 vaccines are being developed using different production systems, including plants, which promises the production of cheap, safe, stable, and effective vaccines. The potential of a plant-based system for rapid production at a commercial scale and for a quick response to an infectious disease outbreak has been demonstrated by the marketing of carrot-cell-produced taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso) for Gaucher disease and tobacco-produced monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp) for the 2014 Ebola outbreak.

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by bi-allelic <i>GBA1</i> mutations that reduce the activity of the lysosomal enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). GCase catalyzes the conversion of glucosylceramide (GluCer), a ubiquitous glycosphingolipid, to glucose and ceramide. GCase deficiency causes the accumulation of GluCer and its metabolite glucosylsphingosine (GluSph) in a number of tissues and organs. In the immune system, GCase deficiency deregulates signal transduction events, resulting in an inflammatory environment. It is known that the complement system promotes inflammation, and complement inhibitors are currently being considered as a novel therapy for GD; however, the mechanism by which complement drives systemic macrophage-mediated inflammation remains incompletely understood. To help understand the mechanisms involved, we used human GD-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived macrophages. We found that GD macrophages exhibit exacerbated production of inflammatory cytokines via an innate immune response mediated by receptor 1 for complement component C5a (C5aR1). Quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA assays showed that in the presence of recombinant C5a (rC5a), GD macrophages secreted 8-10-fold higher levels of TNF-α compared to rC5a-stimulated control macrophages. PMX53, a C5aR1 blocker, reversed the enhanced GD macrophage TNF-α production, indicating that the observed effect was predominantly C5aR1-mediated. To further analyze the extent of changes induced by rC5a stimulation, we performed gene array analysis of the rC5a-treated macrophage transcriptomes. We found that rC5a-stimulated GD macrophages exhibit increased expression of genes involved in TNF-α inflammatory responses compared to rC5a-stimulated controls. Our results suggest that rC5a-induced inflammation in GD macrophages activates a unique immune response, supporting the potential use of inhibitors of the C5a-C5aR1 receptor axis to mitigate the chronic inflammatory abnormalities associated with GD."

GZ452 treatment improved mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption rate. Furthermore, GZ452 diminished hyperactivity of selected proteins in the mTORC1 pathway and improved cell proliferation of <i>Gba</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons. These findings reinforce the detrimental effects of substrate accumulation on mitochondria, autophagy, and mTOR in neurons. A novel rescuing mechanism of SRT was revealed on the function of mitochondrial and autophagy-lysosomal pathways in GD. These results point to mitochondria and the mTORC1 complex as potential therapeutic targets for treatment of GD."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by inherited deficiencies in β-glucocerebrosidase (GBA). Current treatments require rapid disease diagnosis and a means of monitoring therapeutic efficacy, both of which may be supported by the use of GBA-targeting activity-based probes (ABPs). Here, we report the synthesis and structural analysis of a range of cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine inhibitors and ABPs for GBA. We demonstrate their covalent mechanism-based mode of action and uncover binding of the new N-functionalised aziridines to the ligand binding cleft. These inhibitors became scaffolds for the development of ABPs; the O6-fluorescent tags of which bind in an allosteric site at the dimer interface. Considering GBA's preference for O6- and N-functionalised reagents, a bi-functional aziridine ABP was synthesized as a potentially more powerful imaging agent. Whilst this ABP binds to two unique active site clefts of GBA, no further benefit in potency was achieved over our first generation ABPs. Nevertheless, such ABPs should serve useful in the study of GBA in relation to GD and inform the design of future probes."

    "abstract": "Neurometabolic diseases are complex group of rare neurogenetic disorders, which are difficult to diagnose. Patients may have toxic metabolite accumulation, inadequate energy supply, or neurotransmitter deficiency, resulting in a variety of clinical manifestations and severity with enzyme activity or transporter function defects. Multiple organ involvement is frequently seen, among which neurological symptoms and signs are one of the most encountered problems. Ocular motor problems deserve special attention for it occurs in some inborn error of metabolism. Furthermore, some are early signs or characteristic findings of certain diseases, such as the gaze palsy in Niemann-Pick disease type C and Gaucher disease or oculogyric crisis in neurotransmitter diseases. Early recognition and intervention are important for better prognosis in treatable neurometabolic disorders. In addition, ways to evaluate and describe eye movement problems also help to demonstrate the severity or clinical progression for those diagnosed with certain neurometabolic diseases. However, the complexity of eye movement and ocular motor control renders our clinical observation, recording and even anatomic localization of abnormal eye movements. Clinicians are more likely to detect early signs and unravel problems by gaining awareness of abnormal eye movement. This study amied to approach neurometabolic diseases in children via eye motor manifestations."

With over 26 million births occurring per annum, extrapolation of this figure would give us an estimated burden of 17,000 babies born with lysosomal storage disorder (LSD). Given the large population of India and the high rates of consanguineous marriage that takes place in the subcontinent, LSD might not be as rare as we perceive it to be. We report a rare occurrence of type-1 Gaucher's disease in an adult female patient born of a non-consanguineous marriage, belonging to the tropical area of Chhattisgarh, India where there is a predominance of malaria, thalassemia, and sickling. The diagnosis was challenging in this case since we needed to work out all the differential diagnoses of pancytopenia with hepatomegaly and massive splenomegaly. The key part was her medical history where there was documentation of her elder brother's death due to some mental illness of undiagnosed etiology. Being a difficult time due to coronavirus disease 2019 (‎ COVID-19)‎, we were able to diagnose the patient with a bone marrow biopsy followed by glucocerebrosidase enzyme level suggestive of Gaucher's disease."

    "abstract": "Homozygotic mutations in the GBA gene cause Gaucher's disease; moreover, both patients and heterozygotic carriers have been associated with 20- to 30-fold increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease. In homozygosis, these mutations impair the activity of β-glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme encoded by GBA, and generate a lysosomal disorder in macrophages, which changes morphology towards an engorged phenotype, considered the hallmark of Gaucher's disease. Notwithstanding the key role of macrophages in this disease, most of the effects in the brain have been attributed to the β-glucocerebrosidase deficit in neurons, while a microglial phenotype for these mutations has never been reported. We applied the bioluminescence imaging technology, immunohistochemistry and gene expression analysis to investigate the consequences of microglial β-glucocerebrosidase inhibition in the brain of reporter mice, in primary neuron/microglia cocultures and in cell lines. The use of primary cells from reporter mice allowed for the first time, to discriminate in cocultures neuronal from microglial responses consequent to the β-glucocerebrosidase inhibition; results were finally confirmed by pharmacological depletion of microglia from the brain of mice. Our data demonstrate the existence of a novel neuroprotective mechanism mediated by a direct microglia-to-neuron contact supported by functional actin structures. This cellular contact stimulates the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 activity in neurons, a key signal involved in drug detoxification, redox balance, metabolism, autophagy, lysosomal biogenesis, mitochondrial dysfunctions, and neuroinflammation. The central role played by microglia in this neuronal response in vivo was proven by depletion of the lineage in the brain of reporter mice. Pharmacological inhibition of microglial β-glucocerebrosidase was proven to induce morphological changes, to turn on an anti-inflammatory/repairing pathway, and to hinder the microglia ability to activate the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 response, thus increasing the neuronal susceptibility to neurotoxins. This mechanism provides a possible explanation for the increased risk of neurodegeneration observed in carriers of GBA mutations and suggest novel therapeutic strategies designed to revert the microglial phenotype associated with β-glucocerebrosidase inhibition, aimed at resetting the protective microglia-to-neuron communication."

Here, we establish a chemogenetic dopamine (DA) neuron ablation model in larval zebrafish with mitochondrial dysfunction and robustness suitable for high-content screening. We use this system to conduct an in vivo DA neuron imaging-based chemical screen and identify the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) inhibitors as significantly neuroprotective. Knockdown of the angiotensin receptor 1 (<i>agtr1</i>) in DA neurons reveals a cell-autonomous mechanism of neuroprotection. DA neuron-specific RNA-seq identifies mitochondrial pathway gene expression that is significantly restored by RAAS inhibitor treatment. The neuroprotective effect of RAAS inhibitors is further observed in a zebrafish Gaucher disease model and <i>Drosophila pink1</i>-deficient PD model. Finally, examination of clinical data reveals a significant effect of RAAS inhibitors in delaying PD progression. Our findings reveal the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of targeting the RAAS pathway for neuroprotection and demonstrate a salient approach that bridges basic science to translational medicine."

We perform a structural analysis of variants within three inherited lysosomal storage disorders, comparing variants responsive to pharmacological chaperone treatment to those unresponsive to such treatment. We find that predicted ΔΔG of mutation is higher on average for variants unresponsive to treatment, in the case of datasets for both Fabry disease and Pompe disease, in line with previous findings. Using both a single decision tree and an advanced machine learning approach based on the larger Fabry dataset, we correctly predict responsiveness of three Gaucher disease variants, and we provide predictions for untested variants. Many variants are predicted to be responsive to treatment, suggesting that drug-based treatments may be effective for a number of variants in Gaucher disease. In our analysis, we observe dependence on a topological feature reporting on contact arrangements which is likely connected to the order of folding of protein residues, and we provide a potential justification for this observation based on steady-state cellular kinetics."

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and related neurodegenerative disorders, termed the synucleinopathies, are characterized pathologically by the accumulation of protein aggregates containing α-synuclein (aSyn), resulting in progressive neuronal loss. There is considerable need for the development of neuroprotective strategies to halt or slow disease progression in these disorders. To this end, evaluation of genetic mutations associated with the synucleinopathies has helped to elucidate crucial mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, revealing key roles for lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction. The GBA1 gene, which encodes the lysosomal hydrolase β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) is the most common genetic risk factor for PD and is also linked to other neurodegenerative disorders including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Additionally, homozygous mutations in GBA1 are associated with the rare lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher's disease (GD). In this review, we discuss the current knowledge in the field regarding the diverse roles of GCase in neurons and the multifactorial effects of loss of GCase enzymatic activity. Importantly, GCase has been shown to have a bidirectional relationship with aSyn, resulting in a pathogenic feedback loop that can lead to progressive aSyn accumulation. Alterations in GCase activity have furthermore been linked to multiple distinct pathways involved in neurodegeneration, and therefore GCase has emerged as a promising target for therapeutic drug development for PD and related neurodegenerative disorders, particularly DLB."

She was first diagnosed accidentally with enlarged spleen during a pediatric examination when she was three years old, but the family ignored investigations; she was hospitalized for diagnosis at six years old. The GD was confirmed based on: clinical manifestations of left abdominal flank pain, multiple bruising, general weakness, bone pain, low appetite, failure to thrive <5<sup>th</sup> percentile, minor hepato- and severe splenomegaly, enlarged submaxillary lymph nodes, associated by anemia with normal platelets; low activity of beta-Glucosidase, two found mutations in <i>GBA</i> gene, Gaucher cells in bone marrow. The ERT was initiated with Imiglucerase (54 UI/kg/2 wks) two years later after diagnosis, avoiding the splenectomy. Subsequently, the platelets showed the first a promising result, gradually increasing their number every 2 weeks and maintaining it in good parameters till the reported moment (2.5 yrs from the start). The hemoglobin level was appreciated within normal ranges 3 months after ERT start and stabilized completely after 6 months. On the other hand, the red blood count normalized within 20 months of applied therapy. The Lyso-GL-1 decreased by 30% after three months of therapy, no antibodies to Imiglucerase were found. The initial spleen volume (1178.19 cm<sup>3</sup>) decreased by almost 60% in 6 months of ERT, reaching absolutely normal dimensions after 9 months. The ERT with Imiglucerase was tolerated very well by the patient, showing a clear improvement of clinical symptoms after 4-6 months of therapy, hematological picture and splenomegaly solving. Even if the little patient had to come every 2 weeks for infusion, her quality of life improved a lot, being a totally happy child, going to school and having friends. The ERT should be initiated immediately after diagnosis to prevent the multisystem complications."

This study aimed to provide a clinically relevant quantitative assessment of platelet function and determine its relationship with bleeding and GD-related data. Unstimulated and stimulated platelet function was measured by whole blood flow cytometry of platelet surface-activated αIIbβ3 integrin (detected with monoclonal antibody PAC1), P-selectin (CD62P), and lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP3/CD63) in 149 GD patients. GD patients had a higher level of unstimulated CD63 expression than healthy subjects, which was mildly correlated with glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1) levels (<i>r</i> = 0.17, <i>p</i>-value = 0.042). Splenectomized GD patients had a higher level of unstimulated αIIbβ3 integrin and P-selectin expression. Reduced platelet reactivity (-2 standard deviation of reference range) was found in 79 (53%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 44-61%) patients, of whom 10 (6.7%, 95% CI: 3.3-12%) had more severe platelet dysfunction. In a multivariate model, only lyso-Gb1 levels were associated with the more severe platelet dysfunction. Fifty-four (49%) of 128 adult patients who completed the bleeding tendency questionnaire reported positive bleeding history. In a multivariate logistic model, older age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.1) and low P-selectin reactivity (OR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.25-3.35) were associated with more than one bleeding manifestation. Flow cytometry enables the study of platelet function in thrombocytopenic GD patients. A platelet degranulation defect, but not αIIbβ3 integrin activation defect, is associated with clinical bleeding. In vivo increased CD63 expression may be related to GD-related inflammation."

Both types were represented equally (GD1/GD3 = 20/18). L444P (35.5%) was the most common mutant allele while L444P/L444P (34.2%) was the most common genotype overall. Compound heterozygosity of N370S and L444P homozygosity were the dominant genotypes in Turkish children with GD1 and GD3, respectively. None of the patients had moderate to severe thrombocytopenia at last follow-up while the percent of patients with anemia decreased from 60% to 5.7% (p < 0.001). Significant improvements in mean liver (from 2.2 to 1.6 MN, p < 0.001) and spleen (from 15.5 to 7.6 MN, p < 0.001) volumes were observed in the first year of ERT. Linear growth was ameliorated as shown by the decrease in the percent of patients having short stature from 34.3% to 13.3% (p < 0.01) at year 5. Erlenmeyer flask deformity, osteopenia and scoliosis were common skeletal findings. Although none of the patients had lung disease at diagnosis, 20% developed radiological findings suggestive of pulmonary involvement. This single center experience is the first comprehensive study from Turkey not only reporting clinical and genetic characteristics of GD patients but also providing information on the outcomes of ERT in two different sub-types of GD. Genotypic background of Turkish children with GD is similar to western populations. Although visceral and hematological therapeutic goals are reached as early as one year of ERT in both sub-types, achieving normal growth takes several more years than suggested in significant number of children with GD."

Among the numerous clinical manifestations, chronic inflammation has been consistently reported for several LSDs. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the inflammatory response are still not completely understood. In this study, we performed text-mining and systems biology analyses to investigate the inflammatory signals in three LSDs characterized by sphingolipid accumulation: Gaucher disease, Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (ASMD), and Fabry Disease. We first identified the cytokines linked to the LSDs, and then built on the extracted knowledge to investigate the inflammatory signals. We found numerous transcription factors that are putative regulators of cytokine expression in a cell-specific context, such as the signaling axes controlled by STAT2, JUN, and NR4A2 as candidate regulators of the monocyte Gaucher disease cytokine network. Overall, our results suggest the presence of a complex inflammatory signaling in LSDs involving many cellular and molecular players that could be further investigated as putative targets of anti-inflammatory therapies."

    "abstract": "In Gaucher disease (GD), genetic deficiency of acid β-glucosidase leads to accumulation of its substrate glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph). Lipid-laden cells, most prominently seen as macrophages engorged with GlcCer and GlcSph-laden lysosomes, trigger chronic metabolic inflammation and multisystemic phenotypes. Among the pleiotropic effects of inflammatory cascades, the induction of glucosylceramide synthase accentuates the primary metabolic defect. First-line therapies for adults with GD type 1 include Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) and eliglustat Substrate Reduction Therapy (SRT). The ENCORE phase 3 clinical trial of eliglustat demonstrated non-inferiority compared to ERT. It is not known whether switching stable patients from long-term ERT to SRT results in the incremental reversal of the disease phenotype and its surrogate indicators. Herein, we report real-world experience from a single tertiary referral center of 38 adult GD type 1 patients, stable on long-term ERT (mean 13.3 years), who switched to eliglustat SRT (mean 3.1 years). After switch to SRT, there was significant reduction in spleen volume (<i>P</i> = 0.003) while liver volume, which was normal at baseline, remained unchanged. Platelet counts increased significantly (<i>P</i> = 0.026). Concomitantly, there was reduction of three validated biomarkers of Gaucher disease activity: plasma GlcSph decreased from 63.7 ng/ml (95% CI, 37.6-89.8) to 26.1 ng/ml (95% CI, 15.7-36.6) (<i>P</i> < 0.0001); chitotriosidase fell from 1136.6 nmol/ml/h (95% CI, 144.7-2128.6) to 466.9 nmol/ml/h (95% CI, 209.9-723.9) (<i>P</i> = 0.002); and glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma B (gpNMB) decreased from 59.3 ng/ml (95% CI, 39.7-78.9) to 43.6 ng/ml (95% CI, 30.7-56.6) (<i>P</i> = 0.0006). There were no episodes of avascular necrosis or fractures in patients on SRT. Patients reported favorable experiences of switching from alternate week infusions to oral therapy. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the switch to eliglustat SRT from ERT leads to incremental response, even in stable patients after long-term ERT."

In our work we analysed the expression profile of genes in adult patients with type 1 GD. This study was an observational, cross-sectional analysis of a group of twenty patients with type 1 GD and ten healthy volunteers as a control group. First, on the group of ten persons, microarray gene analysis was performed. Afterwards, significantly regulated genes were selected, and the microarray results were confirmed by real-time PCR on the whole study group. Based on the microarray results in the pathway analysis, we focused on genes related to chemokines, inflammatory processes, endocytosis, autophagy, and apoptosis. Patients with GD demonstrated up-regulation of genes related to NFkB pathway (NFkB, NKkBR SQSTM1), inflammation (IL-1b), endocytosis and autophagy (BCN1, SMAD), genes coding proteins involved in apoptosis (CASP, NFkB, BCL2) as well as genes related to proteasome degradation (PSMD2, PSMB9) and SNARE complex (SNAP, STX). Simultaneously, we showed down-regulation of genes coding proteins of chemokines and their receptors (GNB4, CCL5). The qRT-PCR results confirmed changes in expression of selected genes. Parallel microarray results showed inhibition of genes related to neurones development and survival (NTRK1) and stimulation of gene expression related to neurodegeneration and apoptosis (BCN1, IL1B). The work revealed different pathway activation, especially inflammatory processes followed by autophagy and apoptosis. Our results also pay attention to new pathways leading to disorders of the functioning of the nervous tissue in patients with type 1 GD, which may lead to the development of polyneuropathy and chronic pain.

    "abstract": "Urine and plasma biomarker testing for lysosomal storage disorders by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) currently requires multiple analytical methods to detect the abnormal accumulation of oligosaccharides, mucopolysaccharides, and glycolipids. To improve clinical testing efficiency, we developed a single LC-MS method to simultaneously identify disorders of oligosaccharide, mucopolysaccharide, and glycolipid metabolism with minimal sample preparation. We created a single chromatographic method for separating free glycans and glycolipids in their native form, using an amide column and high pH conditions. We used this glycomic profiling method both in untargeted analyses of patient and control urines using LC ion-mobility high-resolution MS (biomarker discovery), and targeted analyses of urine, serum, and dried blood spot samples by LC-MS/MS (clinical validation). Untargeted glycomic profiling revealed twenty biomarkers that could identify and subtype mucopolysaccharidoses. We incorporated these with known oligosaccharide and glycolipid biomarkers into a rapid test that identifies at least 27 lysosomal storage disorders, including oligosaccharidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, sphingolipidoses, glycogen storage disorders, and congenital disorders of glycosylation and de-glycosylation. In a validation set containing 115 urine samples from patients with lysosomal storage disorders, all were unambiguously distinguished from normal controls, with correct disease subtyping for 88% (101/115) of cases. Glucosylsphingosine was reliably elevated in dried blood spots from Gaucher disease patients with baseline resolution from galactosylsphingosine. Glycomic profiling by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry identifies a range of lysosomal storage disorders. This test can be used in clinical evaluations to rapidly focus a diagnosis, as well as to clarify or support additional gene sequencing and enzyme studies."

A total of 31patients, involving 5, 14, 4 and 8 patients with Gaucher, Fabry, Pompe disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis, respectively, were included in analysis. The result showed that only five Gaucher disease (GD) patients in Shanghai used Imiglucerase in 2019, while the other 26 patients with the other three LSDs did not receive ERTs. The total health expenditure of GD patients was 2,273,000CNY on average mainly resulted by the high cost of Imiglucerase. The total health expenditure of the other 26 patients was 37,765CNY on average. Though the cost-sharing mechanism between basic medical insurance, charity fund and patients had been explored for Gaucher disease in Shanghai, the out-of-pocket part, which was 164,301 CNY, still laid a heavy economic burden on the patients and their families. The mean EQ-VAS score of GD patients was 76.4 ± 15.5, which was higher than that of the other three LSDs.

Genetic defects in GBA cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD), and also constitute a risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease. GBA and other retaining glycosidases can be selectively visualized by activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) using fluorescent probes composed of a cyclophellitol scaffold having a configuration tailored to the targeted glycosidase family. GBA processes β-d-xylosides in addition to β-d-glucosides, this in contrast to the other two mammalian cellular retaining β-d-glucosidases, GBA2 and GBA3. Here we show that the xylopyranose preference also holds up for covalent inhibitors: xylose-configured cyclophellitol and cyclophellitol aziridines selectively react with GBA over GBA2 and GBA3 in vitro and in vivo, and that the xylose-configured cyclophellitol is more potent and more selective for GBA than the classical GBA inhibitor, conduritol B-epoxide (CBE). Both xylose-configured cyclophellitol and cyclophellitol aziridine cause accumulation of glucosylsphingosine in zebrafish embryo, a characteristic hallmark of GD, and we conclude that these compounds are well suited for creating such chemically induced GD models."

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) using GCase activity as a trait identified several candidate modifier genes, including <i>Dmrtc2</i> and <i>Arhgef1</i> (p=2.1x10<sup>-7</sup>), and <i>Grik5</i> (p=2.1x10<sup>-7</sup>). Bayesian integration of the gene mapping with transcriptomics was used to build integrative networks. The analysis uncovered additional candidate GCase regulators, highlighting modules of the acute phase response (p=1.01x10<sup>-8</sup>), acute inflammatory response (p=1.01x10<sup>-8</sup>), fatty acid beta-oxidation (p=7.43x10<sup>-5</sup>), among others. Our study revealed previously unknown candidate modulators of GCase activity, which may facilitate the design of therapies for diseases with GCase dysfunction."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder caused by a disturbance in the metabolism of glucocerebroside in the macrophages. Most of its manifestations - hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and bone pain - are amenable to a macrophage-target therapy such as enzyme replacement. However, there is increasing evidence that abnormalities of the liver persist despite the specific GD treatment. In this work, we adapted histomorphometry techniques to the study of hepatocytes in GD using liver tissue of treated patients, developing the first morphometrical method for canalicular quantification in immunohistochemistry-stained liver biopsies, and exploring histomorphometric characteristics of GD. This is the first histomorphometric technique developed for canalicular analysis on histological liver biopsy samples."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of acid β-glucosidase encoded by the GBA gene. In patients with GD, childhood onset parkinsonian features have been rarely described. Twin siblings with GD are described, including clinical follow-up and treatment response. Bone marrow, enzyme activity studies and genotyping were performed. By age 9 months, symptoms at onset were thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly. By age 2, hypokinesia, bradykinesia and oculomotor apraxia were observed. By age 5 a complete rigid hypokinetic syndrome was stablished in both patients, including bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity. Treatment with imiglucerase, miglustat, ambroxol and levodopa were performed. Levodopa showed a good response with improvement in motor and non-motor skills. Foamy cells were found in the bone marrow study. Glucocerebrosidase activity was 28% and 26%. Sanger sequencing analysis identified a missense mutation and a complex allele (NP_000148: p.[(Asp448His)]; [(Leu422Profs*4)]) in compound heterozygosity in GBA gene. Two siblings with neuronopathic GD with an intermediate form between type 2 and 3, with a systemic and neurological phenotype are described. The complex neurological picture included a hypokinetic-rigid and tremor syndrome that improved with levodopa treatment. These conditions together have not been previously described in pediatric GD. We suggest that in children with parkinsonian features, lysosomal storage disorders must be considered, and a levodopa trial must be performed. Moreover, this report give support to the finding that GBA and parkinsonian features share biological pathways and highlight the importance of lysosomal mechanisms in parkinsonism pathogenesis, what might have therapeutic implications."

    "abstract": "Progranulin (PGRN) is a key regulator of lysosomes, and its deficiency has been linked to various lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), including Gaucher disease (GD), one of the most common LSD. Here, we report that PGRN plays a previously unrecognized role in autophagy within the context of GD. PGRN deficiency is associated with the accumulation of LC3-II and p62 in autophagosomes of GD animal model and patient fibroblasts, resulting from the impaired fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. PGRN physically interacted with Rab2, a critical molecule in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Additionally, a fragment of PGRN containing the Grn E domain was required and sufficient for binding to Rab2. Furthermore, this fragment significantly ameliorated PGRN deficiency-associated impairment of autophagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagic flux. These findings not only demonstrate that PGRN is a crucial mediator of autophagosome-lysosome fusion but also provide new evidence indicating PGRN's candidacy as a molecular target for modulating autophagy in GD and other LSDs in general. KEY MESSAGES : PGRN acts as a crucial factor involved in autophagosome-lysosome fusion in GD. PGRN physically interacts with Rab2, a molecule in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. A 15-kDa C-terminal fragment of PGRN is required and sufficient for binding to Rab2. This PGRN derivative ameliorates PGRN deficiency-associated impairment of autophagy. This study provides new insights into autophagy and may develop novel therapy for GD."

    "abstract": "Biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) mutations cause Gaucher disease, whereas heterozygous mutations are numerically the most important genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD) and are associated with the development of other synucleinopathies, notably Dementia with Lewy Bodies. This phenomenon is not limited to GBA, with converging evidence highlighting further examples of autosomal recessive disease genes increasing neurodegeneration risk in heterozygous mutation carriers. Nevertheless, despite extensive research, the cellular mechanisms by which mutations in GBA, encoding lysosomal enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), predispose to neurodegeneration remain incompletely understood. Alpha-synuclein (A-SYN) accumulation, autophagic lysosomal dysfunction, mitochondrial abnormalities, ER stress and neuroinflammation have been proposed as candidate pathogenic pathways in GBA-linked PD. The observation of GCase and A-SYN interactions in PD initiated the development and evaluation of GCase-targeted therapeutics in PD clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Mesenteric lymphadenopathy is a rare manifestation of Gaucher disease (GD) in children and can be accompanied by protein losing enteropathy (PLE). PLE is a difficult-to-treat complication of GD. To date, only a few pediatric GD cases with PLE and massive mesenteric lymphadenopathies have been reported. Here, we report a girl with chronic neuronopathic GD, whose disease course was complicated by massive mesenteric lymphadenopathies with resultant protein losing enteropathy despite a regular and appropriate enzyme replacement therapy of 60 IU/kg/biweekly until the development of mesenteric lymphadenopathies and 120 IU/kg/biweekly thereafter. PLE is a devastating and life threatening complication of GD developing despite long term use of high dose ERT. Clinicians should be alert for this complication particularly in GD patients presenting with progressive abdominal distension, edema, ascites and diarrhea or in patients who have already developed mesenteric lymphadenopathies. Timely diagnosis may allow early intervention with previously suggested surgical or medical treatment options. Although there is no specific and effective treatment, surgical and aggressive medical interventions in addition to ERT were reported to relieve diarrhea and halt progression of mesenteric lymphadenopathies."

These inhibitors act on enzymes related to various biochemical processes; they are involved in metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and Gaucher disease, tumors and viral infections, thus, they are interesting hubs for the development of new drugs and therapies. In this work, the screening of 63 environmental samples collected in the Brazilian Amazon found activity against β-glucosidase, of at least 60 min, in 13.85% of the tested extracts, with <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. GFB01 showing inhibitory activity of 90.2% for α-glucosidase and 96.9% against β-glucosidase. It was found that the nutritional limitation due to a reduction in the concentration of sodium nitrate, despite not being sufficient to cause changes in cell growth and photosynthetic apparatus, resulted in reduced production of α and β-glucosidase inhibitors and differential protein expression. The proteomic analysis of cyanobacteria isolated from the Amazon is unprecedented, with this being the first work to evaluate the protein expression of <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. GFB01 subjected to nutritional stress. This evaluation helps to better understand the metabolic responses of this organism, especially related to the production of inhibitors, adding knowledge to the industrial potential of these cyanobacterial compounds."

    "abstract": "Bulbar and respiratory weakness occur commonly in children with Pompe disease and frequently lead to dysarthria. However, changes in vocal quality associated with this motor speech disorder are poorly described. The goal of this study was to characterize the vocal function of children with Pompe disease using auditory-perceptual and physiologic/acoustic methods. High-quality voice recordings were collected from 21 children with Pompe disease. The Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain (GRBAS) scale was used to assess voice quality and ratings were compared to physiologic/acoustic measurements collected during sustained phonation tasks, reading of a standard passage, and repetition of a short phrase at maximal volume. Based on ratings of grade, dysphonia was present in 90% of participants and was most commonly rated as mild or moderate in severity. Duration of sustained phonation tasks was reduced and shimmer was increased in comparison to published reference values for children without dysphonia. Specific measures of loudness were found to have statistically significant relationships with perceptual ratings of grade, breathiness, asthenia, and strain. Our data suggest that dysphonia is common in children with Pompe disease and primarily reflects impairments in respiratory and laryngeal function; however, the primary cause of dysphonia remains unclear. Future studies should seek to quantify the relative contribution of deficits in individual speech subsystems on voice quality and motor speech performance more broadly."

    "abstract": "Preconception and prenatal carrier screening is designed to provide reproductive risk information, but carriers for some autosomal recessive or X-linked conditions also have personal health risks. This study investigated the prevalence of and inclusion of personal health implications in pre- and post-test counseling. Twelve genetic conditions with personal health risks for carriers included on carrier screening panels but not otherwise screened routinely were identified (e.g., Gaucher disease with Parkinson's disease risk). A retrospective review was performed of patients with a positive carrier screen for one of these conditions at our center from 2012 to 2019. Of 6147 individuals that had carrier screening for one of the twelve conditions, 96 (1.56%) did not report a known family history and screened positive for one of the conditions. Testing was ordered largely by reproductive endocrinologists (51.0%) and genetic counselors (35.4%). Most individuals did not receive pre- (96.8%) or post-test (64.6%) counseling about personal health risks. Post-test counseling was performed principally by genetic counselors (97.1%). For carriers of conditions with guidelines for specialist referral, most individuals (75.9%) were referred. Expanded genetic carrier screening increasingly identifies individuals with personal health implications, but patients are frequently not counseled before or after testing. These findings stress the importance of developing guidelines for practitioners about expanded carrier screening counseling and follow-up."

One was a pediatric patient (8 years old) while the remainder were adults, median age of 44 years old (range 21 to 64 years old). Two patients required hospitalization though none required intensive care or intubation. All 11 patients recovered from COVID-19 and there were no reported deaths.

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD), the most common lysosomal storage disorders, is caused by GBA gene mutations resulting in glycosphingolipids accumulations in various tissues, such as the brain. While suppressing glycosphingolipid accumulation is the central strategy for treating peripheral symptoms of GD, there is no effective treatment for the central nervous system symptoms. As glycosphingolipid biosynthesis starts from ceramide glycosylation by glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), inhibiting GCS in the brain is a promising strategy for neurological GD. Herein, we discovered T-036, a potent and brain-penetrant GCS inhibitor with a unique chemical structure and binding property. T-036 does not harbor an aliphatic amine moiety and has a noncompetitive inhibition mode to the substrates, unlike other known inhibitors. T-036 exhibited sufficient exposure and a significant reduction of glucosylsphingolipids in the plasma and brain of the GD mouse model. Therefore, T-036 could be a promising lead molecule for treating central nervous system symptoms of GD."

However, limited evidence is available on the HRQoL of FCs of patients with Gaucher disease (GD). This study aimed to assess HRQoL and related factors among FCs of patients with GD in China. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with 49 FCs recruited by convenience sampling. Participants completed the Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 (SF-36), Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale, the Multi-dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the Herth Hope Index, and a questionnaire about FCs' and patients' sociodemographic characteristics. Single-sample t tests, one-way analysis of variance, and multivariate linear regression analysis were used to analyze the data analysis. Participating FCs had significantly lower scores in all eight SF-36 domains compared with the general population in China (p < 0.01). FCs' gender, education, daily care time, anxiety, and the perceived disease severity of patients were significant predictors of SF-36 physical component summary scores. Caregiving help from others, anxiety, perceived disease severity, and medical insurance type were significant predictors of SF-36 mental component summary scores. The findings showed FCs of patients with GD had lower HRQoL. There is an urgent need to address the health concerns of FCs of people with rare diseases including their HRQoL."

This study described the health care service utilization through participants' perspective and estimated the cost of illness (COI), and patients with Gaucher disease (GD)'s/caregivers' health-related quality of life in China. An online retrospective survey of patients with GD and their caregivers was conducted during May-June 2018. Socio-demographic, health service utilization, disease-related expenses, social support, sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were investigated. Using self-reported information, we estimated the annual COI, including direct healthcare, direct non-healthcare, and indirect costs. Forty patients and their 49 caregivers were surveyed. The patients' onset age of GD was 9.3 ± 10.9; their disease course was 3.5 ± 3.1 years. 21 (42.9%) patients had ≥ 2 caregivers, but 35 (71.4%) caregivers reported have no experience as a caregiver. 79.6% caregivers have stopped working, and 87.8% changed weekly working schedule. Before final diagnosis, patients visited 3.9 ± 3.1 (max = 20) hospitals and took 1.2 ± 1.7 (max = 6.6) years for confirmed diagnosis. On average, 5.0 ± 9.6 misdiagnoses occurred, and the per-patient diagnoses cost was USD ($) 7576. After GD confirmation, 8 (16.3%) patients received no treatment, 40 (81.6%) received pharmacotherapy, 10 (20.4%) received surgery, 38 (77.6%) received outpatient service (8.8 ± 9.1 times/annually), and 37 (77.5%) received inpatient service (4.0 ± 3.5 times/annually). Annual per-patient COI was USD ($) 49,925 (95% confidence interval: 29,178, 70,672). Average direct healthcare cost was $41,816, including pharmaceutical ($29,908), inpatient ($7,451), and outpatient ($1,838). Productivity loss per-caregiver was $1,980, and their Zarit Burden Inventory score was moderate-severe (48.6 ± 19.6). Both patients/caregivers reported lower social support (32.4 ± 7.4, 34.9 ± 7.6), two times higher PSQI (7.9 ± 2.9, 8.7 ± 3.6), and half lower SF-36 (41.3 ± 18.6, 46.5 ± 19.3) than those reported for healthy Chinese individuals. The high misdiagnosis rate, together with delayed diagnosis, substantial costs, and deteriorated health-related quality of life of GD patients as well as their heavy care burden, calls for extreme attention from policymakers in China. Further efforts of government and society are urgently demanded, including pharmaceutical reimbursement, screening newborns, developing precise diagnostic tools, and training doctors."

To determine the disease burden in patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), we used Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurements Information System (PROMIS)-GI symptom scales and a GI-focused medical history. Pompe mice showed early, extensive, and progressive glycogen accumulation throughout the GI tract. Long-term ERT (6 months) was more effective to clear the glycogen accumulation than short-term ERT (5 weeks). GI manifestations were highly prevalent and severe, presented early in life, and were not fully amenable to ERT in patients with LOPD (<i>n</i> = 58; age range: 18-79 years, median age: 51.55 years; 35 females; 53 on ERT).

We explored whether this approach can be used to study Gaucher disease, one of the most common types of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) in a near-haploid human cell line (HAP1). CRISPR-Cas9 targeting to coding sequences of β-glucocerebrosidase (GBA), the causative gene of Gaucher disease, resulted in an insertional mutation and premature termination of GBA. We confirmed the GBA knockout at both the gene and enzyme levels by genotyping and GBA enzymatic assay. Characterization of the knockout line showed no significant changes in cell morphology and growth. Lysosomal staining revealed more granular lysosomes in the cytosol of the GBA-knockout line compared to its parental control. Flow cytometry analysis further confirmed that more lysosomes accumulated in the cytosol of the knockout line, recapturing the disease phenotype. Finally, we showed that this knockout cell line could be used to evaluate a replacement therapy by recombinant human GBA. Targeted gene disruption in human HAP1 cells enables rapid establishment of the Gaucher model to capture the key pathology and to test replacement therapy. We expect that this streamlined method can be used to generate human disease models of other LSDs, most of which are still lacking both appropriate human disease models and specific treatments to date."

We identified an AMRF patient with a biallelic combination of <i>SCARB2</i> mutations determined by whole exome sequencing. <i>SCARB2</i> encodes a protein that traffics β-glucocerebrosidase to the lysosomal membrane. Mutations lead to a complex pattern of glucosylceramide accumulation and neurologic symptoms including progressive action myoclonus, seizures, and ataxia. We then evaluated the effect of inhibiting glucosylceramide synthesis, as is used in Gaucher disease. The patient was treated for 3 years with miglustat after several years of steady worsening. Progression of myoclonus halted, dysphagia resolved, some skills were reacquired, and seizures remained well controlled. The response suggests that neurologic symptoms of <i>SCARB2</i>-associated AMRF could be ameliorated, at least partly, by targeting glycosphingolipid metabolism with available medications."

CML usually undergoes a triphasic clinical course ending in a blast crisis, an accelerated phase of blasts and promyelocyte production. Ten percent of CML patients reach the blast crisis phase, with 20-30% of leukemias belonging to B-cell lymphoid lineage. However, a transformation of CML into T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is rare. We present a 56-year-old male patient, known case of hypertension and Ph1 CML of eight years with a family history of Gaucher disease who developed T-ALL.

Anemia was noted at diagnosis in 50%, thrombocytopenia in 30.7%, severe splenomegaly in 58.7%, severe hepatomegaly in 11.9%, and skeletal findings were detected in 24.3% of the patients. The most prevalent GD type was type 3 (54.5%). Twenty-two of type 3 patients had no neurological manifestations at diagnosis, and 12 developed variable central nervous system manifestations during follow-up. The most common neurological features were limited eye movements, oculomotor apraxia, and squint. Of the 60 patients for whom genotypes were obtained, homozygous L444P was the most common (n=35/60, 58.3%). Treatment with ERT (imiglucerase) revealed significant improvements in blood indices, organ volumes, and growth parameters (P<0.05). Ten (11.7%) type 3 patients did not develop any neurological manifestations under ERT over 20 years. Mortality was 16%, and the 20-year OS was 73.3%. We conclude that in Egypt, type 3 is the most prevalent phenotype of GD, and homozygous L444P is the predominant GBA genotype of GD.

Some movement disorders are commonly or prominently associated with cardiac disease. Neurological and cardiac symptoms may share underlying physiopathological mechanisms in diseases, such as Friedreich's ataxia and Wilson's disease, and in certain metabolic disorders, including Refsum disease, Gaucher disease, a congenital disorder of glycosylation, or cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. In certain conditions, such as Sydenham's chorea or dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia syndrome (ATX-<i>DNAJC19</i>), heart involvement can present early in the course of disease, whereas in others such as Friedreich's ataxia or Refsum disease, cardiac symptoms tend to present in later stages. In another 68 acquired or inherited conditions, cardiac involvement or movement disorders are seldom reported. As cardiac disease is part of the phenotypic spectrum of several movement disorders, heart involvement should be carefully investigated and increased awareness of this association encouraged as it may represent a leading cause of morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC) is an ultra-rare progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 genes that lead to premature death, with most individuals dying between 10 and 25 years of age. NPC can present at any age and many individuals with NPC may be misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. A key challenge with recognizing NPC is the heterogeneous and nonspecific clinical presentation. Currently, there are no approved treatments for NPC in the United States; miglustat, an FDA-approved treatment for Gaucher disease, is used off-label for NPC and GM1 gangliosidosis. To estimate the number of people in the United States that 1) have an NPC diagnosis 2) have an NPC diagnosis and/or are treated off-label with miglustat for NPC and 3) are likely to have NPC. For the first two objectives, patients were identified using the Symphony Integrated DataVerse database (Oct 2015-Jan 2020). To identify the number of people with NPC for Objective 1, cases of NPC were defined as any patients with an ICD-10 code of E75.242 (NPC) during the study period. Objective 2 expands upon Objective 1, including (a) patients from Objective 1 and (b) patients with documented miglustat use (NDC 43975-0310 or 10,148-0201) who did not have any claim with Gaucher disease (ICD-10 E75.22) or GM1 gangliosidosis (ICD-10 E75.1) during the study period. For the third objective, published NPC incidence (1 per 89,000 live births) and expected mortality estimates were applied to the 2018 United States birth rate (11.6 per 1000) and population size (326.7 million). A total of 308 million unique individuals were represented in the database. Of these, 294 individuals had an NPC diagnosis, yielding an identified NPC prevalence of 0.95 per million people in the United States. 305 individuals were diagnosed with NPC and/or were treated with miglustat without having a diagnosis for either Gaucher or GM1 gangliosidosis, yielding an NPC diagnosed or treated prevalence of 0.99 per million people in the United States. Based on the published literature, there are an estimated 42 new NPC cases per year. Applying this number to the distribution of NPC type (based on age of neurologic symptom onset) and corresponding mortality estimates generates an estimated 943 prevalent cases of NPC, or 2.9 cases of NPC per million people in the United States. NPC is an ultra-rare, progressive neurodegenerative disease with approximately 1 per million people in the United States diagnosed with or treated off-label for NPC. Given that NPC is often misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, the estimated prevalence from the epidemiology calculations (2.9 per million) approximates the number of NPC cases if disease awareness, screening and diagnosis efforts were enhanced."

We evaluated the incidence of NPC in our NC plus lysosomal storage disease (LSD) suspicious neonates and infants series. The study included children (≤3 years old) with a history of NC together with a suspicion of LSD, referred from Spanish Hospitals during the period 2011-2020. Screening for NPC was done by plasma biomarker assay (chitotriosidase activity and 7-ketocholesterol), and Sanger sequencing for NPC1 and NPC2 genes. We screened NPC disease in 17 patients with NC plus organomegaly and that were LSD suspicious, finding 5 NPC patients (29.4%) and 2 carriers. Our results emphasize the need to study NPC when NC and visceral enlargement arise in a newborn or infant."

A total of 32 patients, 5 males, and 11 females in both the study (range 19-60, mean age 34.56) and control group (range 18-49, mean age 34.63) were included in the study. The file records of all patients obtained in the first evaluation were examined, and the hematological, visceral, and bone examination findings were recorded. Subsequently, oral examinations were performed for oral findings and dentomaxillofacial involvement, and radiological examinations were performed in panoramic images and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. There was mandible involvement in 9 (56.3%), and involvement in both jaws in 4 (25.0%) of the patients with Type I GD. According to the CBCT findings, generalized rarefaction in 10 (62.5%) patients, enlarged marrow spaces in 12 (75.0%) patients, thinning of the lamina dura in 10 (62.5%) patients, and loss in the cortical borders of the mandibular canal in 7 (43.8%) patients were among the common radiographic findings. When the control and study group were compared, in panoramic images, a significant difference was found in terms of generalized rarefaction and enlarged marrow spaces, while significant differences were found in CBCT images regarding generalized rarefaction, enlarged marrow spaces, loss in the cortical margins of the mandibular canal and widening in the periodontal ligament space. The roadmap for the diagnosis of Gaucher lesions in the jawbones includes a comprehensive medical history and a clinical and radiological examination. In conclusion, dentists should be familiar with the dentomaxillofacial findings of GD and be aware of possible oral and dental complications that may develop."

    "abstract": "For three decades, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), and more recently, substrate reduction therapy, have been the standard-of-care for type I Gaucher disease (GD1). Since 2012, three different ERTs have been available. No clinical trial or academic study has ever compared these ERTs beyond one year. Herein we compare the impact of the ERTs on repeated measurements of glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1; the most sensitive and GD-specific biomarker). A total of 135 adult patients (77 (57%) female) with GD1, followed from July 2014 to March 2020 and treated with a single ERT (imiglucerase (n = 41, 30.4%), taliglucerase alfa (n = 21, 15.6%) and velaglucerase alfa (n = 73, 54.1%)), were included. Disease severity was defined by genotypes (mild: N370S (c.1226A>G) homozygous and N370S/R496H (c.1604G) compound heterozygous; severe: all other genotypes) and by the severity score index (SSI; mild: <7; severe: ≥7). Lyso-Gb1 testing was performed at Centogene™ on dry blood spot samples collected during routine visits. Patients treated with imiglucerase had higher lyso-Gb1 levels at different time points. A huge variation in lyso-Gb1 levels was noticeable both inter-individually and intra-individually for all three ERTs. A steeper and faster decrease of lyso-Gb1 levels was shown in velaglucerase alfa. Nevertheless, the differences between medications were not very large, and bigger numbers and more pretreatment data are required for more powerful conclusions."

Lyso GL-1 (median: 685.5 ng/mL, cut-off: 14) and Lyso GL-3 (median: 75.6 ng/mL, cut-off: 3.5) were found to be elevated in all enzymatically deficient patients of GD and FD respectively, however, no specific trend was observed between the levels of these biomarkers and the pathogenic variant(s) present in the patients of these disorders. This is the first report on Lyso GL-1 and Lyso GL-3 levels in Indian patients of GD and FD respectively. These results will be useful for early diagnosis to improve management of these LSDs."

Standard echocardiography at rest was used to assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was performed on a recumbent ergometer using a ramp protocol. LVEF was similar in both groups (GD-S: 65.1 ± 5.2% vs. C: 65.2 ± 5.2%, p > .05), as well as PAPS (24.1 ± 4.2 mmHg vs. C: 25.5 ± 1.3 mmHg, p > .05).

Patients with GD type I have an abnormal CPET response compared to healthy controls likely due to the complex pathophysiologic process in GD that impacts multiple systems integral to the physiologic response to exercise."

To characterize bone marrow infiltration in patients with type 1 GD followed at the Gaucher Disease Referral Center of Porto Alegre, Brazil, and to assess whether the Bone Marrow Burden score (BMB) correlates with clinical or laboratory parameters.

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder classically subdivided into type 1 (non-neuronopathic) GD, and types 2 and 3 (neuronopathic) GD. It is typically characterized by clinical manifestations including anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, bone lesions, and (in more severe forms) neurological impairment. However, less-commonly reported and often under-recognized manifestations exist, which potentially have a significant impact on patient outcomes. Greater efforts are needed to understand, recognize, and manage these manifestations. This review provides a synthesis of published information about three under-recognized GD manifestations (pulmonary involvement, lymphadenopathy, and Gaucheroma) and recommends diagnostic, management, and treatment strategies based on the available literature and author experience. The authors aim to raise awareness about these serious, progressive, and sometimes life-threatening conditions, which are often diagnosed late in life. Little is known about the incidence, pathophysiology, prognostic factors, and optimal management of pulmonary involvement, lymphadenopathy, and Gaucheroma in patients with GD. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has shown limited efficacy for the prevention and treatment of these manifestations. More research is needed to evaluate the potential effect of substrate reduction therapy (SRT) with glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitors, and to develop additional approaches to treat these GD manifestations. Improvements in data collection registries and international data-sharing are required to better understand the impact of these manifestations on GD patients, help develop effective management strategies, and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is a glycogen storage disease caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Treatment with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA, alglucosidase alfa) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) significantly improves clinical outcomes; however, many IOPD children treated with rhGAA develop anti-drug antibodies (ADA) that render the therapy ineffective. Antibodies to rhGAA are driven by T cell responses to sequences in rhGAA that differ from the individuals' native <i>GAA</i> (nGAA). The goal of this study was to develop a tool for personalized immunogenicity risk assessment (PIMA) that quantifies T cell epitopes that differ between nGAA and rhGAA using information about an individual's native GAA gene and their HLA DR haplotype, and to use this information to predict the risk of developing ADA. Four versions of PIMA have been developed. They use EpiMatrix, a computational tool for T cell epitope identification, combined with an HLA-restricted epitope-specific scoring feature (iTEM), to assess ADA risk. One version of PIMA also integrates JanusMatrix, a Treg epitope prediction tool to identify putative immunomodulatory (regulatory) T cell epitopes in self-proteins. Using the JanusMatrix-adjusted version of PIMA in a logistic regression model with data from 48 cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM)-positive IOPD subjects, those with scores greater than 10 were 4-fold more likely to develop ADA (p<0.03) than those that had scores less than 10. We also confirmed the hypothesis that some GAA epitopes are immunomodulatory. Twenty-one epitopes were tested, of which four were determined to have an immunomodulatory effect on T effector response <i>in vitro</i>. The implementation of PIMA V3J on a secure-access website would allow clinicians to input the individual HLA DR haplotype of their IOPD patient and the GAA pathogenic variants associated with each GAA allele to calculate the patient's relative risk of developing ADA, enhancing clinical decision-making prior to initiating treatment with ERT. A better understanding of immunogenicity risk will allow the implementation of targeted immunomodulatory approaches in ERT-naïve settings, especially in CRIM-positive patients, which may in turn improve the overall clinical outcomes by minimizing the development of ADA. The PIMA approach may also be useful for other types of enzyme or factor replacement therapies."

In some cases, testing reveals difficult-to-evaluate structural differences, candidate variants that do not fully explain the phenotype, single pathogenic variants in recessive disorders, or no variants in genes of interest. Thus, there is a need for better tools to identify a precise genetic diagnosis in individuals when conventional testing approaches have been exhausted. We performed targeted long-read sequencing (T-LRS) using adaptive sampling on the Oxford Nanopore platform on 40 individuals, 10 of whom lacked a complete molecular diagnosis. We computationally targeted up to 151 Mbp of sequence per individual and searched for pathogenic substitutions, structural variants, and methylation differences using a single data source. We detected all genomic aberrations-including single-nucleotide variants, copy number changes, repeat expansions, and methylation differences-identified by prior clinical testing. In 8/8 individuals with complex structural rearrangements, T-LRS enabled more precise resolution of the mutation, leading to changes in clinical management in one case. In ten individuals with suspected Mendelian conditions lacking a precise genetic diagnosis, T-LRS identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in six and variants of uncertain significance in two others. T-LRS accurately identifies pathogenic structural variants, resolves complex rearrangements, and identifies Mendelian variants not detected by other technologies. T-LRS represents an efficient and cost-effective strategy to evaluate high-priority genes and regions or complex clinical testing results."

However, the role of accumulated GlcCer in αSyn aggregation is not completely understood. Using various biophysical assays, we demonstrate that GlcCer self-assembles to form amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates <i>in vitro</i>. The GlcCer assemblies are stable in aqueous media of different pH and exhibit a twisted ribbon-like structure. Near lysosomal pH GlcCer aggregates induced αSyn aggregation and stabilized its nascent oligomers. We found that several <i>bona fide</i> inhibitors of proteinaceous amyloids effectively inhibited aggregation of GlcCer. This study contributes to the growing evidence of cross-talk between proteinaceous amyloids and amyloid-like aggregates of metabolites accumulated in diseases and suggests these aggregates as therapeutic targets."

In this aspect, previous research has shown that CD47 modulates phagocytosis via macrophages, the transmigration of neutrophils, and the activation of T-cells, dendritic cells, and B-cells. Moreover, several studies have reported the increased expression of the CD47 receptor in a variety of diseases, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM), bladder cancer, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Gaucher disease, Multiple Sclerosis and stroke among others. The ubiquitous expression of the CD47 cell receptor on most resident cells of the CNS has previously been established through different methodologies. However, there is little information concerning its precise functions in the development of different neurodegenerative pathologies in the CNS. Consequently, further research pertaining to the specific functions and roles of CD47 and SIRP is required prior to its exploitation as a druggable approach for the targeting of various neurodegenerative diseases that affect the human population.

Importantly, the terminal mannose <i>N</i>-glycan structure is essential for the uptake of recombinant GCase into macrophages via the mannose receptor. In this research, recombinant GCase was produced using <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transient expression in both wild-type (WT) and <i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnTI) downregulated <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> (ΔgntI) plants, the latter of which accumulates mannosidic-type <i>N</i>-glycan structures. The successfully produced functional GCase exhibited GCase enzyme activity. The enzyme activity was the same as that of the conventional mammalian-derived GCase. Notably, <i>N</i>-glycan analysis revealed that a mannosidic-type <i>N</i>-glycan structure lacking plant-specific <i>N</i>-glycans (β1,2-xylose and α1,3-fucose residues) was predominant in all glycosylation sites of purified GCase produced from ΔgntI plants. Our research provides a promising alternative plant line as a host for the production of recombinant GCase with a mannosidic-type <i>N</i>-glycan structure. This glycoengineered plant might be applicable to the production of other pharmaceutical proteins, especially mannose receptor targeted protein, for therapeutic uses."

    "abstract": "Eliglustat, an oral substrate reduction therapy, is approved for eligible adults with Gaucher disease type 1. In the Phase 3 ENGAGE trial of previously untreated adults with Gaucher disease type 1, eliglustat-treated patients had statistically significant improvements in organ volumes and hematologic parameters compared with placebo in the 9-month primary analysis. We report final outcomes by time on eliglustat among all patients who participated in the ENGAGE trial and extension. No patient deteriorated clinically or withdrew due to adverse events; 39/40 patients entered the open-label extension period and 34/40 (85%) remained in the trial until completion or switching to commercial eliglustat after its approval (2.3-6 years). Clinically meaningful improvements in Gaucher disease manifestations were seen in all patients concomitant with reductions in pathological lipid substrate levels (glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine). Among patients with 4.5 years of eliglustat exposure, mean spleen volume decreased by 66% (from 17.1 to 5.8 multiples of normal [MN], n = 13), mean liver volume decreased by 23% (from 1.5 to 1.1 MN, n = 13), mean hemoglobin increased 1.4 g/dl (from 11.9 to 13.4 g/dl, n = 12), mean platelet count increased by 87% (from 67.6 to 122.6 × 10<sup>9</sup> /L, n = 12), median chitotriosidase decreased by 82% (from 13 394 to 2312 nmol/h/ml, n = 11), median glucosylceramide decreased by 79% (from 11.5 to 2.4 μg/ml, n = 11), median glucosylsphingosine decreased by 84% (from 518.5 to 72.1 ng/ml, n = 10), and mean spine T-score increased from -1.07 (osteopenia) to -0.53 (normal) (n = 9). The magnitude of improvement in Gaucher disease manifestations and biomarkers over time was similar among the full trial cohort. Eliglustat was well-tolerated and led to clinically significant improvements in previously untreated patients with Gaucher disease type 1 during 4.5 years of treatment."

    "abstract": "Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli is responsible for post-diarrheal (D+) hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which is a cause of acute renal failure in children. The glycolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) is the main receptor for Shiga toxin (Stx) in kidney target cells. Eliglustat (EG) is a specific and potent inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, first step of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, actually used for the treatment of Gaucher's disease. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the efficiency of EG in preventing the damage caused by Stx2 in human renal epithelial cells. Human renal tubular epithelial cell (HRTEC) primary cultures were pre-treated with different dilutions of EG followed by co-incubation with EG and Stx2 at different times, and cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, tubulogenesis, and Gb3 expression were assessed. In HRTEC, pre-treatments with 50 nmol/L EG for 24 h, or 500 nmol/L EG for 6 h, reduced Gb3 expression and totally prevented the effects of Stx2 on cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis. EG treatment also allowed the development of tubulogenesis in 3D-HRTEC exposed to Stx2. EG could be a potential therapeutic drug for the prevention of acute kidney injury caused by Stx2. For the first time, we have demonstrated that Eliglustat prevents Shiga toxin 2 cytotoxic effects on human renal epithelia, by reducing the expression of the toxin receptor globotriaosylceramide. The present work also shows that Eliglustat prevents Shiga toxin 2 effects on tubulogenesis of renal epithelial cells. Eliglustat, actually used for the treatment of patients with Gaucher's disease, could be a therapeutic strategy to prevent the renal damage caused by Shiga toxin."

    "abstract": "Human genetic studies as well as studies in animal models indicate that lysosomal dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Among the lysosomal genes involved, GBA1 has the largest impact on Parkinson's disease risk. Deficiency in the GBA1 encoded enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) leads to the accumulation of the GCase glycolipid substrates glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine and ultimately results in toxicity and inflammation and negatively affect many clinical aspects of Parkinson's disease, including disease risk, the severity of presentation, age of onset, and likelihood of progression to dementia. These findings support the view that re-establishing normal levels of GCase enzyme activity may reduce the progression of Parkinson's disease in patients carrying GBA1 mutations. Studies in mouse models indicate that PR001, a AAV9 vector-based gene therapy designed to deliver a functional GBA1 gene to the brain, suggest that this therapeutic approach may slow or stop disease progression. PR001 is currently being evaluated in clinical trials with Parkinson's disease patients carrying GBA1 mutations."

An emerging theme in neurodegeneration warrants an urgent and comprehensive update: that carrier status of early-onset autosomal recessive (AR) disease, typically considered benign, is associated with an increased risk of a spectrum of late-onset NDDs. <i>Glucosylceramidase beta</i> (<i>GBA1</i>) gene mutations, responsible for the AR lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease, are a prominent example of this principle, having been identified as an important genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease. Genetic analyses have revealed further examples, notably <i>GRN, TREM2, EIF2AK3</i>, and several other LSD and mitochondria function genes. In this Review, we discuss the evidence supporting the strikingly distinct allele-dependent clinical phenotypes observed in carriers of such gene mutations and its impact on the wider field of neurodegeneration."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is the most prevalent lysosomal storage disorder, affecting all ethnic groups, although its prevalence is higher in Ashkenazi Jewish populations. Three clinical forms of GD have been described: Type 1 non-neuronopathic, type 2 acute neuronopathic, and type 3 subacute neuronopathic. An autosomal recessive disorder is caused by variants in the human glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA; MIM*606463) located on chromosome 1q21, resulting from deficit or lack of activity of the β-glucocerebrosidase enzyme, leading to the accumulation of glucocerebroside substrate in the cells of the macrophage-monocyte system. The aim was to determine variants in Mexican and Spanish populations with GD. We report the molecular analysis by a direct automatic method sequenced of both chains of the GBA gene, in 69 Mexican and 369 Spanish patients with GD. We detected 75 variants with pathogenic or likely pathogenic effect and, identified 3 new variants c.408_412del/p.Asn136Lysfs*15; c.820G>A/p.Glu274Lys and c.1058T>G/p*. The most frequent variants were c.1448T>C/p.Leu483Pro/L444P and c.1226A>G/p.Asn409Ser/N370S. The detected genotypes were compared with data from both GD registries to define similarities and differences in both populations. We defined the variant profile in patients with GD in a Mexican and a Spanish population and compared them. The screening permitted the detection of common variants and the report of three new variants, in addition to a variant associated with Parkinson disease but not with GD. Since molecular diagnosis has considerable predictive value in GD, it is important to study the genotype-phenotype correlations, establishing the severity of the variant."

    "abstract": "Primary dysfunction of autophagy due to Mendelian defects affecting core components of the autophagy machinery or closely related proteins have recently emerged as an important cause of genetic disease. This novel group of human disorders may present throughout life and comprises severe early-onset neurodevelopmental and more common adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Early-onset (or congenital) disorders of autophagy often share a recognizable \"clinical signature,\" including variable combinations of neurological, neuromuscular and multisystem manifestations. Structural CNS abnormalities, cerebellar involvement, spasticity and peripheral nerve pathology are prominent neurological features, indicating a specific vulnerability of certain neuronal populations to autophagic disturbance. A typically biphasic disease course of late-onset neurodegeneration occurring on the background of a neurodevelopmental disorder further supports a role of autophagy in both neuronal development and maintenance. Additionally, an associated myopathy has been characterized in several conditions. The differential diagnosis comprises a wide range of other multisystem disorders, including mitochondrial, glycogen and lysosomal storage disorders, as well as ciliopathies, glycosylation and vesicular trafficking defects. The clinical overlap between the congenital disorders of autophagy and these conditions reflects the multiple roles of the proteins and/or emerging molecular connections between the pathways implicated and suggests an exciting area for future research. Therapy development for congenital disorders of autophagy is still in its infancy but may result in the identification of molecules that target autophagy more specifically than currently available compounds. The close connection with adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders highlights the relevance of research into rare early-onset neurodevelopmental conditions for much more common, age-related human diseases.<b>Abbreviations:</b> AC: anterior commissure; AD: Alzheimer disease; ALR: autophagic lysosomal reformation; ALS: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; AMBRA1: autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ASD: autism spectrum disorder; ATG: autophagy related; BIN1: bridging integrator 1; BPAN: beta-propeller protein associated neurodegeneration; CC: corpus callosum; CHMP2B: charged multivesicular body protein 2B; CHS: Chediak-Higashi syndrome; CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; CMT: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; CNM: centronuclear myopathy; CNS: central nervous system; DNM2: dynamin 2; DPR: dipeptide repeat protein; DVL3: disheveled segment polarity protein 3; EPG5: ectopic P-granules autophagy protein 5 homolog; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ESCRT: homotypic fusion and protein sorting complex; FIG4: FIG4 phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase; FTD: frontotemporal dementia; GBA: glucocerebrosidase; GD: Gaucher disease; GRN: progranulin; GSD: glycogen storage disorder; HC: hippocampal commissure; HD: Huntington disease; HOPS: homotypic fusion and protein sorting complex; HSPP: hereditary spastic paraparesis; LAMP2A: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2A; MEAX: X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy; mHTT: mutant huntingtin; MSS: Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome; MTM1: myotubularin 1; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; NBIA: neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation; NCL: neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; NPC1: Niemann-Pick disease type 1; PD: Parkinson disease; PtdIns3P: phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; RAB3GAP1: RAB3 GTPase activating protein catalytic subunit 1; RAB3GAP2: RAB3 GTPase activating non-catalytic protein subunit 2; RB1: RB1-inducible coiled-coil protein 1; RHEB: ras homolog, mTORC1 binding; SCAR20: SNX14-related ataxia; SENDA: static encephalopathy of childhood with neurodegeneration in adulthood; SNX14: sorting nexin 14; SPG11: SPG11 vesicle trafficking associated, spatacsin; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TBC1D20: TBC1 domain family member 20; TECPR2: tectonin beta-propeller repeat containing 2; TSC1: TSC complex subunit 1; TSC2: TSC complex subunit 2; UBQLN2: ubiquilin 2; VCP: valosin-containing protein; VMA21: vacuolar ATPase assembly factor VMA21; WDFY3/ALFY: WD repeat and FYVE domain containing protein 3; WDR45: WD repeat domain 45; WDR47: WD repeat domain 47; WMS: Warburg Micro syndrome; XLMTM: X-linked myotubular myopathy; ZFYVE26: zinc finger FYVE-type containing 26."

Surprisingly, however, preliminary studies suggest that Gaucher disease does not confer a higher risk of severe, life-threatening effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and no severe cases have been reported in large cohorts of patients from the United States, Europe and Israel. It is thought that the accumulation of glucocerebroside in the cells of Gaucher patients may promote immune tolerance rather than inflammation on exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

    "abstract": "Multiple mutations have been described in the human GBA1 gene, which encodes the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) that degrades glucosylceramide and is pivotal in glycosphingolipid substrate metabolism. Depletion of GCase, typically by homozygous mutations in GBA1, is linked to the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher's disease (GD) and distinct or heterozygous mutations in GBA1 are associated with increased Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. While numerous genes have been linked to heritable PD, GBA1 mutations in aggregate are the single greatest risk factor for development of idiopathic PD. The importance of GCase in PD necessitates preclinical models in which to study GCase-related mechanisms and novel therapeutic approaches, as well as to elucidate the molecular mechanisms leading to enhanced PD risk in GBA1 mutation carriers. The aim of this study was to develop and characterize a novel GBA1 mouse model and to facilitate wide accessibility of the model with phenotypic data. Herein we describe the results of molecular, biochemical, histological, and behavioral phenotyping analyses in a GBA1 D409V knock-in (KI) mouse. This mouse model exhibited significantly decreased GCase activity in liver and brain, with substantial increases in glycosphingolipid substrates in the liver. While no changes in the number of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra were noted, subtle changes in striatal neurotransmitters were observed in GBA1 D409V KI mice. Alpha-synuclein pathology and inflammation were not observed in the nigrostriatal system of this model. In summary, the GBA1 D409V KI mouse model provides an ideal model for studies aimed at pharmacodynamic assessments of potential therapies aiming to restore GCase."

Two main factors that misled the diagnosis were identified. Each patient with Gaucher disease need to be approached by taking a thorough history, a proper clinical examination, and then by being investigated, accordingly.

Owing to the rarity of these diseases, the prevalence of lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan is unknown. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide survey to estimate the number of patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan. A nationwide survey was conducted following the \"Manual of nationwide epidemiological survey for understanding patient number and clinical epidemiology of rare diseases (3rd version)\". A questionnaire asking for detailed information, such as disease phenotypes and medical history, was created and sent to 504 institutions with doctors who have experience in treating patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders. Result A total of 303 completed questionnaires were collected from 504 institutions (response rate: 60.1%). The number of patients was estimated by calculating the rate/frequency of overlap. The estimated number of patients was 1658 (±264.8) for Fabry disease, 72 (±11.3) for mucopolysaccharidosis I, 275 (±49.9) for mucopolysaccharidosis II, 211 (±31.3) for Gaucher disease, 124 (±25.8) for Pompe disease, 83 (±44.3) for metachromatic leukodystrophy, 57 (±9.4) for Niemann-Pick type C, and 262 (±42.3) for adrenoleukodystrophy. In addition the birth prevalence was calculated using the estimated number of patients and birth year data for each disease, and was 1.25 for Fabry disease, 0.09 for mucopolysaccharidosis I, 0.38 for mucopolysaccharidosis II, 0.19 for Gaucher disease, 0.14 for Pompe disease, 0.16 for metachromatic leukodystrophy, 0.16 for Niemann-Pick type C, and 0.20 for adrenoleukodystrophy. Among the diseases analyzed, the disease with the highest prevalence was Fabry disease, followed by mucopolysaccharidosis II, adrenoleukodystrophy, Gaucher disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy. In particular, the high prevalence of mucopolysaccharidosis II and Gaucher disease type II was a feature characteristic of Japan. We estimated the number of patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan. The details of the age at diagnosis and treatment methods for each disease were clarified, and will be useful for the early diagnosis of these patients and to provide appropriate treatments.

    "abstract": "Numerous clinical observations and exploitation of cellular and animal models indicate that glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and galactosylceramide (GalCer) are involved in many physiological and pathological phenomena. In many cases, the biological importance of these monohexosylcermides has been shown indirectly as the result of studies on enzymes involved in their synthesis and degradation. Under physiological conditions, GalCer plays a key role in the maintenance of proper structure and stability of myelin and differentiation of oligodendrocytes. On the other hand, GlcCer is necessary for the proper functions of epidermis. Such an important lysosomal storage disease as Gaucher disease (GD) and a neurodegenerative disorder as Parkinson's disease are characterized by mutations in the GBA1 gene, decreased activity of lysosomal GBA1 glucosylceramidase and accumulation of GlcCer. In contrast, another lysosomal disease, Krabbe disease, is associated with mutations in the GALC gene, resulting in deficiency or decreased activity of lysosomal galactosylceramidase and accumulation of GalCer and galactosylsphingosine. Little is known about the role of both monohexosylceramides in tumor progression; however, numerous studies indicate that GlcCer and GalCer play important roles in the development of multidrug-resistance by cancer cells. It was shown that GlcCer is able to provoke immune reaction and acts as a self-antigen in GD. On the other hand, GalCer was recognized as an important cellular receptor for HIV-1. Altogether, these two molecules are excellent examples of how slight differences in chemical composition and molecular conformation contribute to profound differences in their physicochemical properties and biological functions."

The molecular diagnosis of GD is complicated by the presence of recombinant alleles originating from a highly homologous pseudogene. Clinical exome sequencing (CES) is a rapid genetic approach for identifying disease-causing mutations. However, copy number variation and recombination events are poorly detected, and further investigations are required to avoid mis-genotyping. The aim of this work was to set-up an integrated strategy for GD patients genotyping using CES as a first-line test. Eight patients diagnosed with GD were analyzed by CES. Five patients were fully genotyped, while three were revealed to be homozygous for mutations that were not confirmed in the parents. Therefore, MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification) and specific long-range PCR were performed, and two recombinant alleles, one of them novel, and one large deletion were identified. Furthermore, an MLPA assay performed in one family resulted in the identification of an additional novel mutation (p.M124V) in a relative, in trans with the known p.N409S mutation. In conclusion, even though CES has become extensively used in clinical practice, our study emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive molecular strategy to provide proper <i>GBA</i> genotyping and genetic counseling."

    "abstract": "The B subunit pentamer verotoxin (VT aka Shiga toxin-Stx) binding to its cellular glycosphingolipid (GSL) receptor, globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb<sub>3</sub>) mediates internalization and the subsequent receptor mediated retrograde intracellular traffic of the AB5 subunit holotoxin to the endoplasmic reticulum. Subunit separation and cytosolic A subunit transit via the ER retrotranslocon as a misfolded protein mimic, then inhibits protein synthesis to kill cells, which can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome clinically. This represents one of the most studied systems of prokaryotic hijacking of eukaryotic biology. Similarly, the interaction of cholera AB5 toxin with its GSL receptor, GM1 ganglioside, is the key component of the gastrointestinal pathogenesis of cholera and follows the same retrograde transport pathway for A subunit cytosol access. Although both VT and CT are the cause of major pathology worldwide, the toxin-receptor interaction is itself being manipulated to generate new approaches to control, rather than cause, disease. This arena comprises two areas: anti neoplasia, and protein misfolding diseases. CT/CTB subunit immunomodulatory function and anti-cancer toxin immunoconjugates will not be considered here. In the verotoxin case, it is clear that Gb<sub>3</sub> (and VT targeting) is upregulated in many human cancers and that there is a relationship between GSL expression and cancer drug resistance. While both verotoxin and cholera toxin similarly hijack the intracellular ERAD quality control system of nascent protein folding, the more widespread cell expression of GM1 makes cholera the toxin of choice as the means to more widely utilise ERAD targeting to ameliorate genetic diseases of protein misfolding. Gb<sub>3</sub> is primarily expressed in human renal tissue. Glomerular endothelial cells are the primary VT target but Gb<sub>3</sub> is expressed in other endothelial beds, notably brain endothelial cells which can mediate the encephalopathy primarily associated with VT2-producing <i>E. coli</i> infection. The Gb<sub>3</sub> levels can be regulated by cytokines released during EHEC infection, which complicate pathogenesis. Significantly Gb<sub>3</sub> is upregulated in the neovasculature of many tumours, irrespective of tumour Gb<sub>3</sub> status. Gb<sub>3</sub> is markedly increased in pancreatic, ovarian, breast, testicular, renal, astrocytic, gastric, colorectal, cervical, sarcoma and meningeal cancer relative to the normal tissue. VT has been shown to be effective in mouse xenograft models of renal, astrocytoma, ovarian, colorectal, meningioma, and breast cancer. These studies are herein reviewed. Both CT and VT (and several other bacterial toxins) access the cell cytosol via cell surface ->ER transport. Once in the ER they interface with the protein folding homeostatic quality control pathway of the cell -ERAD, (ER associated degradation), which ensures that only correctly folded nascent proteins are allowed to progress to their cellular destinations. Misfolded proteins are translocated through the ER membrane and degraded by cytosolic proteosome. VT and CT A subunits have a C terminal misfolded protein mimic sequence to hijack this transporter to enter the cytosol. This interface between exogenous toxin and genetically encoded endogenous mutant misfolded proteins, provides a new therapeutic basis for the treatment of such genetic diseases, e.g., Cystic fibrosis, Gaucher disease, Krabbe disease, Fabry disease, Tay-Sachs disease and many more. Studies showing the efficacy of this approach in animal models of such diseases are presented."

Indeed, we review the evidence for this hypothesis that links physiological conditions favoring both vesiculation and enhanced RBC adhesion and demonstrate the veracity of this hypothesis by way of a specific example occurring in splenic flow which we argue has various renderings in a wide range of vascular flows, in particular microvascular flows. We provide a mechanistic basis for membrane loss and the formation of lysed red blood cells in the spleen that may mediate their turnover.

Considering the functional advantages of BM-MSCs as bone and cartilage reparatory cells and supporting angiogenesis, several donor-related factors are also essential to consider when autologous BM-MSCs are used for such regenerative therapies. Aging is one of several factors contributing to the donor-related variability and found to be associated with a reduction of BM-MSC numbers. However, even within the same age group, other factors affecting MSC quantity and function remain incompletely understood. For patients with osteonecrosis, several underlying factors have been linked to the decrease of the proliferation of BM-MSCs as well as the impairment of their differentiation, migration, angiogenesis-support and immunoregulatory functions. This review discusses the quality and quantity of BM-MSCs in relation to the etiological conditions of osteonecrosis such as sickle cell disease, Gaucher disease, alcohol, corticosteroids, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, diabetes, chronic renal disease and chemotherapy. A clear understanding of the regenerative potential of BM-MSCs is essential to optimize the cellular therapy of osteonecrosis and other bone damage conditions."

    "title": "TRAP5b and RANKL/OPG Predict Bone Pathology in Patients with Gaucher Disease.",
    "abstract": "Bone involvement occurs in 75% of patients with Gaucher disease (GD), and comprises structural changes, debilitating pain, and bone density abnormalities. Osteoporosis is a silent manifestation of GD until a pathologic fracture occurs. Thus, early diagnosis is crucial for identifying high-risk patients in order to prevent irreversible complications. Thirty-three patients with GD were assessed prospectively to identify predictive markers associated with bone density abnormalities, osteopenia (OSN), and osteoporosis (OSR). Subjects were categorized into three cohorts based on T- or Z-scores of bone mineral density (BMD). The first GD cohort consisted of those with no bone complications (Z-score ≥ -0.9; T-scores ≥ -1), the second was the OSN group (-1.8 ≥ Z-score ≥ -1; -2.5 ≥ T-score ≥ -1), and the third was the OSR group (Z-score ≤ -1.9; T-scores ≤ -2.5). Serum levels of TRAP5b, RANKL, OPG, and RANK were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. TRAP5b levels were increased in GD patients, and showed a positive correlation with GD biomarkers, including plasma glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1) and macrophage activation markers CCL18 and chitotriosidase. The highest level of TRAP5b was measured in patients with osteoporosis. The elevation of RANKL and RANKL/OPG ratio correlated with osteopenia in GD. TRAP5b, RANKL, and RANKL/OPG elevation indicate osteoclast activation in GD. TRAP5b is a potential bone biomarker for GD with the ability to predict the progression of bone density abnormalities."

    "title": "Metabolizing profile of the cytochrome pathway CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and the ABCB 1 transporter in Spanish patients affected by Gaucher disease.",
    "abstract": "Several therapeutic options are available for type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1), including enzymatic replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT). Eliglustat is a selective inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase that is extensively metabolized by CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent by CYP3A4; it is also an inhibitor of the P-gp transporter. The aim of this study is to evaluate the metabolizer profile of these cytochrome isoforms in 61 GD1 patients, and to analyze interferences with concomitant therapies. Patients were selected from the Spanish Gaucher Disease Registry considering clinical data, GBA genotype, severity score index, comorbidities, concomitant drugs, type and response to therapy and adverse effects. The polymorphisms of CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and three ABCB1 transporter variants were analyzed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The most frequent metabolizer profile was extensive or intermediate for CYP2D6, extensive for CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A4*22 and normal activity for ABCB1. Correlations between metabolizer profile and other variables were analyzed by multiple regression study. Twenty-eight patients received ERT, 17 eliglustat and seven miglustat. Forty-two patients (68.8%) had associated diseases and 54.5% were taking daily concomitant medication. Nine patients under eliglustat therapy received concomitant drugs that interact with the CYPs and/or ABCB1, five of these did not reach therapeutic goals and three presented mild or moderate adverse effects (headache and gastrointestinal disorders). Detailed analysis in four patients with TTT haplotype, corresponding to lack of activity of the transporter, was performed. In order to apply personalized medicine and avoid interferences and adverse effects, the individual CYP metabolizer profile and transporter must be considered when choosing the concomitant medication and/or making dose adjustments."

    "title": "An analysis of member retention patterns for adult rare disease cohorts to support evaluating multiyear payment arrangements for novel therapies.",
    "abstract": "<b>BACKGROUND:</b> Traditionally, treatment for chronic conditions addressed symptoms or was disease modifying and required lifelong periodic administration and recurring costs. Cell and gene therapies for rare diseases often require a short administration period relative to their expected long-term clinical benefit. Costs have historically been recognized when the service or treatment is administered, resulting in the potential for the cost associated with the possible long-term clinical benefit of cell and gene therapies being incurred during a short administration period. Innovative payment arrangements have been proposed to improve the synchronization of the payment and the emergence of the clinical benefit. Expected payments associated with a multiyear payment arrangement will depend on many factors, but key drivers of the payments include efficacy, durability of effect, mortality, and member retention. This research extends a previous study by analyzing member retention for adult patients with certain rare diseases. <b>OBJECTIVE:</b> To develop member retention estimates from a US commercial payer's perspective for adults diagnosed with certain rare diseases during a 10-year period. <b>METHODS:</b> Four population cohorts were examined: (1) self-insured - all subscribers, (2) self-insured - rare medical condition, (3) fully insured - all subscribers, and (4) fully insured - rare medical condition. Seven rare medical conditions were prospectively selected: cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, Gaucher disease, hemophilia, sickle cell disease, spina bifida, and thalassemia. We limited the study cohort to members who were either the subscriber or the subscriber's partner and were aged 18 years or older; dependent children were excluded from the analysis, regardless of age. The IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters research database for the 10 years ending December 31, 2016, was used as the basis for the analysis. The analysis was completed using the <i>lifetest</i> procedure available in version 9.4 of the SAS Software System for Windows. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to produce retention rates. A log-rank test with chi-square statistic was used to determine statistically significant differences between pairs of curves. <b>RESULTS:</b> The study found that the subscriber retention for the rare medical condition cohort is significantly higher than the all-subscribers cohort by at least 12 points at each 1-year period. The finding was statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.0001) for the self-insured and fully insured cohorts. At year 5, approximately 20% more of the rare medical condition cohort was retained as compared with the all-subscribers cohort regardless of payer type. In addition, the study found that the probability of retention for adults with each rare medical condition in the rare disease cohort was also statistically significantly higher than all subscribers regardless of payer type. <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> In multiyear payment arrangements, it may be important to set expectations for member retention based on studies specific to particular member cohorts. Health insurers and plan administrators may have inaccurate expectations if standard assumptions based on all member populations are used. This study found that adults diagnosed with 1 of 7 rare medical conditions are retained longer, on average, than all adult subscribers. <b>DISCLOSURES:</b> Milliman received funding from bluebird bio for the conduct of this study and fees from AveXis, outside the submitted work. Jackson, Runyan, and Metz are employed by Milliman. Jackson and Metz are members of the American Academy of Actuaries and meet the qualification standards for performing the analyses in this report.

    "abstract": "We performed a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the incidence and types of lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) in case series of nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF). PubMed, Ovid, and clinicaltrials.gov were reviewed for case series evaluating the workup of NIHF diagnosed in utero or in the neonatal period in human subjects from 1979 to August 2020. Retrospective case series with at least five cases of fetal and/or neonatal NIHF with its workup mentioned were identified. Idiopathic NIHF was defined as NIHF without an apparent cause after initial standard-of-care workup. In total, 22 case series with 2678 total cases of NIHF were identified. The overall incidence of LSD was 6.6% (177/2663) in NIHF cases that were tested for any LSD, and 8.2% (177/2151) in idiopathic NIHF cases. The most common LSD identified in cases of NIHF were mucopolysaccharidosis type VII, galactosialidosis, infantile sialic acid storage disease, Gaucher disease, GM1 gangliosidosis, and sialidosis. More than 40% of the most common LSD causes of NIHF have a potential postnatal treatment. LSD testing for NIHF allows for early diagnosis, better counseling and appropriate management, planning for possible early treatment, and counseling for recurrence risk."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal β-glucocerebrosidase A (GBA) deficiency causes Gaucher disease (GD), a recessive disorder caused by bi-allelic mutations in GBA. The prevalence of GD is associated with ethnicity but largely unknown and potentially underestimated in many countries. GD may manifest with organomegaly, bone involvement, and neurological symptoms as well as abnormal laboratory biomarkers. This study attempted to screen for GD in patients using abnormal platelet, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and ferritin results from laboratory databases. Electronic laboratory databases were interrogated using a 2- to 4-year time interval to identify from clinical biochemistry records patients with a phenotype of reduced platelets (<150 × 10<sup>9</sup> /L) and either elevated ALP (>130 iu/L) or ferritin [>150 (female) or >250 µg/L (male)]. The mean value over the screening window was used to reduce variability in results. A dried blood spot sample was collected for the determination of GBA activity in patients meeting these criteria. If low GBA activity was found, then the concentration of the GD-specific biomarker glucosyl-sphingosine (lyso-GB1) was assayed, and the GBA gene sequenced. Samples were obtained from 1058 patients; 232 patients had low GBA activity triggering further analysis. No new cases of GD with homozygosity for pathogenic variants were identified, but 12 patients (1%) were identified to be carriers of a pathogenic variant in GBA. Pathology databases hold routine information that can be used to screen for patients with inherited errors of metabolism. However, biochemical screening using mean platelets, ALP, and ferritin has a low yield for unidentified cases of GD."

A 9-month-old female infant who had received a diagnosis of neonatal hepatitis due to cytomegalovirus infection at 2 months of age presented to our institute with developmental delay, fever, vomiting, feeding difficulty, breathlessness and features of elevated intracranial pressure due to hydrocephalus. Key examination findings with cholestatic jaundice as an early manifestation led to suspicion of type 4 Farber disease. Observation of hydrocephalus, hypertension, bilateral pinguecula and Erlenmeyer flask deformity of the femur were unusual findings for Farber disease. The child had few features (pinguecula, Erlenmeyer flask deformity and hydrocephalus) overlapping with Gaucher disease. Alternatively, prosaposin deficiency (Farber disease type 7) was another differential diagnosis. Diagnosis of Farber disease was confirmed by detection of foamy macrophages on skin biopsy and two homozygous missense variants in <i>ASAH1</i> gene."

Defects in GCase lead to the accumulation of glucosylceramide, which causes the development of the lysosomal storage disease known as Gaucher's disease. Loss-of-function mutations in the GBA1 gene are the most important genetic risk factor for synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Recent studies on PD genes associated with lysosomal function suggest that GCase activity is decreased in cell models of PD and in neurons derived from PD patients.

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD), one of the most common lysosomal disorders, is caused by deficiency of β-glucocerebrosidase. Based on the presence and severity of neurological complications, GD is classified into types I, II (the most severe form), and III. Abnormalities in systemic markers of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (B<sub>12</sub> ) metabolism have been reported in GD type I patients, suggesting a higher prevalence of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency in these patients. A 2-month-old male with GD type II was admitted to the hospital presenting jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and ichthyosis. At admission, cholestasis and ascites, abnormal liver function enzymes, prolonged prothrombin time, and high levels of B<sub>12</sub> were confirmed. Analysis of biomarkers of B<sub>12</sub> status revealed elevated B<sub>12</sub> and holo-transcobalamin (holo-TC) levels. The B<sub>12</sub> profile found in our patient is the opposite to what is described for GD type I patients. Holo-TC may increase in inflammatory states or due to liver diseases. In GD, the accumulation of glucocerebroside may be a trigger that initiates a systemic inflammatory reaction, characterized by macrophage activation. We suggest higher levels of holo-TC could be associated with a more severe (neuronopathic) GD, and be a biomarker of GD type II."

We conducted retrospective chart reviews of patients with GD1 or their family members diagnosed with ALS. To further investigate whether there is an association between ALS and GD, we performed exploratory analyses for the presence of <i>GBA</i> variants in 3 ALS cohorts from Toronto (Canada), Montreal (Canada), and Project MinE (international), totaling 4,653 patients with ALS and 1,832 controls. We describe 2 patients with GD1 and 1 obligate <i>GBA</i> mutation carrier (mother of GD1 patient) with ALS. We identified 0 and 8 <i>GBA</i> carriers in the Toronto and Montreal cohorts, respectively. The frequencies of <i>GBA</i> variants in patients with ALS in the Montreal and Project MinE cohorts were similar to those of Project MinE controls or Genome Aggregation Database population controls. The occurrence of ALS in biallelic or monoallelic <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers described here, in addition to common pathogenic pathways shared by GD1 and ALS, suggests that <i>GBA</i> variants could influence ALS risk. However, analyses of <i>GBA</i> variants in ALS cohorts did not reveal a meaningful association. Examination of larger cohorts and neuropathologic studies will be required to elucidate whether patients with GD1 are indeed at increased risk for ALS."

This cross-sectional survey of physician members of Pediatric Emergency Research Canada and the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians explored: personal safety/responsibility to care; patient interactions; ethical issues in pandemic care; institutional dynamics and communication practices. Data analysis was descriptive: categorical data were summarised with frequency distributions, continuous data [100 mm visual analog scales (VAS)] were analysed using measures of central tendency. Short open-ended items were coded to identify frequencies of responses. From June 29 to July 29, 2020, 187 respondents (13% response rate) completed the survey: 39% were from Ontario and 20% from Quebec, trained in general (50%) or pediatric (37%) emergency medicine. Respondents reported a high moral obligation to care for patients (97/100, IQR: 85-100, on 100 mm VAS). Fear of contracting COVID-19 changed how 82% of respondents reported interacting with patients, while 97% reported PPE negatively impacted patient care. Despite reporting a high proportion of negative emotions (84%), respondents (59%) were not/slightly concerned about their mental health. Top concerns included a potential second wave, Canada's financial situation, worldwide solidarity, and youth mental health. Facilitators to provide emergency care included: teamwork, leadership, clear communications strategies. Canadian emergency physicians felt a strong sense of responsibility to care, while dealing with several ethical dilemmas. Clear communication strategies, measures to ensure safety, and appropriate emergency department setups facilitate pandemic care. Emergency physicians were not concerned about their own mental health, requiring further exploration."

    "abstract": "Long known as digestive organelles, lysosomes have now emerged as multifaceted centers responsible for degradation, nutrient sensing, and immunity. Growing evidence also implicates role of lysosome-related mechanisms in pathologic process. In this review, we discuss physiological function of lysosomes and, more importantly, how the homeostasis of lysosomes is disrupted in several diseases, including atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune disorders, pancreatitis, lysosomal storage disorders, and malignant tumors. In atherosclerosis and Gaucher disease, dysfunction of lysosomes changes cytokine secretion from macrophages, partially through inflammasome activation. In neurodegenerative diseases, defect autophagy facilitates accumulation of toxic protein and dysfunctional organelles leading to neuron death. Lysosomal dysfunction has been demonstrated in pathology of pancreatitis. Abnormal autophagy activation or inhibition has been revealed in autoimmune disorders. In tumor microenvironment, malignant phenotypes, including tumorigenesis, growth regulation, invasion, drug resistance, and radiotherapy resistance, of tumor cells and behaviors of tumor-associated macrophages, fibroblasts, dendritic cells, and T cells are also mediated by lysosomes. Based on these findings, a series of therapeutic methods targeting lysosomal proteins and processes have been developed from bench to bedside. In a word, present researches corroborate lysosomes to be pivotal organelles for understanding pathology of atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune disorders, pancreatitis, and lysosomal storage disorders, and malignant tumors and developing novel therapeutic strategies."

The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of the three treatable forms of lysosomal storage disorders (Gaucher disease [GD], Pompe disease [PD], and Fabry disease [FD]) in a cohort of mostly urban-dwelling individuals of African ancestry, a previously unknown genetic landscape for LSDs. Large-scale selective multistep biochemical and genetic screening was performed in patients seeking healthcare for various health concerns. Fluorimetric enzyme assays for GD, PD, and FD were performed on dried blood spots. Targeted gene sequencing was performed on samples that showed significantly lower enzyme activities (<10% of control mean) after two tiers of enzymatic screening. A total of 5287 unique samples representing a cross section of patients who visited Howard University Hospital and College of Medicine from 2015 to 2017 were included in the study. Study samples were obtained from a population where ~90% reported as African-American, ~5% Hispanic, and <5% Caucasian or other. Regarding GD, three subjects had either homozygous or heterozygous mutations in the <i>GBA</i> gene. As to PD, eight subjects were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for <i>GAA</i> mutations, including three novel mutations: (a) c.472 A > G; p.T158A, (b) c.503G > T; p.R168L, (c) c.1985del.

We previously reported that gba1 knockout (KO) medaka exhibited glucosylceramide accumulation and neuronopathic GD phenotypes, including short lifespan, the dopaminergic and noradrenergic neuronal cell loss, microglial activation, and swimming abnormality, with asyn accumulation in the brains. A recent study reported that deletion of GBA2, non-lysosomal glucocerebrosidase, in a non-neuronopathic GD mouse model rescued its phenotypes. In the present study, we generated gba2 KO medaka and examined the effect of Gba2 deletion on the phenotypes of gba1 KO medaka. The Gba2 deletion in gba1 KO medaka resulted in the exacerbation of glucosylceramide accumulation and no improvement in neuronopathic GD pathological changes, asyn accumulation, or swimming abnormalities. Meanwhile, though gba2 KO medaka did not show any apparent phenotypes, biochemical analysis revealed asyn accumulation in the brains. gba2 KO medaka showed a trend towards an increase in sphingolipids in the brains, which is one of the possible causes of asyn accumulation. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the deletion of Gba2 does not rescue the pathological changes or behavioral abnormalities of gba1 KO medaka, and GBA2 represents a novel factor affecting asyn accumulation in the brains."

While enzyme replacement therapy using recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) can significantly improve patient outcomes, detailed disease mechanisms and incomplete therapeutic effects require further studies. Here we report a three-dimensional primary human skeletal muscle (\"myobundle\") model of infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) that recapitulates hallmark pathological features including reduced GAA enzyme activity, elevated glycogen content and lysosome abundance, and increased sensitivity of muscle contractile function to metabolic stress. In vitro treatment of IOPD myobundles with rhGAA or adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated hGAA expression yields increased GAA activity and robust glycogen clearance, but no improvements in stress-induced functional deficits. We also apply RNA sequencing analysis to the quadriceps of untreated and AAV-treated GAA<sup>-/-</sup> mice and wild-type controls to establish a Pompe disease-specific transcriptional signature and reveal novel disease pathways. The mouse-derived signature is enriched in the transcriptomic profile of IOPD vs. healthy myobundles and partially reversed by in vitro rhGAA treatment, further confirming the utility of the human myobundle model for studies of Pompe disease and therapy."

The iminosugar Miglustat is a well-characterized drug for the treatment of rare genetic lysosome storage diseases, such as Gaucher and Niemann-Pick type C, and has also been described to be active against a variety of enveloped viruses. The activity of Miglustat is here demonstrated in the micromolar range for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The drug acts at the post-entry level and leads to a marked decrease of viral proteins and release of infectious viruses. The mechanism resides in the inhibitory activity toward α-glucosidases that are involved in the early stages of glycoprotein N-linked oligosaccharide processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a marked decrease of the viral Spike protein. Indeed, the antiviral potential of protein glycosylation inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 is further highlighted by the low-micromolar activity of the investigational drug Celgosivir. These data point to a relevant role of this approach for the treatment of COVID-19."

Currently, sphingolipids and their metabolism are hotly debated topics in various biochemical fields. Similar to other macromolecular reactions, SL metabolism has important implications in health and disease in most cells. A plethora of SL-related genetic ailments has been described. Defects in SL catabolism can cause the accumulation of SLs, leading to many types of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) collectively called sphingolipidoses. These diseases mainly impact the neuronal and immune systems, but other systems can be affected as well. This review aims to present a comprehensive, up-to-date picture of the rapidly growing field of sphingolipid LSDs, their etiology, pathology, and potential therapeutic strategies. We first describe LSDs biochemically and briefly discuss their catabolism, followed by general aspects of the major diseases such as Gaucher, Krabbe, Fabry, and Farber among others. We conclude with an overview of the available and potential future therapies for many of the diseases. We strive to present the most important and recent findings from basic research and clinical applications, and to provide a valuable source for understanding these disorders."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a heterogeneous group of conditions causing substrate accumulation leading to progressive organ damage. Newborn screening (NBS) for several LSDs has become available in recent years due to advances in technology and treatment availability. While early initiation of treatment is lifesaving for those with infantile presentations, controversy continues regarding diagnosis of milder, later-onset diseases in infancy, including creation of pre-symptomatic populations of 'patients-in-waiting', the potential for medicalization, stigmatization, and/or discrimination. In-depth interviews were conducted with 36 adults [11 with Fabry disease (FD), 8 with Gaucher disease (GD), and 17 with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD)], to determine their perspectives on NBS for their respective conditions. Thirty-four of 36 participants were in favor of NBS; both participants not in favor had GD1. Emergent themes influencing participants favorably toward NBS included earlier age of onset, a long diagnostic odyssey, less efficacious treatment, and the desire to have made different life decisions (e.g., relationships, career, or lifestyle) with the knowledge of their diagnosis. Concerns about insurance discrimination and psychological or physical burdens were associated with less favorable opinions of NBS. The ability for parents to make future reproductive decisions based their child's NBS result was considered favorably by some participants and unfavorably by others. Participants' specific condition (GD1, FD, or LOPD) contributed to these experiences differently. Participants with LOPD and FD favored NBS to initiate earlier treatment and prevent irreversible organ damage, whereas fewer patients with GD1 mentioned this benefit. Participants with LOPD had the longest diagnostic odyssey, while those with FD were more likely to report feeling misunderstood and experiencing accusations of malingering, both contributing to favorable views of NBS. Results expand prior quantitative findings by illuminating how participants' lived experiences can shape opinions about NBS. By understanding how currently affected individuals perceive the lifelong impact of a NBS result, genetic counselors can provide better anticipatory guidance to the parents of individuals diagnosed with a later-onset LSD by NBS."

Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of inherited diseases caused by mutations affecting genes that encode the function of the lysosomal enzymes. Three LSDs are associated with lung involvement and/or interstitial lung disease (ILD): Gaucher disease (GD); Niemann-Pick disease, also known as acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD); and Fabry disease (FD). In GD and in ASMD, analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung biopsy can be informative, showing foamy cells. In GD, ILD is rare. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been available since 1991 and has greatly changed the natural history of GD, with pulmonary failure and death reported before the ERT era. In ASMD, ILD is frequent and is usually associated with spleen enlargement, low platelet cell count and low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Results of ERT are promising regarding preliminary results of olipudase alfa in paediatric and adult ASMD populations. The most frequent respiratory manifestation in FD is COPD-like symptoms regardless of smoking habit and dyspnoea due to congestive heart failure. Early diagnosis of these three LSDs is crucial to prevent irreversible organ damage. Early initiation of ERT can, at least in part, prevent organ failure."

    "title": "The Role of Exosomes in Lysosomal Storage Disorders.",
    "abstract": "Exosomes, small membrane-bound organelles formed from endosomal membranes, represent a heterogenous source of biological and pathological biomarkers capturing the metabolic status of a cell. Exosomal cargo, including lipids, proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs, can either act as inter-cellular messengers or are shuttled for autophagic/lysosomal degradation. Most cell types in the central nervous system (CNS) release exosomes, which serve as long and short distance communicators between neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. Lysosomal storage disorders are diseases characterized by the accumulation of partially or undigested cellular waste. The exosomal content in these diseases is intrinsic to each individual disorder. Emerging research indicates that lysosomal dysfunction enhances exocytosis, and hence, in lysosomal disorders, exosomal secretion may play a role in disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, the unique properties of exosomes and their ability to carry cargo between adjacent cells and organs, and across the blood-brain barrier, make them attractive candidates for use as therapeutic delivery vehicles. Thus, understanding exosomal content and function may have utility in the treatment of specific lysosomal storage disorders. Since lysosomal dysfunction and the deficiency of at least one lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase, is associated with the development of parkinsonism, the study and use of exosomes may contribute to an improved understanding of Parkinson disease, potentially leading to new therapeutics."

    "title": "The Unique Phenotype of Lipid-Laden Macrophages.",
    "abstract": "Macrophages are key multi-talented cells of the innate immune system and are equipped with receptors involved in damage and pathogen recognition with connected immune response guiding signaling systems. In addition, macrophages have various systems that are involved in the uptake of extracellular and intracellular cargo. The lysosomes in macrophages play a central role in the digestion of all sorts of macromolecules and the entry of nutrients to the cytosol, and, thus, the regulation of endocytic processes and autophagy. Simplistically viewed, two macrophage phenotype extremes exist. On one end of the spectrum, the classically activated pro-inflammatory M1 cells are present, and, on the other end, alternatively activated anti-inflammatory M2 cells. A unique macrophage population arises when lipid accumulation occurs, either caused by flaws in the catabolic machinery, which is observed in lysosomal storage disorders, or as a result of an acquired condition, which is found in multiple sclerosis, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. The accompanying overload causes a unique metabolic activation phenotype, which is discussed here, and, consequently, a unifying phenotype is proposed."

    "abstract": "Genetic, epidemiological and experimental evidence implicate lysosomal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related synucleinopathies. Investigate several mouse models of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) and evaluate pathologies reminiscent of synucleinopathies. We obtained brain tissue from symptomatic mouse models of Gaucher, Fabry, Sandhoff, Niemann-Pick A (NPA), Hurler, Pompe and Niemann-Pick C (NPC) diseases and assessed for the presence of Lewy body-like pathology (proteinase K-resistant α-synuclein and tau aggregates) and neuroinflammation (microglial Iba1 and astrocytic GFAP) by immunofluorescence. All seven LSD models exhibited evidence of proteinopathy and/or inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). However, these phenotypes were divergent. Gaucher and Fabry mouse models displayed proteinase K-resistant α-synuclein and tau aggregates but no neuroinflammation; whereas Sandhoff, NPA and NPC showed marked neuroinflammation and no overt proteinopathy. Pompe disease animals uniquely displayed widespread distribution of tau aggregates accompanied by moderate microglial activation. Hurler mice also demonstrated proteinopathy and microglial activation. The present study demonstrated additional links between LSDs and pathogenic phenotypes that are hallmarks of synucleinopathies. The data suggest that lysosomal dysregulation can contribute to brain region-specific protein aggregation and induce widespread neuroinflammation in the brain. However, only a few LSD models examined exhibited phenotypes consistent with synucleinopathies. While no model can recapitulate the complexity of PD, they can enable the study of specific pathways and mechanisms contributing to disease pathophysiology. The present study provides evidence that there are existing, previously unutilized mouse models that can be employed to study pathogenic mechanisms and gain insights into potential PD subtypes, helping to determine if they are amenable to pathway-specific therapeutic interventions."

This was a descriptive, prospective cross-sectional study of 18 patients with Gaucher disease who underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging of both femurs and the lumbar spine. Semiquantitative analyses were performed on the basis of the bone marrow burden (BMB) score. We looked for linear relationships among the variables splenic volume, quality of life score, and BMB score. We identified a linear relationship between the BMB scores and splenic volume. The quality of life score showed no statistically significant relationship with splenic volume or the BMB score. The linear relationship between the BMB score and the splenic volume indicates that the extent of bone disease is greater in individuals with splenomegaly. No correlation was found between the BMB and quality of life scores, illustrating the insidious and silent progression of Gaucher disease."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease type 3 (GD3) is a severely debilitating disorder characterized by multisystemic manifestations and neurodegeneration. Enzyme replacement therapy alleviates visceral signs and symptoms but has no effect on neurological features. Ambroxol has been suggested as an enzyme enhancement agent. Some studies have confirmed its effectiveness in preventing the progression of neurological manifestations of neuronopathic Gaucher disease. In this study, we report two GD3 siblings in whom ambroxol combined with enzyme replacement therapy was initiated at different stages of the disease. We demonstrate the enzyme enhancement effect of ambroxol on L444P/H225Q;D409H glucocerebrosidase activity through results of fibroblast studies and long-term clinical outcomes of the two patients. The sibling diagnosed at the age of four-and-a-half years with significant neurological involvement manifested relatively rapid improvement on ambroxol treatment, followed by stabilization of further course. The younger sibling, in whom the treatment was started at seven weeks, displayed attention deficit and low average cognitive functioning at the age of seven years, but did not manifest other neurological symptoms. The difference in neurological outcomes indicates that ambroxol delayed or even halted the evolution of neurological manifestations in the younger sibling. This observation suggests that early initiation of ambroxol treatment may arrest neurological involvement in some GD3 patients."

    "abstract": "For the last three decades, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Gaucher disease (GD) has been available. We aimed to evaluate the effect of ERT on the pregnancy and obstetric outcome in a unique group of multiparous women with type 1 GD (GD1) who had pregnancies with and without ERT. The Gaucher Unit database (1987-2019) was searched for multiparous women who had pregnancies before and after the institution of ERT. Data were collected from the clinic files and study-specific questionnaires. Descriptive, correlation analysis and generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to study the effect of ERT and confounding variables on study outcomes. We identified 19 women with 105 pregnancies, among which 26 (24.7%) terminated in first-trimester miscarriage. The risk for miscarriage was associated with the severity of GD1 genotype and phenotype, but not with ERT usage. Early postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) was reported in 16 (84%) women after 25 deliveries (31.6%, 95% CI 21.6%-43.1%). The risks of early PPH and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions were significantly lower when ERT was used during pregnancy, OR (95% CI) 0.13 (0.03-0.54) and 0.27 (0.08-0.94), respectively, compared to pregnancies without the use of ERT. Enzyme replacement therapy during pregnancy is risk reducing for early PPH and RBC transfusions in women with GD1. We suggest considering ERT for the benefit of all pregnant women with GD1, including mild GD1."

    "title": "Clinicogenetic Profile, Treatment Modalities, and Mortality Predictors of Gaucher Disease: A 15-Year Retrospective Study.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, in which biallelic pathogenic variants in the Glucosidase beta acid (GBA) gene result in defective functioning of glucosylceramidase that causes deposition of glucocerebroside in cells. GD has 3 major types namely, non-neuronopathic (type I), acute neuronopathic (type II), and chronic neuronopathic (type III). Definite treatment options are limited and expensive. They succumb early to the disease, if untreated. There is paucity of studies from the Indian subcontinent, which elicit the factors resulting in their premature mortality. A retrospective study was carried out in a tertiary care setting of South India to assess the clinical profile, mutation spectrum, and various management strategies (only supportive therapy, enzyme replacement therapy [ERT], substrate reduction therapy [SRT] haematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT]), and mortality predictors of patients with GD from 2004 to 2019. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted. In silico predictions were performed for novel variants. There were 60 patients with all types of GD seen over the study period of 15 years. Their median age at diagnosis was 2 years. The median follow-up was for 5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 2-8). The overall mortality rate was 35%; however, it was only 10% in those receiving definite treatment. Mortality was higher (47.5%) by more than 4 folds in those only on supportive therapy. The median survival from the time of diagnosis was 6.3 years (IQR = 3.5-10.8) in the definite treatment group and 3.5 years (IQR = 1-5) in those on supportive therapy. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significant (p value 0.001) mortality difference between these groups. The multiple logistic regression analysis found the neuronopathic type (OR = 5) and only supportive therapy (OR = 6.3) to be the independent risk factors for premature mortality. GD is a rare disease with a high mortality rate, if left untreated. ERT and SRT are the definitive treatments which increase the survival. In resource-limited settings like India, with higher prevalence of the neuronopathic type, HSCT may be a more suitable definitive treatment option, due to its one-time intervention and cost, assuming similar efficacy to ERT. However, the efficacy and safety of HSCT in GD needs to be established further by substantial patient numbers undergoing it."

Thus far, <i>GBA1b</i> was documented as a <i>bone fide</i> GCase-encoding gene, while the role of <i>GBA1a</i> encoded protein remained unclear. In the present study, we characterized a mutant variant of the fly <i>GBA1a</i>, which underwent ERAD and mildly activated the UPR machinery. RNA-seq analyses of homozygous mutant flies revealed upregulation of inflammation-associated as well as of cell-cycle related genes and reduction in programmed cell death (PCD)-associated genes, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR. We also observed compromised cell death in the midgut of homozygous larvae and a reduction in pupation. Our results strongly indicated that <i>GBA1a</i>-encoded protein plays a role in midgut maturation during larvae development."

    "abstract": "The lysosomal storage disease Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is caused by impaired cholesterol efflux from lysosomes, which is accompanied by secondary lysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin and glucosylceramide (GlcCer). Similar to Gaucher disease (GD), patients deficient in glucocerebrosidase (GCase) degrading GlcCer, NPC patients show an elevated glucosylsphingosine and glucosylated cholesterol. In livers of mice lacking the lysosomal cholesterol efflux transporter NPC1, we investigated the expression of established biomarkers of lipid-laden macrophages of GD patients, their GCase status, and content on the cytosol facing glucosylceramidase GBA2 and lysosomal integral membrane protein type B (LIMP2), a transporter of newly formed GCase to lysosomes. Livers of 80-week-old <i>Npc1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed a partially reduced GCase protein and enzymatic activity. In contrast, GBA2 levels tended to be reciprocally increased with the GCase deficiency. In <i>Npc1</i><sup>-/-</sup> liver, increased expression of lysosomal enzymes (cathepsin D, acid ceramidase) was observed as well as increased markers of lipid-stressed macrophages (GPNMB and galectin-3). Immunohistochemistry showed that the latter markers are expressed by lipid laden Kupffer cells. Earlier reported increase of LIMP2 in <i>Npc1</i><sup>-/-</sup> liver was confirmed. Unexpectedly, immunohistochemistry showed that LIMP2 is particularly overexpressed in the hepatocytes of the <i>Npc1</i><sup>-/-</sup> liver. LIMP2 in these hepatocytes seems not to only localize to (endo)lysosomes. The recent recognition that LIMP2 harbors a cholesterol channel prompts the speculation that LIMP2 in <i>Npc1</i><sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes might mediate export of cholesterol into the bile and thus protects the hepatocytes."

    "abstract": "TMEM106B is a transmembrane protein localized to the endo-lysosomal compartment. Genome-wide association studies have identified <i>TMEM106B</i> as a risk modifier of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, especially with progranulin haploinsufficiency. We recently demonstrated that TMEM106B loss rescues progranulin null mouse phenotypes including lysosomal enzyme dysregulation, neurodegeneration and behavioural alterations. However, the reason whether TMEM106B is involved in other neurodegenerative lysosomal diseases is unknown. Here, we evaluate the potential role of TMEM106B in modifying the progression of lysosomal storage disorders using progranulin-independent models of Gaucher disease and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. To study Gaucher disease, we employ a pharmacological approach using the inhibitor conduritol B epoxide in wild-type and hypomorphic <i>Tmem106b</i>-/- mice. TMEM106B depletion ameliorates neuronal degeneration and some behavioural abnormalities in the pharmacological model of Gaucher disease, similar to its effect on certain progranulin null phenotypes. In order to examine the role of TMEM106B in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, we crossbred <i>Tmem106b-/-</i> mice with <i>Ppt1-/-</i>, a genetic model of the disease. In contrast to its conduritol B epoxide-rescuing effect, TMEM106B loss exacerbates Purkinje cell degeneration and motor deficits in <i>Ppt1-/-</i> mice. Mechanistically, TMEM106B is known to interact with subunits of the vacuolar ATPase and influence lysosomal acidification. In the pharmacological Gaucher disease model, the acidified lysosomal compartment is enhanced and TMEM106B loss rescues <i>in vivo</i> phenotypes. In contrast, gene-edited neuronal loss of <i>Ppt1</i> causes a reduction in vacuolar ATPase levels and impairment of the acidified lysosomal compartment, and TMEM106B deletion exacerbates the mouse <i>Ppt1-/-</i> phenotype. Our findings indicate that TMEM106B differentially modulates the progression of the lysosomal storage disorders Gaucher disease and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. The effect of TMEM106B in neurodegeneration varies depending on vacuolar ATPase state and modulation of lysosomal pH. These data suggest TMEM106B as a target for correcting lysosomal pH alterations, and in particular for therapeutic intervention in Gaucher disease and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis."

To date, the regulation of sclerostin has been attributed exclusively to the transcriptional downregulation of the <i>Sost</i> gene hours after stimulation. Using mouse models and rodent cell lines, we describe the rapid, minute-scale post-translational degradation of sclerostin protein by the lysosome following mechanical load and PTH. We present a model, integrating both new and established mechanically and hormonally activated effectors into the regulated degradation of sclerostin by lysosomes. Using a mouse forelimb mechanical loading model, we find transient inhibition of lysosomal degradation or the upstream mechano-signaling pathway controlling sclerostin abundance impairs subsequent load-induced bone formation by preventing sclerostin degradation. We also link dysfunctional lysosomes to aberrant sclerostin regulation using human Gaucher disease iPSCs. These results reveal how bone anabolic cues post-translationally regulate sclerostin abundance in osteocytes to regulate bone formation."

In this observational study, we recorded objective data on sleep macro- and microarchitecture repeatedly over several nights before and during the COVID-19 government-imposed lockdown. The main objective was to evaluate changes in patterns of sleep duration and architecture during home confinement using the pre-confinement period as a control. Participants were regular users of a sleep-monitoring headband that records, stores, and automatically analyzes physiological data in real time, equivalent to polysomnography. We measured sleep onset duration, total sleep time, duration of sleep stages (N2, N3, and rapid eye movement [REM]), and sleep continuity. Via the user's smartphone application, participants filled in questionnaires on how lockdown changed working hours, eating behavior, and daily life at home. They also filled in the Insomnia Severity Index, reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaires, allowing us to create selected subgroups. The 599 participants were mainly men (71%) of median age 47 (interquartile range: 36-59). Compared to before lockdown, during lockdown individuals slept more overall (mean +3·83 min; SD: ±1.3), had less deep sleep (N3), more light sleep (N2), and longer REM sleep (mean +3·74 min; SD: ±0.8). They exhibited less weekend-specific changes, suggesting less sleep restriction during the week. Changes were most pronounced in individuals reporting eveningness preferences, suggesting relative sleep deprivation in this population and exacerbated sensitivity to societal changes. This unique dataset should help us understand the effects of lockdown on sleep architecture and on our health."

Other hematological manifestations such as coagulation abnormalities, platelet dysfunction, gammopathy, and other hematological malignancies associated with GD are also discussed. Current and future treatment modalities are delineated, including enzyme replacement and substrate reduction therapy, pharmacological chaperon, and gene therapy. A literature search was conducted to identify original research articles relevant to hematology manifestations and GD published before November 2020.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Patients with GD should be ideally followed and treated in a center of excellence where the GD expert benefits from experienced consultants in relevant disciplines. Due to the availability of several very expensive treatment options, it is important to have an unbiased expert who can select the most suitable management for the individual patients (including withholding prescription in asymptomatic patients)."

Earlier diagnosis and advances in treatment have improved the life expectancy of IMD patients over the last decades, with the majority of patients now surviving beyond the age of 20. This has created a new challenge: as they grow up, the care of IMD patients' needs to be transferred from metabolic pediatricians to metabolic physicians specialized in treating adults, through a process called \"transition.\" The purpose of this study was to assess how this transition is managed in Europe: a survey was sent to all 77 centers of the European Reference Network for Hereditary Metabolic Disorders (MetabERN) to collect information and to identify unmet needs regarding the transition process. Data was collected from 63/77 (81%) healthcare providers (HCPs) from 20 EU countries. Responders were mostly metabolic pediatricians; of these, only ~40% have received appropriate training in health issues of adolescent metabolic patients. In most centers (~67%) there is no designated transition coordinator. About 50% of centers provide a written individualized transition protocol, which is standardized in just ~20% of cases. In 77% of centers, pediatricians share a medical summary, transition letter and emergency plan with the adult team and the patient. According to our responders, 11% of patients remain under pediatric care throughout their life. The main challenges identified by HCPs in managing transition are lack of time and shortage of adult metabolic physician positions, while the implementations that are most required for a successful transition include: medical staff dedicated to transition, a transition coordinator, and specific metabolic training for adult physicians. Our study shows that the transition process of IMD patients in Europe is far from standardized and in most cases is inadequate or non-existent. A transition coordinator to facilitate collaboration between the pediatric and adult healthcare teams should be central to any transition program. Standardized operating procedures, together with adequate financial resources and specific training for adult physicians focused on IMDs are the key aspects that must be improved in the rare metabolic field to establish successful transition processes in Europe."

Patients with relevant symptoms and all patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) were invited for further assessment at an ambulatory care visit. Survival of hospitalization for COVID-19. Respiratory, cognitive, and functional symptoms were assessed by telephone with the Q3PC cognitive screening questionnaire and a checklist of symptoms. At the ambulatory care visit, patients underwent pulmonary function tests, lung computed tomographic scan, psychometric and cognitive tests (including the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey and 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), and, for patients who had been hospitalized in the ICU or reported ongoing symptoms, echocardiography. Among 834 eligible patients, 478 were evaluated by telephone (mean age, 61 years [SD, 16 years]; 201 men, 277 women). During the telephone interview, 244 patients (51%) declared at least 1 symptom that did not exist before COVID-19: fatigue in 31%, cognitive symptoms in 21%, and new-onset dyspnea in 16%. There was further evaluation in 177 patients (37%), including 97 of 142 former ICU patients. The median 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory score (n = 130) was 4.5 (interquartile range, 3.0-5.0) for reduced motivation and 3.7 (interquartile range, 3.0-4.5) for mental fatigue (possible range, 1 [best] to 5 [worst]).

Serology was positive in 172 of 177 outpatients (97%). Four months after hospitalization for COVID-19, a cohort of patients frequently reported symptoms not previously present, and lung-scan abnormalities were common among those who were tested. These findings are limited by the absence of a control group and of pre-COVID assessments in this cohort.

Gba KI mice developed age-dependent pupil dilation deficits to an anti-muscarinic agent; histologically, the iris covered the anterior part of the lens with adhesions between the iris and the anterior surface of the lens (posterior synechia). This may prevent pupil dilation in general, beyond an un-responsiveness of the iris to anti-muscarinics. Gba KI mice displayed atrophy and pigment dispersion of the iris, and occlusion of the iridocorneal angle by pigment-laden cells, reminiscent of secondary open angle glaucoma. Gba KI mice showed progressive thinning of the retina consistent with retinal degeneration. GluSph levels were increased in the anterior and posterior segments of the eye, suggesting that accumulation of lipids in the eye may contribute to degeneration in this compartment. We conclude that the Gba KI model provides robust and reproducible eye phenotypes which may be used to test for efficacy and establish biomarkers for GBA1-related therapies."

The authors review the literature pertaining to the effectiveness of currently available therapies and describe new pharmacotherapies under development, especially for young patients. For pediatric patients with non-neuronopathic Gaucher disease, there may be new therapeutic options on the horizon in the form of gene therapy or small molecule glucocerebrosidase chaperones. These have the potential to result in a cure for systemic disease manifestations and/or to reduce the cost and convenience of treatment. For children with neuronopathic Gaucher disease, the challenge of targeting therapy to the central nervous system is being explored through new modalities including brain-targeted gene therapy, <i>in-utero</i> therapy, brain-penetrant small molecule chaperones, and other methods that convey enzyme across the blood-brain barrier. Indeed, these are exciting times for both pediatric patients with Gaucher disease and those with other lysosomal storage disorders."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD), the most common lysosomal storage disorder (LSD), is caused by autosomal recessive mutations of the glucocerebrosidase gene, <i>GBA1</i>. In the majority of cases, GD has a non-neuropathic chronic form with adult onset (GD1), while other cases are more acute and severer neuropathic forms with early onset (GD2/3). Currently, no radical therapies are established for GD2/3. Notably, GD1, but not GD2/3, is associated with increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), the elucidation of which might provide a clue for novel therapeutic strategies. In this context, the objective of the present study is to discuss that the evolvability of α-synuclein (αS) might be differentially involved in GD subtypes. Hypothetically, aging-associated PD features with accumulation of αS, and the autophagy-lysosomal dysfunction might be an antagonistic pleiotropy phenomenon derived from αS evolvability in the development in GD1, without which neuropathies like GD2/3 might be manifested due to the autophagy-lysosomal dysfunction. Supposing that the increased severity of GD2/3 might be attributed to the decreased activity of αS evolvability, suppressing the expression of β-synuclein (βS), a potential buffer against αS evolvability, might be therapeutically efficient. Of interest, a similar view might be applicable to Niemann-Pick type C (NPC), another LSD, given that the adult type of NPC, which is comorbid with Alzheimer's disease, exhibits milder medical symptoms compared with those of infantile NPC. Thus, it is predicted that the evolvability of amyloid β and tau, might be beneficial for the adult type of NPC. Collectively, a better understanding of amyloidogenic evolvability in the pathogenesis of LSD may inform rational therapy development."

    "abstract": "Increased activity of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) was reported earlier in patients with different types of mucopolysaccharidoses. DPP-IV (also known as CD26 lymphocyte T surface antigen) is a transmembrane protein showing protease activity. This enzyme displays various functions in the organism and plays an important role in multiple processes like glucose metabolism, nociception, cell-adhesion, psychoneuroendocrine regulation, immune response and cardiovascular adaptation. In order to evaluate DPP-IV in lysosomal storage diseases (LSD), we examined its activity in plasma samples from 307 patients affected with 24 different LSDs and in 75 control persons. Our results revealed elevated DPP-IV activity especially in individuals affected with mucolipidosis II/III, alpha-mannosidosis, and mucopolysaccharidoses types III, II, and I (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In other LSDs the DPP-IV activity was still significantly increased, but to a lesser extent. In patients with Gaucher disease, ceroid lipofuscinosis type 1 (CLN1), Niemann-Pick disease type C and A, Krabbe and Pompe diseases, gangliosidosis GM2 and metachromatic leukodystrophy discreet or no changes in DPP-IV activity were observed. DPP-IV may serve as a first-tier diagnostic procedure or additional biochemical analysis in recognizing patients with some LSDs. DPP-IV may become an object of basic research for a better understanding of LSDs."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is the most common lysosomal storage disease and requires long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which is costly and inconvenient for resource-limited countries such as Thailand. The authors present the case of a 1-year-old boy who was diagnosed with GD type 1 with a homozygous mutation at c.1448 T>C (L444P). He was treated with ERT and matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed 6 months after the ERT was initiated. At a 3-year follow-up after the HSCT, he had full engraftment and the Lyso-GL1 levels were also at an acceptable level, which indicated disease remission. In conclusion, the authors suggest HSCT for long-term remission of GD in children."

    "title": "Elevated glucosylsphingosine in Gaucher disease induced pluripotent stem cell neurons deregulates lysosomal compartment through mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in GBA1, the gene that encodes lysosomal β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Mild mutations in GBA1 cause type 1 non-neuronopathic GD, whereas severe mutations cause types 2 and 3 neuronopathic GD (nGD). GCase deficiency results in the accumulation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph). GlcSph is formed by deacylation of GlcCer by the lysosomal enzyme acid ceramidase. Brains from patients with nGD have high levels of GlcSph, a lipid believed to play an important role in nGD, but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. To identify these mechanisms, we used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from nGD patients. We found that elevated levels of GlcSph activate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), interfering with lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, which were restored by incubation of nGD neurons with mTOR inhibitors. We also found that inhibition of acid ceramidase prevented both, mTOR hyperactivity and lysosomal dysfunction, suggesting that these alterations were caused by GlcSph accumulation in the mutant neurons. To directly determine whether GlcSph can cause mTOR hyperactivation, we incubated wild-type neurons with exogenous GlcSph. Remarkably, GlcSph treatment recapitulated the mTOR hyperactivation and lysosomal abnormalities in mutant neurons, which were prevented by coincubation of GlcSph with mTOR inhibitors. We conclude that elevated GlcSph activates an mTORC1-dependent pathogenic mechanism that is responsible for the lysosomal abnormalities of nGD neurons. We also identify acid ceramidase as essential to the pathogenesis of nGD, providing a new therapeutic target for treating GBA1-associated neurodegeneration."

    "abstract": "Objective For patients with Gaucher disease (GD), a rare, inherited lysosomal storage disease, obtaining a definitive diagnosis is currently time-consuming and costly. A simplified screening method to measure the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) activity using dried blood spots (DBS) on filter paper has recently been developed. Using this newly developed screening method, we evaluated real-world GD screening in patients suspected of having GD. Methods This multicenter, cross-sectional, observational study with a diagnostic intervention component evaluated real-world screening in patients suspected of having GD based on their clinical symptoms and a platelet count <120,000/μL. The endpoint was the number of patients with low GBA activity determined using DBS. Results In 994 patients who underwent initial DBS screening, 77 had low GBA activity. The assay was not repeated in 1 patient who was diagnosed as having a high possibility of GD due to clinical symptoms, and a further 21 patients completed the study without undergoing the second assay. Of the remaining 55 patients who had 2 DBS assays performed, 11 had a low GBA activity in both assays. Overall, DBS screening identified 12 (1.2%) patients with a low GBA activity, a proportion consistent with prior screening studies. Conclusion These results suggest that the simplified DBS method was less burdensome to patients, was easily utilized by many physicians, and could be a useful first-tier screening assay for GD prior to initiating burdensome genetic testing."

    "abstract": "Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) cause Gaucher disease (GD) and are the most commonly known genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). Ambroxol is one of the most effective pharmacological chaperones of GCase. Fourteen GD patients, six PD patients with mutations in the GBA gene (GBA-PD), and thirty controls were enrolled. GCase activity and hexosylsphingosine (HexSph) concentration were measured in dried blood and macrophage spots using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The effect of ambroxol on GCase translocation to lysosomes was assessed using confocal microscopy. The results showed that ambroxol treatment significantly increased GCase activity in cultured macrophages derived from patient blood monocytic cell (PBMC) of GD (by 3.3-fold) and GBA-PD patients (by 3.5-fold) compared to untreated cells (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) four days after cultivation. Ambroxol treatment significantly reduced HexSph concentration in GD (by 2.1-fold) and GBA-PD patients (by 1.6-fold) (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). GD macrophage treatment resulted in increased GCase level and increased enzyme colocalization with the lysosomal marker LAMP2. The possible binding modes of ambroxol to mutant GCase carrying N370S amino acid substitution at pH 4.7 were examined using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. The ambroxol position characterized by minimal binding free energy was observed in close vicinity to the residue, at position 370. Taken together, these data showed that PBMC-derived macrophages could be used for assessing ambroxol therapy response for GD patients and also for GBA-PD patients."

In 2009 it was identified as a pharmacological chaperone for mutant glucocerebrosidase, albeit in a several-fold higher dose. Unfortunately, there have been no pharma-driven clinical trials to establish its use. Thus, real-world observational data are needed on the safety and efficacy of ambroxol for patients with Gaucher disease (GD) and GBA-Parkinson disease (GBA-PD). Clinicians treating patients with ambroxol for GD and GBA-PD were approached to collaborate in an investigator-initiated registry. Anonymized data were collected, including demographics, GD type, GD-specific therapy (when applicable), adverse events (AEs), and, when available, efficacy data. We report the data of the first 41 patients (25 females) at a median (range) age 17 (1.5-74) from 13 centers; 11 with GD type 1(four diagnosed with PD), 27 with neuronopathic GD (nGD), and three GBA mutation carriers with PD. The median (range) treatment period and maximum dose of ambroxol were 19 (1-76) months and 435 (75-1485) mg/day, respectively. One patient with type 2 GD died of her disease. No other severe AEs were reported. Twelve patients experienced AE, including minor bowel discomfort, cough, allergic reaction, mild proteinuria, dizziness and disease progression. Clinical benefits were reported in 25 patients, including stable or improved neurological status, increased physical activity, and reduced fatigue. Until the approval of specific therapies for nGD and disease-modification for GBA-PD, these preliminary data may be encouraging to physicians and patients who consider an off-label use of ambroxol."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare inherited multiorgan disorder, yet a diagnosis can be significantly delayed due to a broad spectrum of symptoms and lack of disease awareness. Recently, the prototype of a GD point-scoring system (PSS) was established by the Gaucher Earlier Diagnosis Consensus (GED-C) initiative, and more recently, validated in Gaucher patients in UK. In our study, the original GED-C PSS was tested in Finnish GD patients. Furthermore, the feasibility of point scoring large electronic health record (EHR) data set by data mining to identify potential undiagnosed GD cases was evaluated. This biobank study was conducted in collaboration with two Finnish biobanks. Five previously diagnosed Finnish GD patients and ~ 170,000 adult biobank subjects were included in the study. The original PSS was locally adjusted due to data availability issues and applied to the Finnish EHR data representing special health care recordings. All GD patients had high levels of the biomarker lyso-Gb1 and deleterious <i>GBA</i> mutations. One patient was a compound heterozygote with a novel variant, potentially pathogenic mutation. Finnish EHR data allowed the retrospective assessment of 27-30 of the 32 original GED-C signs/co-variables. Total point scores of GD patients were high but variable, 6-18.5 points per patient (based on the available data on 28-29 signs/co-variables per patient). All GD patients had been recorded with anaemia while only three patients had a record of splenomegaly. 0.72% of biobank subjects were assigned at least 6 points but none of these potential \"GD suspects\" had a point score as high as 18.5. Splenomegaly had been recorded for 0.25% of biobank subjects and was associated with variable point score distribution and co-occurring ICD-10 diagnoses. This study provides an indicative GED-C PSS score range for confirmed GD patients, also representing potential mild cases, and demonstrates the feasibility of scoring Finnish EHR data by data mining in order to screen for undiagnosed GD patients. Further prioritisation of the \"GD suspects\" with more developed algorithms and data-mining approaches is needed. This study was funded by Shire (now part of Takeda)."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of Gaucher disease (GD) in Japan is much lower than that in Western countries; therefore, data on Japanese pediatric patients with GD type 1 are currently limited. The present study reports on the case of a Japanese pediatric patient with GD type 1 who was diagnosed when she presented with hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and slight anemia at the age of 2 years. Serology tests revealed high levels of acid phosphatase (ACP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). A bone marrow biopsy revealed the presence of Gaucher cells. Abdominal MRI indicated huge hepatosplenomegaly. Erlenmeyer flask deformity was observed on X-ray examination. MRI of the femora featured a high-intensity area within the diaphysis region. The enzymatic activity of leukocyte β-glucosidase, the measurement of which is necessary for a definitive diagnosis of GD, had decreased to 186.7 nmol/h/mg (reference range, 1,424.0-2,338.0 nmol/h/mg). Based on these results, the patient was clinically diagnosed with GD. Glucocerebrosidase gene analysis identified the compound heterozygote mutation of F213I (c.754T>A) on exon 7 and L444P (c.1448T>C) on exon 11. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) along with an intravenous infusion of 60 U/kg of imiglucerase every other week was initiated following diagnosis. Hemoglobin levels and the platelet count gradually improved and normalized after two years. ACP and ACE levels, biomarkers of the progression of GD, also improved. Abdominal MRI at six months after the initiation of ERT revealed a decrease in the size of the liver and spleen, which normalized after 1 year. Conversely, MRI of the femora indicated no improvement in the high-intensity area within the diaphysis region for 10 years."

    "abstract": "Fractures in Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) patients cause significant morbidity. Fracture risk may be decreased by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) but not eliminated. When considering initiation of treatment, it is useful to know to what extent fixed patient-specific factors determine risk for future fractures beyond standard risk factors that change with time and treatment, such as decreased bone mineral density. We developed a tool called the GRAF score (Gaucher Risk Assessment for Fracture) that applies 5 widely available characteristics (sex, age at treatment initiation [ATI], time interval between diagnosis and treatment initiation, splenectomy status, history of pre-treatment bone crisis) and provides a practical method to assess future fracture risk when imiglucerase ERT is initiated. Inclusion criteria: GD1 patients in the International Collaborative Gaucher Group Gaucher Registry as of September 2019 initially treated with alglucerase/imiglucerase; known splenectomy status; at least one skeletal assessment on treatment (3216 of 6422 patients). Data were analyzed by ATI group (< 18, ≥ 18 to < 50, or ≥ 50 years of age) using Cox proportional hazards regression with all 5 risk factors included in the multivariable model. A composite risk score was calculated by summing the contribution of each parameter weighted by the strength of its association (regression coefficient) with fracture risk. Patients were followed from the date of treatment initiation (or age 18 years for patients if treatment started earlier) to the date of first adult fracture (n = 288 first fracture endpoints), death, or end of follow-up. The GRAF score for each ATI group was associated with a 2.7-fold increased risk of adult fracture for each one-point increase (p < 0.02 for < 18 ATI, p < 0.0001 for ≥ 18 to < 50 ATI and ≥ 50 ATI). The GRAF score is a tool to be used with bone density and other modifiable, non-GD-specific risk factors (e.g. smoking, alcohol intake, frailty) to inform physicians and previously untreated GD1 patients about risk for a future fracture after starting imiglucerase regardless of whether there is an eventual switch to an alternative ERT or to substrate reduction therapy. GRAF can also help predict the extent that fracture risk increases if initiation of treatment is further delayed."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of clinically heterogeneous disorders affecting the function of lysosomes and are characterized by an accumulation of undigested substrates within several cell types. In recent years there have been substantial advances in supportive care and drug treatment for some LSDs, leading to improved patient survival, as seen in Gaucher, Pompe and Fabry disease and some Mucopolysaccharidoses; however, many symptoms still persist. Thus it is now even more important to improve patients' quality of life and reduce symptoms and comorbidities. One potential way of achieving this goal is through adjunct nutritional therapy, which is challenging as patients may be overweight with associated consequences, or malnourished, or underweight. Furthermore, drugs used to treat LSDs can modify the metabolic status and needs of patients. There are currently not enough data to make specific dietary recommendations for individual LSDs; however, suggestions can be made for managing clinical manifestations of the diseases, as well as treatment-associated adverse events. The metabolic and nutritional status of adult patients must be regularly assessed and individualized dietary plans may be created to cater to a patient's specific needs. Damage to the autophagic process is a common feature in LSDs that is potentially sensitive to dietary manipulation and needs to be assessed in clinical studies."

Nevertheless, the only therapy targeting GD2 that is approved to date is the monoclonal antibody dinutuximab, which is used in the therapy of neuroblastoma. The relevance of GD2 as a target in other tumor entities remains to be elucidated. Here, we analyzed the expression of GD2 in different pediatric tumor entities by flow cytometry and tested two approaches for targeting GD2. H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma (H3K27M-mutant DMG) samples showed the highest expression of GD2 with all cells strongly positive for the antigen. Ewing's sarcoma (ES) samples also showed high expression, but displayed intra- and intertumor heterogeneity. Osteosarcoma had low to intermediate expression with a high percentage of GD2-negative cells. Dinutuximab beta in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide was used to treat a five-year-old girl with refractory ES. Disease control lasted over 12 months until a single partially GD2-negative intracranial metastasis was detected. In order to target GD2 in H3K27M-mutant DMG, we blocked ganglioside synthesis via eliglustat, since dinutuximab cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Eliglustat is an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, and it is used for treating children with Gaucher's disease. Eliglustat completely inhibited the proliferation of primary H3K27M-mutant DMG cells in vitro. In summary, our data provide evidence that dinutuximab might be effective in tumors with high GD2 expression. Moreover, disrupting the ganglioside metabolism in H3K27M-mutant DMG could open up a new therapeutic option for this highly fatal cancer."

The most common forms of dementia are Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Lewy body dementia, which includes Parkinson's disease (PD) dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Genomic studies over the past 3 decades have identified variants in genes regulating lipid transporters and endosomal processes as major risk determinants for AD, with the most significant being inheritance of the ε4 allele of the APOE gene, encoding apolipoprotein E. A recent surge in research on lipid handling and metabolism in glia and neurons has established defective lipid clearance from endolysosomes as a central driver of AD pathogenesis. The most prevalent genetic risk factors for DLB are the APOE ε4 allele, and heterozygous loss of function mutations in the GBA gene, encoding the lysosomal catabolic enzyme glucocerebrosidase; whilst heterozygous mutations in the GRN gene, required for lysosomal catabolism of sphingolipids, are responsible for a significant proportion of FTD cases. Homozygous mutations in the GBA or GRN genes produce the lysosomal storage diseases Gaucher disease and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Research from mouse and cell culture models, and neuropathological evidence from lysosomal storage diseases, has established that impaired cholesterol or sphingolipid catabolism is sufficient to produce the pathological hallmarks of dementia, indicating that defective lipid catabolism is a common mechanism in the etiology of dementia."

GD affects several organs and tissues, including the brain in certain variants of the disease. Heterozygous GBA1 variants are a major genetic risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease. The RIPK3 kinase is relevant in GD and its deficiency improves the neurological and visceral symptoms in a murine GD model. RIPK3 mediates necroptotic-like cell death: it is unknown whether the role of RIPK3 in GD is the direct induction of necroptosis or if it has a more indirect function by mediating necrosis-independent. Also, the mechanisms that activate RIPK3 in GD are currently unknown. In this study, we show that c-Abl tyrosine kinase participates upstream of RIPK3 in GD. We found that the active, phosphorylated form of c-Abl is increased in several GD models, including patient's fibroblasts and GBA null mice. Furthermore, its pharmacological inhibition with the FDA-approved drug Imatinib decreased RIPK3 signaling. We found that c-Abl interacts with RIPK3, that RIPK3 is phosphorylated at a tyrosine site, and that this phosphorylation is reduced when c-Abl is inhibited. Genetic ablation of c-Abl in neuronal GD and GD mice models significantly reduced RIPK3 activation and MLKL downstream signaling. These results showed that c-Abl signaling is a new upstream pathway that activates RIPK3 and that its inhibition is an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of GD."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) is an inherited lysosomal disorder with multisystemic effects in patients. Hallmark symptoms include hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, and bone disease with varying degrees of severity. Mutations in a single gene, glucosidase beta acid 1 (<i>GBA1</i>), are the underlying cause for the disorder, resulting in insufficient activity of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, which in turn leads to a progressive accumulation of the lipid component glucocerebroside. In this study, we treat mice with signs consistent with GD1, with hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells transduced with a lentiviral vector containing an RNA transcript that, after reverse transcription, results in codon-optimized cDNA that, upon its integration into the genome encodes for functional human glucocerebrosidase. Five months after gene transfer, a highly significant reduction in glucocerebroside accumulation with subsequent reversal of hepatosplenomegaly, restoration of blood parameters, and a tendency of increased bone mass and density was evident in vector-treated mice compared to non-treated controls. Furthermore, histopathology revealed a prominent reduction of Gaucher cell infiltration after gene therapy. The vector displayed an oligoclonal distribution pattern but with no sign of vector-induced clonal dominance and a typical lentiviral vector integration profile. Cumulatively, our findings support the initiation of the first clinical trial for GD1 using the lentiviral vector described here."

    "title": "Functional Connectivity Analysis in Heterozygous Glucocerebrosidase Mutation Carriers.",
    "abstract": "There is evidence that alterations in functional connectivity (FC) of the striatocortical circuits may appear before the onset of clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this study was to investigate FC of the striatocortical circuitry in asymptomatic carriers of heterozygous glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutations, which pose a significant risk for developing PD. Twenty-one parents of confirmed Gaucher disease patients who were carrying heterozygous GBA mutations and 18 healthy individuals matched for age and gender were included. GBA mutation analysis was performed in all participants. Clinical evaluation included neurological examination, Mini Mental State Examination, and UPDRS Part III. Structural and functional MRI data of 18 asymptomatic GBA mutation carriers (asGBAmc) and 17 healthy controls (HC) were available. FC was analyzed with seed-based approach. Eleven asymptomatic mutation carriers had heterozygous p.L483P mutation, 6 subjects heterozygous p.N409S mutation and 1 subject heterozygous p.R392G mutation in GBA gene. Mini-Mental State Examination mean score was 28.77 (±1.16) and 29.64 (±0.70) in asGBAmc and HC groups, respectively (p = 0.012). Significant increased connectivityConclusion:Our results suggest that alterations in striatocortical FC can be detected in asymptomatic heterozygous GBA mutation carriers who are at risk of developing PD. These findings may provide insight into network changes during the asymptomatic phase of PD."

    "title": "Clinicohistological correlation of etiological spectrum of chronic liver disease diagnosed during noncirrhotic stages in children: Can need of liver biopsy be obviated?",
    "abstract": "Limited data exist regarding the etiological spectrum of the subset of chronic liver diseases (CLDs) diagnosed in noncirrhotic states in children. Our primary objective was to study the clinicoetiological profile of CLDs detected in noncirrhotic stages in children younger than 12 years of age. The secondary objective was to find the hepatic histological correlation of provisional diagnosis by different ranks of doctors. This was an observational epidemiological study, cross-sectional in design, conducted in a tertiary-care setting over a 2-year period. Thirty-seven cases were enrolled, with a mean ± SD age of 8 ± 4.1 years and a male:female ratio of 1.8:1. Etiologies noted were Wilson disease (<i>n</i> = 8), autoimmune hepatitis (<i>n</i> = 4), secondary hemochromatosis (<i>n</i> = 4), chronic hepatitis B (<i>n</i> = 3), chronic hepatitis C (<i>n</i> = 2), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (<i>n</i> = 2), progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (<i>n</i> = 2), extrahepatic biliary atresia (<i>n</i> = 2), Alagille syndrome (<i>n</i> = 1), galactosemia (<i>n</i> = 1), Gaucher disease (<i>n</i> = 1), Niemann-Pick disease (<i>n</i> = 1), and Budd-Chiari syndrome (<i>n</i> = 1), with an inconclusive diagnosis in five children. Relevant investigations were ordered more frequently by the specialist consultant (SC) and super specialist (SS) combined in comparison with the senior resident (SR) and junior resident (JR) together. (<i>P</i> = 0.0013). Irrelevance of the tests ordered was significantly higher in the junior tier (JR and SR; SR > JR) in contrast to the senior tier of doctors (SC and SS) (<i>P</i> < 0.01). The clinicohistological correlation of an etiological diagnosis significantly differed between the junior and senior ranks of physicians. We noted that an ideal clinical acumen could help to avoid liver biopsy for etiological diagnosis in 78.3% (29/37) of the study population. Interpretation of clinical presentation by the senior set of doctors is preferable, which could obviate the need for liver biopsy regarding diagnosis in a proportion of pediatric CLD patients."

Modern approaches to conduct ancestral sequence reconstruction for proteins are built upon a conceptual framework from journal founder Emile Zuckerkandl. On top of this, work on maximum likelihood phylogenetics published in Journal of Molecular Evolution in 1996 was one of the first approaches for generating maximum likelihood ancestral sequences of proteins. From its computational history, future model development needs as well as potential applications in areas as diverse as computational systems biology, molecular community ecology, infectious disease therapeutics and other biomedical applications, and biotechnology are discussed. From its past in this journal, there is a bright future for ancestral sequence reconstruction in the field of evolutionary biology."

    "abstract": "Alglucerase enzyme replacement therapy was approved for Gaucher disease (GD) in the United States in 1991; imiglucerase in 1994. We report hematologic, visceral, bone pain, bone crisis, height, weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI) outcomes in patients treated for 20 (±3) years with subset analyses based on pre-treatment severity, genotype, and age at treatment initiation. GD type 1 (GD1) patients in the ICGG Gaucher Registry with complete sets of baseline, 10-year, and 20-year data are included (N = 475). Ten-year and 20-year data are compared to pre-treatment baseline, stratified by splenectomy status. Non-splenectomized patients: Improvements observed at 10 years were maintained at 20 years for most outcomes. Mean changes from baseline at 10 and 20 years, respectively, were: spleen volume: 18.2 multiples of normal (MN) to 5.1 MN and 4.2 MN; liver volume: 1.8 MN to 1.0 MN and 1.0 MN; hemoglobin: 11.4 g/dL to 13.7 g/dL and 13.8 g/dL; platelet count: 91.6 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L to 168.0 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L and 169.1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L; without bone crisis: 85.0% to 98.2% and 96.5%; without bone pain: 52.5% to 72.0% at 10 years, no significant change at 20 years (58.5%). Splenectomized patients: significant changes were observed in liver volume: 2.3 MN to 1.1 MN and 1.0 MN; hemoglobin: 11.7 g/dL to 13.3 g/dL and 13.4 g/dL; platelet count: 229.1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L to 288.1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L and 257.0 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L; without bone crisis: 52.2% to 91.3% and 100%; without bone pain: 16.3% to 30.6% (not significant) and 46.9%. Similar results were found in each of the subset analyses. Patients who start treatment during childhood have normal weight and height in young adulthood. Many treated adult patients are overweight or obese; however, this is consistent with BMI trends observed in the general population. After 1-2 years, the average biweekly imiglucerase dose is ~40 units/kg body weight. Imiglucerase is an effective, long-term treatment for GD1. In a long-term observational setting, improvements seen during early treatment years are sustained by continuing treatment for 20 years, except for bone pain in non-splenectomized patients. These results are consistent when analyzed by different patient subsets, including by disease severity."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD), resulting from biallelic mutations in the gene GBA1, is a monogenic recessively inherited Mendelian disorder with a wide range of phenotypic presentations. The more severe forms of the disease, acute neuronopathic GD (GD2) and chronic neuronopathic GD (GD3), also have a continuum of disease severity with an overlap in manifestations and limited genotype-phenotype correlation. In very young patients, assigning a definitive diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. Several recent studies highlight specific features of neuronopathic GD that may provide diagnostic clues. Distinguishing between the different GD types has important therapeutic implications. Currently there are limited treatment options specifically for neuronopathic GD due to the difficulty in delivering therapies across the blood-brain barrier. In this work, we present both classic and newly appreciated aspects of the Gaucher phenotype that can aid in discriminating between acute and chronic neuronopathic GD, and highlight the continuing therapeutic challenges."

It is essential to characterize and quantify the burden of disease in these patients. Here, we report a measure of muscle fat infiltration in children with infantile and pediatric late-onset Pompe disease (IPD and LOPD, respectively) to better understand the extent of muscle involvement. Eleven pediatric patients with Pompe disease (five IPD, six LOPD), ages 7-17 years, received whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WBMRI), muscle strength testing using the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale, functional assessment using gait, stairs, gowers, chair (GSGC), and urine glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc<sub>4</sub>) testing. The intramuscular fat seen on WBMRI was quantified using proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and correlated to appropriate muscle strength and functional tests, and urine Glc<sub>4</sub>. Patients with IPD, although younger, had higher mean PDFF values than LOPD patients (11.61% vs 8.52%). Significant correlation existed between PDFF and the GSGC assessment (<i>r</i> = .9273, <i>P</i> = .0003). Moderate correlation existed between PDFF and mMRC (<i>r</i> = -.667, <i>P</i> = .0831), and PDFF and urine Glc<sub>4</sub> (<i>r</i> = .6121, <i>P</i> = .0667). Anterior tibialis was in the top quartile of muscle involvement for patients with LOPD. In the past, physical therapy assessments alone have been used to track disease progression. Here, we show the clinical utility of WBMRI in quantifying muscle involvement in children with Pompe disease, especially regarding the novel involvement of anterior tibialis in children with LOPD, to better assess baseline muscle burden and mapping disease progression in children treated with ERT."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient enzymatic activity of acid β-glucosidase, resulting in accumulation of its substrate glucosylceramide, leading to debilitating visceral, hematologic, and skeletal manifestations. Women with GD1 are at increased risk for complications during pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum. Treatment with enzyme replacement therapy is generally recommended before and during pregnancy to reduce risks. Eliglustat, an oral substrate-reduction therapy, is a first-line treatment for adults with GD1 adults who have extensive, intermediate, or poor CYP2D6-metabolizer phenotypes (>90% of patients). We report on pregnancy outcomes among women in eliglustat trials who had unplanned pregnancies and female partners of men in the trials. In four phase 2 and 3 eliglustat trials of 393 adults with GD1, women of childbearing potential were required to use contraception, have monthly pregnancy tests, and discontinue eliglustat promptly if pregnant. In phase 2 and 3 trials, 18 women had 19 pregnancies, resulting in 14 healthy infants from 13 pregnancies (one set of twins), three elective terminations, one ectopic pregnancy, one spontaneous abortion, and one in utero death. Median estimated eliglustat exposure duration during pregnancy was 38 days. In phase 1 trials (non-GD1 subjects), one woman had a spontaneous abortion. Partners of 16 eliglustat-treated men with GD1 had 18 pregnancies, all resulting in healthy infants. Eliglustat is not approved during pregnancy due to limited data. Guidelines for clinicians and patients with GD that address use of eliglustat in women of childbearing potential are needed."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a recessive metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the <i>GBA</i> gene-encoded enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase. We characterized a cohort of 36 Albanian GD patients, 31 with GD type 1 and 5 affected by GD types 2, 3, and an intermediate GD phenotype between type 2 and type 3. Of the 12 different <i>GBA</i> alleles that we detected, the most frequently observed was p.Asn409Ser, followed by p.[Asp448His;His294Gln]. The prevalence of the p.Leu483Pro allele was approximately 10-fold lower than reported in other populations. We identified a novel pathogenic missense variant (c.1129G>A; p.Ala377Thr). All five of our non-type 1 patients had genotypes consisting of the p.[Asp448His;His294Gln] allele in combination with another severe <i>GBA</i> allele. The median Lyso-Gb1 level of treated patients carrying the p.[Asp448His;His294Gln] and no p.Asn409Ser allele was significantly higher than that of treated individuals homozygous or compound heterozygous for the p.Asn409Ser allele. In conclusion, the most important distinguishing features of the Albanian GD patient population are the underrepresentation of the p.Leu483Pro allele and an unusually high number of p.[Asp448His;His294Gln] alleles originating from a common Balkan founder event. The presence of at least one p.Asn409Ser allele is associated with mild disease and low Lyso-Gb1 biomarker levels, while compound heterozygosity involving p.[Asp448His;His294Gln] and no p.Asn409Ser entails severe phenotypes and high Lyso-Gb1 levels."

    "abstract": "There are minimal data on the frequencies of monocyte subsets and dendritic cells (DCs) in children with Gaucher disease (GD), as nearly all previous studies have involved adult patients. Consequently, we aimed to describe the changes in these cell subpopulations in children with GD type 1 who were on regular enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). This case-control study included 25 children with GD1 and 20 healthy controls. All participants underwent investigations such as complete blood count and flow cytometric assessment of DC and monocyte frequencies and phenotype. We found that GD1 children had significantly reduced percentages of both types of DCs, i.e., plasmacytoid DCs and myeloid DCs, compared to the control group. There was also a significant reduction in absolute monocyte numbers and percentage of classical monocyte. Moreover, the GD1 children had higher frequencies of non-classical and intermediate monocytes than the control group. Our results so far indicate that, when compared to the control group, the GD1 children had significantly reduced total and classical monocyte, with significantly decreased frequencies for both types of DCs. These changes can contribute to immunological abnormalities in pediatric patients with GD1. Children with Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) have significantly reduced total and classical monocyte frequencies, with decreasing percentages for both types of dendritic cells. GD1 children had significantly reduced frequencies of myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells as compared to the controls. The GD1 children also had significant changes in monocyte subsets when compared to the controls. Our results show that monocytes and dendritic cells' significant changes could contribute to immunological abnormalities in pediatric patients with GD1."

    "abstract": "Current therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) are palliative, of which the levodopa/carbidopa therapy remains the primary choice but is unable to modulate the progression of neurodegeneration. Due to the complication of such a multifactorial disorder and significant limitations of the therapy, numerous genetic approaches have been proved effective in finding out genes and mechanisms implicated in this disease. Following the observation of a higher frequency of PD in Gaucher's disease (GD), a lysosomal storage condition, mutations of glycosylceramidase beta (GBA) encoding glucocerebrosidase (GCase) have been shown to be involved and have been explored in the context of PD. GBA mutations are the most common genetic risk factor of PD. Various studies have revealed the relationships between PD and GBA gene mutations, facilitating a better understanding of this disorder. Various hypotheses delineate that the pathological mutations of GBA minimize the enzymatic activity of GCase, which affects the proliferation and clearance of α-synuclein; this affects the lysosomal homeostasis, exacerbating the endoplasmic reticulum stress or encouraging the mitochondrial dysfunction. Identification of the pathological mechanisms underlying the GBA-associated parkinsonism (GBA + PD) advances our understanding of PD. This review based on current literature aims to elucidate various genetic and clinical characteristics correlated with GBA mutations and to identify the numerous pathological processes underlying GBA + PD. We also delineate the therapeutic strategies to interfere with the mutant GCase function for further improvement of the related α-synuclein-GCase crosstalks. Moreover, the various therapeutic approaches such as gene therapy, chaperone proteins, and histone deacetylase inhibitors for the treatment of GBA + PD are discussed."

CT showed massive splenomegaly and multiple nodules inside the spleen. Bone marrow examination showed an increase of macrophages with large cytoplasm. Suspected of splenic lymphoma, the patient underwent splenectomy. Spleen specimens were histologically analyzed and suggested the probability of Gaucher's disease (GD). Leukocyte glucocerebrosidase (GBA) enzyme activity had decreased to 1.25 nmol/mg, and mutation analysis of GBA revealed two missense variants, p.D448H (D409H), p.L483P (L444P), which confirmed the diagnosis of type I GD. Fourteen months after splenectomy, he developed right buttock pain, and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging showed a fragile right pubic and pelvic fracture. We initiated injection of imiglucerase as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and administered bisphosphonate. His symptoms gradually improved without surgical treatment. In addition, thrombocytopenia and anemia also improved, and angiotensin-converting enzyme levels decreased. Type I GD should be considered a differential diagnosis of giant splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia, even in the elderly. ERT or substrate reduction therapy should be administrated to GD patients, while paying attention to the development of bone lesions."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are rare genetic disorders, with heterogeneous clinical manifestations and severity. Treatment options, such as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), substrate replacement therapy, and pharmacological chaperone therapy, are available for several LSDs, including Gaucher disease (GD), Fabry disease (FD), and Hunter syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type II [MPS II]). However, patients in some countries face challenges accessing treatments owing to limited availability of locally licensed, approved drugs. The Takeda LSD Charitable access program aims to meet the needs of individuals with GD, FD or MPS II with the greatest overall likelihood of benefit, in selected countries, through donation of ERT to nonprofit organizations, and support for medical capacity-building as well as family support via independent grants. Long-term aims of the program are to establish sustainable healthcare services delivered by local healthcare providers for patients with rare metabolic diseases. Patients receiving treatment through the program are monitored regularly, and their clinical data and progress are reviewed annually by an independent medical expert committee (MEC). The MEC also selects patients for enrollment completely independent from the sponsoring company. As of 31 August, 2019, 199 patients from 13 countries were enrolled in the program; 142 with GD, 41 with MPS II, and 16 with FD. Physicians reported improvements in clinical condition for 147 (95%) of 155 patients with follow-up data at 1 year. The response rate for follow-up data at 1 year was high, with data collected for > 90% of patients who received ERT through the program showing clinical improvements in the majority of patients. These findings suggest that the program can benefit selected patients previously unable to access disease-specific treatments. Further innovative solutions and efforts are needed to address the challenges and unmet needs of patients with LSDs and other rare diseases around the world."

    "abstract": "Transfusion-dependent patients typically develop iron-induced cardiomyopathy, liver disease, and endocrine complications. We aimed to estimate the incidence of endocrine disorders in transfusiondependent thalassemia (TDT) patients during long-term iron-chelation therapy with deferasirox (DFX). We developed a multi-center follow-up study of 426 TDT patients treated with once-daily DFX for a median duration of 8 years, up to 18.5 years. At baseline, 118, 121, and 187 patients had 0, 1, or ≥2 endocrine diseases respectively. 104 additional endocrine diseases were developed during the follow-up. The overall risk of developing a new endocrine complication within 5 years was 9.7% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 6.3-13.1). Multiple Cox regression analysis identified three key predictors: age showed a positive log-linear effect (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for 50% increase 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3, P=0.005), the serum concentration of thyrotropin showed a positive linear effect (adjusted HR for 1 mIU/L increase 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.4, P<0.001) regardless the kind of disease incident, while the number of previous endocrine diseases showed a negative linear effect: the higher the number of diseases at baseline the lower the chance of developing further diseasess (adjusted HR for unit increase 0.5, 95% CI: 0.4-0.7, P<0.001). Age and thyrotropin had similar effect sizes across the categories of baseline diseases. The administration of levothyroxine as a covariate did not change the estimates. Although in DFX-treated TDT patients the risk of developing an endocrine complication is generally lower than the previously reported risk, there is considerable risk variation and the burden of these complications remains high. We developed a simple risk score chart enabling clinicians to estimate their patients' risk. Future research will look at increasing the amount of variation explained from our model and testing further clinical and laboratory predictors, including the assessment of direct endocrine magnetic resonance imaging."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal Storage Diseases (LSD) are rare and multisytemic diseases which are caused by lysosomal enzyme deficiencies leading into accumulation of waste products due to an interruption in the decomposition process. Due to the low prevalence and therefore limited disease awareness as well as the fact that LSD patients present with unspecific symptoms the final diagnosis is often made after a long delay. The aim of this German-wide survey was to characterize the period between onset of symptoms and final diagnosis regarding e.g. self-perceived health, symptom burden and false diagnoses for patients with selected LSDs (Fabry disease (FD), Gaucher disease (GD) and Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II). The study was conducted as a telephone based cross-sectional survey. All patients living in Germany with a confirmed diagnosis of FD, GD or MPS II were eligible to participate. The questionnaire was provided in advance in order to enable the participants to prepare for the interview. Only descriptive analyses were carried out. Single analyses were not carried out for all three patient groups due low case numbers. Of the overall population, 39 patients have been diagnosed with FD, 19 with GD and 11 with MPS II with the majority of patients being index patients. The majority of FD patients reported their current health status as \"satisfactory\" or better (79.5%). Self-perceived health status was observed to be at least stable or improving for the majority of FD patients compared to the year prior to diagnosis. The most frequently reported symptoms for patients with FD were paraesthesias (51.3%), whereas patients with GD reported a tendency for bleeding, blue spots or coagulation disorder (63.2%) as well as hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly (63.2%) as the most commonly appearing symptoms. The number of patients reporting misdiagnoses was n = 5 (13.5%) for patients with FD and n = 5 (27.8%) for patients with GD. The median duration of the diagnostic delay was 21.0 years for FD, 20.0 years for GD and 2.0 years for MPS II. This study showed that self-perceived status of health for patients might improve once the final correct diagnoses has been made and specific treatment was available. Furthermore, it was observed that diagnostic delay is still high in Germany for a relevant proportion of affected patients. Further challenges in the future will still be to increase awareness for these diseases across the entire healthcare sector to minimize the diagnostic delay."

Patients with GD type 1 were treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for at least two years. The control group was composed of healthy volunteers, unrelated to the patients, adjusted with age, sex and body mass index (BMI). The miRNA alteration between these groups was examined. After obtaining preliminary results on a group of six GD patients by the high-output method (TaqMan low-density array (TLDA)), potential miRNAs were selected for confirming the results by using the qRT-PCR method. With Diane Tools, we analysed miRNAs of which differential expression is most significant and their potential role in GD pathophysiology. We also determined the essential pathways these miRNAs are involved in. 266 dysregulated miRNAs were found among 753 tested. Seventy-eight miRNAs were downregulated, and 188 were upregulated. Thirty miRNAs were significantly altered; all of them were upregulated. The analysis of pathways regulated by the selected miRNAs showed an effect on bone development, inflammation or regulation of axonal transmission in association with Parkinson's disease. We revealed few miRNAs, like miR-26-5p, which are highly altered and fit the GD pathophysiological model, might be considered as novel biomarkers of disease progression but need further evaluation."

    "abstract": "Deficiency of glucocerebrosidase (GBA), a lysosomal β-glucosidase, causes Gaucher disease. The enzyme hydrolyzes β-glucosidic substrates and transglucosylates cholesterol to cholesterol-β-glucoside. Here we show that recombinant human GBA also cleaves β-xylosides and transxylosylates cholesterol. The xylosyl-cholesterol formed acts as an acceptor for the subsequent formation of di-xylosyl-cholesterol. Common mutant forms of GBA from patients with Gaucher disease with reduced β-glucosidase activity were similarly impaired in β-xylosidase, transglucosidase, and transxylosidase activities, except for a slightly reduced xylosidase/glucosidase activity ratio of N370S GBA and a slightly reduced transglucosylation/glucosidase activity ratio of D409H GBA. XylChol was found to be reduced in spleen from patients with Gaucher disease. The origin of newly identified XylChol in mouse and human tissues was investigated. Cultured human cells exposed to exogenous β-xylosides generated XylChol in a manner dependent on active lysosomal GBA but not the cytosol-facing β-glucosidase GBA2. We later sought an endogenous β-xyloside acting as donor in transxylosylation reactions, identifying xylosylated ceramide (XylCer) in cells and tissues that serve as donor in the formation of XylChol. UDP-glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) was unable to synthesize XylChol but could catalyze the formation of XylCer. Thus, food-derived β-D-xyloside and XylCer are potential donors for the GBA-mediated formation of XylChol in cells. The enzyme GCS produces XylCer at a low rate. Our findings point to further catalytic versatility of GBA and prompt a systematic exploration of the distribution and role of xylosylated lipids."

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection carries high morbidity and mortality in individuals with chronic disorders. Its impact in rare disease populations such as Gaucher disease (GD) is unknown. In GD, decreased acid β-glucosidase activity leads to the accumulation of inflammatory glycosphingolipids and chronic myeloid cell immune activation which a priori could predispose to the most severe effects of SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection in GD, we conducted a cross-sectional study in a large cohort. 181 patients were enrolled, including 150 adults and 31 children, with a majority of patients on treatment (78%). Information on COVID-19 exposure, symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or antibody testing was obtained during the peak of the pandemic in the New York City metropolitan area. Forty-five adults reported a primary exposure to someone with COVID-19 and 17 (38%) of these patients reported at least one COVID-19 symptom. A subset of adults was tested (n = 88) and in this group 18% (16/88) were positive. Patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 had significantly more symptoms (4.4 vs 0.3, p < 0.001) than patients testing negative. Among patients who were antibody-positive, quantitative titers indicated moderate to high antibody response. In GD adults, male gender, older age, increased BMI, comorbidities, GBA genotype, prior splenectomy and treatment status were not associated with the probability of reporting symptoms or testing positive. No patient required COVID-19-specific treatments and there were no deaths. Our data suggests that GD does not confer a heightened risk for severe effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection feared based on the known chronic inflammatory state in these patients."

To gain insights into the association of progressive accumulation of GlcCer and the Parkinson's disease phenotypes, we generated dopaminergic (DA) neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a GD1 patient and a healthy donor control, and measured GlcCer accumulation by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We tested two DA neuron differentiation methods: a well-established method that mimics a step-wise developmental process from iPSCs to neural progenitor cells, and to DA neurons; and a synthetic mRNA-based method that overexpresses a transcription factor in iPSCs. GD1-specific accumulation of GlcCer was detected after 60 days of differentiation by the former method, whereas it was detected after only 10 days by the latter method. With this synthetic mRNA-based rapid differentiation method, we found that the metabolic defect in GD1 patient cells can be rescued by the overexpression of wild-type GBA1 or the treatment with an inhibitor for GlcCer synthesis. Furthermore, we detected the increased phosphorylation of α-synuclein, a biomarker for Parkinson's disease, in DA neurons derived from a GD1 patient, which was significantly decreased by the overexpression of wild-type GBA1. These results suggest that synthetic mRNA-based method accelerates the analyses of the pathological mechanisms of Parkinson's disease in GD1 patients and possibly facilitates drug discovery processes."

    "title": "Impaired autophagy: The collateral damage of lysosomal storage disorders.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), which number over fifty, are monogenically inherited and caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins that are involved in lysosomal function. Lack of the functional protein results in storage of a distinctive material within the lysosomes, which for years was thought to determine the pathophysiology of the disorder. However, our current view posits that the primary storage material disrupts the normal role of the lysosome in the autophagic pathway resulting in the secondary storage of autophagic debris. It is this \"collateral damage\" which is common to the LSDs but nonetheless intricately nuanced in each. We have selected five LSDs resulting from defective proteins that govern widely different lysosomal functions including glycogen degradation (Pompe), lysosomal transport (Cystinosis), lysosomal trafficking (Danon), glycolipid degradation (Gaucher) and an unidentified function (Batten) and argue that despite the disparate functions, these proteins, when mutant, all impair the autophagic process uniquely."

    "title": "Patients with Gaucher disease display systemic oxidative stress dependent on therapy status.",
    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutations in <i>GBA1</i>, which encodes for the lysosomal hydrolase enzyme, β-glucocerebrosidase. The resulting misfolded protein can trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress and an unfolded protein response within the affected cells. The enzyme deficiency leads to accumulation of its substrates, glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine, within macrophage lysosomes and with prominent disease manifestations in macrophage rich tissues. Resultant lysosomal pathology and impaired autophagy leads to redox imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction and intracellular oxidative stress. Here we have systematically examined a role for oxidative stress in individuals affected by Gaucher disease. We compared multiple oxidative stress biomarkers in plasma and red blood cell samples from patients who are currently untreated, with those who are stable on standard-of-care therapy, and with healthy controls. We found significant differences in key oxidative stress biomarkers in untreated patients compared to healthy control. In treated patients, results generally fell between the controls and the untreated patients. Interestingly, even asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic untreated patients had evidence of significant systemic oxidative stress. We conclude that underlying oxidative stress may contribute to Gaucher disease pathophysiology including long-term adverse outcomes such as Parkinsonism and malignancies. Therapies targeting oxidative stress may prove useful as adjuvant treatments for Gaucher disease and other lysosomal storage disorders."

    "abstract": "Neurological forms of Gaucher disease, the inherited disorder of β-Glucosylceramidase caused by bi-allelic variants in GBA1, is a progressive disorder which lacks a disease-modifying therapy. Systemic manifestations of disease are effectively treated with enzyme replacement therapy, however, molecules which cross the blood-brain barrier are still under investigation. Clinical trials of such therapeutics require robust, reproducible clinical endpoints to demonstrate efficacy and clear phenotypic definitions to identify suitable patients for inclusion in trials. The single consistent clinical feature in all patients with neuronopathic disease is the presence of a supranuclear saccadic gaze palsy, in the presence of Gaucher disease this finding serves as diagnostic of 'type 3' Gaucher disease. We undertook a study to evaluate saccadic eye movements in Gaucher patients and to assess the role of the EyeSeeCam in measuring saccades. The EyeSeeCam is a video-oculography device which was used to run a protocol of saccade measures. We studied 39 patients with non-neurological Gaucher disease (type 1), 21 patients with type 3 (neurological) disease and a series of 35 healthy controls. Mean saccade parameters were compared across disease subgroups. We confirmed the saccadic abnormality in patients with type 3 Gaucher disease and identified an unexpected subgroup of patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who demonstrated significant saccade parameter abnormalities. These patients also showed subtle neurological findings and shared a GBA1 variant. This striking novel finding of a potentially attenuated type 3 Gaucher phenotype associated with a specific GBA1 variant and detectable saccadic abnormality prompts review of current disease classification. Further, this finding highlights the broad spectrum of neuronopathic Gaucher phenotypes relevant when designing inclusion criteria for clinical trials."

    "title": "Benign or not benign? Deep phenotyping of liver Glycogen Storage Disease IX.",
    "abstract": "Liver Glycogen Storage Disease Type IX (GSD IX) is one of the most common forms of GSD. It is caused by a deficiency in enzyme phosphorylase kinase (PhK), a complex, hetero-tetrameric enzyme comprised of four subunits - α, β, γ, and δ - each with tissue specific isoforms encoded by different genes. Until the recent availability of gene panels and exome sequencing, the diagnosis of liver GSD IX did not allow for differentiation of these subtypes. This study presents the first comprehensive literature review for liver GSD IX subtypes - GSD IX α2, β, and γ2. We aim to better characterize the natural history of liver GSD IX and further investigate if there are subtype-specific differences in clinical presentation. A comprehensive literature review was performed with the help of a medical librarian at Duke University Medical Center to gather all published patients of liver GSD IX. Our refined search yielded 74 articles total. Available patient data were compiled into an excel spreadsheet. Data were analyzed via descriptive statistics. The number of patients with specific symptoms were individually summed and reported as a percentage of the total number of patients for which data were available or were averaged and reported as a mean numerical value. Published pathology reports were scored using the International Association of the Study of the Liver Scale. There were a total of 183 GSD IX α2 patients, 17 GSD IX β patients, and 30 GSD IX γ2 patients. Average age at diagnosis was 4 years for GSD IX α2 patients, 2.34 years for GSD IX β patients, and 1.81 years for GSD IX γ2 patients. Hepatomegaly was reported in 164/176 (93.2%) of GSD IX α2 patients, 16/17 (94.1%) of GSD IX β patients, and 30/30 (100%) of GSD IX γ2 patients. Fasting hypoglycemia was reported in 53/121 (43.8%) of GSD IX α2 patients, 8/16 (50%) of GSD IX β patients, and 18/19 (94.7%) of GSD IX γ2 patients. Liver biopsy pathology reports were available and interpreted for 46 GSD IX α2 patients, 3 GSD IX β patients, and 24 GSD IX γ2 patients. 22/46 (47.8%) GSD IX α2 patients, 1/3 (33.3%) GSD IX β patients, and 23/24 (95.8%) GSD IX γ2 patients with available pathology reports documented either some degree of fibrosis or cirrhosis. Our comprehensive review demonstrates quantitatively that the clinical presentation of GSD IX γ2 patients is more severe than that of GSD IX α2 or β patients. However, our study also shows the existence of a severe phenotype in GSD IX α2, evidenced by early onset liver pathology in conjunction with clinical symptoms. There is need for a more robust natural history study to better understand the variability in liver pathophysiology within liver GSD IX; in addition, further study of mutations and gene mapping could bring a better understanding of the relationship between genotype and clinical presentation."

    "title": "Nanotechnology-based approaches for treating lysosomal storage disorders, a focus on Fabry disease.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of rare diseases in which the defect of a lysosomal protein results in a pathogenic accumulation of nonmetabolized products within the cells. The main treatment for LSDs is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), consisting in the exogenous administration a recombinant protein to replace the defective one. Although several diseases such as Gaucher, Fabry, and Pompe are treated following this approach, ERT is limited to LSDs without severe neuronal affectation because recombinant enzymes do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, ERT shows additional drawbacks, including enzyme low half-life, poor bioavailability, and immunogenic responses. In this scenario, nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems (DDS) have been proposed as solution to overcome these limitations and improve the efficacy of ERT. The present review summarizes distinct approaches followed by our group and collaborators on the use of DDS for restoring lysosomal enzymes in disease-affected cells. During the last decade, we have been exploring different synthetic nanoparticles, from electrolytic complexes, to liposomes and aggresomes, for the delivery of α-galactosidase A (GLA) enzyme. Studies were mainly conducted on Fabry disease models, but results can be also extrapolated to other LSDs, as well as to other diseases treated with alternative therapeutic proteins. The advantages and disadvantages of different DDS, the difficulties from working with very labile and highly glycosylated enzymes and the relevance of using appropriate targeting moieties is thoroughly discussed. Finally, the use of natural DDS, namely extracellular vesicles (EVs) is also introduced. This article is categorized under: Therapeutic Approaches and Drug Discovery > Nanomedicine for Neurological Disease Therapeutic Approaches and Drug Discovery > Nanomedicine for Cardiovascular Disease Therapeutic Approaches and Drug Discovery > Emerging Technologies."

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) remains challenging due to wide clinical, biochemical and molecular heterogeneity. The study applies a combined biochemical and genetic approach to diagnose symptomatic Indian patients of Pompe, Fabry, Gaucher and Hurler disease to generate a comprehensive dataset of pathogenic variants for these disorders. Symptomatic patients were biochemically diagnosed by fluorometric methods and molecular confirmation was carried out by gene sequencing. Genetic variants were analyzed according to the ACMG/AMP 2015 variant interpretation guidelines. Amongst the 2181 suspected patients, 285 (13%) were biochemically diagnosed. Of these, 22.5% (64/285) diagnosed with Pompe disease harboured c.1933G>A, c.1A>G, c.1927G>A and c.2783G>C as common and 10 novel pathogenic variants while 7.4% (21/285) patients diagnosed with Fabry disease carried c.851T>C, c.902G>A, c.905A>C and c.1212_1234del as frequent disease-causing variants along with 7 novel pathogenic variants. As many as 48.4% (138/285) patients were diagnosed with Gaucher disease and had c.1448T>C as the most common pathogenic variant followed by c.1342G>C and c.754T>C with 7 previously unreported disease-causing variants and in the 21.7% (62/285) diagnosed cases of Hurler disease, c.1469T>C, c.754delC c.568_581del and c.1898C>T were identified as the most common causative variants along with 21 novel pathogenic variants. This comprehensive data set of disease-causing frequent and novel pathogenic variants reported for the first time in such a large patient cohort for each of these four LSDs from the Indian sub-continent, along with their biochemical and clinical spectrum will contribute towards providing definitive diagnosis and treatment, identifying carrier status, as well as in counselling prenatal cases to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with these disorders."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the acid β-glucosidase encoding gene (<i>GBA1</i>), resulting in the deficient activity of acid β-glucosidase (GCase). To date, there is no approved treatment for the neurological manifestations of the disease. The role of Ambroxol as a chaperone for mutant GCase has been extensively demonstrated <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, different authors have reported beneficial effects of high doses of Ambroxol on neurological manifestations in patients affected by GD. In this report, we describe the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> effects of Ambroxol in two patients (P1 and P2) affected by the neurological form of GD and epilepsy, carrying mutations already reported as responsive to the chaperone. Indeed, P1 presented the N188S mutation in compound heterozygous with a null allele (IVS2 + 1G > A) and P2 was homozygous for the L444P mutation. As expected, a beneficial effect of Ambroxol was observed in cultured fibroblasts as well as <i>in vivo</i>, both on epilepsy and on biomarkers of GD, in P1. However, Ambroxol was completely undefective in P2, suggesting that other factors besides the <i>GBA1</i> mutation itself would be involved in the response therapy which would be difficult to predict based on the patient genotype. The present report expands the experience of Ambroxol treatment in neurological GD patients and highlights the need to <i>in vitro</i> test the individual response to Ambroxol even in patients carrying mutations already classified as responsive to the chaperone."

    "abstract": "Gaucher Disease (GD), which is the most common lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by bi-allelic mutations in <i>GBA1</i>-a gene that encodes the lysosomal hydrolase β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). The neuronopathic forms of GD (nGD) are characterized by severe neurological abnormalities that arise during gestation or early in infancy. Using GD-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs), we have previously reported that neuronal cells have neurodevelopmental defects associated with the downregulation of canonical Wnt signaling. In this study, we report that GD NPCs display elevated levels of Dkk1, which is a secreted Wnt antagonist that prevents receptor activation. Dkk1 upregulation in mutant NPCs resulted in an increased degradation of β-catenin, and there was a concomitant reduction in lysosomal numbers. Consistent with these results, incubation of the mutant NPCs with recombinant Wnt3a (rWnt3a) was able to outcompete the excess Dkk1, increasing β-catenin levels and rescuing lysosomal numbers. Furthermore, the incubation of WT NPCs with recombinant Dkk1 (rDkk1) phenocopied the mutant phenotype, recapitulating the decrease in β-catenin levels and lysosomal depletion seen in nGD NPCs. This study provides evidence that downregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in nGD neuronal cells involves the upregulation of Dkk1. As Dkk1 is an extracellular Wnt antagonist, our results suggest that the deleterious effects of Wnt/β-catenin downregulation in nGD may be ameliorated by the prevention of Dkk1 binding to the Wnt co-receptor LRP6, pointing to Dkk1 as a potential therapeutic target for <i>GBA1</i>-associated neurodegeneration."

This study explores utility of screening in Porto Alegre, Brazil, and Cincinnati, Ohio. A retrospective analysis of clinical information and laboratory data from GD1 patients was performed. Over 19 years, 68 individuals with GD1 (31 males, 37 females) underwent screening, and 20 (29.4%) had abnormalities. Twelve (17.6%) had polyclonal gammopathy (mean age 24.2 years, p = .02), seven (10%) had monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS; mean age 52.7 years, p = .009). One had multiple myeloma (age 61 years). Risk factors for MGUS included male gender (p = .05), p.N409S allele (p = .032). MGUS developed in six of 62 treated and two of four untreated individuals. Of those with MGUS receiving treatment, four were on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and one on substrate reduction therapy (SRT). Gammopathy normalized in 13 treated individuals (10 polyclonal, three MGUS) and remained abnormal in two treated individuals (two polyclonal, two MGUS). Gammopathy relapse was seen in one individual with MGUS and three with polyclonal gammopathy. This study describes screening for gammopathies and identifies risk factors in individuals with GD1."

Although the diagnosis and management of patients with GD have significantly evolved over the last 30 years, some patients remain poor responders to GD-specific therapy, needing novel and investigational therapies. Ideally, patients with GD, like patients with other rare diseases, should be managed by a multidisciplinary team expert with the diverse clinical manifestations and potential GD-related or -unrelated comorbidities. The hematology community should be knowledgeable regarding the presentation and the variety of hematologic complications and comorbidities associated with Gaucher disease."

    "abstract": "Genetic, preclinical and clinical data link Parkinson's disease and Gaucher's disease and provide a rational entry point to disease modification therapy via enhancement of β-Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity. We discovered a new class of pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyrazine activators effecting both Vmax and Km. They bind to human GCase and increase substrate metabolism in the lysosome in a cellular assay. We obtained the first crystal structure for an activator and identified a novel non-inhibitory binding mode at the interface of a dimer, rationalizing the observed structure-activity relationship (SAR). The compound binds GCase inducing formation of a dimeric state at both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomal pHs, as confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation. Importantly, the pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyrazines have central nervous system (CNS) drug-like properties. Our findings are important for future drug discovery efforts in the field of GCase activation and provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the requirements for enzymatic activation, pointing to the relevance of dimerization."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) comprise a rare and heterogeneous group of nearly 50 heritable metabolic disorders caused by mutations in proteins critical for cellular lysosomal function. Defects in the activity of these proteins in multiple organs leads to progressive intra-lysosomal accumulation of specific substrates, resulting in disruption of cellular functions, extracellular inflammatory responses, tissue damage and organ dysfunction. The classification and clinical presentation of different LSD are dependent on the type of accumulated substrate. Some clinical signs and symptoms are common across multiple LSD, while others are more specific to a particular syndrome. Due to the rarity and wide clinical diversity of LSD, identification and diagnosis can be challenging, and in many cases diagnosis is delayed for months or years. Treatments, such as enzyme replacement therapy, haemopoietic stem cell transplantation and substrate reduction therapy, are now available for some of the LSD. For maximum effect, therapy must be initiated prior to the occurrence of irreversible tissue damage, highlighting the importance of prompt diagnosis. Herein, we discuss the clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of four of the treatable LSD: Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, Pompe disease, and two of the mucopolysaccharidoses (I and II). For each disease, we present illustrative case studies to help increase awareness of their clinical presentation and possible treatment outcomes."

A co-citation network of 5,324 publications related to glucocerebrosides was constructed.

We provided for each cluster the most cited publications and a description of their intellectual content. We moreover identified emerging trends in glucocerebrosides research by detecting the surges in the rate of publication citations in the most recent years. In conclusion, this study helps to apprehend the most significant lines of research on glucocerebrosides. This should strengthen the connections between scientific communities studying glycosphingolipids to facilitate advances, especially for the most recent researches on cancer drug resistance and Parkinson's disease."

Plant resistance inducers (PRI) are also considered to promote crop health, but their effectiveness is partial and can vary according to the environment and the plant genotype. We investigated the putative interaction between intrinsic (genetic) and PRI-induced resistance in apple when affected by scab and fire blight diseases. A large F1 mapping population was challenged by each disease after a pre-treatment with acibenzolar-<i>S</i>-methyl (ASM) and compared with the water control. Apple scab and fire blight resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected in both conditions and compared. ASM exhibited a strong effectiveness in reducing both diseases. When combined, QTL-controlled and ASM-induced resistance acted complementarily to reduce the symptoms from 85 to 100%, depending on the disease. In our conditions, resistance QTLs were only slightly or rarely affected by ASM treatment, despite their probable implication in various stages of the resistance buildup. Implications of these results are discussed considering already known results, the underlying mechanisms, cross protection of both types of resistance against pathogen adaptation, and practical application in orchard conditions."

Lyso-Gb1 in DBS was extracted by 50% acetonitrile aqueous solution containing isotope-labeled internal standard and analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A reference interval was established by analyzing samples from 277 healthy controls. Lyso-Gb1 was detected in the residual DBS samples from 142 high-risk patients with splenomegaly and/or thrombocytopenia. Based on GCase activity in DBS, samples were classified into four groups: confirmed GD patients (n = 52), GD carriers (n = 5), false positive (n = 36) and negative (n = 49). The optimized Lyso-Gb1 assay showed intra- and inter-assay variations ranged between 2.0%-8.2% and 3.8%-10.2%, respectively. Accuracies ranged from 93.5% to 112.6%. The lowest limit of quantification was 1 ng/mL. The normal reference interval of Lyso-Gb1 in DBS ranged from 2.1 to 9.9 ng/mL. Among the 142 subjects, except for one GD patient (Lyso-Gb1 > 2500 ng/mL), the Lyso-Gb1 concentrations in 51 GD patients ranged from 190.5 to 2380.6 ng/mL (the median 614.8 ng/mL). Also, one negative patient was found to have an elevated Lyso-Gb1 level (684.5 ng/mL), while the other patients were normal. The negative case was then confirmed to be an atypical GD patient with a c.1091A > G (p.Y364C) homozygous variant in PSAP gene by next generation sequencing.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely available tool used to identify abnormalities in cerebral function, as well as epileptiform abnormalities indicating an increased risk of seizures. We characterized the EEG findings in GD3, reviewing 67 patients with 293 EEGs collected over nearly 50 years. Over 93% of patients had some form of EEG abnormality, most consisting of background slowing (90%), followed by interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) (54%), and photoparoxysmal responses (25%). The seven patients without background slowing were all under age 14 (mean 6.7 years). There was a history of seizures in 37% of this cohort; only 30% of these had IEDs on EEG. Conversely, only 56% of patients with IEDs had a history of seizures. These observed EEG abnormalities document an important aspect of the natural history of GD3 and could potentially assist in identifying neurological involvement in a patient with subtle clinical findings. Additionally, this comprehensive description of longitudinal EEG data provides essential baseline data for understanding central nervous system involvement in neuronopathic GD."

Haplotype analysis was performed for 9 probands and their parents for whom DNA samples were available. In 58 unrelated probands, the GBA mutation p.L483P was the most common (30/116 alleles, 26%), followed by p.G85E (16%), p.F252I (13%), and p.R296Q (9%). The median age at diagnosis of the 18 patients harboring the p.G85E mutation was 3.8 (range 1.2-57) years. No patients developed neurological symptoms during follow-up periods of 2.2-20.3 (median 13.9) years. The size of the shared haplotype containing GBA p.G85E was 732 kbp, leading to an estimated age of 3075 years.

Among 100 patients (GD, n = 25; non-GD, n = 75), analyses based on 11 possible factors estimated group mean (standard deviation) PSS scores of: GD (n = 14), 1.08 (0.25); non-GD (n = 38), 0.58 (0.31). Mean between-group difference (95% confidence interval) was -0.49 (-0.68, -0.31) and area under the receiver-operating characteristic analysis curve (95% confidence interval) was 0.88 (0.78, 0.97). A threshold PSS score of 0.82 identified all 14 patients with GD in the analysis set (100% sensitivity) and 27 of 38 patients in the non-GD group (71% specificity). Patients with liver disease and haematological malignancy were most likely to have manifestations overlapping GD. Preliminary validation of the GED-C PSS discriminated effectively between patients with GD and those with overlapping signs."

    "title": "Enzyme kinetics and inhibition parameters of human leukocyte glucosylceramidase.",
    "abstract": "Glucosylceramidase (GCase) is a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of β-glucosidic linkage of glucocerebroside (GC) into glucose and ceramide; thereby, plays an essential function in the degradation of complex lipids and the turnover of cellular membranes. The growing list of 460 mutations in the gene coding for it-glucosylceramidase beta acid 1 (<i>GBA1</i>)-is reported to abolish its catalytic activity and decrease its enzyme stability, associating it with severe health conditions such as Gaucher disease (GD), Parkinson Disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Although the three-dimensional structure of wild type glucosylceramidase is elucidated, little is known about its features in human cells. Moreover, alternative sources of GCase that prove to be effective in the treatment of diseases with enzyme treatment therapies, impose the need for a simple and cost-effective procedure to study the enzyme behavior. This work, for the first time, shows a well-established, yet simple, cost- and time-efficient protocol for the study of GCase enzyme in human leukocytes by the artificial substrate <i>p</i>-Nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (PNPG). Characterization of the enzyme in human leukocytes for activation parameters (optimal pH, K<sub>m</sub>, and V<sub>max</sub>) and enzyme inhibition was done. The results indicate that the optimum pH of GCase enzyme with PNPG is 5.0. The K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> values are 12.6mM and 333 U/mg, respectively. Gluconolactone competitively inhibits GCase, with a K<sub>i</sub> value of 0.023 mM and IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.047 mM. Glucose inhibition is uncompetitive with a K<sub>i</sub> of 1.94 mM and IC<sub>50</sub> of 55.3 mM. This is the first report for the inhibitory effect of glucose, δ-gluconolactone on human leukocyte GCase activity."

There is increasing evidence to suggest that dysregulated metabolism of sphingolipids is linked to neurodegenerative processes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease and Gaucher's disease. In this review, we provide an overview of the role of sphingolipids in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. We describe the implications of altered metabolism of sphingolipids in the pathophysiology of certain neurodegenerative diseases, with a primary focus on ALS. Finally, we provide an update of potential treatments that could be used to target the metabolism of sphingolipids in neurodegenerative diseases."

There are few patients and published studies about inborn errors of metabolism. The main objective of this study was to describe the effectiveness of orphan drugs in inborn errors of metabolism in paediatric patients. Retrospective descriptive study of 24 months on patients diagnosed with inborn errors of metabolism during childhood and who attended the pharmacy clinic or Day-Care Unit of a 630-bed general hospital. The study included 15 patients with a median age of 17.8 years and were treated with nine different drugs: sapropterin, sodium phenylbutyrate, miglustat, velaglucerase, sebelipase, idursulfase, 5-hydroxytryptophan, succinate, and riboflavin. Nine different inborn errors of metabolism were observed: phenylketonuria, defects of the urea cycle, Gaucher, Nieman-Pick, Hunter's disease, along with acid lipase deficiency, and mitochondrial diseases. Orphan drugs used for the treatment of inborn errors of metabolism accounted for 1.3% of hospital drug costs. Some orphan drugs achieved asymptomatic patients, but others just produced a modest symptomatic improvement. Most patients showed good tolerance to the treatment. Orphan drugs used in inborn errors of metabolism had an easy to manage toxicity profile, with many disparities in effectiveness. These drugs have a high economic impact. The cost-effectiveness ratio for orphan drugs is a controversial issue due to their high cost and the inconclusive clinical evidence."

Mouse models exist for the systemic (type 1) and for the acute neuronopathic forms (type 2) of GD. Here we report the generation of a mouse that phenotypically models chronic neuronopathic type 3 GD. Gba<sup>-/-</sup>;Gba<sup>tg</sup> mice, which contain a Gba transgene regulated by doxycycline, accumulate moderate levels of the offending substrate in GD, glucosylceramide, and live for up to 10 months, i.e. significantly longer than mice which model type 2 GD. Gba<sup>-/-</sup>;Gba<sup>tg</sup> mice display behavioral abnormalities at ∼4 months, which deteriorate with age, along with significant neuropathology including loss of Purkinje neurons. Gene expression is altered in the brain and in isolated microglia, although the changes in gene expression are less extensive than in mice modeling type 2 disease. Finally, bone deformities are consistent with the Gba<sup>-/-</sup>;Gba<sup>tg</sup> mice being a genuine type 3 GD model. Together, the Gba<sup>-/-</sup>;Gba<sup>tg</sup> mice share pathological pathways with acute neuronopathic GD mice but also display differences that might help understand the distinct disease course and progression of type 2 and 3 patients."

Group 1 was 6 initially treated patients, including 1 case of chitotriosidase deficiency, aged 10-43 years old, 4 females and 2 males. The blood routine test, chitotriosidase activity and plasma glucosylsphingosine level were measured during pre-and post-treatment. Group 2 were 6 cases of Gaucher disease including 3 cases of chitotriosidase deficiency, who received long-term specific treatment in the same hospital, aged 17 to 32 years, 2 females and 4 males. The plasma glucosylsphingosine level was detected in the follow-up treatment during January 2017 to July 2020. <b>Results:</b> Patients in group 1 had a significant increase in plasma platelets after 12 months of treatment (<i>P<</i>0.05), and also a significant increase in plasma hemoglobin after 30 months of treatment (<i>P<</i>0.05). The chitotriosidase activity of 5 patients in group 1 significantly decreased after 18 months of treatment (<i>P<</i>0.05), the median value of the chitotriosidase activity decreased by 7 278 nmol·ml(-1)·h(-1) at 30 months of treatment. While only 3 months after treatment, the plasma glucosylsphingosine levels of 6 patients in group 1 decreased significantly (<i>P<</i>0.05), the median value of the glucosylsphingosine levels decreased by 259.7 μg/L at 30 months of treatment. The plasma glucosylsphingosine levels in group 1 patients were positively correlated with chitotriosidase activity, with spearman of 0.863, <i>P<</i>0.001. In group 2, 6 patients with Gaucher disease that had been treated for a long period of time, showed normal peripheral blood routine tests, normal liver and spleen volume. However, the plasma glucosphingosine levels in group 2 patients decreased significantly during 2017-2020 (<i>P<</i>0.05). Compare to the initial values, the median value of the last glucosphingosine levels in group 2 patients had been reduced by 23.4 μg/L. <b>Conclusion:</b> The detection of plasma glucosylsphingosine levels in patients with Gaucher disease could be used for short-term and long-term follow-up of treatment."

The purpose of this study was to report long-term outcomes of VNS therapy in two patients with PME. We performed VNS therapy for two patients with PME. We reviewed the conditions of epileptic seizures, status epilepticus (SE), myoclonus, and Karnofsky performance state (KPS) scale scores at baseline and after 10 years. A 16-year-old boy with myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF) underwent VNS therapy. Baseline KPS scale score was 50, seizure frequency was weekly, and SE occurred yearly. At 23 years old, KPS scale score was 10. He had remained SE-free and frequency of epileptic seizures had markedly reduced. At 24 years old, he died due to pneumonia. A woman with Gaucher's disease type III underwent VNS therapy at 20 years old. Baseline KPS scale score was 80, seizure frequency was daily, and SE occurred monthly. At 30 years old, KPS scale was 30. She remained SE-free, but still experienced epileptic seizures yearly. Both patients became lethargic during VNS-off periods, with symptoms improving to baseline levels when VNS was resumed. Long-term outcomes with VNS showed good epileptic seizure control and freedom from SE. VNS might help maintain level of consciousness."

    "abstract": "To address progressive respiratory muscle weakness in late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), we developed a 12-week respiratory muscle training (RMT) program. In this exploratory, double-blind, randomized control trial, 22 adults with LOPD were randomized to RMT or sham-RMT. The primary outcome was maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP). Secondary and exploratory outcomes included maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), peak cough flow, diaphragm ultrasound, polysomnography, patient-reported outcomes, and measures of gross motor function. MIP increased 7.6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (15.9) in the treatment group and 2.7 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (7.6) in the control group (P = 0.4670). MEP increased 14.0 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (25.9) in the treatment group and 0.0 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (12.0) in the control group (P = 0.1854). The only statistically significant differences in secondary/exploratory outcomes were improvements in time to climb 4 steps (P = 0.0346) and daytime sleepiness (P = 0.0160). The magnitude of changes in MIP and MEP in the treatment group were consistent with our pilot findings but did not achieve statistical significance in comparison to controls. Explanations for this include inadequate power and baseline differences in subject characteristics between groups. Additionally, control group subjects appeared to exhibit an active response to sham-RMT and therefore sham-RMT may not be an optimal control condition for RMT in LOPD."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive multisystemic lysosomal storage disorder presenting a marked phenotypic and genotypic variability. GD is caused by a deficiency in the glucocerebrosidase enzyme. The diagnosis of GD remains challenging because of the large clinical spectrum associated with the disease. Moreover, GD biomarkers are often not sensitive enough and can be subject to polymorphic variations. The main objective of this study was to perform a metabolomic study using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography system coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer to identify novel GD biomarkers. Following the analysis of plasma samples from patients with GD, and age- and gender-matched control samples, supervised statistical analyses were used to find the best molecules to differentiate the two groups. Targeted biomarkers were structurally elucidated using accurate mass measurements and tandem mass spectrometry. This metabolomic study was successful in highlighting seven biomarkers associated with GD. Fragmentation tests revealed that these latter biomarkers were lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub> (glucosylsphingosine) and four related analogs (with the following modifications on the sphingosine moiety: -C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, -H<sub>2</sub>, -H<sub>2</sub>+O, and +H<sub>2</sub>O), sphingosylphosphorylcholine, and N-palmitoyl-O-phosphocholineserine.

In addition, it is the most common genetic disorder in the Ashkenazi Jewish population with phenotypic variation presenting in early childhood to asymptomatic nonagenarians. There have been a number of studies showing an increased risk of certain malignancies in patients, especially non- Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma. We describe a 66-year-old Ashkenazi Jewish male with GD1 who was first started on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with imiglucerase for GD1 at age 57 years, followed a year later by the diagnosis of diffuse large b-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (DLBCL). He was treated with <i>R-CHOP</i> (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, plus the monoclonal antibody rituximab), however relapsed and developed myelodysplasia necessitating an allo-stem-cell transplantation but succumbed to severe graft vs. host disease. In addition, we also describe a 38-year-old Ashkenazi Jewish male with GD1 who was diagnosed with DLBCL at age 22 years with Gaucher disease diagnosed on pre-treatment bone marrow biopsy which was confirmed by enzyme assay and genotyping. At age 24 years, he was started on ERT with imiglucerase and at age 35 years, he switched to eliglustat. He has remained in remission from the lymphoma. A meta-analysis of the literature will be elaborated upon and we will discuss the relationship of GD1 to NHL and discuss more recent information regarding lyso-GL1 and the development of NHL and multiple myeloma."

He was diagnosed with GD (homozygous mutation at c.1448 T > C, p.L483P), and started receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) at 17 months old. He developed respiratory distress symptoms after 45 months of ERT; chest imaging reported diffuse interstitial infiltration of the bilateral lungs and consolidations at the right lungs. Allogeneic HSCT using cells from a matched unrelated donor was performed four months upon progressive respiratory symptoms. His respiratory symptoms subsided in one month; chest imaging improvement, pulmonary function test improvement, and normalized activity of β-glucocerebrosidase were reported in three months. This is the first report of a patient who received early and regular ERT but developed severe infiltrative lung involvement and recovered after allogeneic HSCT. Based on study results, we suggest regular chest imaging, even for asymptomatic patients. For patients with severe lung involvement, rapid deterioration, and unresponsive to higher ERT dosages, allogeneic HSCT should be considered."

    "abstract": "Ambroxol hydrochloride is being used in respiratory diseases as a broncholytic therapy. Beta-Glucosylceramide (GC) is a naturally occurring glycosphingolipid that exerts an immune protective effect. The aim of the present study was to determine the synergistic immunomodulatory effect between these two compounds. Immune-mediated hepatitis was induced in the mice by administration of Con A. Mice were treated with either Ambroxol or GC alone or with the combination of both. Mice were followed for their effect on the liver injury, cytokine profile, and the immune system. Coadministration of Ambroxol and GC significantly alleviated the liver injury induced by ConA, as demonstrated by the decreased liver enzymes. The combined treatment had a statistically significant synergistic effect on the suppression of intrahepatic CD8+CD25+, an increase in the CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratio and in the CD8+ intrahepatic lymphocyte trapping, as well as on change of serum in the IL4 levels. The beneficial effect was associated with the promotion of regulatory T lymphocytes subsets, and with a trend for a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory cytokine shift. Coadministration of Ambroxol with GC exerted a synergistic immunoprotective effect in a model of immune-mediated acute liver damage. Considering the high safety profile of both agents, the combination may become a novel immunomodulatory non-immunosuppressive therapeutic agent. Coadministration of Ambroxol with glucocerebroside exerted a synergistic immunoprotective effect in a model of immune-mediated acute liver damage."

The uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine among children will be instrumental in limiting the spread of the disease as herd immunity may require vaccine coverage of up to 80% of the population. Prior history of pandemic vaccine coverage was as low as 40% among children in the United States during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. To investigate predictors associated with global caregivers' intent to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, when the vaccine becomes available. An international cross sectional survey of 1541 caregivers arriving with their children to 16 pediatric Emergency Departments (ED) across six countries from March 26 to May 31, 2020. 65% (n = 1005) of caregivers reported that they intend to vaccinate their child against COVID-19, once a vaccine is available. A univariate and subsequent multivariate analysis found that increased intended uptake was associated with children that were older, children with no chronic illness, when fathers completed the survey, children up-to-date on their vaccination schedule, recent history of vaccination against influenza, and caregivers concerned their child had COVID-19 at the time of survey completion in the ED. The most common reason reported by caregivers intending to vaccinate was to protect their child (62%), and the most common reason reported by caregivers refusing vaccination was the vaccine's novelty (52%). The majority of caregivers intend to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, though uptake will likely be associated with specific factors such as child and caregiver demographics and vaccination history. Public health strategies need to address barriers to uptake by providing evidence about an upcoming COVID-19 vaccine's safety and efficacy, highlighting the risks and consequences of infection in children, and educating caregivers on the role of vaccination."

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway and the formation of neuronal inclusions known as Lewy bodies. Chronic neuroinflammation, another hallmark of the disease, is thought to play an important role in the neurodegenerative process. Glycosphingolipids are a well-defined subclass of lipids that regulate crucial aspects of the brain function and recently emerged as potent regulators of the inflammatory process. Deregulation in glycosphingolipid metabolism has been reported in Parkinson's disease. However, the interrelationship between glycosphingolipids and neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease is not well known. This review provides a thorough overview of the links between glycosphingolipid metabolism and immune-mediated mechanisms involved in neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease. After a brief presentation of the metabolism and function of glycosphingolipids in the brain, it summarizes the evidences supporting that glycosphingolipids (i.e. glucosylceramides or specific gangliosides) are deregulated in Parkinson's disease. Then, the implications of these deregulations for neuroinflammation, based on data from human inherited lysosomal glycosphingolipid storage disorders and gene-engineered animal studies are outlined. Finally, the key molecular mechanisms by which glycosphingolipids could control neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease are highlighted. These include inflammasome activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, altered calcium homeostasis, changes in the blood-brain barrier permeability, recruitment of peripheral immune cells or production of autoantibodies."

Internal standards were added to 100 µL of plasma/serum and glycosphingolipids: lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub>, lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub>, and galactosylsphingosine (GalSph) were extracted with dichloromethane/methanol and analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS. Samples from unaffected controls and patients with GD were first analyzed using a HILIC column to separate lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub> from its isomer, GalSph. Samples from patients with FD or GD were analyzed using a C18 column to measure lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> and the hexosylsphingosine (HexSph: lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub> + GalSph) fraction in a single combined method. Extraction efficiency was between 73% and 87% and day-to-day variability showed a relative standard error of <7.5%. GalSph was determined to have minimal to no contribution to the HexSph fraction in samples from unaffected controls and patients with GD. Lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> and HexSph measurements by the combined method were in good agreement with established methods, with no bias.

This study is the first report of patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) in a large cohort of patients with type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1) enabling us to study predictors of the reported outcomes. The PROM was sent via a mobile phone survey to 405 adult patients with GD1. Demographics, clinical data, and treatment status were extracted from clinic charts. Age, sex, severity score index (SSI) at presentation and treatment status were used as variables to assess outcomes. A total of 192 patients with GD1 (111 females) responded (47.4% response rate), of whom 124 (64.5%) had received GD1-specific therapy. Around 40% of patients reported that GD had restricted their education/job and fun activities and were concerned about being emotional and financial burdens on others. Concerns regarding the risk of bone disease and Parkinson disease were also high (60%). The severity of GD1 (reflected by the need for GD1-specific therapy and a high SSI) was associated with GD1-related restrictions and concerns, fatigue, physical weakness, bone pain, and worry regarding the future. The use of GD1 specific PROM highlights personal problems that are not captured by traditional outcome parameters and that need to be addressed to improve health-related quality of life. Validated PROM should be included among the outcome measures in clinical practice and future prospective studies for patients with chronic and rare diseases."

    "abstract": "Enzymes have gained attention for their role in numerous disease states, calling for research for their efficient delivery. Loading enzymes into polymeric nanoparticles to improve biodistribution, stability, and targeting in vivo has led the field with promising results, but these enzymes still suffer from a degradation effect during the formulation process that leads to lower kinetics and specific activity leading to a loss of therapeutic potential. Stabilizers, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), can be beneficial, but the knowledge and understanding of their interaction with enzymes are not fully elucidated. To this end, the interaction of BSA with a model enzyme B-Glu, part of the hydrolase class and linked to Gaucher disease, was analyzed. To quantify the natural interaction of beta-glucosidase (B-Glu,) and BSA in solution, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis was performed. Afterwards, polymeric nanoparticles encapsulating these complexes were fully characterized, and the encapsulation efficiency, activity of the encapsulated enzyme, and release kinetics of the enzyme were compared. ITC results showed that a natural binding of 1:1 was seen between B-Glu and BSA. Complex concentrations did not affect nanoparticle characteristics which maintained a size between 250 and 350 nm, but increased loading capacity (from 6% to 30%), enzyme activity, and extended-release kinetics (from less than one day to six days) were observed for particles containing higher B-Glu:BSA ratios. These results highlight the importance of understanding enzyme:stabilizer interactions in various nanoparticle systems to improve not only enzyme activity but also biodistribution and release kinetics for improved therapeutic effects. These results will be critical to fully characterize and compare the effect of stabilizers, such as BSA with other, more relevant therapeutic enzymes for central nervous system (CNS) disease treatments."

Initial surgery was performed in 13/18 tumors, with complete resection in 6 (one with free margin and five with microscopic residual disease); 10/13 had local relapse. Eleven patients with 13 tumors underwent treatment with methotrexate-vinblastine. The response rate to chemotherapy was 54%, and up to 81% if stable disease cases were included. The best response was partial remission. Only 2 had grade 4 toxicity. Twelve of 15 patients had sequelae. In 8 cases sequelae were directly related to the surgical intervention and 3 of them were severe. The 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival were 30% and 93.3%, respectively. DF has a high local relapse rate, regardless of surgical margin involvement. Low dose chemotherapy achieved stable disease and even remission of the lesions with low toxicity. The high rate of sequelae is probably related to the initial surgery performed in the majority of patients and may be avoided by the use of neoadjuvant low dose chemotherapy."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by a genetic deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) leading to the accumulation of glucocerebroside in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The early diagnosis allows a prompt enzyme replacement therapy reversing cytopenias and visceromegaly and preventing irreversible bone lesions. Current diagnostic algorithms are based on well-recognized hematological manifestations. Although bone symptoms are present in 25-32% of the patients, they are not usually suspected as associated with Gaucher disease at clinical presentation. We designed an educational program aimed to give advice on the skeletal involvement in GD and a new diagnostic algorithm that considers bone symptoms to facilitate its early diagnosis (BIG project: Bone Involvement in Gaucher Disease). The study aims at describing the BIG project and the results of its application in our clinic in various cities in Argentina. Within the frame of this project, between March 2017 and December 2018, 38 dry blood spot samples from patients with bon e manifestations suspected of having GD were submitted to quantification of GCase activity. One sample did not meet the inclusion criteria. Deficient GCase activity was detected in three of the remaining 37 samples. The diagnosis of GD was confirmed in two girls who presented bone manifestations of 4 and 2 years of evolution, respectively, without hematological alterations. The third patient with low enzyme activity had normal leukocyte GCase. The two newly diagnosed cases of GD show the efficacy of our dual strategy aimed to facilitate the early diagnosis of this rare disease."

Currently, PD is primarily associated with nonneuronopathic GD; however, with currently available treatments, patients with chronic neuronopathic GD, who historically had a shortened life span, are now living well into their 50s and beyond. We highlight 4 patients with chronic neuronopathic GD with parkinsonian features, describing their GD genotype and phenotype as well as the presentation and progression of their parkinsonism. Symptoms presented in their fourth or fifth decade of life, and include unilateral bradykinesia and/or tremor. Of the patients, 3 had cognitive impairment. The fourth patient has not shown cognitive decline 6 years after PD onset. This small series highlights that PD is not exclusively associated with nonneuronopathic GD and that as the chronic neuronopathic GD population ages, the clinical spectrum and heterogeneity of neurological manifestations may include parkinsonism."

    "title": "Sclerotic bone lesions caused by non-infectious and non-neoplastic diseases: a review of the imaging and clinicopathologic findings.",
    "abstract": "Bone sclerosis is a focal, multifocal, or diffuse increase in the density of the bone matrix on radiographs or computed tomography (CT) imaging. This radiological finding can be caused by a broad spectrum of diseases, such as congenital and developmental disorders, depositional disorders, and metabolic diseases. The differential diagnosis can be effectively narrowed by an astute radiologist in the light of the clinical picture and typical findings on imaging. Some of these lesions are rare and have been described as case reports and series in the literature. This article aims to collate the clinical-radiologic findings of non-infectious and non-neoplastic causes of bone sclerosis with relevant imaging illustrations."

    "title": "Arylsulfatase A (ASA) in Parkinson's Disease: From Pathogenesis to Biomarker Potential.",
    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease, is a clinically heterogeneous disorder, with obscure etiology and no disease-modifying therapy to date. Currently, there is no available biomarker for PD endophenotypes or disease progression. Accumulating evidence suggests that mutations in genes related to lysosomal function or lysosomal storage disorders may affect the risk of PD development, such as <i>GBA1</i> gene mutations. In this context, recent studies have revealed the emerging role of arylsulfatase A (ASA), a lysosomal hydrolase encoded by the <i>ARSA</i> gene causing metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) in PD pathogenesis. In particular, altered ASA levels have been detected during disease progression, and reduced enzymatic activity of ASA has been associated with an atypical PD clinical phenotype, including early cognitive impairment and essential-like tremor. Clinical evidence further reveals that specific <i>ARSA</i> gene variants may act as genetic modifiers in PD. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that ASA may function as a molecular chaperone interacting with α-synuclein (SNCA) in the cytoplasm, preventing its aggregation, secretion and cell-to-cell propagation. In this review, we summarize the results of recent preclinical and clinical studies on the role of ASA in PD, aiming to shed more light on the potential implication of ASA in PD pathogenesis and highlight its biomarker potential."

    "abstract": "There remain no approved therapies for rare but devastating neuronopathic glyocosphingolipid storage diseases, such as Sandhoff, Tay-Sachs, and Gaucher disease type 3. We previously reported initial optimization of the scaffold of eliglustat, an approved therapy for the peripheral symptoms of Gaucher disease type 1, to afford <b>2</b>, which effected modest reductions in brain glucosylceramide (GlcCer) in normal mice at 60 mg/kg. The relatively poor pharmacokinetic properties and high Pgp-mediated efflux of <b>2</b> prompted further optimization of the scaffold. With a general objective of reducing topological polar surface area, and guided by multiple metabolite identification studies, we were successful at identifying <b>17</b> (CCG-222628), which achieves remarkably greater brain exposure in mice than <b>2</b>. After demonstrating an over 60-fold improvement in potency over <b>2</b> at reducing brain GlcCer in normal mice, we compared <b>17</b> with Sanofi clinical candidate venglustat (Genz-682452) in the CBE mouse model of Gaucher disease type 3. At doses of 10 mg/kg, <b>17</b> and venglustat effected comparable reductions in both brain GlcCer and glucosylsphingosine. Importantly, <b>17</b> achieved these equivalent pharmacodynamic effects at significantly lower brain exposure than venglustat."

    "title": "Outcomes of pregnancies in patients with Gaucher Disease: The experience of a center of excellence on rare metabolic Disease-Gaucher Disease, in Greece.",
    "abstract": "Pregnancy is reported to exacerbate manifestations in women with Gaucher Disease (GD). The objective of our study was to examine the outcome of pregnancies of Caucasian women with GD in a Greek Center of Excellence on GD. Fifteen GD women were enrolled. All data were collected by questionnaire: fertility, normal pregnancies, spontaneous-elective-therapeutic abortions, maternal -neonatal status, birth weight and chromosomal abnormalities. Forty-one pregnancies were reported among 15 women: mean conception age (±SD) 27.7 ± 5.8years (range 17-42years). Thirty-seven conceptions were spontaneous, 4 were after in vitro fertilization (IVF). Twenty three out of the 41 (56.1 %) pregnancies were normal. Eleven out of the 41 (26.8 %) pregnancies resulted in spontaneous abortions, 3 out of 41 (7.3 %) in elective and 3 out of 41 (7.3 %) in therapeutic abortions. Therapeutic abortions were due to worsening of GD manifestations, fetal chromosomal abnormalities and GD type 2 embryo. Nine out of 15 women had maternal complications: gestational diabetes, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, osteoporosis and postpartum hemorrhage. Twenty three out of the 41 pregnancies resulted in live births. Nine out of the 23 (39.1 %) deliveries were caesarian sections and 14 out of 23 (60.9 %) were vaginal. The total number of neonates was 24 (14 females / 10 males). Mean gestational age on delivery (± SD) was 35.9 ± 3.1 weeks (range 26-38 w). Average female birth weight (±SD) was 2671.4 ± 851.6 g (range 900-4100 grams) and male was 3333 ± 996.4 g (range 1930-4700 grams). Nine out of 24 (37.5 %) neonates had low birth weight. Average low birth weight (±SD) was 1931.1 ± 420.52 g (range 900-2300 grams). Twenty out of the 24 (83.3 %) neonates were healthy. Four out of 24 neonates had neonatal complications: two neonates had GD type 1, one had GD type 3 and one neonate died two days after delivery (it was born at 26 weeks). Four neonates were hospitalized in incubators at the intensive neonatal care unit due to low birth weight. Thirty-nine women did not receive enzyme replacement therapy for GD during pregnancy, while, in two pregnancies, treatment was discontinued during the first trimester and re-administered after that. Mean first menarche age (±SD) was 13.6 ± 0.7 years. Thirteen out of 15 women were menopausal, mean menopausal age (± SD) 466 ± 2.6 years. Most of GD women experience uncomplicated pregnancies and deliver normal, healthy infants, although the rate of complications and the rate of abortions is high in this population."

    "title": "Synthesis of \"<i>All-Cis\"</i> Trihydroxypiperidines from a Carbohydrate-Derived Ketone: Hints for the Design of New β-Gal and GCase Inhibitors.",
    "abstract": "Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) are small compounds able to rescue the activity of mutated lysosomal enzymes when used at subinhibitory concentrations. Nitrogen-containing glycomimetics such as aza- or iminosugars are known to behave as PCs for lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). As part of our research into lysosomal sphingolipidoses inhibitors and looking in particular for new β-galactosidase inhibitors, we report the synthesis of a series of alkylated azasugars with a relative \"<i>all-cis</i>\" configuration at the hydroxy/amine-substituted stereocenters. The novel compounds were synthesized from a common carbohydrate-derived piperidinone intermediate <b>8</b>, through reductive amination or alkylation of the derived alcohol. In addition, the reaction of ketone <b>8</b> with several lithium acetylides allowed the stereoselective synthesis of new azasugars alkylated at C-3. The activity of the new compounds towards lysosomal β-galactosidase was negligible, showing that the presence of an alkyl chain in this position is detrimental to inhibitory activity. Interestingly, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, and <b>12</b> behave as good inhibitors of lysosomal β-glucosidase (GCase) (IC<sub>50</sub> = 12, 6.4, and 60 µM, respectively). When tested on cell lines bearing the Gaucher mutation, they did not impart any enzyme rescue. However, altogether, the data included in this work give interesting hints for the design of novel inhibitors."

    "abstract": "To describe the case of a 12-year-old woman with vitreoretinal manifestations of Type 3 Gaucher disease. A retrospective case report including multimodal imaging and histologic examination of the vitreous. A 12-year-old woman with a history of Gaucher disease Type 3 was referred to the ophthalmology service for evaluation of vitreous deposits in both eyes. Funduscopic examination was notable for white vitreous opacities in both eyes. Ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography demonstrated areas of blockage associated with the deposits and focal areas of leakage. Optical coherence tomography angiography showed shadow artifact without intrinsic flow at these sites. Three years after presentation, she developed a right hemorrhagic posterior vitreous detachment, requiring pars plana vitrectomy with scleral buckle. A vitreous sample was sent to pathology, which demonstrated Gaucher cells. Gaucher disease is a rare metabolic condition caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of hemorrhagic posterior vitreous detachment in Type 3 Gaucher disease, including ultra-widefield imaging, optical coherence tomography angiography, and histopathology."

    "title": "Shoulder Osteonecrosis: Pathogenesis, Causes, Clinical Evaluation, Imaging, and Classification.",
    "abstract": "The humeral head is the second most common site for nontraumatic osteonecrosis after the femoral head, yet it has attracted relatively little attention. Osteonecrosis is associated with many conditions, such as traumatism, corticosteroid use, sickle cell disease, alcoholism, dysbarism (or caisson disease), and Gaucher's disease. The diagnosis is clinical and radiographic with MRI, with radiographs being the basis for staging. Many theories have been proposed to decipher the mechanism behind the development of osteonecrosis, but none have been proven. Because osteonecrosis may affect patients with a variety of risk factors, it is important that caregivers have a heightened index of suspicion. Early detection may affect prognosis because prognosis is dependent on the stage and location of the disease. In particular, the disease should be suspected in patients with a history of fractures, steroid usage, or sickle cell disease, and in divers. This report reviews osteonecrosis of the humeral head, with an emphasis on causes, clinical evaluation, imaging, and classification."

    "abstract": "Eliglustat is a first-line oral treatment for adults with Gaucher disease type 1 who have cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 extensive, intermediate, or poor metabolizer phenotypes. Per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E14 guidance, a Phase 1 thorough electrocardiographic (ECG) study was done during drug development to assess eliglustat's effects on cardiac repolarization by measuring ECG intervals in healthy adult subjects. Using data from the thorough ECG study, we performed pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic-ECG modeling to establish the relationship between eliglustat concentrations and their effects on ECG intervals. We then used that concentration-response relationship to predict the effects of eliglustat on each ECG interval for each CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype (the main determinant of eliglustat exposure) and in different drug-drug interaction scenarios. These predictions, together with other exposure-related factors, contributed to the CYP2D6 phenotype-based dosing recommendations for eliglustat, including dose adjustments and contraindications when co-administered with drugs metabolized by the CYP2D6 and CYP3A pathways."

    "title": "Cardiac involvement in Lysosomal Storage Diseases.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) include a heterogeneous group of rare, inborn, metabolic diseases characterized by deficiency of lysosomal enzymes or of other proteins involved in lysosomal function, leading to multi organ system substrates accumulation, with consequent multi systemic clinical presentation. Cardiac disease is particularly important in some group of LSDs as glycogen storage diseases (Pompe), mucopolysaccharidoses and in glycosphingolipidoses (Anderson-Fabry disease and less frequently Gaucher disease). Various cardiac manifestations may be observed including hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease and valvular disease. The availability of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has changed the natural history of some LSDs such as Pompe disease, thanks to the significant effects on cardiological involvement. In other LSDs such as MPSs or Fabry disease, ERT has been shown to stabilize or slow the progression of heart damage. This imposes the need for a timely diagnosis that allows a rapid onset of ERT."

    "abstract": "The challenges in the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of Gaucher disease (GD), an autosomal recessive inborn error of glycosphingolipid metabolism, can negatively impact clinical outcomes. This systematic literature review evaluated the value of glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), as the most reliable biomarker currently available for the diagnosis, prognosis, and disease/treatment monitoring of patients with GD. Literature searches were conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, ScienceOpen, Science.gov, Biological Abstracts, and Sci-Hub to identify original research articles relevant to lyso-Gb1 and GD published before March 2019. Seventy-four articles met the inclusion criteria, encompassing 56 related to pathology and 21 related to clinical biomarkers. Evidence for lyso-Gb1 as a pathogenic mediator of GD was unequivocal, although its precise role requires further elucidation. Lyso-Gb1 was deemed a statistically reliable diagnostic and pharmacodynamic biomarker in GD. Evidence supports lyso-Gb1 as a disease-monitoring biomarker for GD, and some evidence supports lyso-Gb1 as a prognostic biomarker, but further study is required. Lyso-Gb1 meets the criteria for a biomarker as it is easily accessible and reliably quantifiable in plasma and dried blood spots, enables the elucidation of GD molecular pathogenesis, is diagnostically valuable, and reflects therapeutic responses. Evidentiary standards appropriate for verifying inter-laboratory lyso-Gb1 concentrations in plasma and in other anatomical sites are needed."
