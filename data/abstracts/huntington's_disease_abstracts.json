        "abstract": "Epigenetic reprogramming has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases by targeting reversible gene expression changes without altering the underlying DNA sequence. This review explores key epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs, and chromatin remodeling, that contribute to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Pharmacological interventions such as DNA methylation modulators, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and non-coding RNA therapies have shown potential in restoring normal gene function. Advanced approaches, including CRISPR-dCas9 epigenetic editing, synthetic transcription factors (STFs), and Yamanaka factor-mediated cellular rejuvenation, offer precise control over disease-associated gene expression. Despite these advancements, several challenges and controversies remain, including off-target effects, delivery limitations, long-term safety concerns, and ethical implications. Emerging research focuses on multi-target combination therapies, integrating epigenetic interventions with stem cell therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and AI-driven precision medicine. Future directions involve the development of non-invasive drug delivery systems, AI-powered biomarker discovery, and personalized epigenome-based treatments to enhance therapeutic outcomes. As research advances, epigenetic reprogramming holds the potential to revolutionize neurodegenerative disease treatment, providing more effective, individualized, and disease-modifying interventions."

        "title": "Neuroglobin: A promising candidate to treat neurological diseases.",
        "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative illnesses constitute a global health issue and a foremost economic burden since they are a large cause of incapacity and death worldwide. Altogether, the burden of neurological disorders has increased considerably over the past 30 years because of population aging. Overall, neurological diseases significantly impair cognitive and motor functions and their incidence will increase as societies age and the world's population continues to grow. Autism spectrum disorder, motor neuron disease, encephalopathy, epilepsy, stroke, ataxia, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease represent a non-exhaustive list of neurological illnesses. These affections are due to perturbations in cellular homeostasis leading to the progressive injury and death of neurons in the nervous system. Among the common features of neurological handicaps, we find protein aggregation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial impairment in the target tissues, e.g., the brain, cerebellum, and spinal cord. The high energy requirements of neurons and their inability to produce sufficient adenosine triphosphate by glycolysis, are responsible for their dependence on functional mitochondria for their integrity. Reactive oxygen species, produced along with the respiration process within mitochondria, can lead to oxidative stress, which compromises neuronal survival. Besides having an essential role in energy production and oxidative stress, mitochondria are indispensable for an array of cellular processes, such as amino acid metabolism, iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, calcium homeostasis, intrinsic programmed cell death (apoptosis), and intraorganellar signaling. Despite the progress made in the last decades in the understanding of a growing number of genetic and molecular causes of central nervous diseases, therapies that are effective to diminish or halt neuronal dysfunction/death are rare. Given the genetic complexity responsible for neurological disorders, the development of neuroprotective strategies seeking to preserve mitochondrial homeostasis is a realistic challenge to lastingly diminish the harmful evolution of these pathologies and so to recover quality of life. A promising candidate is the neuroglobin, a globin superfamily member of 151 amino acids, which is found at high levels in the brain, the eye, and the cerebellum. The protein, which localizes to mitochondria, is involved in electron transfer, oxygen storage and defence against oxidative stress; hence, possessing neuroprotective properties. This review surveys up-to-date knowledge and emphasizes on existing investigations regarding neuroglobin physiological functions, which remain since its discovery in 2000 under intense debate and the possibility of using neuroglobin either by gene therapy or its direct delivery into the brain to treat neurological disorders."

        "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin (<i>HTT</i>) gene. Nuclease-deficient Cas9 protein (dCas9) epigenetic editing for targeted gene regulation is a promising therapeutic approach for HD through downregulation of the causative gene, <i>HTT</i>. A screen of several dCas9 variants with expanded PAM recognition was fused to KRAB and DNMT3A/L to assess the ability to downregulate total <i>HTT</i>. Surprisingly, only <i>S</i> <i>p</i>dCas9 could significantly downregulate <i>HTT</i>, while expanded PAM recognition variants dxCas9 and dCas9-VQR were less efficient or unable to reduce <i>HTT</i> expression. Using our lead construct with <i>S</i> <i>p</i>dCas9, DNA methylation changes were assessed through reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, showing high on-target increases in DNA methylation and few off-targets. In addition, <i>HTT</i> silencing was mitotically stable for up to 6 weeks in a rapidly dividing cell line. Finally, significant downregulation of <i>HTT</i> was achieved in patient-derived neuronal stem cells, showing the efficacy of this system in a disease-relevant cell type. This approach represents a novel therapeutic pathway for the treatment of HD."

        "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable hereditary disorder caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the Huntingtin gene (HTT). HD is characterized by motor dysfunction and cognitive decline. The pathophysiology of HD begins in cortico-striatal circuits and later spreads to other brain regions, notably the hippocampus. At the cellular level, structural changes in synapses have been observed prior to neuronal degeneration, significantly disrupting the formation and maintenance of neuronal circuits. The postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95, hereafter Dlg4/PSD95) is a key synaptic plasticity protein reduced in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epigenetic silencing of plasticity and memory genes contributes to AD pathology and cognitive impairment. To restore endogenous Dlg4/PSD95 expression in AD, we previously developed an epigenetic editing strategy where a zinc finger DNA-binding domain targeting the Dlg4/PSD95 gene promoter was fused to the transactivation domain VP64 and driven under a CMV promoter. AAV-PhP.B-mediated delivery of this artificial transcription factor (ATF) CMV-PSD95-6ZF-VP64 improved cognition in an AD mouse model. Here, we assessed the therapeutic potential of AAV9-mediated delivery of the synapsin-driven ATF PSD95-6ZF-VP64 in the R6/2 HD mouse model. Consistent with the previous studies, R6/2 mice exhibited reduced hippocampal Dlg4/PSD95 mRNA and protein levels in young adulthood (7 weeks), which persisted into early adulthood (14 weeks). Starting at adolescents (4 weeks), the R6/2 mice also displayed motor (i.e., accelerated rotarod) and cognitive (i.e., Barnes maze and object location memory) impairments. In wild-type primary hippocampal cultures, AAV9-PSD95-6ZF-VP64 led to an increase in synaptic PSD-95 clusters and spine size. Intracerebroventricular injections of neonatal R6/2 mice with AAV9-PSD95-6ZF-VP64 elevated hippocampal Dlg4/PSD95 expression levels to those observed in control non-transgenic mice. Importantly, AAV9-PSD95-6ZF-VP64 effectively improved hippocampal-dependent deficits in spatial learning and memory in young adult HD mice, as well as impairments in motor coordination and motor skill learning, with these benefits persisting into adulthood. This work validates Dlg4/PSD95 as a key player in the prodromal phase of HD pathology and establishes the ATF PSD95-6ZF-VP64 as an attractive therapeutic tool for treating the disease's early phase."

        "abstract": "Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) accounts for 40% of endometrial cancer-related deaths. The standard of care for stages III and IV USC yields a 20%-30% survival at 2 years and a 10%-20% survival at 3-5 years. Recent advances in the second-line treatment of advanced or recurrent USC are rapidly evolving. Targeted therapeutic approaches with the use of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, as well as the use of trastuzumab deruxtecan, offer new hope for successful second-line therapies for patients. However, further investigation into novel targeted therapeutic approaches is warranted, given the high burden of disease associated with this aggressive histological subtype. USC shares clinical and genomic similarities with epithelial ovarian cancer, suggesting a correlation with 'BRCAness'. Niraparib, a potent PARP1 and PARP2 inhibitor, was shown to have a positive impact on platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, regardless of the presence or absence of BRCA status. Our hypothesis is that patients with stage III, stage IV and platinum-sensitive recurrent USC receiving niraparib maintenance in addition to standard therapy for USC may have an improved progression-free survival. Participating sites include the primary site, Northwell Health Zucker Cancer Centre, and secondary site, Rutgers Cancer Institute of NJ. Females over the age of 18 with stage III, stage IV or platinum-sensitive recurrent USC will be recruited and enrolled based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. 24 subjects will be enrolled during phase 1 and 21 subjects will be enrolled during phase 2, over a total of 3 years. Patients will receive an individualised dose of niraparib daily every 28 days per cycle for 1 year or until progression of disease. Follow-up of disease status will continue for 5 years poststudy treatment. This phase II clinical trial will employ a Simon two-stage minimax design to test the null hypothesis that the 1 year response rate is <20% versus the alternative hypothesis that the 1 year response rate is ≥40%, with alpha=0.05 and power=0.90. Ethical approval was granted by Northwell Health Cancer Institute institutional review board (reference number: 19-0380) and PRMS.

        "abstract": "Loss of Y chromosome (LOY), an age-related somatic mutation, is associated with various age-related diseases, but its role in the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. This study investigated the relationship between blood LOY levels and the risk of PD onset and progression. We estimated the LOY level for each male participant based on genome-wide arrays or whole genome sequencing data. We performed Cox proportional hazards regression analysis among 222,598 male participants in the UK Biobank and linear mixed model analysis involving 2574 male individuals with PD across 14 cohorts, encompassing 19,562 visits. In the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort, we further compared brain structure using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and carried out brain network functional connectivity analysis based on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) datasets. Additionally, we assessed the LOY status in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data, which included 1,303,531 cells from 279 post-mortem samples across five brain regions, and performed temporal dynamic gene expression analysis. Male participants with LOY had a slightly higher risk of developing PD during follow-up (HR = 1·16, 95% CI = 1·01-1·34, P = 0·04). Among males affected by PD, LOY carriers experienced accelerated neurodegenerative progression, manifesting as more rapid motor impairment (P = 0·0072) and cognitive decline (P = 0·0005) compared to non-LOY carriers. Patients with PD carrying LOY also exhibited decreased network functional connectivity in certain brain regions. Notably, LOY cells were particularly enriched in microglia/immune and vascular/epithelial cells, and a subset of genes in LOY-Mic P2RY12 cells were associated with PD progression. This data-driven study highlights the potential association of LOY with the onset and progression of PD through the analysis of multi-scale data, including clinical phenotypes, brain neuroimaging maps, and molecular profiles from single-nucleus transcriptome across multi-brain regions. These findings suggest that LOY may be an accomplice to the onset and progression of PD.

        "abstract": "Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are synthetic nucleic acid analogues offering distinct structural and functional advantages over conventional RNA and DNA, positioning them as powerful molecules in molecular biology. Recently, PNAs have gained significant attention for their potential in the prevention and management of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury (SCI), depression, and anxiety. PNA5, a specific PNA variant, is highly expressed in neocortical association regions, particularly in primates, and plays a critical role in high-level cognitive functions such as reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving. It can form stable, sequence-specific hybridizations with nucleic acids, resist nuclease degradation, and efficiently cross cellular membranes, making them ideal candidates for targeting disease-related genes in the brain. PNA5 has shown neuroprotective properties by improving cognitive function, reducing neuroinflammation, and preserving the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Additionally, it supports critical processes such as neural migration, axon guidance, and synaptogenesis, which are vital for maintaining proper brain function. This review explores the mechanisms by which PNAs, particularly PNA5, exert therapeutic effects in neurological disorders. It highlights their role in gene modulation, protein regulation, and potential strategies for enhancing PNA delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) and its related disorders."

        "title": "Reversing Epigenetic Dysregulation in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Mechanistic and Therapeutic Considerations.",
        "abstract": "Epigenetic dysregulation has emerged as an important player in the pathobiology of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Aberrant DNA methylation, histone modifications, and dysregulated non-coding RNAs have been shown to contribute to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. These alterations are often exacerbated by environmental toxins, which induce oxidative stress, inflammation, and genomic instability. Reversing epigenetic aberrations may offer an avenue for restoring brain mechanisms and mitigating neurodegeneration. Herein, we revisit the evidence suggesting the ameliorative effects of epigenetic modulators in toxin-induced models of NDDs. The restoration of normal gene expressions, the improvement of neuronal function, and the reduction in pathological markers by histone deacetylase (HDAC) and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors have been demonstrated in preclinical models of NDDs. Encouragingly, in clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease (AD), HDAC inhibitors have caused improvements in cognition and memory. Combining these beneficial effects of epigenetic modulators with neuroprotective agents and the clearance of misfolded amyloid proteins may offer synergistic benefits. Reinforced by the emerging methods for more effective and brain-specific delivery, reversibility, and safety considerations, epigenetic modulators are anticipated to minimize systemic toxicity and yield more favorable outcomes in NDDs. In summary, although still in their infancy, epigenetic modulators offer an integrated strategy to address the multifactorial nature of NDDs, altering their therapeutic landscape."

Unhealthy aging often associates with cognitive decline and motor-neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, which include dietary habits, interact with aging and influence brain health, thus having an impact on the development of neurodegenerative disorders. In this context, fungal-derived bioactive compounds have emerged as promising neuroprotective agents due to their diverse biological properties that include antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, pro-autophagic, and neurotrophic effects. Key fungal metabolites, including polysaccharides, terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds have been shown to modulate neuroinflammatory pathways, enhance neuronal survival, stimulate protective autophagy, and promote synaptic plasticity. Still, challenges related to their bioavailability, standardization, and clinical translation remain unresolved. Future deep research will be crucial to unlocking the full therapeutic potential of fungal-derived neuroprotective compounds. This review examines the potential therapeutic role of fungal metabolites, providing a comparative evaluation with a focus on their mechanisms of action in promoting brain health and longevity."

        "abstract": "<b>Importance:</b> Genomic sequencing enables the rapid identification of a breadth of genetic variants. For clinical purposes, sequencing for small genetic variations is considered a solved problem, while challenges remain for structural variants, given the lower sensitivity and specificity. Interest has recently risen among governing bodies in developing protocols for population-wide genetic screening. However, usefulness is constrained when the probability of being affected by a rare disease remains low, despite a positive genetic test. This is a common scenario in neurodegenerative disorders. The problem is recognised among statisticians and statistical geneticists but is less well-understood by clinicians and researchers who will act on these results, and by the general public who might access screening services directly without the appropriate support for interpretation. <b>Observations:</b> We explore the probability of subsequent disease following genetic screening of several variants, both single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and larger repeat expansions, for two neurological conditions, Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), comparing these results with screening for phenylketonuria, which is well-established. The risk following a positive screening test was 0.5% for <i>C9orf72</i> in ALS and 0.4% for <i>HTT</i> in HD when testing repeat expansions, for which the test had sub-optimal performance (sensitivity = 99% and specificity = 90%), and 12.7% for phenylketonuria and 10.9% for ALS <i>SOD1</i> when testing pathogenic SNVs (sensitivity = 99.96% and specificity = 99.95%). Subsequent screening confirmation via PCR for <i>C9orf72</i> led to a 2% risk of developing ALS as a result of the reduced penetrance (44%). <b>Conclusions and Relevance:</b> We show that risk following a positive screening test result can be strikingly low for rare neurological diseases, even for fully penetrant variants such as <i>HTT</i>, if the test has sub-optimal performance. Accordingly, to maximise the utility of screening, it is vital to prioritise protocols with very high sensitivity and specificity, and a careful selection of markers for screening, giving regard to clinical interpretability, actionability, high penetrance, and secondary testing to confirm positive findings."

The CAG•CTG sequence is found in approximately one-third of pathogenic TNR loci, including the HTT gene that causes Huntington's disease. Friedreich's ataxia, the most prevalent hereditary ataxia, results from GAA repeat expansion at the FXN gene. Here we used cytosine and adenine base editing to reduce the repetitiveness of TNRs in patient cells and in mice. Base editors introduced G•C>A•T and A•T>G•C interruptions at CAG and GAA repeats, mimicking stable, nonpathogenic alleles that naturally occur in people. AAV9 delivery of optimized base editors in Htt.Q111 Huntington's disease and YG8s Friedreich's ataxia mice resulted in efficient editing in transduced tissues, and significantly reduced repeat expansion in the central nervous system. These findings demonstrate that introducing interruptions in pathogenic TNRs can mitigate a key neurological feature of TNR diseases in vivo."

Neurotrophins are a class of protein-secreting cells that serve as the primary ligand for the Trk receptors. The four primary neurotrophins are nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived nerve factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin-4/5. Mounting evidence suggests that Trk receptors can be categorized into three types: TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC. These receptors play a crucial role in facilitating neuronal growth and development. Trk receptors influence the survival and differentiation of neurons via many signalling cascades. Neurotrophin interaction with Trk receptors triggers a signalling cascade involving PLC, PI3K/Akt, and Ras/MAPK signalling pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that diminished neurotrophic support, changes in Trk receptor expression, or disruptions in signalling cascades play a crucial role in the development of various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and many more.

One such capsid, AAV-DB-3, provided transduction of up to 45% of medium spiny neurons in the adult NHP striatum, along with substantial transduction of relevant deep layer neurons in the cortex.

Therapeutic strategies include enhancing mHTT degradation, gene silencing via antisense oligonucleotides and RNAi, promoting neuroprotection through BDNF signaling, and modulating neurotransmitters like glutamate and dopamine. Berberine, a natural isoquinoline alkaloid, has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for HD due to its multifaceted neuroprotective properties. Research indicates that berberine can mitigate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including HD, by targeting various molecular pathways. It exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and autophagy-enhancing effects, which are crucial in reducing neuronal damage and apoptosis associated with HD. These properties make berberine a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention in HD, as demonstrated in both cellular and animal models. Berberine activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is vital for cell survival and neuroprotection. It reduces oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, both of which are implicated in HD pathology. Berberine enhances autophagic processes, promoting the degradation of mutant huntingtin protein, a key pathological feature of HD. In transgenic HD mouse models, berberine administration has been shown to alleviate motor dysfunction and prolong survival. It effectively reduces the accumulation of mutant huntingtin in cultured cells, suggesting a direct impact on the disease's molecular underpinnings. Berberine's safety profile, established through its use in treating other conditions, supports its potential for clinical trials in HD patients. Its ability to modulate neurotransmitter levels and engage multiple signaling pathways further underscores its therapeutic promise. While berberine shows significant potential as a therapeutic agent for HD, further research is necessary to fully elucidate its mechanisms and optimize its clinical application. The current evidence in the review paper, primarily from preclinical studies, provides a strong foundation for future investigations into berberine's efficacy and safety in human HD patients."

        "abstract": "The identification of active interventions in neurodegenerative disorders is a major challenge in neurology; the use of repurposed drugs may represent a valuable strategy. Tetracyclines, a second generation of antibiotic molecules, offer various potential applications. Following an anecdotal observation of the potential anti-amyloidogenic activity of iododoxorubicin, the search for chemical analogs with a better safety profile led to tetracyclines. Their heterocyclic structures with a planar conformation interfere with b-sheet amyloid formation. Thus, doxycycline, a derivative with favorable blood-brain barrier penetration, emerged as a strong candidate to combat peripheral and central amyloidosis. In particular, we tested the anti-prion activity of doxycycline in vitro and in vivo experiments, confirming its capacity to disrupt or inhibit the formation of prion protein aggregates associated with pathological events. Treatment with doxycycline in human subjects with prion - related encephalopathies yielded contradictory results, suggesting that a preventive approach is a more favorable condition to verify efficacy; a clinical trial involving subjects at genetic risk of developing fatal familial insomnia, exposed to doxycycline for ten years, is currently ongoing. The anti-amyloidogenic capacity of doxycycline, combined with its safety profile in long-term treatment, has suggested its use in peripheral amyloidosis, which was tested with positive results. A specific interaction with β-amyloid or α-synuclein oligomers, as well as tau aggregation has also been demonstrated. More recently, the action of doxycycline has been extended to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacities. In particular, the anti-inflammatory activity of doxycycline may explain the drug 's efficacy in numerous experimental models where protein misfolding has been associated with neuroinflammation, including Huntington's and Parkinson' s diseases. Thus, the pleiotropic action of doxycycline appears to be an interesting tool for addressing progressive neuronal dysfunction in multifactorial neurodegenerative diseases. The application of precision medicine principles to doxycycline treatment represents the best strategy to determine its efficacy. These aspects are illustrated here concerning another pleiotropic tetracycline, minocycline."

        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), present an increasingly significant global health burden, primarily due to the lack of effective early diagnostic tools and treatments. Exosomes-nano-sized extracellular vesicles secreted by nearly all cell types-have emerged as promising candidates for both biomarkers and therapeutic agents in NDs. This review examines the biogenesis, molecular composition, and diverse functions of exosomes in NDs. Exosomes play a crucial role in mediating intercellular communication. They are capable of reflecting the biochemical state of their parent cells and have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In doing so, they facilitate the propagation of pathological proteins, such as amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau, and alpha-synuclein (α-syn), while also enabling the targeted delivery of neuroprotective compounds. Recent advancements in exosome isolation and engineering have opened up new possibilities for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. These range from the discovery of non-invasive biomarkers to innovative approaches in gene therapy and drug delivery systems. However, challenges related to standardization, safety, and long-term effects must be addressed before exosomes can be translated into clinical applications. This review highlights both the promising potential and the obstacles that must be overcome to leverage exosomes in the treatment of NDs and the transformation of personalized medicine."

Despite symptomatic relief from current therapies, disease-modifying treatments targeting the core molecular mechanism are still lacking. RNA-based therapies offer a promising approach to treating neurodegenerative disease by targeting molecular mechanisms such as gene expression, protein synthesis, and neuroinflammation. Therapeutic strategies include Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), RNA interference (RNAi), small interfering RNA (siRNA) and short hairpin RNA (shRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA) therapies, and microRNA (miRNA)-based interventions. These therapies aim to decrease toxic protein accumulation, restore deficient proteins, and modulate inflammatory responses in conditions like AD, PD, and HD. Unlike conventional treatments that primarily manage symptoms, RNA-based therapies have the potential to modify disease progression by addressing its root causes. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current RNA-based therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases, discussing their mechanism of action, preclinical and clinical advancement. It further explores innovative solutions, including nanocarrier-mediated delivery, chemical modifications to enhance RNA stability, and personalized medicine approaches guided by genetic profiling that are being developed to overcome these barriers. This review also underscores the therapeutic opportunities and current limitations of RNA-based interventions, highlighting their potential to transform the future of neurodegenerative disease management."

Although progress has been made, there is still a lack of effective cures to date, and an in-depth understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of these neurodegenerative diseases is imperative for drug development. Protein phosphorylation, regulated by protein kinases and protein phosphatases, participates in most cellular events, whereas aberrant phosphorylation manifests as a main cause of diseases. As evidenced by pharmacological and pathological studies, protein kinases are proven to be promising therapeutic targets for various diseases, such as cancers, central nervous system disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. The mechanisms of protein phosphatases in pathophysiology have been extensively reviewed, but a systematic summary of the role of protein kinases in the nervous system is lacking. Here, we focus on the involvement of protein kinases in neurodegenerative diseases, by summarizing the current knowledge on the major kinases and related regulatory signal transduction pathways implicated in diseases. We further discuss the role and complexity of kinase-kinase networks in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, illustrate the advances of clinical applications of protein kinase inhibitors or novel kinase-targeted therapeutic strategies (such as antisense oligonucleotides and gene therapy) for effective prevention and early intervention."

        "abstract": "Huntington disease is a rare neurodegenerative disorder with no disease-modifying therapies. This study aimed to quantify longitudinal changes in Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) scores and evaluate their susceptibility to placebo response, enhancing our understanding of disease progression and ability to optimize future trials. We used data from the Enroll-HD natural history study (NCT01574053) and the GENERATION HD1 phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03761849) to model disease progression and placebo response for UHDRS scores, which are commonly used to evaluate disease progression in clinical trials. We included 8,071 Enroll-HD participants (mean baseline age: 51.4 years, 51.5% female) to develop a natural history progression model using baseline characteristics as predictive covariates. This model was then used to predict natural history progression of 260 participants from the GENERATION HD1 placebo arm (mean baseline age: 48.7 years, 43.5% female).The progression measured by Total Functional Capacity (TFC) in the GENERATION HD1 placebo arm aligned with predicted natural history (within 95% CI), indicating no significant placebo response. However, significant improvements (outside the 95% CI of the model) were observed after baseline for Total Motor Score (TMS), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) score, and Stroop Word Reading (SWR) score. The improvement in TMS persisted until the end of the dosing period (week 69), converging to natural history predictions at subsequent follow-up visits (weeks 85 and 101), suggesting a placebo effect. By contrast, cognitive scores (SDMT and SWR) showed sustained significant improvement (outside the 95% CI) up to the final follow-up visit at week 101, likely due to practice effects from the more frequent testing schedule in GENERATION HD1 compared with the annual assessments in Enroll-HD. Consequently, the composite UHDRS (cUHDRS) score, a linear combination of TFC, TMS, SDMT, and SWR, is influenced by both placebo and practice effects. Our results suggest that clinical scores in Huntington disease trials are susceptible to long-term placebo responses. These effects should be considered in future trial designs, especially when comparing trial data with natural history studies. Although based on the largest Huntington's trial, our results rely on limited placebo data and may not generalize to other trials with different populations, treatments, and designs."

        "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a monogenic neurodegenerative disorder typically characterized by chorea, a hyperkinetic motor feature. Historical data suggest that hypokinetic features, like rigidity and bradykinesia, become more prominent in later stages of HD. No evidence-based analysis has confirmed this observation. Additionally, several motor features of the disease are not clearly defined as hypokinetic or hyperkinetic. This study aimed to 1) elucidate the trajectory of hyperkinetic and hypokinetic features across the disease course and 2) to classify vague motor features as following a hyperkinetic or hypokinetic trajectory. Data from 13,475 motor-manifest HD patients from the Enroll-HD platform were analyzed. Linear mixed-effects models were constructed for each of the 31 Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor subscales, with disease burden as the primary predictor. The models were used to generate the trajectories of features known to represent hyperkinesis and hypokinesis, with the same being done for vague subscales. Dynamic time warping (DTW) was then used to classify said subscales as having a hyperkinetic or hypokinetic trajectory. Hyperkinetic features rise initially and diminish in middle disease, while hypokinetic features continually increase across the disease course. All non-choreiform features demonstrated a hypokinetic-like trajectory. HD is generally considered a hyperkinetic movement disorder, but the middle and late stages of the disease are predominated by hypokinesis. These findings suggest that hypokinetic features may be a larger contributor to the overall motor burden of HD. This has significant implications for clinical trial design, motor phenotype clustering, and pharmacotherapy."

        "abstract": "The cure rate for chronic neurodegenerative diseases remains low, creating an urgent need for improved intervention methods. Recent studies have shown that enhancing mitochondrial function can mitigate the effects of these diseases. This paper comprehensively reviews the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to uncover the potential use of targeted mitochondrial interventions as viable therapeutic options. We detail five targeted mitochondrial intervention strategies for chronic neurodegenerative diseases that act by promoting mitophagy, inhibiting mitochondrial fission, enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, applying mitochondria-targeting antioxidants, and transplanting mitochondria. Each method has unique advantages and potential limitations, making them suitable for various therapeutic situations. Therapies that promote mitophagy or inhibit mitochondrial fission could be particularly effective in slowing disease progression, especially in the early stages. In contrast, those that enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and apply mitochondria-targeting antioxidants may offer great benefits during the middle stages of the disease by improving cellular antioxidant capacity and energy metabolism. Mitochondrial transplantation, while still experimental, holds great promise for restoring the function of damaged cells. Future research should focus on exploring the mechanisms and effects of these intervention strategies, particularly regarding their safety and efficacy in clinical settings. Additionally, the development of innovative mitochondria-targeting approaches, such as gene editing and nanotechnology, may provide new solutions for treating chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Implementing combined therapeutic strategies that integrate multiple intervention methods could also enhance treatment outcomes."

A total of 215 lung cancer patients with BrMs confirmed by surgical pathology were retrospectively included in five centres, 167 patients were assigned to the training cohort, and 48 to the external test cohort. All patients underwent regular follow-up brain MRIs. Clinical and morphological MRI models for predicting RFS were built using univariate and multivariate Cox regressions, respectively. Handcrafted and deep learning (DL) signatures were constructed from BrMs pretreatment MR images using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method, respectively. A DLRM was established by integrating the clinical and morphological MRI predictors, handcrafted and DL signatures based on the multivariate Cox regression coefficients. The Harrell C-index, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and Kaplan-Meier's survival analysis were used to evaluate model performance. The DLRM showed satisfactory performance in predicting RFS and 6- to 18-month intracranial recurrence in lung cancer patients after BrMs resection, achieving a C-index of 0.79 and AUCs of 0.84-0.90 in the training set and a C-index of 0.74 and AUCs of 0.71-0.85 in the external test set. The DLRM outperformed the clinical model, morphological MRI model, handcrafted signature, DL signature, and clinical-morphological MRI model in predicting RFS (P < 0.05). The DLRM successfully classified patients into high-risk and low-risk intracranial recurrence groups (P < 0.001).

Recent studies provide compelling information regarding the contribution of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), a potent neuropeptide, in regulating neuroinflammation, vasodilation, and neuronal survival in these disorders. This review systematically delves into the multidimensional aspects of CGRP as both a neuroprotective agent and a neurotoxic factor in NDDs. The neuroprotective effects of CGRP include suppression of inflammation, regulation of intracellular signaling pathways, and promotion of neuronal growth and survival. However, under pathological conditions, its overexpression or dysregulation is associated with oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and neuronal death. The therapeutic use of CGRP and its receptor antagonists in migraine provides substantial evidence for CGRP's therapeutic potential, which can be further explored for the management of NDDs. However, since the bidirectional nature of CGRP effects is evident, it is crucial to gain an accurate insight into its mechanisms to target only the neuropeptide's beneficial effects while completely avoiding the undesired consequences. Further studies should focus on understanding the context-dependent activity of CGRP in the hope of designing targeted therapy for NDDs, which could gradually transform the current pharmacological management of NDDs."

        "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a detrimental neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of a CAG triplet in the <i>HTT</i> gene. This mutation leads to the production of mutant Huntingtin (Htt) protein with toxic gain-of-function. The mHtt is responsible in several ways for the establishment of an intricate pathogenetic scenario in affected cells, particularly in HD neurons. Among the features of HD, oxidative stress plays a relevant role in the progression of the disease at the cellular level. Mitochondrial dysfunction, bioenergetic deficits, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production, neuroinflammation, and general reduction of antioxidant levels are all involved in the promotion of a toxic oxidative environment, eventually causing cell death. Nonetheless, neuronal cells exert antioxidant molecules to build up defense mechanisms. Key components of these defensive mechanisms are the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 α (PGC-1α). Thus, this review aims to describe the involvement of oxidative stress in HD by exploring the roles of NRF2 and PGC-1α, crucial actors in this play.

        "abstract": "Progressive neuronal loss is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which cause cognitive and motor impairment. Delaying the onset and course of symptoms is largely dependent on neuroadaptation, the brain's ability to restructure in response to damage. The molecular, cellular, and systemic processes that underlie neuroadaptation are examined in this study. These mechanisms include gliosis, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and changes in neurotrophic factors. Axonal sprouting, dendritic remodelling, and compensatory alterations in neurotransmitter systems are important adaptations observed in NDDs; nevertheless, these processes may shift to maladaptive plasticity, which would aid in the advancement of the illness. Amyloid and tau pathology-induced synaptic alterations in Alzheimer's disease emphasize compensatory network reconfiguration. Dopamine depletion causes a major remodelling of the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease, and non-dopaminergic systems compensate. Both ALS and Huntington's disease rely on motor circuit rearrangement and transcriptional dysregulation to slow down functional deterioration. Neuroadaptation is, however, constrained by oxidative stress, compromised autophagy, and neuroinflammation, particularly in elderly populations. The goal of emerging therapy strategies is to improve neuroadaptation by pharmacologically modifying neurotrophic factors, neuroinflammation, and synaptic plasticity. Neurostimulation, cognitive training, and physical rehabilitation are instances of non-pharmacological therapies that support neuroplasticity. Restoring compensating systems may be possible with the use of stem cell techniques and new gene treatments. The goal of future research is to combine biomarkers and individualized medicines to maximize neuroadaptive responses and decrease the course of illness. In order to reduce neurodegeneration and enhance patient outcomes, this review highlights the dual function of neuroadaptation in NDDs and its potential as a therapeutic target."

        "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (Htt) resulting in an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the huntingtin (HTT) protein. The expanded polyQ alters structure of HTT making it susceptible to aggregation. The expression of mutant HTT (mHTT) causes dysregulation of several key cellular pathways in neuronal cells resulting in neurodegeneration. Recent studies have demonstrated phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of the huntingtin (N-HTT) protein as an important regulator of its localization, structure, aggregation, clearance and toxicity. Most studies have focused on the effect of phosphorylation of Ser13 and Ser16 in N-HTT on protein aggregation and reported a drastic reduction in aggregation. However, the downstream impact of this phosphorylation status on key cellular pathways is largely unexplored. Utilizing an inducible cell line model for expression of Exon 1 fragment of mHTT bearing 150 polyglutamine repeats (HD150Q), we demonstrate that kinetin induced phosphorylation at Ser13 and Ser16 of N-HTT resulted in prevention of aggregation as well as resolution of preformed aggregates. Furthermore, kinetin treatment led to rescue of ATP levels and transcription of key genes as well as significant reduction in mitochondrial ROS levels restoring mitochondrial function. Notably, ER stress markers were significantly reduced at transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels. Restoration of mitochondrial function and mitigation of ER stress lead to significant improvement in cell survival. These findings further strengthen the view that HTT N-terminal phosphorylation is a promising therapeutic target for HD."

Next to neurodegeneration, altered immune activation is involved in disease progression. Since central nervous system inflammation and dysfunction of immune cells are recognized as driving characteristics, immunomodulation might represent an additional therapeutic strategy. Short-chain fatty acids were known to have immunomodulatory effects in neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. In this study, R6/2 mice were treated daily with 150 mM propionate. Survival range, body weight, and motor abilities were monitored. In striatal and cortical samples, neuronal survival was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining of NeuN-positive cells and expression levels of BDNF mRNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction. As inflammatory marker TNFα mRNA and IL-6 mRNA were quantified by rtPCR, iNOS-expressing cells were counted in immunologically stained brain slides. Microglial activation was evaluated by immunofluorescent staining of IBA1-positive cells and total IBA1 protein by Western Blot, in addition, SPI1 mRNA expression was quantified by rtPCR. Except for clasping behavior, propionate treatment did neither improve the clinical course nor mediated neuronal protection in R6/2 mice. Yet there was a mild anti-inflammatory effect in the CNS, with (i) reduction in SPI1-mRNA levels, (ii) reduced iNOS positive cells in the motor cortex, and (iii) normalized TNFα-mRNA in the motor cortex of propionate-treated R6/2 mice. Thus, Short-chain fatty acids, as an environmental factor in the diet, may slightly alleviate symptoms by down-regulating inflammatory factors in the central nervous system.

While IRFs are recognized for their regulatory functions in neuroinflammation, microglial activation, and neuronal survival, their dual roles as both drivers of pathological inflammation and mediators of neuroprotective pathways underscore a sophisticated regulatory paradox in neurodegenerative disorders. This review aims to synthesize current evidence on IRF-mediated neuroinflammation in AD and related diseases, focusing on the multifaceted functions of key IRF family members, including IRF1, IRF3, and IRF7. We critically evaluate their divergent roles: IRF1 and IRF3, for instance, exacerbate neuroinflammatory cascades and amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology in AD, whereas IRF7 may paradoxically suppress inflammation under specific conditions. Additionally, we explore IRF dysregulation in Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease, emphasizing shared and distinct mechanisms across neurodegenerative disorders. Restoring IRF balance through genetic manipulation, small-molecule inhibitors, or microbiome-derived modulators could attenuate neuroinflammation, enhance Aβ clearance, and protect neuronal integrity. Ultimately, this work provides a framework for future research to harness IRF signaling pathways in the development of precision therapies for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases."

        "title": "Alpha-Pinene Ameliorates Memory Deficits in 3-Nitropropionic Acid-Induced Rat Model of Huntington's Disease.",
        "abstract": "Memory impairment is one of the cognitive symptoms in Huntington's disease (HD) which appears before motor dysfunction in patients. Various molecular mechanisms, including disruptions in neurotrophins levels, are involved in the occurrence of memory problems in HD. Alpha-pinene (APN), a member of the monoterpene family, exhibited beneficial effects in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders. As a result, this study assessed the impact of APN on memory in the 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) induced model of HD in rats. Male Wistar rats received saline, 3-NP to model HD, or APN (1, 5, or 10 mg/kg) plus 3-NP for 21 days to assess APN's effects. Working and spatial memory were examined by the Y-maze and Morris-water-maze (MWM) tests. The mRNA levels of neurotrophins and their receptors in the brain cortex and hippocampus of the rats were quantitatively assessed through Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. The results showed that APN, at all three doses, significantly prevented the disease phenotype induced by 3-NP administration. In addition, APN treatment elevated the gene expression levels of BDNF, TrkA, TrkB, and CREB, while significantly decreasing P75 NTR showing a dose-dependent effect in the brain cortex and hippocampus, compared to the 3-NP group. These findings suggest that APN alleviates 3-NP-induced memory deficits by enhancing neurotrophins and their receptor levels in an animal model of HD."

        "title": "Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase as a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders: Mechanisms, challenges, and future directions.",
        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and functional decline, posing significant global health challenges. Emerging evidence highlights nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), a cytosolic enzyme regulating nicotinamide (NAM) methylation, as a pivotal player in NDs through its dual impact on epigenetic regulation and metabolic homeostasis. This review synthesizes current knowledge on NNMT's role in disease pathogenesis, focusing on its epigenetic modulation via DNA hypomethylation and histone modifications, alongside its disruption of NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis and homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism. Elevated NNMT activity depletes NAD<sup>+</sup>, exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction and impairing energy metabolism, while increased Hcy levels drive oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and aberrant protein aggregation (e.g., Aβ, tau, α-synuclein). Notably, NNMT overexpression in AD and PD correlates with neuronal hypomethylation and neurotoxicity, as observed in postmortem brain studies and transgenic models. Mechanistically, NNMT consumes S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), limiting methyl donor availability for DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone methyltransferases (HMTs), thereby altering gene expression patterns critical for neuronal survival. Concurrently, NNMT-mediated NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion disrupts sirtuin activity (e.g., SIRT1) and mitochondrial biogenesis, accelerating axonal degeneration. Therapeutic strategies targeting NNMT, such as RNA interference (RNAi), small-molecule inhibitors and exercise therapy, show promise in preclinical models by restoring NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and reducing Hcy toxicity. However, challenges persist in achieving cellular specificity, optimizing blood-brain barrier penetration, and mitigating off-target effects. This review underscores NNMT's potential as a multifactorial therapeutic target, bridging metabolic and epigenetic dysregulation in NDs. Future research should prioritize elucidating tissue-specific NNMT interactions, refining inhibitor pharmacokinetics, and validating translational efficacy in clinical trials. Addressing these gaps could pave the way for novel disease-modifying therapies to combat the rising burden of neurodegeneration."

        "title": "Neuroprotective role of morin hydrate on 3-nitropropionic acid-elicited huntington's disease: in vivo investigation of RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL necroptosis signaling pathway.",
        "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare dominantly inheritable autosomal neurodegenerative disease with unclear pathophysiological pathways. In neurodegenerative disorders, including HD, necroptosis plays a significant role in neuronal death. Morin hydrate (MH), a natural bioactive flavonoid, has various pharmacological properties via orchestrating neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and necroptosis. Up to now, there is no extant data on the impact of MH on the necroptotic pathway in HD. This research aimed to scrutinize the effect of MH on neurodegeneration initiated by 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) administration in rats via modulating necroptosis and apoptosis signaling pathways and compare it with necrosulfonamide (NSA) as a necroptosis inhibitor. HD was triggered in male wistar rats by intraperitoneal injection of 3-NP (10 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. Intraperitoneal injection of MH (20 mg/kg/day, i.p.) or NSA (1.65 mg/kg/day, i.p.) an hour prior to 3-NP administration for 14 days. At the end of study, rats were weighed, and their locomotor activity was assessed via grip strength and open field tests. Striata of rats were investigated histologically and immunohistochemically by evaluation the expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Striatal tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), caspase 3, and 8 levels were quantified through the ELISA technique, while striatal expression of necroptosis-associated proteins; phosphorylated form of receptor interacting protein kinase 1/3(p-RIPK1, p-RIPK3) and phosphorylated form of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (p-MLKL) were assessed by the Western blot technique. Striatal succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity was assayed colorimetrically. Finally, gene enrichment analysis using ShinyGO was employed. MH and NSA significantly mitigated body weight loss and ameliorated locomotor deterioration, besides reversing histological abnormalities in the striatum of rats. Intriguingly, MH exerted similar effects on specific biomarkers and molecular signals as NSA. MH and NSA inhibited neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and necroptosis by significantly decreasing the striatal (TNF-α), caspase 3, and necroptosis-associated proteins (P-RIPK1, P-RIPK3, and P-MLKL) levels. Besides, MH and NSA also decreased striatal GFAP and increased SDH activity. Gene enrichment analysis revealed a significant interaction between genes. Together, MH exerts a neuroprotective action on 3-NP-elicited HD rats via reducing neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and necroptosis. This study highlights MH as a potential protection against HD, calling for further research to confirm its neuroprotective effects."

        "abstract": "Super-enhancers (SEs) play a key role in cell fate determination by regulating the transcription of cell-specific target genes and may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Targeted inhibition of the activity of SEs or knockout of SEs fragments may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. This article mainly outlines the discovery, structure, and identification methods of SEs; lists the current SE database platforms; summarizes the main regulatory mechanisms of SEs and strategies to acquire disease-specific SEs; and reviews recent research advances on SEs in neurodegenerative diseases.

        "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a challenging neurodegenerative disorder linked to Huntingtin (HTT) gene mutation, lacking an effective cure despite numerous therapeutic attempts. Cordyceps sinensis, recognized for its health benefits, particularly its constituent cordycepin, exhibits neuroprotective effects in various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the neuroprotective potential of cordycepin in HD remains insufficiently explored. In this study, in vitro experiments using HD cell models demonstrate that cordycepin treatment enhances cell survival, slightly diminishes mutant HTT aggregates, and improves neuronal formation. In vivo investigations on R6/2 HD transgenic mice reveal a modest increase in body weight and a slight amelioration in pathological aggregates following cordycepin administration, although behavioral changes are not significant. While the underlying mechanisms remain unexplored, the findings suggest cordycepin's promise as a supplementary therapeutic for HD, providing neuroprotective effects and reducing mutant protein aggregates."

        "title": "Newly generated striatal neurons rescue motor circuitry in a Huntington's disease mouse model.",
        "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss of neostriatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). We previously found that intraventricular delivery of viral vectors expressing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Noggin induced heterotopic recruitment of new MSNs to the adult neostriatum and slowed disease progression in the R6/2 mouse model of HD. Nonetheless, the extent to which newly generated neurons integrate into adult striatal circuits has remained unclear. Here, using wild-type (WT) and R6/2 mice, we follow the fate of genetically tagged new neurons recruited to the striatum after intraventricular infusion of BDNF and Noggin. Using rabies tract tracing, optogenetics, and calcium imaging, we find that new neurons functionally assimilate into the cortico-striato-pallidal motor circuitry, and chemogenetic stimulation of these new neurons confirms their contribution to motor behavior. Together, these data indicate that induced neurogenesis may restore multi-synaptic circuits in the adult brain, offering a regenerative strategy for the treatment of HD."

        "title": "The pharmacodynamics-based prophylactic benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors on neurodegenerative diseases: evidence from a network meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represent a new generation of antihyperglycemic agents that operate through mechanisms distinct from conventional diabetes treatments. Beyond their metabolic effects, these medications have demonstrated neuroprotective properties in preclinical studies. While clinical trials have explored their therapeutic potential in established neurodegenerative conditions, their role in disease prevention remains unclear. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to comprehensively evaluate the prophylactic benefits of these agents across multiple neurodegenerative diseases and identify the most promising preventive strategies. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, ClinicalKey, Cochrane CENTRAL, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov through October 24th, 2024, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors. Our primary outcome was the incidence of seven major neurodegenerative diseases: Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and Huntington's disease. Secondary outcomes included safety profiles assessed through dropout rates. We performed a frequentist-based NMA and evaluated risk of bias with Risk of Bias tool. The main result of the primary outcome in the current study would be re-affirmed via sensitivity test with Bayesian-based NMA. Our analysis encompassed 22 RCTs involving 138,282 participants (mean age 64.8 years, 36.4% female). Among all investigated medications, only dapagliflozin demonstrated significant prophylactic benefits, specifically in preventing Parkinson's disease (odds ratio = 0.28, 95% confidence intervals = 0.09 to 0.93) compared to controls. Neither GLP-1 receptor agonists nor other SGLT2 inhibitors showed significant preventive effects for any of the investigated neurodegenerative conditions. Drop-out rates were comparable across all treatments. This comprehensive NMA reveals a novel and specific prophylactic effect of dapagliflozin against Parkinson's disease, representing a potential breakthrough in preventive neurology. The specificity of dapagliflozin's protective effect to Parkinson's disease might rely on its highly selective inhibition to SGLT2. These findings provide important direction for future research and could inform preventive strategies for populations at risk of Parkinson's disease. PROSPERO CRD42021252381."

        "title": "Activating autophagy to eliminate toxic protein aggregates with small molecules in neurodegenerative diseases.",
        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia, are well known to pose formidable challenges for their treatment due to their intricate pathogenesis and substantial variability among patients, including differences in environmental exposures and genetic predispositions. One of the defining characteristics of NDs is widely reported to be the buildup of misfolded proteins. For example, Alzheimer disease is marked by amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylated Tau aggregates, whereas Parkinson disease exhibits α-synuclein aggregates. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia exhibit TAR DNA-binding protein 43, superoxide dismutase 1, and fused-in sarcoma protein aggregates, and Huntington disease involves mutant huntingtin and polyglutamine aggregates. These misfolded proteins are the key biomarkers of NDs and also serve as potential therapeutic targets, as they can be addressed through autophagy, a process that removes excess cellular inclusions to maintain homeostasis. Various forms of autophagy, including macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and microautophagy, hold a promise in eliminating toxic proteins implicated in NDs. In this review, we focus on elucidating the regulatory connections between autophagy and toxic proteins in NDs, summarizing the cause of the aggregates, exploring their impact on autophagy mechanisms, and discussing how autophagy can regulate toxic protein aggregation. Moreover, we underscore the activation of autophagy as a potential therapeutic strategy across different NDs and small molecules capable of activating autophagy pathways, such as rapamycin targeting the mTOR pathway to clear α-synuclein and Sertraline targeting the AMPK/mTOR/RPS6KB1 pathway to clear Tau, to further illustrate their potential in NDs' therapeutic intervention. Together, these findings would provide new insights into current research trends and propose small-molecule drugs targeting autophagy as promising potential strategies for the future ND therapies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This review provides an in-depth overview of the potential of activating autophagy to eliminate toxic protein aggregates in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. It also elucidates the fascinating interrelationships between toxic proteins and the process of autophagy of \"chasing and escaping\" phenomenon. Moreover, the review further discusses the progress utilizing small molecules to activate autophagy to improve the efficacy of therapies for neurodegenerative diseases by removing toxic protein aggregates."

        "abstract": "In polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, including Huntington disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), targeting the mutant CAG tract in mRNA could be a therapeutic strategy for lowering pathogenic protein. We explored the viability of this therapeutic strategy <i>in vivo</i> at the level of the reagent design, toxicity, systemic delivery, brain regions transduction, silencing efficiency, and allele preference. We designed a series of CAG-directed short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) based on a previous A2 reagent, allele selective <i>in vitro</i>. Humanized HD (Hu<sup>128Q/21Q</sup>) and SCA3 (Ki<sup>150Q/21Q</sup>) mice with mutant ∼100 CAGs and normal 21 CAGs alleles were used to simulate biallelic conditions occurring in patients. We administered AAV-PHP.eB shRNAs-encoding vectors into the blood as an equivalent of non-invasive CAG-directed brain-targeted therapy crossing the blood-brain barrier. We demonstrate that optimized CAG-targeted A4(P10) and A4(P10,11) shReagents can lower mutant huntingtin and ataxin-3 protein and its aggregates by targeting brain regions selectively and with diminished toxicity compared to other tested shRNAs. The important considerations of the approach are the silencing efficiency depending on the transduction region and careful dose adjustment. Moreover, the CAG approach could be suitable to target somatic expansion. Our work paves the way toward developing the therapy for polyQ diseases, potentially shortening drug development."

        "title": "Rare Diseases, Spotlighting Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Huntington's Disease, and Myasthenia Gravis: Insights from Landscape Analysis of Current Research.",
        "abstract": "Rare diseases are a diverse group of disorders that, despite each individual condition's rarity, collectively affect a significant portion of the global population. Currently approximately 10,000 rare diseases exist globally, with 80% of these diseases being identified as having genetic origins. In this Review, we examine data from the CAS Content Collection to summarize scientific progress in the area of rare diseases. We examine the publication landscape in the area in an effort to provide insights into current advances and developments. We then discuss the evolution of key concepts in the field, genetic associations, as well as the major technologies and development pipelines of rare disease treatments. We focus our attention on three specific rare diseases: (i) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a terminal neurodegenerative disease affecting the central nervous system resulting in progressive loss of motor neurons that control voluntary muscles; (ii) Huntington's disease, another terminal neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the brain, with a wide impact on a person's functional abilities; and (iii) myasthenia gravis, a chronic autoimmune synaptopathy leading to skeletal muscle weakness. While the pathogenesis of these rare diseases is being elucidated, there is neither a cure nor preventative treatment available, only symptomatic treatment. The objective of the paper is to provide a broad overview of the evolving landscape of current knowledge on rare diseases and specifically on the biology and genetics of the three spotlighted diseases, to outline challenges and evaluate growth opportunities, an aim to further efforts in solving the remaining challenges."
