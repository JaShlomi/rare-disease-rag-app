    "title": "Subtle changes in Purkinje cell firing in Purkinje cell-specific <i>Dyt1 ΔGAG</i> knock-in mice.",
    "abstract": "DYT1 dystonia is an inherited early-onset generalized dystonia characterized by sustained muscle contractions causing abnormal, repetitive movements or postures. Most DYT1 patients have a heterozygous trinucleotide GAG deletion (<i>ΔGAG</i>) in <i>DYT1/TOR1A</i>, coding for torsinA. <i>Dyt1</i> heterozygous ΔGAG knock-in (KI) mice or global KI mice show motor deficits and abnormal Purkinje cell firing. However, Purkinje cell-specific heterozygous ΔGAG conditional KI mice (Pcp2-KI) show improved motor performance, reduced sensory-evoked brain activation in the striatum and midbrain, and reduced functional connectivity of the striatum with the anterior medulla. Whether Pcp2-KI mice show similar abnormal Purkinje cell firing as the global KI mice, suggesting a cell-autonomous effect causes the abnormal Purkinje cell firing in the global KI mice, is unknown. We used acute cerebellar slice recording in Pcp2-KI mice to address this issue. The Pcp2-KI mice exhibited no changes in spontaneous firing and intrinsic excitability compared to the control mice. While membrane properties were largely unchanged, the resting membrane potential was slightly hyperpolarized, which was associated with decreased baseline excitability. Our results suggest that the abnormal Purkinje cell firing in the global KI mice was not cell-autonomous and was caused by physiological changes elsewhere in the brain circuits. Our results also contribute to the ongoing research of how basal ganglia and cerebellum interact to influence motor control in normal states and movement disorders."

    "title": "Sex-specific alterations of Purkinje cell firing in <i>Sgce</i> knockout mice and correlations with myoclonus.",
    "abstract": "Myoclonus is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by sudden, brief, involuntary jerks of single or multiple muscles. Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements, postures, or both. Myoclonus-dystonia (M-D) or DYT11 dystonia is an early-onset genetic disorder characterized by subcortical myoclonus and less pronounced dystonia. DYT11 dystonia is the primary genetic M-D caused by loss of function mutations in <i>SGCE</i>, which codes for ε-sarcoglycan. <i>Sgce</i> knockout (KO) mice model DYT11 dystonia and exhibit myoclonus, motor deficits, and psychiatric-like behaviors. Neuroimaging studies show abnormal cerebellar activity in DYT11 dystonia patients. Acute small hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of <i>Sgce</i> mRNA in the adult cerebellum leads to motor deficits, myoclonic-like jerky movements, and altered Purkinje cell firing. Whether <i>Sgce</i> KO mice show similar abnormal Purkinje cell firing as the acute shRNA knockdown mice is unknown. We used acute cerebellar slice recording in <i>Sgce</i> KO mice to address this issue. The Purkinje cells from <i>Sgce</i> KO mice showed spontaneous and intrinsic excitability changes compared to the wild-type (WT) mice. Intrinsic membrane properties were not altered. The female <i>Sgce</i> KO mice had more profound alterations in Purkinje cell firing than males, which may correspond to the early onset of the symptoms in female human patients and more pronounced myoclonus in female KO mice. Our results suggest that the abnormal Purkinje cell firing in the <i>Sgce</i> KO mice contributes to the manifestation of the myoclonus and other motor symptoms in DYT11 dystonia patients."

    "abstract": "This case report stresses the importance of exercising caution when translating the names of prescribed drugs, especially when treating patients from abroad. We describe a young female migrant from Ukraine seeking help in the Danish mental healthcare system due to worsening psychotic symptoms. The misinterpretation of the sound-alike drugs Azapin (clozapine) and asenapine caused an acute dystonic reaction. This case illustrates various pitfalls regarding medication error. First, it uncovers a medication error due to a sound-alike drug and emphasises the importance of paying attention to national guidelines since first-line treatment can differ between countries. These factors combined increase the risk of medication error with potentially fatal consequences."

    "abstract": "Dystonia, a challenging movement disorder, poses significant therapeutic challenges due to its resistance to treatment, resulting in both physical impairment and substantial mental distress, ultimately impacting overall quality of life. Cerebral palsy (CP) is a major non-genetic cause of secondary dystonia, characterized by diverse clinical presentations. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a therapeutic intervention for individuals with dystonic CP. We conducted a systematic analysis of studies assessing the safety and effectiveness of DBS, with a focus on its long-term outcomes [PROSPERO (Unique identifier: CRD42023399285)]. We examined factors that influence treatment response and proposed strategies to enhance patient quality of life. DBS, especially when targeting the basal ganglia or innovative targets, shows promise as a therapeutic approach for dystonic CP. While existing controlled studies confirm its safety and effectiveness, a thorough evaluation of long-term efficacy remains crucial. This research highlights the potential of DBS in improving the lives of individuals with dystonic CP, providing hope for further refinement, innovation, and broader clinical application of this therapeutic approach."

    "abstract": "Tremor phase-locked deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been shown to modulate symptom severity in postural tremor, including essential and dystonic tremor, with less energy than existing systems. Previous studies focused on unilateral stimulation; it remains unknown how tremor asymmetry interacts with stimulation in the context of bilateral phase-locked DBS. Archival limb acceleration from nine essential tremor patients was analyzed for asymmetries in tremor amplitude, frequency, and instability, and their relationship with continuous high-frequency DBS (cDBS). Bilateral phase-locked DBS was tested in one essential tremor and one dystonic tremor patient. Postural tremor is asymmetric, with larger tremor power linked to smaller amplitude and frequency stability in one hand. These asymmetries were significantly reduced during cDBS, with greater effects on larger amplitude tremors. Bilateral phasic DBS effects were also asymmetric. This study enhances understanding of tremor asymmetry and its relationship with DBS, offering insights for patient-specific tremor treatments. © 2025 The Author(s).

    "title": "Dynamic electro-clinical features in Guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase deficiency: A familial case series.",
    "abstract": "Guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase deficiency is an inborn error of creatine metabolism, responsible for the absent conversion of guanidinoacetic acid into creatine, resulting in cerebral creatine deficit. It could present a variety of symptoms such as neurodevelopmental delay, epilepsy, movement disorder (ataxia, dystonia, and chorea), and behavioral disturbances. After intellectual disability, epilepsy is the second most frequent expression of the disorder, usually arising during infancy with febrile seizures that are typically followed by generalized seizures and electroencephalographic anomalies. Herein, we describe three siblings with the same homozygous truncating variant in GAMT, all of whom showed significant global developmental delay during early infancy. The eldest two developed initially neglected atypical absences, preceded by focal motor seizures in the older brother, with complete remission with antiseizure medications and dietary treatment. Despite seizure freedom, during follow-up, both developed overt focal epileptiform discharges that have persisted after 2 years of creatine supplementation. Neither seizures nor electroencephalographic abnormalities were noted in the youngest brother who took advantage of an earlier diagnosis and treatment. The dynamic electroclinical pattern we observed has never been reported beforehand. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term prognosis of epilepsy in patients who have introduced dietary treatment after the seizure onset. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: GAMT deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that prevents the brain from getting enough creatine, leading to developmental delay, seizures, movement disorders, and behavior problems. This condition often starts in infancy with seizures in fever and can be partially limited by creatine supplementation. In this paper, we present three siblings with the same mutation. The older two had seizures that improved with treatment, but their brain activity remained abnormal. The youngest, diagnosed and treated earlier with supplementation, did not develop epilepsy. More research is needed to understand electro-clinical features of this condition and the long-term effects of early or late dietary treatment."

    "title": "Spontaneous remission of dropped head syndrome following short-term bed rest in acute encephalopathy: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Dropped head syndrome is commonly observed in neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies. Its underlying causes include neck extensor myopathy and cervical dystonia. However, spontaneous remission of dropped head syndrome is extremely rare. A 70-year-old woman initially presented with a dropped head. One year after her first visit, she developed gait disturbance, bilateral hand bradykinesia, and rigidity of the trunk and all four limbs. Levodopa had a limited effect on both the dropped head and parkinsonism, and was eventually discontinued due to visual hallucinations. Two years and three months after the initial visit, her Mini-Mental State Examination score declined to 22/30, and she was ultimately diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies. Three years and two months after the initial visit, she experienced decreased consciousness due to acute encephalopathy associated with cellulitis. After 10 days of bed rest, her consciousness normalized, and she gradually resumed sitting and standing. Remarkably, the dropped head, previously present even before the encephalopathy, was no longer observed in either posture. The remission of dropped head syndrome persisted for over a year. Sustained supine positioning for 10 days may have induced prolonged relaxation of the anterior cervical muscles, functioning as a form of \"prolonged sensory trick,\" thereby modulating the sensorimotor cortex and contributing to the remission of dystonic anterocollis. Furthermore, the restoration of neck extensor muscle strength may have followed the resolution of dystonic anterocollis. This case may offer insight into the mechanisms underlying spontaneous remission in dropped head syndrome."

The efficacy of BoNT-A was assessed through changes in the scores on the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) before and 4 to 6 weeks after the treatment. The differences in the absolute and relative changes in the total TWSTRS scores and in its components (severity, incapacity, and pain) between the groups were evaluated.The US and EMG groups were well balanced in relation to baseline and demographic characteristics. After the BoNT-A treatment, there was a mean reduction in the TWSTRS score of 8 points (relative reduction of 23%) equally between the US and EMG groups (mean difference in absolute decrease of 0.1 point; <i>p</i> = 0.97; and mean difference in relative decrease of 2%; <i>p</i> = 0.89). There were no differences in the declines in the scores on the TWSTRS components, nor when the improvements in the TWSTRS scores were dichotomized as more significant or lower reductions (all <i>p</i>-values > 0.3).The present randomized trial did not demonstrate any difference in improvements between BoNT-A treatment guided by US or EMG in patients with idiopathic cervical dystonia.ReBEC Identifier: RBR-33dd4p4."

    "abstract": "Retrotransposon activation is emerging as a significant factor in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVAs) are hominid-specific retrotransposons that create genetic variation through insertion polymorphisms and variable short tandem repeat (STR) lengths. We investigate how the SVA (CCCTCT)<sub>n</sub> STR contributes to the striatal neurodegenerative disorder X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP), where the repeat expansion length within the pathogenic SVA is inversely correlated with age at disease onset. Phenotypic and transcriptomic analysis of XDP and isogenic SVA-deleted striatal organoids reveal that the SVA insertion drives hallmarks of neurodegeneration, including transcriptional dysregulation, decreased neuronal activity, and apoptosis, which are ameliorated by SVA deletion. We identify an (AGAGGG)<sub>n</sub> hexamer-containing RNA in the XDP-causing SVA that increases expression during organoid maturation and drives R-loop formation in organoids and brain tissue. Knockdown of the hexamer-containing RNA by antisense oligonucleotides rescues apoptosis in XDP organoids. We demonstrate that a retrotransposon-derived tandem repeat RNA may cause neurodegeneration."

    "abstract": "The development of idiopathic adult-onset dystonia (IAOD) in different body parts is associated with specific demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as with specific risk factors. To investigate whether specific occupations are associated with specific forms of IAOD at onset, namely blepharospasm (BSP), cervical dystonia (CD), and task-specific upper limb dystonia (TS-ULD). Data from 905 IAOD patients enrolled in the Italian Dystonia Registry were analysed. Each patient was assigned to the corresponding occupational category by specialists in occupational medicine according to the classification of the Italian National Institute of Statistics. Logistic regression models (adjusted for sex, year of birth, Italian geographical areas, and age at dystonia onset) were computed to assess the association between occupation and specific dystonia at onset, using patients who developed focal dystonia in other body parts as controls. Compared to other occupations, trades workers exhibited an increased risk for BSP at onset (OR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.6-4.2), cleaners for CD (OR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.2-9.9), and musicians for TS-ULD (OR = 36.3, 95% CI 11.3-117.1). The longer the duration of employment before the onset of dystonia, the greater the risk of dystonia. We provided novel information indicating that exposure to specific occupations may trigger specific forms of IAOD, namely BSP, CD, and TS-ULD. The associations highlighted by this study may reflect a common pathophysiological mechanism relying on the frequent performance of repetitive movements in a specific body part."

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) technology has become increasingly advanced, and tools capable of optimizing programming are necessary. Three-dimensional (3D) electrode imaging reconstruction has the potential to assist clinicians in selecting the most effective DBS contacts. In this study, we evaluated the predictive capacity of two different methods (Matlab software [Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA] and Brainlab software [Brainlab, Munich, Germany]) in identifying effective DBS contacts, compared with clinical examination (the standard of care). The study also analyzes whether one method is superior. Overall, 29 patients were included: 27 with Parkinson's disease (PD) and two with dystonia (DT). Therefore, images of the 58 brain hemispheres were obtained. Of these, 56 had directional leads, and two had leads with eight-ring contacts. Electrode reconstruction was performed using Matlab software and Brainlab software. The anatomic relationship between the electrodes and the targets (subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus internus) was analyzed. Contacts within the sweet spot of the target were chosen through 3D reconstruction visualization. In addition, if the best contact levels were directional, the best located directional contacts were chosen (this was possible in 40 leads). The best contact was defined as that with the highest motor symptoms improvement rate based on clinical examination (standard of care). The mean age of the patients was 56 years; 24 patients underwent surgery within ≤one year from the surgery, and the maximum time from surgery was three years. The difference in contact-level suggestion was only one hemisphere, with Matlab software correctly suggesting the best clinical contact in 83% (48/58) and Brainlab software in 84% (49/58). The suggestion capacity of the directional contacts was 80% for both methods. Furthermore, there was a 94.8% concordance rate between the two methods (55/58) on choosing the best contacts on the basis of image reconstruction. Matlab software and Brainlab software are effective image reconstruction methods for accurately suggesting the best contact on the basis of clinical examination."

    "abstract": "The objective was to evaluate the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in an international cohort of patients with VPS16-related dystonia. This observational study collected preoperative and postoperative demographic, clinical, stimulation, genetic, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological data of medically refractory DYT-VPS16 patients with implanted DBS in 10 international centers. Motor symptoms and disability outcomes were assessed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale Motor (BFMDRS-M) and Disability (BFMDRS-D) scales. A cut-off threshold for considering response to DBS was set at 25% of BFMDRS-M improvement at the last follow-up (FU) compared to baseline. The cohort consisted of 26 participants (17 men, 65.4%). Age at dystonia onset and surgery was 17.8 ± 10.9 and 35.3 ± 14.8 years, respectively. At the last FU, 102.5 ± 57.3 months (range, 2-216), the mean BFMDRS-M improvement was 41.6 ± 37.3% (26/26 patients) and 34.8 ± 42.6% for the BFMDRS-D (23/26 patients). Most patients (19/26, 73%) were considered responders. Higher motor improvement was associated with stimulation of the ventroposterior portion of the internal globus pallidus. A significant inverse relationship was observed between improvement in BFMDRS-M at last FU, and the presence of spasticity (p = 0.027) and fixed skeletal deformities (p = 0.001) before surgery. Non-responders had a younger age at disease onset and at implantation, shorter disease duration at DBS surgery, and higher baseline BFMDRS scores. DBS was an effective treatment for three-quarters of patients with pathogenic VPS16 variants in our cohort. Mean motor improvement was most pronounced at the 1-year FU, but persisted at the last FU despite disease progression. ANN NEUROL 2025."

    "abstract": "Bilateral globus pallidus pars interna deep brain stimulation (GPi-DBS) is a recognized and effective treatment option for drug-resistant dystonia patients. However, the clinical GPi-DBS outcomes vary significantly. Herein, we explored the pre-implant factors affecting GPi-DBS effectiveness. Genetic profiles, symptom distribution, age at onset, disease duration, and severity of a cohort of 31 GPi-DBS dystonia patients were collected. Dystonia motor severity was evaluated before and after GPi-DBS using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia-Rating-Scale (BFMDRS-M). We assessed the interplay of the aforementioned factors in determining the BFMDRS-M improvement through a multilinear regression analysis. BFMDRS-M score showed a significant improvement (47.8%) since the first year, remaining stable at 5 years (54.3%). Lower limb (0.20), upper limb (0.16) and trunk (0.24) symptoms showed a significantly larger improvement compared to cranial symptoms (0.07, p < 0.05). Consequently, patients with more pronounced lower limb motor symptoms displayed a greater GPi-DBS effect (p < 0.01). However, pre-treatment localization of motor symptoms accounted only for 31% of the Inter-Patient Variability (IPV) in post-GPi-DBS improvement. Amelioration varied also across genetic profiles, with the largest improvement reported for DYT-TOR1A patients (n = 9, 64.2% in the first year), predicting 36% of IPV. Interestingly, combining motor and genetic profiles predicted 73% of the IPV. Including the clinical profile of the patient (age at onset, disease severity and duration) increased prediction accuracy to 81%. Our results suggest that motor and genetic profiles contribute independently to the efficacy of the GPi-DBS treatment. These results may support a personalized prediction of DBS outcomes in dystonia patients."

    "abstract": "Movement disorders such as cerebral palsy (CP) are frequently associated with joint and muscle stiffness, often evaluated using subjective clinical methods like the Modified Ashworth Scale or Tardieu Scale. These approaches lack precision and reproducibility, particularly in preclinical models, limiting their utility in translational research. This study presents the development of a low-cost, open-source torquemeter device tailored for use in a neonatal rabbit model of CP. The device is designed to quantify joint stiffness objectively by measuring torque across a range of controlled joint rotation speeds, a key factor in evaluating hypertonia associated with spasticity and dystonia. The construction process is straightforward, with all components being either commercially available or 3D-printable and requiring only basic assembly tools. The torquemeter demonstrated precise, reproducible measurements of torque and joint stiffness in pilot studies, validating its applicability in preclinical settings. By eliminating subjective biases, the device provides robust data to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions targeting spasticity. This low-cost torquemeter offers an accessible, reliable tool for preclinical movement disorder research. Its ability to quantify limb stiffness with high precision enhances the evaluation of treatment strategies in CP models, paving the way for improved therapeutic development and outcomes."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative changes are key manifestations of Wilson disease (WD), causing neurological symptoms including parkinsonism, tremors, and dystonia. However, the neuroimaging correlates of specific neurological manifestations (especially dystonia) in WD remain poorly characterized. 37 WD patients and 37 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. All subjects underwent structural magnetic resonance scanning, muscle biomechanical measurements, and the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale for Neurology (UWDRS-N) assessment. Neurodegenerative changes, identified as gray matter volume (GV) changes, were analyzed via voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in WD compared to HC. Clinical symptoms were linked to GV changes in WD patients' brains. Compared with HC, WD patients had GV loss in the bilateral caudate nucleus, putamen, cerebellum (Crus1), left amygdala, right posterior insular lobe, and right parahippocampal gyrus and increased GV in the bilateral anterior insular lobes. In cortical areas, UWDRS-N significantly negatively correlated with GV in the bilateral posterior insula lobes, part of temporal lobe, optic cortex, frontal lobe, and cingulate cortex, while positively correlated with that in bilateral anterior insular lobes and putamen. Moreover, the GV from the left parahippocampal gyrus, bilateral hippocampus, and bilateral caudate nucleus showed a strong positive correlation with the <i>F</i> value of the right gastrocnemius medial head. In WD patients with neurological symptoms, obvious abnormal GV values in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit were noted. These GV changes were linked to UWDRS-N and correlated with muscle tension. The study mapped UWDRS-N and muscle biomechanics in GV-impaired areas, suggesting altered GV (especially in basal ganglia) as a key imaging sign of WD severity. This indicates that the CSTC circuit could act as a biomarker for WD neurological symptoms and affect WD dystonia mechanisms. Additionally, it shows that muscle-related biological parameters can assess WD dystonia severity and neurological damage. clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT05305872."

    "abstract": "Movement disorders associated with malaria are often underrecognized. This review aimed to systematically assess their types, onset patterns, and clinical outcomes. We systematically searched major databases for case reports, case series, and cohort studies describing movement disorders in malaria patients. Data were extracted on demographics, Plasmodium species, clinical presentation, imaging, treatment, and outcomes. PRISMA guidelines were followed throughout. A total of 86 individual cases were identified from 72 case reports/series, along with 12 cohort studies were also reviewed. Among individual cases, Plasmodium falciparum was implicated in 75%, and P. vivax in 20%. Cerebellar ataxia was the most common movement disorder, reported in 52% of cases, often appearing 7-21 days after fever resolution. Tremor (16%), dystonia (9%), and chorea (7%) were also documented. Extrapyramidal symptoms, including acute dystonia and rigidity, were observed in 43 children and adolescents treated with artesunate-amodiaquine, with a median onset of 2 days post-treatment. Neuroimaging was normal in 68% of cases, while Cerebrospinal fluid findings were nonspecific. Most patients recovered completely within 1-4 months; however, 4 cases required prolonged rehabilitation. Twelve cohort studies linked malaria, especially Plasmodium falciparum, to movement disorders like cerebellar ataxia. Most cases were immune-mediated with full recovery. Extrapyramidal effects and posturing also occurred, highlighting the importance of drug monitoring. Movement disorders in malaria are rare but clinically significant. They may occur during acute illness or weeks later, often linked to Plasmodium falciparum or antimalarial drugs. Early identification and supportive care usually lead to favorable outcomes."

Appropriate diagnosis is critical to proper management. A broad range of movement disorder phenomenologies occur among patients with genetic epilepsy, including dystonia, chorea, ataxia, myoclonus, stereotypy, tics, and Parkinsonism. For some genes, clear relationships exist between genotype and movement disorder phenotype, while in other situations, the relationship is more complex. Diagnosis of movement disorders involves elements of history, physical examination, video review, and neurophysiology. Assessment of associated impairment, distress, and/or safety concerns is important for considering risks/benefits of treatment. Movement disorders may range from severe and dangerous, requiring pharmacologic or neuromodulatory treatments such as deep brain stimulation, to relatively benign, with only reassurance and continued observation required. Appropriate treatments differ based on phenomenology and etiology, with some genes associated with tailored treatments which can provide dramatic benefit."

    "abstract": "Dystonia is one of the most prevalent movement disorders, characterized by significant clinical and etiological heterogeneity. Despite considerable heritability (~25%), the etiology in most patients remains elusive. Moreover, understanding correlations between clinical manifestations and genetic variants has become increasingly complex. Exome sequencing was conducted on 1924 genetically unsolved, mainly late-onset isolated dystonia patients, recruited primarily from two dystonia registries (DysTract and the Dystonia Coalition). Rare variants in genes previously linked to dystonia (n = 406) were examined, confirmed via Sanger sequencing, and analyzed for segregation when possible. We identified 137 distinct likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants (according to ACMG criteria) across 51 genes in 163/1924 patients, including 153/1895 index patients (diagnostic yield 8.1%). The strongest predictors of a genetic diagnosis were generalized dystonia (28.6% yield) and age at onset (20.4% yield in patients with onset < 30 years). Notably, 56.2% of these variants were novel, with recurrent variants in EIF2AK2, VPS16, KCNMA1, and SLC2A1. Additionally, 321 index patients (16.9%) harbored variants of uncertain significance in 102 genes. The most frequently implicated genes included VPS16, THAP1, GCH1, SGCE, GNAL, and KMT2B. Presumably pathogenic variants in less well-established dystonia genes were also found, including KCNMA1, KIF1A, and ZMYND11. At least six variants (in ADCY5, GNB1, IR2BPL, KCNN2, KMT2B, and VPS16) occurred de novo, supporting pathogenicity. This study provides valuable insights into the genetic landscape of dystonia, underscores the utility of exome sequencing for diagnosis, substantiates several candidate genes, and expands the phenotypic spectrum of some genes to include prominent, sometimes isolated dystonia."

Various approaches have been taken to guide injection into the selected muscle, gland, organ or other body area. Guidance methodologies that can be used in the office setting for skeletal muscle and salivary gland percutaneous injection include uninstrumented manual needle placement, electromyography (EMG), electromyography with electrical stimulation (e-stim), ultrasound (US) and combined guidance (US + EMG or US + e-stim). This article reviews the advantages, disadvantages, and accuracy of each method and the impact of each guidance technique on therapeutic outcome for muscle and salivary gland injections. Overall, manual placement may suffice for large and superficial muscles, however, all instrumented techniques improve accuracy. Electromyography can uniquely provide information on muscle activity, while e-stim can aid injection in patients who cannot voluntarily activate a selected muscle. Ultrasound is the only technique that can visualize internal structures, allowing identification of a safe trajectory for injection of small or deep targets that might otherwise be inaccessible."

    "title": "Mapping dysphagia in pediatric dystonia.",
    "abstract": "Dystonia is a significant movement disorder in childhood, yet swallowing functions in this population remain largely unexplored. Dysphagia, however, can result in severe complications, including aspiration, underscoring the critical need for research in this area. This study, therefore, aimed to evaluate dysphagia in children with dystonia. Children diagnosed with dystonia as the predominant movement disorder were included. Medical histories were recorded, and Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) levels were determined. Oral structure characteristics were assessed, and chewing performance was evaluated using the Turkish version of Mastication Observation and Evaluation (T-MOE) and the Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale (KCPS). Swallowing safety was screened with the Pediatric Eating Assessment Tool-10 (PEDI-EAT-10) and the 3-ounce Water Swallow Test. The Dysphagia Disorders Survey (DDS) was used to assess swallowing disorder severity, while the Dysphagia Management Staging Scale (DMSS) was applied to determine the severity level of dysphagia. Twenty-five children (mean age: 11.32 ± 3.95 years) participated in the study. Of these 56% were classified as level V according to the GMFCS. Three children (12%) had a FOIS level of 4 or below. The mean T-MOE score was 15.62 ± 7.51, and 60% of the children could bite but could not chew effectively according to the KCPS. Oropharyngeal dysphagia was present in all children, with abnormal swallowing (PEDI-EAT-10 score ≥4) and increased aspiration risk (PEDI-EAT-10 score ≥13) observed in 100% and 88% of the participants, respectively. Additionally, 52.0% of the children failed the 3-ounce Water Swallow Test. The mean DDS raw score was 23.08 ± 7.70, and 68% of the children were classified as having severe or profound dysphagia based on the DMSS. Swallowing dysfunction was observed in almost all children with dystonia, with the majority presenting with severe dysphagia and an elevated risk of aspiration. Close monitoring of oral structures and functions, along with continuous evaluation of swallowing performance, is crucial to ensure safe oral feeding and to mitigate life-threatening complications in this population."

    "title": "Dissecting the Phenotypic Spectrum and Complexity of Movement Disorders in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Movement disorders are increasingly recognized as late-occurring neurologic manifestations of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS). We aimed to dissect the spectrum of relevant movement disorders in 22q11.2DS, including clinical and electrophysiologic presentations and effective therapies. Retrospective review of medical records, medication histories, and videotaped examinations was conducted in 31 unrelated adults (55% female) diagnosed with 22q11.2DS and a movement disorder who were seen at a major center of excellence from June 1996 to September 2023. Between-group comparisons were performed to explore the influence of medications on movement disorder presentations. The median age at movement disorder onset was 35.5 (IQR: 22.0) years. Non-parkinsonian tremor was the most common phenotype (21/31, 68%), followed by parkinsonism (13/31, 42%), dystonia (11/31, 36%), myoclonus (9/31, 29%), dyskinesia (6/31, 19%), stereotypies, and functional movement disorders (4/31, 13% each). The majority of patients (24/31, 77%) presented with two or more movement disorder phenotypes (median 3, range: 2-7). Similar trends in prevalence emerged after accounting for antipsychotic exposure and potential drug-related movement disorders. Electrophysiological assessments identified both previously described and novel motor phenotypes. Treatment data for at least one movement disorder (available for 20/31, 65%) indicated a positive response to standard phenotype-based interventions. We demonstrate that movement disorders in adults with 22q11.2DS exhibit greater clinical complexity than previously reported, which could reflect innate vulnerability and pathologic mechanisms beyond medication side effects. In those with a confirmed 22q11.2 microdeletion, periodic neurologic evaluations, supported by electrophysiologic investigations, enable accurate diagnosis and implementation of personalized management strategies."

    "abstract": "Non-ketotic hyperglycemic hemichorea-hemiballismus (NHH) is a rare but reversible movement disorder associated with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. It is characterized by involuntary, non-suppressible choreiform, ballistic movements or several other involuntary movements (dystonia, tremors, etc), contralateral striatal hyperintensity on MRI, and hyperglycemia without ketosis. The exact pathophysiology remains unclear, but prompt glycemic control is essential for symptom resolution. We report the case of a 41-year-old man with no prior history of diabetes who presented with an acute onset of hemichorea affecting the left upper and lower limbs. Laboratory findings revealed hyperglycemia (18 mmol/L) with an elevated HbA1c (>12%), while brain MRI demonstrated characteristic T1 hyperintensity in the right basal ganglia. The patient was started on insulin therapy and oral antihyperglycemic agents, along with neuroleptics for symptomatic relief. By the third day of treatment, his movements began to improve. This case underscores the importance of recognizing NHH in patients with new-onset movement disorders, emphasizing the role of neuroimaging and early glycemic management for favorable outcomes."

A systematic literature retrieval was performed across several databases until April 13, 2024, using keywords like scraping therapy, hemiplegia, and stroke. Studies were screened based on specific criteria, with quality assessed using the Cochrane \"risk of bias\" tool. Eight outcomes were meta-analyzed: efficiency, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, activity of daily living, Barthel Index, NIH Stroke Scale, WHO Quality of Life, Visual Analogue Scale, and dystonia grade 3 to 4. Subgroup analyses were based on age and therapeutic type. Twenty-three studies with 1905 patients were included, with 952 receiving scraping therapy and 953 receiving routine nursing and rehabilitation. Patients treated with scraping showed better therapeutic efficiency than the control group with statistical significance (odds ratio: 5.30, 95% confidence interval: [2.66, 10.56], P < .05). In addition, statistically significant differences were also observed in Barthel Index, NIH Stroke Scale, Visual Analogue Scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life, and activity of daily living assessments between the 2 groups. Scraping therapy improves therapeutic efficiency and quality of life in hemiplegia patients after stroke, highlighting its positive significance for hemiplegia rehabilitation."

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are mediators of intercellular communication through the transfer of nucleic acids, lipids and proteins between cells. This property makes bioengineered EVs promising therapeutic vectors. However, it remains challenging to isolate EVs with a therapeutic payload due to the heterogeneous nature of cargo loading into EVs. In this study, enrichment of EVs with a desired cargo was possible through engineering of the hallmark CD63 transmembrane protein. E-NoMi refers to engineered CD63 with mCherry on the inside of the EV membrane and a tag (3xFLAG) exposed on the outside of the EV membrane. To facilitate EV loading during biogenesis, cargo proteins, such as EGFP, Cre recombinase and the CRISPR-Cas nuclease (SaCas9), were fused to a nanobody (Nb) protein with a high affinity for mCherry. FLAG-tag-based immunocapture from cell conditioned media allowed selection of cargo-loaded E-NoMi-EVs, and tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage sites were used to remove the 3xFLAG-tag from the surface of E-NoMi-EVs after capture. For functional payload delivery to recipient cells, the vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) fusogenic protein was incorporated into E-NoMi-EVs to form fusogenic EV-based vectors (EVVs) and proved to be 10-fold more effective at cargo delivery than EVs generated by size-exclusion chromatography. Functional delivery of cargo with E-NoMi-EVVs was validated in two mouse brain models in vivo."

    "abstract": "To analyze studies employing multiple-target deep brain stimulation (DBS) for non-parkinsonian movement disorders and identify potential indications, therapeutic outcomes, and associated side effects. We systematically screened PubMed and included studies involving patients treated with DBS targeting at least two brain regions, synchronous stimulation of ≥2 regions, patient data regarding symptoms/disease, and reported outcomes. Exclusion criteria included animal studies and reports lacking original data. Twenty-seven studies were identified, included and analyzed; general trends were noted for each disorder. For essential tremor multi-target DBS (VIM+VOA/VOP) demonstrated promising outcomes regarding symptom improvement and reduction of side-effects. For multiple Sclerosis Tremor limited evidence suggested positive outcomes, comparable to standard DBS. The VIM/VOP border has been highlighted as a promising target. Regarding holmes Tremor although limited to case reports, multi-target DBS yielded favorable outcomes with minimal adverse effects. Finaly for dystonia multi-target DBS (GPi+VIM, GPi+VO) effectively addressed tremor and dystonic features. Statistically significant advantages were demonstrated over single-target stimulation in myoclonus-dystonia and hemidystonia. While variability in target selection, methodologies, and outcomes precludes a meta-analysis, evidence supports the potential role of multi-target DBS in cases where single-target stimulation is inadequate. Promising target combinations, such as GPi+VIM (myoclonus-dystonia) and VIM+VOA (essential tremor), warrant further clinical exploration. The heterogeneity and predominance of case reports highlight the need for high-quality, controlled studies to refine indications and optimize strategies for multi-target DBS."

    "abstract": "Progressive supranuclear paralysis (PSP) is an atypical parkinsonian disorder associated with oculomotor features, motor disturbances, along with cognitive problems and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Quality of life (QoL) is often assessed in relation to the motor symptoms. Our aim was to investigate the impact of neuropsychiatric symptoms on QoL. We used data from 40 patients meeting criteria for probable PSP from the Rossy PSP Centre. Motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognition, functionality, disease severity, and quality of life were examined using validated scales. We performed a linear regression model using multiple imputations with chained equations with 500 sets. We found that lower quality of life scores were related to higher anxiety and depression and the interaction between these two. There was a decrease in the quality of life of -3.7 points (95% CI: -6.1 to -1.1) for every one point of increase on the depression scale; there was a decrease in the quality of life scale of -4.3 points for each point of increase on the depression score (95% CI: -7.8 to -0.8). The fully adjusted linear model showed that motor scores, cognition, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms were not associated with quality of life. We found that both anxiety and depression significantly impacted quality of life. Given the prevalence of non-motor manifestations in PSP, these results emphasize the importance of comprehensive evaluations to better capture the multi-faceted impairments seen in PSP that have a meaningful impact on the patient's life."

    "abstract": "MED27 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, a highly conserved protein assembly that initiates transcription by bridging transcription factors bound at enhancers to RNA polymerase II transcription machinery at promoters. Recently, we identified an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) caused by loss-of-function (LoF) variants in the MED27 gene. Affected individuals exhibit global developmental delay, intellectual disability, dystonia, and cerebellar atrophy, highlighting the neuronal system's vulnerability to MED27 disruptions. To investigate the pathogenicity mechanisms and essential roles of this gene during neurodevelopment, we generated multiple zebrafish lines with LoF mutations in med27. Homozygous mutant zebrafish displayed severe developmental defects, motor deficits, and cerebellar atrophy, recapitulating the clinical phenotypes observed in MED27-NDD patients. Rescue experiments revealed that patient-specific mutant MED27 mRNA failed to restore normal phenotypes in mutant zebrafish, unlike wildtype MED27 mRNA, underscoring the clinical relevance of our models. Molecular analysis identified transcription factors foxo3a and fosab as direct downstream targets of med27. These genes are well-established master regulators in the central nervous system, providing mechanistic insights into how med27 disruption impairs neuronal and cerebellar development. Our findings establish med27 as a critical gene of embryogenesis and neurogenesis, shedding light on the disease mechanism underlying MED27-associated NDDs."

To study the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of lesion-induced blepharospasm. Patients with blepharospasm with uncertain etiology prior to brain imaging were systematically searched from the electronic medical records of Turku University Hospital (1996-2022). Clinical information and imaging data were extracted from the patients' records and re-evaluated by the investigators. Etiology of blepharospasm was evaluated by an in-depth review of the clinical information in the context of available literature on lesion-induced dystonias. The prevalence and annual incidence of blepharospasm were calculated based on the annual population count in the area. The search identified 57 patients, of whom four (7.0%) were considered to have lesion-induced blepharospasm, corresponding to a population-based prevalence of 2.5 per million and annual incidence of 0.3 per million. All patients with lesion-induced blepharospasm had atypical features, which were all significantly more common than in patients with idiopathic blepharospasm (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Lesion-induced blepharospasm is more common than thought previously. However, all these patients showed atypical features, suggesting that brain imaging in blepharospasm can be limited to patients with atypical features only. This study investigated the epidemiology of lesion-induced blepharospasm by systematically re-evaluating all patients with blepharospasm with uncertain etiology prior to structural brain imaging from a university hospital (1996-2022).Our results show that lesion-induced blepharospasm is more common that thought previously (7.0% of included patients, prevalence 2.5 per million, annual incidence 0.3 per million).All patients with lesion-induced blepharospasm showed clinical features that were considered atypical for idiopathic blepharospasm, indicating that routine brain imaging is not needed in patients with typical symptoms."

    "abstract": "CNTNAP1 encodes a contactin-associated protein 1, which is essential for formation and organization of myelinated nerve fibers. Biallelic pathogenic variants in CNTNAP1 cause a severe congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy, characterized by hypotonia, arthrogryposis, respiratory failure, and early lethality. We describe two brothers, seven and 13 years old, with spastic tetraparesis and limb dystonia, in whom we identified compound heterozygous variants in CNTNAP1. Comprehensive neurophysiological evaluation revealed an unusual, asymmetric pattern of hypomyelination that spared lower limb nerves. Moreover, brain neuroimaging showed only mild terminal zone hypomyelination. This report extends the phenotypic spectrum of CNTNAP1 encephalopathy to primarily upper motor neuron disease with the predominant spastic features. In addition, it provides further evidence for the association of CNTNAP1 with dystonia. Importantly, CNTNAP1 mutations should be suspected in individuals with unexplained hypotonia and pyramidal syndrome even in the absence of apparent hypomyelination on brain imaging and normal conduction velocities in routinely examined nerves."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of extrainstrumental workload on musician's hand dystonia (MD) and its relation to playing ability by testing two hypotheses: 1) the dominant hand is more severely affected at dystonia-onset; 2) improvement during treatment depends on whether the dominant or non-dominant hand is affected. 151 patients with dominant-hand MD and 92 with non-dominant hand MD were assessed regarding their playing ability at dystonia-onset (T0) and after treatment (T1). There was no significant difference in playing-ability at onset between groups. Significant improvement and a greater change in playing-ability was observed in the dominant-hand group. We found no difference in the proportional frequency of right-handed and left-handed individuals in the group of patients affected on the right or left side respectively. These findings suggest that handedness does not influence MD localization, but the prognosis is more favorable for those with dominant hand dystonia, potentially due to metaplasticity effects."

This retrospective study enrolled 42 children with genetically diagnosed ECHS1D within the China Mitochondrial Disease Network. Patients were classified into severe infantile (SI), slowly progressive infantile (SPI), and late-onset phenotype (LP) based on onset age, disease progression rate, and gross motor impairment severity. Prognosis was assessed using the Modified Rankin Scale(mRS). Forty-two patients (25 male) were included, with a median onset age of 13.5 months (range 3-60). Paroxysmal dystonia (PD, 33.3 %) was the most common initial symptoms, followed by developmental delay(28.6 %) and regression(21.4 %). All patients had globus pallidus involvement and were diagnosed with Leigh syndrome (SI, n = 18; SPI, n = 13; LP, n = 11). SI cases all started with non-paroxysmal dystonia, and showed more frequent putamen (77.8 %) and caudate nucleus (72.2 %) involvement. In SPI and LP cases, PD was more common at onset, with milder symptoms and often isolated globus pallidus involvement. The proportions of elevated urinary metabolic markers 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methylbutyrate (2,3DH2MB) and S-(2-carboxypropyl) cysteamine (SCPCM) were 89.7 % and 93.1 % respectively, and the degree of their elevation was significantly correlated with phenotype severity. Regarding overall prognosis, 52.4 % of patients could walk independently (mRS < 4), with three fatalities. SI cases had the worst prognosis, followed by SPI, while LP cases showed the best outcomes (p < 0.05). In terms of genetics, all patients were compound heterozygous variants in the ECHS1 gene, with 21 novel variants identified. The most common variant was the c.489G > A (p.Pro163=) variant, which was found in 18 patients, accounting for as high as 42.8 % (allele frequency 0.214). And patients carrying this synonymous variant exhibited later onset age, longer diagnostic duration, milder phenotypes. This study provides a comprehensive overview of ECHS1D, summarizing its clinical and genetic spectrum, and indicating that the c.489G > A variant is a potential hotspot in the Chinese population. As findings from single-center studies may not be generalizable to a broader population, multi-center prospective studies are warranted."

We also determined MDCs as a function of speaker severity and listener experience. Ten experienced listeners (ELs) and 12 novice listeners (NLs) rated overall severity of voice quality in 39 speakers with ADLD and 10 controls using a 100-mm visual analog scale across two rating sessions. MDCs at the 95% confidence level (MDC<sub>95</sub>) were calculated for all speakers. MDC<sub>95</sub> scores also were calculated as a function of speaker group, perceived speaker severity using averaged EL ratings as the reference standard (grouped as typical, mild, moderate, severe), and listener experience group. The MDC<sub>95</sub> for EL ratings of overall severity of voice quality for all speakers was 11.10 mm; for NLs, the MDC<sub>95</sub> was 8.73 mm. As a function of speaker group, the MDC<sub>95</sub> for EL ratings was 12.31 mm for speakers with ADLD (<i>n</i> = 39) and 0.89 mm for controls (<i>n</i> = 10). For NLs, the MDC<sub>95</sub> was 9.32 mm for speakers with ADLD and 4.72 mm for controls. As a function of speaker severity (<i>n =</i> 13 typical, <i>n</i> = 9 mild, <i>n</i> = 12 moderate, <i>n</i> = 15 severe), MDC<sub>95</sub> scores ranged from 4.22 to 13.77 mm for ELs, whereas MDC<sub>95</sub> scores ranged from 4.95 mm to 12.25 mm for NLs. Across both listener groups, mildly and moderately dysphonic speakers required larger MDC<sub>95</sub> scores compared to speakers without dysphonia for such differences to be considered beyond measurement error. Differences in MDC<sub>95</sub> scores ranged from 1 to 4 mm between listener groups across speaker severities. Results have implications for measuring and interpreting auditory-perceptual outcomes for speakers with ADLD with different voice quality severities when they are evaluated by ELs and NLs in clinical and research contexts."

It has been noted to occur more frequently in patients with dystonia, and in terms of location in the cervical region. Impedance measurements serve as an objective means to assess the integrity of a DBS system, with increased impedance values typically indicative of lead fracture. We report a case of normal measured impedances in the presence of complete lead fracture. A 12-year-old patient with a history of secondary dystonia due to cerebral palsy treated with GPi DBS (Boston Scientific<sup>®</sup>) presented in dystonic crisis. Upon initial review the DBS system was considered intact based on measured impedances within normal range. Following further exploration, a chest X-ray was performed that showed fracture and dislocation of both extension leads. Normal impedance values in a system cannot be relied upon to ensure system integrity. If the impedance values are out of range then the system integrity is compromised, but if the impedance values are within range the system integrity might still be compromised. It is crucial for clinicians to include this possibility in any patient presenting with subtherapeutic therapy or undergoing MRI scanning. Impedance measurements only may not provide a sufficient robust indication of system integrity in DBS implants, and in suspicion of a reduction in clinical effectiveness X-rays should also be performed to help establish system integrity."

However, the role of condensates in driving disease etiology remains poorly understood. Here, we identify myeloid leukemia factor 2 (MLF2) as a disease-agnostic biomarker for phase transitions, including stress granules and nuclear condensates associated with dystonia. Exploiting fluorophore-derivatized MLF2 constructs, we developed a high-content platform and computational pipeline to screen modulators of NE condensates across chemical and genetic space. We identified RNF26 and ZNF335 as protective factors that prevent the buildup of nuclear condensates sequestering K48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins. Chemical screening identified four FDA-approved drugs that potently modulate condensates by resolving polyubiquitinated cargo and MLF2 accumulation. Our exploratory integrated chemical-genetics approach suggests that modulation of zinc, and potentially autophagy and oxidative stress, is critical for condensate modulation and nuclear proteostasis, offering potential therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders. Application of our platform to a genome-wide CRISPR KO screen identified strong enrichment of candidate genes linked to primary microcephaly and related neurodevelopmental disorders. Two hypomorphic microcephaly-associated alleles of ZNF335 failed to rescue nuclear condensate accumulation in ZNF335 KO cells, suggesting that aberrant condensates and impaired nuclear proteostasis may contribute to the pathogenesis of microcephaly.

Patients are initially diagnosed with temporomandibular joint disorders, or neuralgias, and receive no adequate treatment for an average of 4 years. The study aims to assess the management outcome through botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection in patients with chronic OMD who failed initial multidisciplinary approaches. An interventional prospective anti-RET study was set between October 2021 and May 2024 with 12 OMD patients who did not respond to other treatments. Botox was injected into the LP and MM using a standardized pattern and dosage. The measurable evaluation goals included mouth opening and functional aspects of eating and speaking, which were evaluated at times up to 1 year. The treatment efficacy was assessed based on paired t tests as repeated measures ANOVA. Favourable changes were observed that anticipated the earlier results; the mean pretreated mouth opening augmented from 1.2 to 3.6 cm (P < 0.001) after treatment. Functional improvements were observed in eating and speaking at a level of 75%. In 66.7% of the patients, a sustained benefit was reported at 12 months, although had a 25% relapse rate. Precise injections of Botox lead to striking clinical improvement and lasting effects in the greatest patients with OMD. Although most enjoyed long-term positive outcomes, some patients' relapses assert further constant follow-up. The overall effectiveness of OMD management may be greatly enhanced by properly identifying symptoms as early as possible and the subsequent treatment."

Dystonia severity and disability, cognition, and comorbid depression and anxiety were also assessed. We recruited 35 CD patients and 17 matched HC. In the eye-tracking task, CD patients recognized emotions less accurately than HCs (77.0% vs. 84.4%; <i>p</i> = 0.001), primarily based on difficulties in identification of fear (<i>p</i> = 0.003) and surprise (<i>p</i> = 0.037).

CD patients also had significantly higher total TAS-20 scores (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and subscores (difficulty identifying and describing feelings; all <i>p</i> ≤ 0.026). Five patients (14.3%) reached the threshold for alexithymia and 6 (17.1%) for possible alexithymia. No HC scored positive for alexithymia and only 2 (11.8%) did for possible alexithymia. TAS-20 score correlated inversely with emotion recognition task performance (<i>r</i> = -0.411; <i>p</i> = 0.014). We found poorer performance in emotion recognition in CD patients compared to HC. Together with a different gaze pattern and higher scores for alexithymia our results highlight deficits in emotion processing in CD."

    "abstract": "Stress-induced childhood-onset neurodegeneration with variable ataxia and seizures (CONDSIAS) is an exceptionally rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. It is caused by biallelic inactivating variants in the ADP-ribosyl-serine hydrolase (ADPRS) gene that encodes for the enzyme ADP-ribosyl hydrolase3 (ARH3) involved in DNA repair. A distinctive feature of this condition is the exacerbation of clinical symptoms triggered by physical or emotional stress, as well as febrile illnesses. In this report, we describe three unrelated patients diagnosed with CONDSIAS, each having variable clinical phenotypes and responses to treatment. Patient 1 is a 26-year-old female with language delay, intellectual disability, and infrequent seizures in childhood. She later developed parkinsonism, truncal dystonia, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and neuropsychiatric symptoms in her second decade. Patient 2, an 8-year-old boy born to consanguineous parents, presented with infection-triggered episodic ataxia and ichthyosis. His elder sibling had suffered from progressive ataxia and succumbed to sudden death at the age of 8. Patient 3 is a 6-year-old girl who presented with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, oculomotor apraxia, and upward gaze palsy. Both patients 2 and 3 responded favourably to treatment with high-dose vitamin supplementation, while patient 1 showed stable disease progression without specific therapeutic intervention, suggesting spontaneous stabilization of her condition. Extra-neurological manifestations included ichthyosis in patients 1 and 2 and cataracts in patient 1. These three cases illustrate the heterogeneity in clinical presentation and prognosis of CONDSIAS, highlighting the occurrence of predominant extrapyramidal features and systemic involvement, thereby expanding the phenotypic spectrum beyond the typical manifestations of ataxia and seizures."

    "title": "Early-Onset Movement Disorder Syndrome Caused by Biallelic Variants in PDE1B Encoding Phosphodiesterase 1B.",
    "abstract": "Breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in basal ganglia cells through hydrolysis of diesteric bonds, primarily by PDE10A and PDE1B, is essential for normal human movement. While biallelic loss-of-function variants in PDE10A are known to cause hyperkinetic movement disorders, the role of PDE1B in human disease has not been characterized. We aimed to define the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of a novel autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic PDE1B variants. Clinical phenotyping by senior geneticists and neurologists, followed by whole exome sequencing, segregation analysis (Sanger sequencing), and molecular studies, including mini-gene splicing assays and protein studies in transfected HEK293 cells. Seven affected individuals from five unrelated pedigrees presented with an apparently autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypotonia in infancy, progressing to ataxia and dystonia in early childhood, with developmental delay and intellectual disability. Biallelic PDE1B variants were identified in all affected individuals: three truncating (p.Q45*, p.Q86*, p.S298Afs*6) and three splicing variants (c.594 + 2 T>G, c.735 + 5G>A, c.837-1G>C). Functional studies confirmed that the truncating variants caused loss of the catalytic domain, resulting in truncated or absent functional protein. Splicing variants led to exon skipping, frameshifts, and catalytic domain disruption. These findings establish a causative link between biallelic PDE1B variants and the observed clinical phenotype. Biallelic loss-of-function variants in PDE1B underlie a novel early-onset movement disorder resembling the phenotype associated with PDE10A deficiency. © 2025 The Author(s).

    "title": "Usability and adherence evaluation of a smartphone app for home-based symptom monitoring of cervical dystonia.",
    "abstract": "Cervical dystonia (CD) is a movement disorder that is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions causing abnormal head postures. Current assessments rely primarily on infrequent clinical evaluations and subjective patient-reported outcomes (about every 3 to 4 months), limiting detailed understanding of symptom progression between treatments. Improved understanding of symptom progression would enhance personalized treatment with Botulinum toxin A therapy. For this purpose, we introduce Move2Screen, a smartphone application designed for frequent home-based, asynchronous video monitoring of symptom progression for CD patients. We evaluate the usability and adherence of Move2Screen. Adherence was assessed in a longitudinal home-based observational study involving eight from initially 11 patients with CD who continued participation after the initial on-site acquisition. Usability was measured using the German mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (G-MAUQ) after the two-week mark, which evaluates ease-of-use, interface satisfaction, and usefulness. Adherence was analyzed by tracking the frequency and timing of recorded videos. The app showed good overall usability scores on the G-MAUQ and a high adherence rate, with participants completing 74% of the intended video recordings. However, usability evaluations highlighted some challenges in perceived usefulness and minor technical issues reported by users. The Move2Screen app demonstrates promising usability and adherence for home-based symptom monitoring in CD. However, addressing technical limitations, expanding participant cohorts, and integrating clinical decision support are essential next steps. These developments may enhance individualized care by enabling more informed therapeutic adjustments and improving long-term disease management."

    "title": "Beyond Spasticity: The Dual Impact of Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy in Spastic Quadriplegic Patients With Generalized Dystonia and the Need for Intrathecal Baclofen.",
    "abstract": "Background Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) is primarily indicated for spastic diplegia, effectively reducing lower limb spasticity. However, its role in generalized dystonia remains controversial, as some reports suggest potential symptom exacerbation. In such cases, intrathecal baclofen (ITB) represents the preferred approach. This study evaluates the effects of SDR as a secondary intervention following insufficient ITB therapy on motor function in patients with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy (CP) and generalized dystonia while also introducing a novel surgical strategy to approach mixed movement disorders. Material and methods This retrospective study included patients with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy and generalized dystonia treated at our institution between 2018 and 2023. All patients (n = 16) initially received intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy. In three patients, ITB monotherapy was effective in symptom control; however, due to insufficient spasticity management in the remaining 13 patients, selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) was subsequently performed without removal of the existing ITB system. Due to the worsening of dystonia and the lack of significant improvement in motor functions after SDR, ITB therapy was reintroduced. Clinical outcomes, including Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), and dystonia severity, were assessed before and after SDR, as well as following ITB reinitiation. Additionally, alterations in required ITB dosage before and after SDR were analyzed. Results While SDR effectively reduced spasticity in all patients, no improvement in overall motor function was observed. Notably, 69.2% of patients showed worsening of dystonia after SDR. ITB therapy was reinitiated in 11 patients (84.6%). Subsequent clinical evaluation revealed a significant improvement in both dystonia and all motor functions (standing, sitting, and transitional movements) across all patients (p<0.001). Furthermore, the required dosage of ITB to control dystonia after SDR was significantly lower than the required dosage before SDR (p<0.001). Conclusion Our findings suggest that a tailored, multimodal approach is essential for managing complex cases of CP with spasticity and dystonia. Furthermore, retaining the ITB system without explantation when performing SDR may be a viable strategy that could reduce the overall surgical burden and associated risks for the patient."

    "abstract": "Head tremor is a common symptom in both essential tremor (ET) and cervical dystonia (CD). Distinguishing between these two conditions can be challenging in clinical practice, particularly when head tremor is the dominant feature. Our goal was to explore the potential of speech assessment in recognizing the mechanisms of head tremor in patients with ET and CD. Objective acoustic vocal assessments of oral diadochokinesis, phonatory stability, vocal tremor, and speech timing were performed. Of the 93 patients assessed, 39 had cervical dystonia (CD) with head tremor, 38 had ET with head tremor (ET-HT), and 16 had ET with no head tremor (ET-nHT). Compared to both CD and ET-nHT, ET-HT showed irregular sequential motion rate, excessive pitch fluctuations, increased noise, and higher extent of vocal vibrato. Compared to CD, ET-HT also demonstrated slower sequential motion rate, prolonged pauses, and a slower articulation rate. Additionally, ET-HT had more pronounced vocal tremolo compared to ET-nHT. Speech assessment provided discrimination between the CD and ET-HT groups with an area under curve of 0.80. This study underscores the promising potential of speech analysis in recognizing mechanisms of head tremor in patients with ET or CD, revealing more severe and distinct speech impairments in ET-HT patients compared to those with CD."

This study aimed to clarify the efficacy and safety of STN-DBS and perform a post hoc analysis comparing it with DBS of the internal globus pallidus (GPi-DBS). This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, controlled trial included 67 patients aged 6-60 years old diagnosed with genetic or idiopathic isolated generalised or segmental dystonia. They were enrolled from seven hospitals in China and randomly assigned to undergo GPi-DBS or STN-DBS. After surgery, they were randomised to receive either neurostimulation or sham stimulation for 3 months. At the 3-month follow-up, neurostimulation was also initiated in the sham stimulation group, and all patients were followed up for more than 3 years after treatment. The primary outcome was the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale movement (BFMDRS-M) score. In the STN group, the neurostimulation subgroup exhibited significant improvement (p<0.001), which is also superior to the sham stimulation subgroup (p=0.028) at 3-month follow-up. At the 6-month and >3-year follow-ups, all patients receiving STN-DBS showed a significant improvement in BFMDRS-M scores (p<0.001). Further post hoc analysis revealed that both STN-DBS and GPi-DBS could produce similar therapeutic effects on motor symptoms (P<sub>6 months</sub>=0.865, P<sub>>3 years</sub>=0.905). There were no ongoing serious adverse events throughout the study. For isolated generalised and segmental dystonia patients, the STN is a selectable DBS target with ensured safety and efficacy. STN-DBS and GPi-DBS may achieve comparable therapeutic effects on motor symptoms. NCT03017586."

    "abstract": "Individuals with dystonia may experience acute exacerbations of symptoms. We aimed to explore the role of serum creatinine kinase (CK) levels as a biomarker for dystonia severity during episodes of exacerbation. A retrospective review of admissions to a paediatric tertiary centre due to Status Dystonicus over a 5-year period. A comprehensive scoping review of the published literature for SD and pre-SD was also undertaken. In total 58 admissions for 45 patients were identified. Dystonia Severity Action Plan (DSAP) was Grade 3 (pre-SD) for 41/58 admissions and Grade 4-5 (SD) for 17 admissions. Length of admission was significantly longer for SD (P < 0.005), with poorer outcomes (Fishers Exact test P < 0.001). CK levels were measured in 24/41 episodes of pre-SD, and 16/17 episodes of SD. Median peak CK levels were higher (729 IU/L) in the SD compared to pre-SD group (179.5 IU/L) (p = 0.009). For patients with SD, serial CK measurements tracked dystonia severity over time. Literature review identified 201 episodes of SD in 190 subjects. Note was made of CK measurement in 92/201 (45.8 %) episodes: pre-SD (DSAP 3) in 8 and SD in 84 [DSAP 4 (n = 30), and DSAP 5 (n = 54)] respectively, with a numerical value provided in in 73/90 episodes/cases. Median CK value was 4066 IU/L (884-22,105, 25th to 75th Centile). In the literature review, for 11 episodes serial CK measures were shown to correlate with severity of dystonic symptoms. serum CK levels represent a potentially useful biomarker for dystonia severity that differs between pre-SD and SD, and provide a measure to track dystonia severity at an individual patient basis."

Often, implantation in these patients can be considerably challenging, especially if previous surgical fusion involves the procedure access location. We present the case of a 27-year-old female with T2 American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) A spinal cord injury (SCI) and chronic spastic dystonia. She was maximized on oral medications without satisfactory control of her painful muscle spasms and was a candidate for ITB trial, which ultimately failed due to the difficulty of accessing the spinal canal due to extensive pseudoarthrosis secondary to thoracic to lumbar fusion. A decision was made to directly implant the pump in the operative room using O-arm-aided neuronavigation to guide catheter access at L5-S1. Currently, at 22 months of follow-up post-pump implant, ITB delivery has led to persistent improvements in her spastic dystonia and many aspects of quality of life. The current case indicates that a multidisciplinary approach when considering surgical treatments for medication-refractory spasticity may help expand the indications to large numbers of patients with postsurgical spine abnormalities."

    "title": "Purkinje Cell spike patterns do not correlate with nuclei cell spike patterns in mouse models for cerebellar disease.",
    "abstract": "Cerebellar dysfunction causes various movement disorders, including ataxia, dystonia, and tremor. Previous work demonstrated that spike patterns in cerebellar nuclei neurons were distinct between different movement disorder mouse models. However, often these changes arise from neural dysfunction in the cerebellar cortex, through misfiring, miswiring, or degenerating Purkinje cells. Even though Purkinje cells form the sole output from the cerebellar cortex, their information is relayed to other regions of the motor network via cerebellar nuclei cells. Purkinje cells make GABAergic synapses onto cerebellar nuclei cells, and it is often assumed that changes in Purkinje cell spike patterns result in inverse changes in nuclei cell spike patterns. Here, we test this hypothesis by answering the question of whether a reliable relationship between Purkinje cell and nuclei cell spike patterns exists. Single-cell, <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiology recordings of both cell types from six mouse models for cerebellar movement disorders were analyzed according to parameters relating to spike rate and irregularity. We investigated whether Purkinje cell spike patterns correlated with nuclei cell spike patterns. We found that some parameters for firing irregularity were positively correlated between Purkinje and nuclei cells but no - and particularly no inverse - relationship was observed between Purkinje and nuclei cell spike rate. Overall, this study begins to illuminate that the relationship between Purkinje cells and nuclei cell spike activity in a disease state is more complex and unpredictable. The data suggest Purkinje cell spike activity changes cannot accurately predict nuclei cell changes, which ultimately drive cerebellar disease states. Our findings underscore the importance of studying cerebellar nuclei cell function in cerebellar disease, as lack of changes in Purkinje cell firing patterns can mask disease-causing firing patterns in these cerebellar output cells."

Investigating TPs in cervical dystonia (CD) may help to delineate the contributions of subcortical circuits to CD pathophysiology. The aim of this study was to explore TP ability in patients with CD compared with healthy control subjects (HCs) and to examine the relationship between TPs and clinical features of CD. Twenty patients with CD and 20 HCs completed a TP task. Reaction times (RTs) were measured during TPs under three conditions: rhythmic and single-interval (predictable target onset) and random (unpredictable target onset). RT benefit scores were calculated by subtracting RTs in the random condition from those in predictive conditions. Our exploratory analysis showed that patients with CD had lower benefit scores than HCs in the single-interval task. In CD, benefit scores in the single-interval task were negatively correlated with Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scales severity. Patients with CD exhibited selective impairments in interval-based predictions, suggesting cerebellar involvement in dystonia's pathophysiology. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."

    "abstract": "As advanced molecular testing is incorporated into routine clinical practice, accessibility and yield remain limited. We propose a simplified and effective workup strategy to maximize diagnostic yield based on presented diagnostic yield of rare movement disorders at a tertiary Neurogenetics Clinic. Retrospective analysis (2019-2023) of 190 patients aged 2-87 years, diagnosed with cerebellar ataxia (CA, n = 91), hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP, n = 51), or dystonia and paroxysmal dyskinesia movement disorders (DPD, n = 48). Workup included next-generation sequencing (NGS) and repeat expansion testing. Undiagnosed cases underwent exome or genome sequencing (ES/GS). Among 190 patients, 38 had a prior genetic diagnosis, and 106 were undiagnosed patients who pursued workup; 43 of 106 (41%) cases were genetically diagnosed: 25 of 43(58%) by NGS, 13 of 43 (30%) by repeat expansion analysis, and 5 of 43(12%) by sequencing for founder mutation or target gene. Diagnostic rate in the newly diagnosed CA subgroup reached 52%, 30% in HSP and 32% in DPD. In the overall cohort, the diagnostic yield of NGS panels was 31% and 33% for ES. Diagnostic yield was significantly higher (P-value<0.05) among patients with early-onset disease or isolated phenotypes. We report a high diagnostic yield (41%) compared to reported literature (20%-30%), especially in patients with early-onset disease. ES, compared to panel testing, was of greater contribution to diagnosis of complex phenotypes. Our findings argue for early referral to genetic workup, suggesting that tailored workup based on phenotype complexity and age of onset can reduce auxiliary testing. Further cost-benefit analysis is required to lower expenses and ensure timely diagnosis."

The validation of the variant of interest found was performed by Sanger sequencing. A segregation study was performed on family members. The patient is a man who started at age 32 years with dysarthria soon followed by cerebellar ataxia. On evolution, spasticity, cervical dystonia, and cognitive impairment were observed. A premature stop codon variant was detected in homozygosity in exon 2 of the <i>GDAP</i>2 gene: c.57_59delinsACCCCAGCT (p.Trp19*). It was also detected in the patient's mother and brother, who were heterozygous, and 4 nephews on the paternal side, who were also carriers of the variant. This null variant in the <i>GDAP2</i> gene has not been previously described in the literature associated to ataxia, neither is it present in population databases. It is considered probably pathogenic (PVS1 and PM2) and as such can be classified from this study, providing further evidence on the association of <i>GDAP2</i> with hereditary cerebellar ataxia."

    "abstract": "The organization of care profoundly impacts the variability in the quality of care provided to patients and the equity of access to care. The lack of coordination of care, of communication among healthcare providers, healthcare professionals, and patients, and the duplication of services provided to the patients represent some paradigmatic examples of organizational barriers to deliver high-quality patient-centered care and to promote equitable access to healthcare services. Patient care pathways (PCPs) are valuable tools for the (re)design and the (re)definition of the provision of healthcare services to patients. This work represents the first application of the RarERN Path<sup>©</sup> methodology for the (re)design of Patient Care Pathways (PCPs) to Ataxias, Dystonia, and Phenylketonuria (PKU). The study was conducted with the support of Academic Partners and in collaboration with experts from two of the 24 European Reference Networks for rare diseases (ERN RND and MetabERN). The application of some of the phases of RarERN Path<sup>©</sup> methodology enabled the translation of the good practices already in place in the centers of expertise into a common optimized PCP, one for each of the three diseases, integrating the expertise of some reference centers of excellence with the patients' perspectives, and principally focusing on the organization of care. The PCPs proposed for progressive ataxias, dystonia, and PKU provide insight into the value of specialized centers in diagnosing and managing patients with rare and complex conditions and are the results of a co-designed optimized process integrating the good practices of the centers of excellence and expertise with the perspectives of the patients' representatives. This integrated approach allowed for the re-design and optimization of the organizational dimensions of the patient's care pathways."

MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycINFO, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP were searched up to December 12, 2024. Studies involving human applications of tTIS were eligible. Methodological quality was appraised using the NIH and modified Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine tools. Forty-eight records were reviewed (20 published studies, 28 ongoing trials). Of published studies, 16 single-session and 4 multi-session studies assessed safety, mechanistic outcomes, or therapeutic effects of tTIS in 820 participants. Stimulation was most commonly delivered at beta (20 Hz) or gamma (30-130 Hz) envelope frequencies. Neuroimaging studies supported target engagement of the motor cortex, basal ganglia, and hippocampus in humans, particularly when stimulation was paired with behavioural tasks. Preliminary clinical findings in small samples demonstrated acute symptom improvements in bradykinesia and tremor within 60 minutes following a single tTIS session in Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. Reported adverse events across studies were mild (e.g., tingling, itching). Emerging trials increasingly utilize multi-session protocols (2-40 sessions) and are extending tTIS to patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders, particularly epilepsy and depression. Phase 1 studies demonstrate that tTIS is safe, well-tolerated, and can engage deep brain targets in humans. Well-controlled Phase 2 trials are needed to assess its therapeutic potential in patient populations."

    "abstract": "X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) is a progressive adult-onset neurogenerative disorder caused by the insertion of a SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon in <i>TAF1</i> gene. One element of the SVA is a tandem polymorphic CCCTCT repeat tract whose length inversely correlates with the age of disease onset. Previous observations that the repeat exhibits length-dependent somatic expansion and that XDP onset is modified by variation in DNA repair gene <i>MSH3</i> indicated that somatic repeat expansion is an important disease driver. Here, we sought to uncover genetic modifiers of CCCTCT instability in XDP patients and to provide a mechanistic link between somatic instability and disease. We determined quantitative metrics of both repeat expansion and repeat contraction in blood. Using genetic association analyses of exome sequencing data, as well as directed sequencing of a variant <i>MSH3</i> repeat, we found that <i>MSH3</i> modifies repeat expansion and contraction in blood as well as age at onset. <i>MSH3</i> alleles associated with earlier disease onset were associated with more expansion and less contraction. Conversely, alleles associated with later disease onset were associated with less expansion and more contraction. Notably, <i>MSH3</i> repeat alleles were also similarly associated with expansion and contraction in brain tissues. Our findings provide key evidence that MSH3's role(s) in CCCTCT repeat dynamics underlies its impact on clinical disease and indicate that therapeutic strategies to lower or inhibit MSH3 are predicted to both slow CCCTCT expansion and promote CCCTCT contraction, impacting the disease course prior to clinical onset."

Within this malfunctioning network, the cerebellum plays an important role that needs to be further characterized. To investigate the structural connectivity of the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract (DRTT), probabilistic tractography was performed in 18 CD patients and 18 matched healthy control (HC) subjects. Connectivity was quantified with fractional anisotropy (FA). Thirteen subjects in each group also participated in a neurophysiological double-blind experiment to investigate the effect of cathodal and sham cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) on sensorimotor associative plasticity, as evoked by paired associative stimulation (PAS). The association of FA of the DRTT and neurophysiological parameters was studied with linear models. The FA of the DRTT was not different between the groups and not related to motor symptom severity in CD patients. In the HC group, there was a significant association between the structural connectivity of the DRTT and the effect that cathodal ctDCS had on the PAS effect. This association was not found in CD patients. The microstructural state of the DRTT is a potential biomarker for the efficacy of ctDCS in HC. The lack of this structure-function association in patients is further evidence of abnormal properties of the cerebellar motor network in CD."

This study investigates the immediate effects of ERPWT on dystonia, static plantar pressure distribution, and balance in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Thirteen participants with PD were recruited from the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. After obtaining informed consent, clinical information was recorded, and measurements of lower limb muscle tone, stiffness, and elasticity, as well as static plantar pressure distribution and center of pressure (COP), were measured. Participants subsequently received a single session of ERPWT administered to the bilateral plantar fascia. Following ERPWT, participants were re-evaluated immediately after treatment. After ERPWT, significant decreases were observed in muscle tone, stiffness, and elasticity of the achilles tendon on the more PD-affected side and the anterior aspect of the planta on both feet (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Additionally, significant reductions in COP measures were noted post-treatment (<i>p</i> < 0.001). However, no significant changes were found in muscle tone, stiffness, and elasticity of the achilles tendon on the less PD-affected side or in the anterior tibialis and gastrocnemius. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in static plantar pressure distribution (<i>p</i> > 0.05). These findings indicate that a single session of ERPWT applied to the bilateral planta fascia can yield immediate beneficial effects in reducing dystonia symptoms and improving balance in patients with Parkinson's disease. This therapy may serve as an adjunctive treatment to address motor symptoms in this population. Further research is warranted to explore the long-term effects of ERPWT and its mechanisms of action in PD patients."

    "title": "Self-Reported Dystonia and Dystonia on Neurological Examination: Prevalence and Concordance across Time in a Prospectively Followed Essential Tremor Cohort.",
    "abstract": "Screening questions are important in identifying subgroups of individuals within a target population. Dystonic movements and postures are not uncommon in patients with essential tremor (ET). There is a gap in knowledge - no studies have assessed the validity of a self-report of dystonia in ET patients. We assessed the concordance between self-reported dystonia and the presence or absence of dystonia on examination (DOE). We obtained self-report data from 274 ET cases in a serial study with up to five follow-up evaluations. At each assessment, participants could self-report dystonia, and they underwent a detailed neurological examination, from which a movement disorders neurologist assessed for the presence of DOE. Across time, the prevalence of self-reported dystonia and DOE ranged from 0.0% to 4.3% and 8.6% to 17.5%, respectively. There were 74 cases with either self-reported dystonia or DOE; in only 3 (4.1%) was there a positive concordance between the two at each of their evaluations. Values for sensitivity ranged from 0.0% to 40%; specificity from 96.1% to 100%; positive predictive value from 0.0% to 67.0% (median 30.0%); and negative predictive value from 83.1% to 94.4%. Our study provides important insights into the validity of self-report data on dystonia in ET and the prevalence of DOE in ET. Our findings suggest that self-reported dystonia was not a valid means to identify DOE in ET."

    "title": "Protective role of coenzyme Q10 against trihexyphenidyl-induced pulmonary toxicity in Wistar rats.",
    "abstract": "Trihexyphenidyl (THP), an anticholinergic drug used to manage Parkinson's disease and dystonia, has been associated with oxidative stress and metabolic disturbances, particularly affecting pulmonary function. Long-term exposure to THP may induce lung toxicity through increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a lipid-soluble antioxidant and mitochondrial cofactor, has been shown to protect against oxidative damage and apoptosis in various models of toxicity. However, its role in mitigating THP-induced pulmonary toxicity remains unexplored. This study investigated the protective effects of CoQ10 against THP-induced pulmonary toxicity in male Wistar rats. Thirty-two adult male Wistar rats (180-200 g) were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 8 per group): (i) Control (vehicle-treated), (ii) THP (1.5 mg/kg), (iii) CoQ10 (10 mg/kg), and (iv) THP + CoQ10. Treatments were administered orally once daily for 21 days. Body weight was recorded at baseline and endpoint. At the end of treatment, rats were euthanized, and lungs were excised, weighed, and processed for biochemical and histological analyses. Oxidative stress markers were assessed, including catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Metabolic enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) were measured. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was evaluated to assess vascular function, while caspase-3 levels were determined as an apoptotic marker. Histopathological examination of lung tissues was performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. THP administration resulted in significant weight loss, increased lung weight, oxidative stress (decreased CAT, GPx, SOD, and GSH; increased MDA), and metabolic alterations (elevated LDH, PDH, lactate, and pyruvate). ACE activity was reduced, and caspase-3 was elevated, indicating apoptosis. CoQ10 co-administration mitigated these effects, restoring antioxidant enzyme activity, metabolic balance, and ACE levels while reducing MDA and caspase-3 expression. Histological analysis confirmed that CoQ10 ameliorated THP-induced pulmonary damage. CoQ10 demonstrated significant protective effects against THP-induced oxidative stress, metabolic disturbances, and apoptosis, likely due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These findings suggest CoQ10 as a potential therapeutic agent for THP-induced pulmonary toxicity, warranting further research. Not applicable."

    "abstract": "Musician's dystonia (MD) causes a loss of motor control during music performance, with negative consequences on the musician's career. To date, no efficacious treatment has been identified. This qualitative study focuses on the experiences of musicians with MD, exploring the onset and progression of dystonia and the coping strategies that are employed. Thirty-one musicians diagnosed with MD were interviewed, and a reflexive thematic analysis was conducted. The analysis yielded two themes: \"Dystonia…a labyrinth you don't understand how you got in and don't know how to move through\" and \"The kiss of death for a musician.\" The experience of musicians is characterized by pervasive uncertainty, stemming from the unpredictability and ambiguity of symptoms, the absence of clear prognoses, and the lack of effective treatments. This uncertainty is further compounded by the delegitimization from social and professional contexts, as well as from health professionals. MD has resulted in biographical destruction, but over time most participants manage to reconceptualize their identity. MD should be regarded as a work-related illness with the potential to result in work-related disability. To assist musicians in overcoming the challenges posed by MD, greater societal awareness and specific psychological and social support are necessary."

    "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder linked with MECP2 variants, frequently presenting with movement disorders (MDs). This study examined the frequency, types, and associations of MDs with RTT characteristics and severity. Twenty female patients (median age 11 years, range 3-40) with MECP2 variants were recruited and assessed using disease severity and MD scales, alongside videotaped neurological examinations. Prevalent MD was hypokinetic in 55% of the patients and hyperkinetic in 45%. Parkinsonism and dystonia were the most common, coexisting in 75% of patients. Higher Movement Disorders-Childhood Rating Scale (MD-CRS) scores correlated with greater severity on the Rett Assessment Rating Scale (RARS) (P = 0.04). Dystonia was significantly associated with respiratory (P < 0.05) and gastrointestinal problems (P = 0.02). The study identified parkinsonism and dystonia as the prevalent MDs in RTT, emphasizing the association between dystonia and gastrointestinal/respiratory problems and reflecting the complex nature of MDs in RTT."

    "abstract": "Abnormal dopamine neurotransmission and striatal dysfunction is implicated in many forms of dystonia, yet the underlying molecular processes remain unknown. Here, we identified thousands of dysregulated genes within striatal spiny projection neuron (SPN) subtypes in a genetic mouse model of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD), which is caused by gene defects that reduce dopamine neurotransmission. Although changes in mRNA expression were unique to each SPN subtype, abnormal glutamatergic signaling was implicated in each SPN subtype. Indeed, both AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated currents were enhanced in direct SPNs but diminished in indirect SPNs in DRD mice. The pattern of mRNA dysregulation was distinct from parkinsonism where the dopamine deficit occurs in adults, suggesting that the phenotypic outcome is dependent on both the timing of the dopaminergic deficit and the SPN-specific adaptions. By leveraging these disease-specific molecular signatures, we identified LRRK2 inhibition, among other mechanisms, as a novel therapeutic target for dystonia."

We evaluated accuracy parameters of selected self-rated scales for depression and anxiety in patients with idiopathic cervical dystonia (CD). Two-hundred-and-ten patients with idiopathic CD were recruited from 10 movement disorders centers from the US, Canada, Australia, and UK. At the end of each botulinum toxin cycle, participants were administered the Adult Standard Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) as reference standard for depression and anxiety. Participants completed 8 self-administered index instruments (2 for depression, 2 for anxiety, and 4 combining screening for both). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, covariate-adjusted area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and likelihood ratios were calculated for all instruments. On the MINI, 8.6 % (100 % female) fulfilled criteria for current major depressive disorder and 10.5 % (91 % female) fulfilled criteria for any current disorder amongst panic, social anxiety or generalized anxiety disorders. For depression screening, all tools had an AUC higher than 0.80, with the two most accurate being the BDI-II (AUC 0.91, sensitivity 87.5 %) and the HADS-Depression (AUC 0.88, sensitivity 93.7 %). For anxiety screening, the only instrument showing clinical usefulness was the HADS-Anxiety (AUC 0.82, sensitivity 86.3 %). Current major depression can be screened in CD with high degree of accuracy using different self-administered scales, whereas existing screening tools for anxiety perform worse. Dystonia-specific instruments are less accurate than scales developed for the general population."

    "abstract": "Loss of Y chromosome (LOY), an age-related somatic mutation, is associated with various age-related diseases, but its role in the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. This study investigated the relationship between blood LOY levels and the risk of PD onset and progression. We estimated the LOY level for each male participant based on genome-wide arrays or whole genome sequencing data. We performed Cox proportional hazards regression analysis among 222,598 male participants in the UK Biobank and linear mixed model analysis involving 2574 male individuals with PD across 14 cohorts, encompassing 19,562 visits. In the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort, we further compared brain structure using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and carried out brain network functional connectivity analysis based on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) datasets. Additionally, we assessed the LOY status in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data, which included 1,303,531 cells from 279 post-mortem samples across five brain regions, and performed temporal dynamic gene expression analysis. Male participants with LOY had a slightly higher risk of developing PD during follow-up (HR = 1·16, 95% CI = 1·01-1·34, P = 0·04). Among males affected by PD, LOY carriers experienced accelerated neurodegenerative progression, manifesting as more rapid motor impairment (P = 0·0072) and cognitive decline (P = 0·0005) compared to non-LOY carriers. Patients with PD carrying LOY also exhibited decreased network functional connectivity in certain brain regions. Notably, LOY cells were particularly enriched in microglia/immune and vascular/epithelial cells, and a subset of genes in LOY-Mic P2RY12 cells were associated with PD progression. This data-driven study highlights the potential association of LOY with the onset and progression of PD through the analysis of multi-scale data, including clinical phenotypes, brain neuroimaging maps, and molecular profiles from single-nucleus transcriptome across multi-brain regions. These findings suggest that LOY may be an accomplice to the onset and progression of PD.

    "title": "Patient Selection in Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR).",
    "abstract": "For almost as long as selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) has existed, there has been debate surrounding which patients should be eligible to undergo the procedure. The selection criteria used to identify suitable surgical candidates have remained largely unchanged for the last three decades, despite the popularity and use of the procedure increasing. Historically, those aged between 3 and 9 years, those of GMFCS level 2 or 3, and those without evidence of dystonia were considered for SDR. In recent years, as the procedure has continued to develop, however, these parameters are expanding, with evidence to suggest a much broader cohort of patients may benefit from SDR than once thought. This chapter seeks to review current practice in patient selection for SDR, as well as the potential directions that this controversial discussion may move towards in the future."

    "title": "Neurophysiological and Neuroanatomical Background of Spasticity: Surgical Implication for Dorsal Rhizotomy in Cerebral Palsy.",
    "abstract": "Spasticity arises from the exaggeration of the monosynaptic reflex, attributed to the loss of inhibitory influences from descending supraspinal structures, though not exclusively. Defined by its resistance to muscle stretching, spasticity yields two significant outcomes. Firstly, muscles tend to remain in a shortened position, restricting movement. Secondly, hypertonia, coupled with a lack of mobilization, leads to soft tissue changes, including a loss of viscoelasticity. This non-velocity-dependent biomechanical aspect limits movements, even at slow velocities, rendering them unresponsive to antispastic agents. Proactively addressing hypertonia/spasticity is crucial to prevent the fixation of disorders and the potential irreducibility of this vicious circle. Understanding the role of the reticular formation, its afferent projections, and efferent pathways is essential for comprehending circadian tone variations and the variability in clinical presentations among patients. The mechanism of hypertonia in children with cerebral palsy is twofold: a neural component due to spasticity (velocity dependent) and a biomechanical component linked to soft tissue changes. Although clinically challenging to differentiate, this distinction is crucial, as only the former responds to antispastic treatments, while the latter requires physiotherapy. Additionally, spasticity is often accompanied by dystonia, a sustained hypertonic state induced by voluntary motion attempts. Distinguishing spasticity from dystonia is essential, as dorsal rhizotomy minimally affects the dystonic component. Spasticity, by opposing muscle stretching and lengthening, leads to muscles remaining in a shortened position, resulting in soft tissue changes and contracture, ultimately restricting movements. Hypertonia and lack of mobilization create a vicious circle, culminating in severe locomotor disability due to irreducible musculotendinous retraction and joint ankylosis/bone deformities. These evolving consequences must be carefully considered during a child's assessment for decision-making. The hypotonic effects of lumbosacral dorsal rhizotomy, acting not only at a segmental level on the lower limbs but also supra-segmentally through the reticular formation, are also discussed."

    "abstract": "Quality of life (QoL) is a commonly used outcome measure in people with chronic neurological diseases (CND). As valuable as QoL is, it does not take into account aspects of subjective well-being (SWB) such as subjective happiness, meaning in life, life satisfaction and hope; all constructs that are considered central to well-being. The goal was to assess how the different aspects of SWB are altered in Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia relative to healthy controls (HCs) and to identify the most important predictors of different dimensions of SWB in PD and dystonia. Eighty-two people with PD, 63 with dystonia, and 50 HCs were surveyed using various measures of SWB. People with PD and dystonia had significantly lower satisfaction with life than HCs, with self-esteem and loneliness being significant covariates. Although people with PD and dystonia had significantly less meaning in life, they still sought meaning in life as much as HCs. Self-esteem, resilience and neuroticism were significant covariates for the presence of \"meaning in life.\" There were no significant group differences in subjective happiness or hope. In people with PD, mood (depression and anxiety), personality traits (extraversion and self-esteem), disease duration, and pain/discomfort were significant predictors of various measures of SWB. The main significant predictor of SWB in dystonia was depression, which predicted 49% of the variance in subjective happiness. These results emphasize the importance of SWB as a field of investigation and clinical care in the management of people with PD and dystonia."

This retrospective, monocentric study recruited patients from the Neurology Department of Henan Provincial People's Hospital between April 2017 and December 2023. All patients underwent neural antibody testing in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and met the diagnostic criteria for autoantibody-negative but probable severe AE, with available 1-year follow-up data. In total, 124 patients with autoantibody-negative severe AE were analyzed. Among them, 27.4% achieved good functional outcomes at discharge. Older age (OR 1.034, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.010-1.058, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and the presence of dyskinesia/dystonia (OR 8.463, 95% CI 3.282-21.820, <i>p</i> < 0.001) were predictive of poor short-term outcomes. At the 1-year follow-up, 54.8% experienced favorable long-term outcomes. Independent predictors of unfavorable long-term outcomes included older age (OR 1.076, 95% CI 1.018-1.136, <i>p</i> = 0.009), longer hospital stays (OR 1.264, 95% CI 1.105-1.446, <i>p</i> = 0.001), the presence of refractory status epilepticus (OR 14.765, 95% CI 1.759-123.935, <i>p</i> = 0.013) and higher CASE scores at discharge (OR 2.079, 95% CI 1.450-2.980, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Additionally, 30.6% of patients had relapsed, with refractory status epilepticus being an independent risk factor for relapse. Although patients with antibody-negative severe AE experience significant disability in the early stages of their disease, the majority eventually regain independent functioning. Older age at disease onset, longer hospital stays, the presence of refractory status epilepticus and higher CASE scores at discharge may predict a poor long-term prognosis."

However, knowledge of bilateral torticollis is limited. The purpose of this article was to describe how bilateral torticollis may present itself clinically. Case I describes an infant with CMT with a sternocleidomastoid tumor (SMT) on the right side, with some limitation in rotation towards the right side and in lateral flexion towards the left side, the muscle on the right side was shortened. While sitting with support, he tilted his head to the left and was stronger in the lateral flexors on the left side which fits well with postural left-sided torticollis. The other infant had bilateral muscular torticollis, the sternocleidomastoid muscle had thickened bilaterally, and both active and passive rotations were affected. The head was held in flexion, and active rotation was severely limited on both sides. For both cases the therapeutic interventions were to gain a normal range of motion (ROM) and a good head position. CMT can appear in different ways and may be bilateral. Both infants gained good ROM and better head position, however case I still needs some training. To gain more knowledge about bilateral CMT, we should follow these cases over a longer period of time. It is important to communicate and discuss our experiences with each other to understand rare cases of CMT."

    "abstract": "Claudius, the fourth emperor of Rome, suffered from multiple health issues, including an unsteady gait, persistent tremors in his arms and head, and a speech impediment that caused him to stutter and mispronounce words since childhood. Despite possessing average or even above-average intellectual abilities, he was considered unfit for public office (cursus honorum) due to these physical conditions. Based on remaining historical records, modern scholars have proposed several possible diagnoses, including cerebral palsy, dystonia, transverse myelitis, or Tourette syndrome. While earlier scholarship argued that he had cerebral palsy, more recent interpretations favor dystonia or Tourette syndrome. This claim is supported by historical records that show how Claudius' symptoms fluctuated over time since his childhood and how he was able to maintain a relatively stable health during his reign, carrying out his imperial duties effectively. Claudius's physical impairments subjected him to harsh treatment from his family. His mother Antonia the Younger, his sister Livilla, and his paternal grandmother Livia treated him with contempt. In contrast, his adoptive grandfather Augustus showed some leniency, expressing hope that Claudius' condition might improve one day. None the less, both Augustus and his uncle Tiberius chose to excluded him from public service. His disabilities, especially his walking and speech issues, remained a source of ridicule even after his death. This is poignantly illustrated in Seneca's satirical poem \"Apocolocyntosis,\" which was written after his death. Unable to become a celebrated soldier or orator due to his physical limitations, Claudius was far removed from the Roman ideal of leadership both in his own times and in posterior times. He was often met with contempt and discrimination. Nevertheless, he proved to be a capable and successful emperor. Although none of his contemporary historians explicitly recorded the efforts Claudius may have made to overcome his disabilities, such perseverance can be inferred from the subtext of historical accounts. In this, Claudius offers a powerful symbol of resilience and hope."

To evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of repeat DAXI treatments for CD over 52 weeks in the phase 3, open-label ASPEN-OLS (NCT03617367). Adults with moderate-to-severe CD (Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale [TWSTRS] score ≥20) initially received DAXI 125U or 250U based on treatment history and investigator judgment. Retreatment could be titrated (50U-75U) each cycle (maximum 300U) for up to four cycles over 52 weeks. Assessments were conducted at Week 4, 6, 12, and every 4 weeks until retreatment. In all, 357 subjects received ≥1 dose of DAXI; most subjects (68.9%) received 250U during Cycle 1. Subjects most commonly received three (47.3%) or two (26.6%) treatments over 52 weeks. The average dose increased with successive cycles (Cycle 2: 239U, Cycle 3: 256U, Cycle 4: 270U). Mean (SD) change in TWSTRS score from baseline increased from -15.4 (10.3) in Cycle 1 to -19.9 (13.6) in Cycle 4. Median duration of effect was 20.1 weeks (Cycle 1, 2). No trend was observed between exposure to DAXI and any safety signals or antibody events. The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events per treatment were muscular weakness (4.9%), injection-site pain (4.2%), and dysphagia (3.9%). DAXI was safe and efficacious over repeated treatments in adults with CD. Adverse event rates were similar to or potentially lower compared with conventional BoNTs."

To this day, there have been limited studies and reports on the <i>NUS1</i> gene. We described the case of an 8-year-old Chinese boy exhibiting developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To elucidate the genetic etiology, whole-exome sequencing was performed on the proband. A candidate variant was subsequently validated by Sanger sequencing in the proband and his unaffected parents. Whole-exome sequencing analysis discovered a novel heterozygous variant (c.279del, p.L94Wfs*11) on exon 1 of <i>NUS1</i> (NM_138459.5), leading to premature termination of protein translation (p.L94Wfs*11). Sanger sequencing failed to identify the candidate variant in his unaffected parents. Following the updated American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines, the c.279del variant was classified as pathogenic (PVS1+PM6+PM2_Supporting). Based on the clinical phenotype of the proband, he was diagnosed with autosomal dominant intellectual developmental disorder-55 with seizures (MRD55) and ASD. This study expands the phenotype and mutation spectrum of the <i>NUS1</i> gene, which contributes to the diagnosis of related disorders. Furthermore, the identification of the genetic basis of the proband and confirmation of the corresponding loci of his family members will facilitate the genetic counseling of the proband's parents regarding reproduction."

A scoping review was performed according to the PRISMA extension. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library, using terms referring to alpha-2 agonists and neurological symptoms in pediatric palliative care. Seven articles were identified, including three case reports, two case series, one observational cohort study, and one retrospective analysis. Two drugs (dexmedetomidine, <i>n</i> = 4/7, and clonidine, <i>n</i> = 3/7) were investigated, encompassing a total of 44 patients aged between 7 months and 18 years. Most patients (95%) initiated treatment in an inpatient setting before transitioning to home care. All patients reported clinical improvement; however, 25% of children treated with clonidine discontinued its use due to ineffectiveness or side effects. No adverse effects were reported with dexmedetomidine use. Alpha-2 agonists are increasingly being used to manage intractable neurological symptoms in pediatric palliative care. However, evidence regarding their safety profile and effectiveness remains limited, highlighting the need for further research in this area."

The severity of DRD ranges from mild to fatal encephalopathy. DRD is caused by recessive mutations in the TH gene. This article is a systematic review (SR) of all reports of patients with DRD, including the first Mexican cases and other phenotypes associated with variants in the gene encoding tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), from its first description to the first quarter of 2024. The SR followed the PRISMA guidelines in five databases (Scopus, MEDLINE, PubMed Central, LILACS, and Scielo). Sixty-two publications were selected. They included 179 patients with TH deficiency, but only 143 included clinical descriptions. The age of onset was infantile regardless of phenotype, and there was a delay in age at diagnosis (t = -7.139, P < 0.001). Encephalopathy was the earliest presentation, and psychomotor retardation was common in all forms of TH deficiency. Multiple motor manifestations may be present, including dystonia, parkinsonism, gait disturbances, and others. Response to dopaminergic replacement therapy (DRT) has been reported in 143 patients (good in 64.3%, moderate in 23.7%, and poor in 12%). The compound heterozygous genotype was the most common (61.45%) for the biallelic variants of the TH gene. In addition, data from 6 cases with heterozygous variants are described. This is the most comprehensive review of TH deficiency cases and shows that these phenotypes are rare, have a wide neurological phenotypic variability, are often infantile-onset, and respond well to DRT."

    "abstract": "Pontocerebellar hypoplasia is a rare neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by severe hypoplasia or atrophy of pons and cerebellum that may be associated with other brain malformations, microcephaly, optic nerve atrophy, dystonia, ataxia and neuromuscular disorders. At this time, there are 17 variants of PCH distinguished by clinical presentation and distinctive radiological and biochemical features in addition to pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia. PCH1 is defined as PCH variant associated with anterior horn degeneration in the spinal cord with muscle weakness and hypotonia, and is associated with recessive variants in genes VRK1, EXOSC3, EXOSC8, EXOSC9 and SLC25A46. Neuromuscular manifestations may clinically present as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), motor neuropathy (HMN) or neuronopathy (non-5q spinal muscular atrophy; SMA) or sensorimotor polyneuropathy (HMSN). Physiologic functions of PCH1-associated genes include regulation of RNA metabolism, mitochondrial fission and neuronal migration. Overall, complex phenotypes associated with PCH1 gene variants ranging from PCH and related neurodevelopmental disorders combined with neuromuscular disorders to isolated neuromuscular disorders have variable outcomes with isolated neuromuscular disorders typically having later onset with better outcomes. Improved understanding of pathogenesis of pontocerebellar hypoplasia and its association with motor neuronopathies and peripheral neuropathies may provide us with valuable insights and lead to potential new therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disorders."

    "title": "Retinal Thickness in Patients with Parkinson's Disease and Dopa Responsive Dystonia-Is There Any Difference?",
    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Certain aspects of retinal thickness assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) require additional clarification. It is supposed that attributing reduced retinal thickness in PD to dopaminergic loss may not be acceptable as it also happens in diseases where dopaminergic loss does not occur. The objective of our study is to compare the ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL), and macular thickness of PD and dopa responsive dystonia (DRD) patients with healthy controls (HC), to investigate whether DRD patients, as a distinctive model of genetically induced dopamine deficiency, have reduced retinal thickness in comparison with PD, and to analyze correlation between retinal thickness and various PD clinical parameters. <b>Methods</b>: We analyzed 86 patients with PD, 10 patients with DRD, and 96 age- and sex-matched HC. <b>Results</b>: GCIPL, pRNFL, and central macula thickness (CMT) are statistically significantly thinner in PD patients compared to HC (<i>p</i> < 0.001, all). GCIPL and CMT are also statistically significantly thinner in DRD patients compared to HC (<i>p</i> = 0.012, <i>p</i> = 0.001, respectively). GCIPL thickness correlates positively with the daily dose of levodopa (r = 0.244, <i>p</i> < 0.01). The thickness of GCIPL and pRNFL correlate negatively with current age (r = -0.219; <i>p</i> < 0.01 and r = -0.358; <i>p</i> < 0.05, respectively). All retinal parameters are statistically significantly thinner in females than in males (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusions</b>: Patients with PD and DRD did not differ in GCIPL and pRNFL thickness when compared to one another. These results, supported by positive correlation of levodopa dose and GCIPL thickness in PD patients, emphasize the importance of dopamine in maintaining retinal thickness."

    "abstract": "CYFIP2, essential for actin cytoskeleton regulation, is implicated in early-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) with neurodevelopmental impairments and variable movement disorders, including occasional dyskinetic crises. We report a novel CYFIP2 frameshift variant (c.281_282insA/p.(Gln95ProfsTer15)) causing dyskinetic crises and to assess its functional impact. Clinical and genetic evaluations were conducted, alongside functional studies using patient-derived fibroblasts. Actin dynamics and cell motility were analyzed with confocal microscopy and live-cell imaging. The patient exhibited DEE, delayed neurodevelopment, refractory seizures, and movement disorders, including dystonia, choreoathetosis, and dyskinetic crises. Functional studies revealed disrupted actin organization, impaired cell motility, and altered protrusive structures. This study confirms CYFIP2 as a cause of dyskinetic crises and underscores its role in cellular dynamics, broadening the phenotypic spectrum of CYFIP2-related disorders. Early genetic diagnosis and further research are essential to developing targeted therapeutic strategies."

On examination, the child had melanocytic naevi, altered consciousness, right lower facial nerve palsy, pyramidal signs, ataxia and dystonia. Neuroimaging showed communicating hydrocephalus and leptomeningeal enhancements, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing lymphocyte-predominant leucocytosis; hence, the possibility of tuberculous meningitis was considered. The work-up for tuberculosis was unyielding. Anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) was started empirically. Repeat CSF analysis showed atypical pigmentary cells suggestive of melanocytes; hence, ATT was discontinued. In conclusion, the leptomeningeal enhancements and the hydrocephalus masqueraded as the picture of tuberculosis in neurocutaneous melanosis."

    "abstract": "Lingual dystonia is a rare form of focal dystonia involving involuntary, repetitive, and often painful muscle contractions of the tongue, which can lead to abnormal tongue posturing or protrusion, dysarthria, and/or dysphagia. Lingual dysotnia can be primary or secondary to various conditions. The thalamus is a key relay center between the motor cortex and basal ganglia, and damage here can disrupt motor signaling pathways, possibly leading to focal dystonia, like lingual dystonia. Methotrexate (MTX) can cause acute to subacute neurological complications, which are linked with high doses of MTX, while chronic MTX neurotoxicity develops more slowly, resulting in persistent focal neurological deficits. We present a 56-year-old male patient on MTX therapy who developed an isolated lingual dystonia as a chronic presentation of a small infarction in the posterolateral thalamus. The finding of thalamic infarction on brain CT and the lack of clinical improvement in dystonia symptoms after prolonged MTX withdrawal from therapy indicate that lingual dystonia could be directly causally related to thalamic insult, while it is less likely that lingual dystonia is a side effect of MTX therapy. This case provides us with new knowledge in determining the etiology of lingual dystonia in the light of thalamic infarction and MTX neurotoxicity."

We recorded EMG from bilateral sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and biceps (BIC) muscles and EEG over sensorimotor cortex. Theta power, IMC, and corticomuscular coherence (CMC) were analyzed across baseline and touch conditions and correlated with Torticollis Severity Scale (TSS) scores. Granger causality was used to assess the directionality of coherence. patients exhibited increased theta power in SCMs but not in biceps muscles. Theta IMC was significantly higher only between bilateral SCMs in CD compared to HS. We found no group differences in theta CMC, with Granger causality indicating predominant theta connectivity from muscle to cortex. The ST was associated with increased theta IMC between SCMs, while patients without ST showed a significant reduction in IMC. SCM theta power and IMC were both inversely correlated with TSS. increased theta power and IMC in SCMs are specific to CD and likely reflect a subcortical drive rather than a cortical influence. Our results challenge prior suggestions of a pathogenic role for muscle theta synchronization in CD and suggest a possible compensatory role in balancing head position."

A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Studies were selected from PubMed, SCIELO, and the Regional Portal of BVS using defined inclusion criteria, assessing DBS outcomes on motor function, quality of life, and adverse events. The GRADE system evaluated the risk of bias. Of the 11 studies reviewed, 107 patients aged 5 to 26 years were included. Most studies focused on bilateral GPi stimulation, with nine reporting improvements in motor symptoms. However, outcomes varied, with significant benefits observed primarily in younger patients. Complications occurred in 22.4% of patients, predominantly infections and device-related issues. This review showed that GPi DBS can improve motor symptoms and reduce disability in patients with CP, although outcomes are variable and influenced by patient characteristics, such as age. Further large-scale longitudinal studies are necessary to optimize candidate selection and enhance long-term outcomes."

Incidence of antiepileptic initiations, from 10 years before until 10 years after the PD diagnosis, was compared to an age-, sex-, and region-matched cohort without PD.ResultsAntiepileptics were more commonly initiated for persons with PD (29.3% of PD cohort and 15.2% of comparison cohort). Gabapentinoids were the most commonly initiated antiepileptics in both cohorts. A similar pattern in initiation rates was observed for both gabapentinoids and other antiepileptics, with increased incidence in the PD cohort approximately three years before the diagnosis and a significant peak around the time of PD diagnosis (the initiation rate at the time of PD diagnosis 3/100 and 1/100 person-years, for the PD and comparison cohorts, respectively). Clonazepam initiations were more common in the PD cohort (26.7% of initiations vs. 5.8% in the comparison cohort).ConclusionsThe increase in antiepileptic initiation rates before the diagnosis of PD suggests that they might be used for prodromal motor or non-motor symptoms."

    "abstract": "We present a case of a 76-year-old woman diagnosed with pathologically confirmed progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) with pallido-nigral-luysial atrophy, who initially presented with a dropped head. Upon her first visit, neurophysiological and neuroradiological examinations provided no definitive cause, and the tactile trick was effective, leading to a diagnosis of cervical dystonia. Trihexyphenidyl treatment had no effect, but her condition gradually improved over 3 years. By age 74, she developed gait freezing without muscle rigidity or tremor. Dopamine-transporter scintigraphy revealed reduced tracer uptake in the bilateral corpus striata, prompting the diagnosis of pure akinesia with gait freezing (PAGF). At age 76, the patient developed retrocollis, muscle rigidity in all extremities, and recurrent temporomandibular dislocation. She eventually died from aspiration pneumonia after several years of illness. At autopsy, the brain weighed 1,370 ‍g. Macroscopic examination showed atrophy of the pallidum and subthalamic nucleus and depigmentation of the substantia nigra. Histopathological analysis revealed degeneration with 4-repeat tau pathology in the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and subthalamic nucleus, along with tufted astrocytes in the globus pallidus and putamen, confirming a pathological diagnosis of pallido-nigral-luysial atrophy-type PSP. We suggest that the clinical presentation of PAGF correlates well with the pathological findings of pallido-nigral-luysial atrophy. While dystonia in PSP is typically observed in the limbs, blepharospasm, or retrocollis, only two other cases of PSP with a dropped head have been reported. The pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear, but we hypothesize that 4-repeat tau pathology in the globus pallidus may contribute to the development of cervical dystonia. Further neuropathological studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis."

    "abstract": "Urbach-Wiethe syndrome, also known as lipoid proteinosis (LP), is a rare genodermatosis clinically characterized by mucocutaneous lesions, dysphonia with onset in early childhood, and, sometimes, neurological complications. Clinical signs, as well as the severity of the disease, are highly variable, while its course is usually slowly progressive. The typical primary sign is hoarse crying, due to laryngeal infiltration, at birth or during early childhood. Alterations of the skin and mucous membranes develop within the first two years of life. The skin lesions initially appear on the face and limbs and usually resolve by healing. Infiltration of the respiratory system can cause upper respiratory tract infections, hoarseness or aphonia, dysphagia, and even airway obstruction. Dystonia, epileptic seizures, and learning disorders may be observed in affected children. Treatment remains a major challenge since no standardized therapies exist, but oral acitretin appears to be effective in improving skin manifestations. We report two clinical cases of young women suffering from LP, presenting with dermatological, otorhinolaryngological, and neurological symptoms, currently referred to our Rare Cutaneous Syndrome Center at the Policlinico Umberto I in Rome (Italy)."

To provide an updated and integrative review of the clinical, neurobiological, and therapeutic dimensions of FMD, incorporating recent evidence across diagnostic and treatment modalities. We conducted a comprehensive review of the leading studies on FMD, emphasizing the most common clinical presentations: functional tremor, dystonia, myoclonus, parkinsonism, gait disorder, and tics. Drawing on recent evidence, we examined recovery-associated factors and integrated these insights into a structured diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm. FMD primarily affects women and typically presents with tremor, weakness, or mixed motor symptoms. Phenotypic heterogeneity is common; non-motor symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and psychiatric comorbidities contribute to clinical complexity. Neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies reveal salience, interoception, and motor network disruptions, often involving the amygdala, sensorimotor cortex, and temporoparietal junction. Diagnosis relies on positive clinical signs rather than exclusion. A five-phase diagnostic framework is recommended, including neurological examination, patient-centred communication, and multidisciplinary engagement. Treatment requires an individualized approach combining physiotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, neuromodulation, pharmacotherapy, and digital tools. Prognosis varies, but early diagnosis, a strong therapeutic alliance, and patient confidence in recovery improve outcomes. FMD is a multisystem disorder requiring integrated, personalized, and humanized care. Advances in neurobiology and therapeutic modalities offer promise, but unmet needs remain-particularly the development of diagnostic biomarkers, standardized outcome measures, and scalable treatment models."

    "abstract": "Dystonia is a movement disorder causing involuntary muscle contractions and abnormal movements. Often, repeated practice does not lead to motor improvement in children with acquired dystonia, likely due to sensory deficits, which may contribute to their impairment. Therefore, improvement of sensory function might improve motor performance. In this study, we propose that an augmented vibrotactile biofeedback may improve motor learning in children with acquired dystonia, but not in children with genetic dystonia, who do not have associated sensory deficits. To test this hypothesis, we recorded muscle activity and kinematic recordings and computed outcome measures that represent motor skills, during practice of a point-to-point movement and trajectory-following task. We examined the effects of applying vibrotactile biofeedback on dystonic muscles, in healthy children and those with genetic and acquired dystonia. The device significantly improved motor learning in children with acquired dystonia, in the cyclic task only, as evidenced by reduced error and improved task correlation index (<i>p < 0.01</i>), while no significant effects were observed in other groups. Our results show that the vibrotactile device can become an effective method of motor improvement only for cyclic and smooth tasks but not for point-to-point tasks in children with acquired dystonia."

He was diagnosed and followed up with cavernous malformations and chronic cerebral infarctions based on an MRI. However, during the re-evaluation of MRI, lesions with low signal intensity (SI) cores surrounded by high SI rims were observed in bilateral thalami and left subthalamic nucleus on T2-weighted images, which differed from typical cavernous malformations. In addition, symmetrical scarring changes were noted in the frontal lobes and bilateral parietal bones, potentially corresponding to the thalamic and subthalamic nucleus lesions. Upon reviewing medical history, it was revealed that the patient had undergone thalamotomy in 1963 and 1964. The literature review suggested the use of procaine-oil blocking during thalamotomies of that era. Chemical shift imaging was added, and the presence of fat was confirmed in bilateral thalamic lesions with high SI on in-phase and low SI on out-of-phase images. Imaging findings resulting from obsolete treatments can be unfamiliar and mistaken for pathological conditions. Investigating the history of suspected treatments can lead to definitive diagnoses through imaging studies."

Control cohorts were age and sex matched 1:1 with RTT. We utilized the PSTAPLE algorithm to conduct MRI-based anatomic segmentations and quantify global and regional volumetry. A total of 42 subjects (14 per group) were included with mean age 8.0 years ± 6.1 S.D. (range: 1.4-20.7 years). Global and regional brain volumes were compared between groups with analysis of covariance. Intracranial cavity volume was regressed as a variable of interest; the log of age at scan was regressed as a variable of no interest. Global and regional volumes were reduced in RTT (versus DD and TD). Total gray matter was reduced by 19% in RTT (versus TD and DD). Similar volumetric reductions were noted in occipital, parietal, and temporal cortices in RTT (versus TD and DD). Cerebellar white matter was reduced in RTT (3.4%; versus DD only). MRI findings in individuals with RTT demonstrated global reductions in brain volume with relatively uniform involvement of cortical and subcortical structures. Cerebellar white matter volume may be reduced in individuals with RTT (versus DD). These findings underscore the importance of correcting for global volume abnormalities when assessing regional volumetry and suggest that neuroimaging evaluations may distinguish children with RTT from those with idiopathic DD."

The current study aimed to understand rates of loneliness and its determinants in PD. Consecutive cross-sectional sampling resulted in 178 PD subjects (60 % men) across disease stages (86 % early-stage) with gold-standard diagnoses. Loneliness was characterized with two scales, PD was characterized by objective measures, motor ratings, and perceived functional impact, and social-emotional assessment included social connection, depression, and life space. Nonparametric bivariate and robust multivariate regression determined predictors of loneliness in PD, and social-emotional predictors of PD functional impact. Most participants had concern, with 64.6 % endorsing high levels of loneliness. PD stage, but not motor impairment or other objective measures, predicted loneliness. In contrast, subjective measures of PD functional impact, social network size, social support, depression, and life space had a significant relationship with loneliness. In multivariate models, depression, PD functional impact, and social network size specifically emerged as the most important predictors of loneliness. Although social loneliness was generally more impacted by PD, men had more emotional loneliness. Similarly, loneliness was a potent, independent predictor of PD functional impact. We show that loneliness is a critical issue in PD which relates more to individual response to disease than objective motor severity. Although PD most impacts general relationships' quality, men may have additional loss of intimate confidantes. Interventions targeting depression and social networks may not only improve loneliness but also improve PD functional impact."

Out of 60 PD patients, we observed 16 patients displaying de novo dystonic symptoms after the implantation and 11 dystonic PD patients without benefit from the stimulation. We hypothesized that a common neural pathway may cause dystonia in both conditions. Our study aims to investigate the clinical and connectivity substrates of dystonia after STN-DBS. We divided our cohort into four groups: 16 patients displaying dystonia after STN-DBS, 11 patients with previously known dystonia not improving after surgery, 14 patients with dystonic symptoms relieved by the stimulation and 19 controls who never experienced dystonia. MANOVA was used to compare clinical data and the distance of the active contact center from the STN border among the four groups. Finally, we reconstructed the \"sour\" spots for dystonic symptoms and the associated structural and functional connectivity using a Parkinsonian normative connectome. De novo dystonic and not-improved dystonic patients had a statistically significant longer PD duration before surgery (p = 0.001) and a greater active contact-STN distance (p < 0.001). Moreover, the \"sour\" spots were similar in both groups and structural and functional connectivity profiles were associated with brain areas correlated with dystonia pathophysiology (cerebellum, midbrain, parietal and temporal cortices). We formulated a two-hit model for dystonia after STN-DBS: a clinical feature of Parkinsonian patients causes predisposing altered plasticity contributing to dystonic symptoms development when coupled with the stimulation of dystonia-related subcortical and cortical structures."

A 15-question survey was distributed online to clinician members of the American Headache Society (AHS) assessing clinical practices using onabotA and non-onabotA toxins for chronic migraine and comorbid conditions, and descriptive analysis was performed. 168 respondents (162 from the United States and 6 from Canada) completed the survey (response rate 10.1 % [168/1665]). Of 48 respondents (28 % of total) using non-onabotA toxins for chronic migraine, 27 (16 %) used incobotulinum toxin A; 23 (14 %) used abobotulinum toxin A; and 12 (7 %) used rimabotulinum toxin B. Non-onabotA toxins were predominantly used due to administration/payor imposed issues (19/48; 40 %) and cost (18/48 [38 %]). Most clinicians using non-onabotA toxins reported similar efficacy to onabotA (32/48; 67 %), while fewer reported better efficacy (9/48 [19 %]) or worse efficacy (7/48 [15 %]) than onabotA.

    "title": "[Clinical phenotypic and genetic analysis of three children with Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia and Self-limited familial infantile epilepsy caused by PRRT2 gene mutation].",
    "abstract": "To investigate the clinical phenotypic and genetic characteristics of three children with Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) and Self-limited familial infantile epilepsy (SeLIE) caused by PRRT2 gene mutation. Three children with PKD and SeLIE caused by PRRT2 gene mutation (children 1-3) who were treated in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from November 2022 to August 2023 were selected as the research subjects. A retrospective study was conducted to collect the clinical and family history data of the three children. 2 mL of peripheral venous blood from children 1-3 and parents of children 1-2 were collected (parents of children refused to undergo genetic testing and no blood samples were collected), genomic DNA was extracted, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed, and Sanger sequencing method was used for verification. According to the Classification Standards and Guidelines for Genetic Variants formulated by the American Society of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) (hereinafter referred to as the \"ACMG Guidelines\"), the pathogenicity of the variant loci detected in three children was rated, and the detrimental loci of the variant loci were analyzed by multiple bioinformatics software. This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (Ethics No. 2024-KY-0881-002). The clinical data and genetic test results of the three children in this study are as follows. Child 1: female, age of onset of 4 months and 10 days, with seizures, manifested as sudden cessation of movements, staring in both eyes, cyanosis of the lips, paleness, and stiffness and shaking of limbs. The results of genetic testing showed that child 1 had maternal PRRT2 gene c.583_584dup (p.P196Afs*34) frameshift variant, which was rated as a pathogenic variant (PVS1 PM2_Supporting PP4) according to ACMG guidelines. According to the clinical manifestations and genetic test results of child 1, he was diagnosed with SeLIE and took oral sodium valproate [0.5 mL/(kg.d)], and was still taking medication at the follow-up of 2 years old, and did not have seizures again after 5 months of age. Child 2: male, age of onset of 10 years old, manifested as dystonia after sudden movement. The results of genetic testing showed that child 2 had PRRT2 gene mutations: paternal c.649dupC (p.R217Pfs*8) frameshift variant and maternal c.445C>A (p.Q149K) mutation. Among them, c.649dupC was a reported pathogenic variant, and according to ACMG guidelines, c.445C>A variant was rated as a variant of unknown clinical significance (PM2_Supporting), with a high probability of benignness. According to the clinical manifestations and genetic test results of the child 2, he was diagnosed with PKD, and was followed up with oral oxcarbazepine 9 mg/(kg.d) until 12 years and 2 months, and was still on the drug, and there was no recurrence of the seizure of the form of dyskinesia after taking the drug. Child 3: male, age of onset of 11 years old, manifested by dystonia after sudden exercise. The results of genetic testing showed that child 3 had a missense variant of PRRT2 gene c.904G>C (p.D302H), and his parents refused genetic testing, and the source of the mutation was unknown, and the variant was rated as a variant of unknown clinical significance (PM2_Supporting+PP3_Moderate+PP4) according to ACMG guidelines. According to the clinical manifestations and genetic test results of child 3, he was diagnosed with PKD, and was treated with oral oxcarbazepine 10 mg/(kg.d) for 1 year and then discontinued on his own, and was followed up at the age of 17, and there was no recurrence of the seizure of the form of movement disorder after taking the drug. One case of SeLIE and two cases of PKD caused by PRRT2 gene mutations responded well to anti-seizure drugs. In this study, four variant loci of PRRT2 gene were found: c.583_584dup, c.904G>C, c.649dupC, c.445C>A, among which c.583_584dup were new variants, enriching the variant spectrum of PRRT2 gene."

    "title": "Abnormal Brain Iron Metabolism is Linked to Altered Neural Function in Isolated Laryngeal Dystonia.",
    "abstract": "Laryngeal dystonia (LD) is an isolated focal dystonia causing involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles that selectively impair speech production. LD is characterized as a functional and structural neural network disorder; however, the mechanistic aspects of network dysfunction in dystonia remain unknown. We hypothesized that iron-induced abnormal metabolic processes may underlie microstructural neuronal damage, contributing to altered neural activity within the dystonic network and, subsequently, the development of the dystonic state. We used 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ultra-high field resolution for quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) of iron content, multi-echo multi-band resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) of brain activity and functional connectivity, positron emission tomography with [<sup>11</sup>C]flumazenil radioligand of GABA<sub>A</sub> neuroreceptor availability, and immunohistochemistry of postmortem brain tissue to investigate iron metabolism in LD patients and healthy controls. The QSM analysis found increased iron content in primary sensorimotor and premotor cortices, inferior frontal, middle frontal, and middle temporal gyri, middle cingulate cortex, superior and inferior parietal lobules, insula, putamen, and cerebellum. Histopathology substantiated the neuroimaging findings by showing focal clusters of iron precipitates in these regions. Increased iron content in the supplementary motor area and middle cingulate cortex was associated with altered neural activity, while increased iron in the middle cingulate cortex, premotor cortex, and putamen had associations with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor availability in LD patients. Abnormal iron accumulations are likely to contribute to the imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory signaling within the dystonic neural network, leading to altered network dynamics that ultimately contribute to LD development. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."

    "title": "Practical management of repeated life-threatening status epilepticus in Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood: Case report and literature review.",
    "abstract": "Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC) is a severe channelopathy that manifests before 18 months of age, primarily caused by pathogenic variants in the ATP1A3 gene. It is characterized by recurrent and disabling episodes of plegia, dystonia, dysautonomia, along with chronic neurological features and cardiac arrhythmias. About 50% of AHC patients have epilepsy, and a subset of them may develop refractory or super-refractory status epilepticus. Currently, there are no specific available therapeutic guidelines, particularly for managing life-threatening paroxysmal and epileptic episodes in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). This report aims to illustrate a comprehensive treatment approach and clinical management of a young boy with AHC and multiple episodes of super-refractory status epilepticus throughout his lifetime. The patient was diagnosed with AHC at the age of 6 months, carrying the most severe ATP1A3 gene mutation-p.Glu815Lys. Epileptic seizures started at 24 months of age, and after a relatively stable clinical course, he experienced a first super-refractory status epilepticus at the age of 16. Subsequently, he presented two additional episodes of status epilepticus and faced progressive neurological deterioration until death at the age of 20. AHC management is a substantial challenge due to the coexistence of multiple paroxysmal events, epilepsy, chronic neurological impairments, and the possibility of cardiac abnormalities, including short QTc or cardiac rhythm complications. Tailored treatment and deep knowledge of this complex disease are imperative for effective management."

    "abstract": "The generation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons overcomes limited access to human tissues and offers an unprecedented approach to modeling motor neuron diseases such as dystonia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Motor neurons generated through different strategies may exhibit substantial differences in purity, maturation, characterization, and even neuronal identity, leading to variable outcomes in disease modeling and drug screening. However, very few comparative studies have been conducted to determine the similarities and differences among motor neurons prepared via different protocols. In this study, we prepared human induced pluripotent stem cell-motor neurons via lentiviral delivery of transcription factors and chemical induction and performed a systematic comparative analysis. We found that motor neurons generated by both approaches showed typical motor neuron morphology and robustly expressed motor neuron-specific markers, such as nuclear homeobox transcription factor 9 and choline acetyltransferase. The chemical induction protocol utilizes a combination of small molecules to induce motor neuron differentiation, offering a significantly faster maturation time of 35 days compared to 46 days with lentiviral delivery of transcription factors. Additionally, while lentiviral delivery of transcription factors are suitable for downstream biochemical analysis, chemical induction are more applicable for therapeutic approaches as they avoid the use of lentiviruses. Both approaches produce motor neurons with high purity (> 95%) and yield. No significant differences were found between chemical induction and lentiviral delivery of transcription factors in terms of motor neuron markers and maturation markers. These robust methodologies offer researchers powerful tools for investigating motor neuron diseases and potential therapeutic strategies."

    "title": "Development and Preliminary Validation of a Parkinsonism-Dystonia Scale for Infants and Young Children.",
    "abstract": "Parkinsonism in infancy is rare and is highly correlated with the presence of dystonia. Advances in treating and characterizing developmental and infantile degenerative parkinsonism have highlighted the need for a specialized assessment scale. The aim of this study was to design and validate a scale that effectively assesses parkinsonism-dystonia in early life. The Infantile Parkinsonism-Dystonia Rating Scale (IPDRS) was designed to capture the key clinical features of parkinsonism-dystonia in early life. It consists of 28 items across three subscales: Non-motor symptoms, Motor symptoms, and Dyskinesias. Thirty-two patients with hypokinetic movement disorder were scored following a standardized protocol. Filmed motor examinations were analyzed independently by three pediatric movement disorders specialists to evaluate interrater reliability. Twenty additional patients with primary neurotransmitter disorders were scored, and nine of them were evaluated at baseline and after treatment. Psychometric validation was conducted. A total of 52 patients were scored using the IPDRS. Mean age was 3.1 years (standard deviation [SD]: 2.0), and the mean IPDRS score was 40.8 (SD: 13.17). Internal consistency analysis demonstrated a Cronbach's α of 0.21 for Non-motor symptoms subscale, 0.84 for Motor symptoms subscale, and 0.95 for Dyskinesia subscale. Kappa indexes exceeded 0.70 in seven items. Correlation coefficients for dystonia items with the Barry-Albright-Dystonia Scale ranged from 0.46 to 0.64. After treatment, all IPDRS scores changed significantly, with an effect size of 2.42. The IPDRS appears to be a reliable and valid tool for assessing parkinsonism in early life. Further validation studies with a larger sample size are needed to confirm these findings and complete the validation process. © 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "The Movement Disorders Society recommends the DYT/PARK prefix for genes where dystonia and parkinsonism are prominent in approximately half or more of patients. This systematic review explores the genotype-phenotype correlations of <i>GLB1</i>, <i>SLC6A3</i>, <i>SLC30A10</i>, <i>PLA2G6</i>, and <i>SLC39A14</i>-recently classified as DYT <i>SLC39A14</i> and historically linked to dystonia-parkinsonism. We searched PubMed and the Human Gene Mutation Database using standardized terms, including English-language, peer-reviewed publications up to February 2024. Following the MDSGene protocol, we extracted individual-level data on patients with biallelic pathogenic variants and at least one movement disorder. Features were marked \"missing\" if not explicitly reported. Of 1828 articles, 128 were eligible. We identified 386 patients and 262 variants. The median age at onset was 3 years for <i>GLB1</i>, 3 months for <i>SLC6A3</i>, 2.5 years for <i>SLC30A10</i>, 1.5 years for <i>SLC39A14</i>, and 16 years for <i>PLA2G6</i>. Missing data may reflect underreporting of negative findings. Case reports/serie, may bias toward atypical presentations. Our analysis showed dystonia-parkinsonism predominates in <i>SLC6A3</i> and <i>PLA2G6</i>, while <i>GLB1</i>, <i>SLC30A10</i>, and <i>SLC39A1</i> show predominantly dystonic phenotypes with a low frequency of parkinsonism. Ataxia was common in <i>GLB1</i> and <i>PLA2G6</i>. Awareness of these phenotypes is essential for early diagnosis and intervention, particularly in treatable conditions like <i>SLC30A10</i> or <i>SLC39A14</i>. The predominantly dystonic phenotype in <i>GLB1</i>, <i>SLC30A10</i>, and <i>SLC39A14</i> suggest that the DYT prefix may be more appropriate, highlighting the need to reconsider their nomenclature, and the importance of systematic reviews."

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an efficient treatment for movement disorders, most commonly Parkinson's Disease (PD), dystonia and essential tremor. DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead."

Meanwhile, movement disorders associated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis are usually chorea and dystonia, with peripheral nerve damage being rare. We present a case of anti-NMDAR encephalitis with motor aphasia as the first symptom. The patient, a 16-year-old female, was admitted to the hospital with further progression of the disease, complicated by grand mal seizures with peripheral nerve damage. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The patient accepted first-line therapy, including methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin shock therapy, rituximab second-line treatment (rituximab), and third-line therapies (mycophenolate mofetil), as well as efgartigimod as an additional therapy. After 6 weeks of comprehensive treatment, the patient's muscle strength in both lower limbs recovered, and the psychiatric symptoms and seizures improved. This case broadens the range of clinical symptoms of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, and we should recognize that motor aphasia may also be one of the first symptoms in adolescent patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. What's more, efgartigimod may be a promising treatment for patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis."

Here, we report the first case of a patient with frontal lobe infarction presenting with unique dystonic hand postures-specifically, a pointing gun posture and full-finger extension posture-in combination with frontal release signs. A 68-year-old man with a prior diagnosis of probable Parkinson disease acutely developed speech and communication impairment, along with reduced voluntary motor function in the right lower extremity. Neurological examination revealed apathy, motor and sensory aphasia, and flaccid paralysis of the right lower limb. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed an ischemic stroke involving the left superior frontal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, and corpus callosum. Dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography revealed reduced tracer accumulation in the left striatum. Ten days after stroke onset, the patient exhibited a pointing gun posture in the right hand. A repeat neurological examination revealed a grasp reflex. Removing grasped objects led to a transient index finger extension with flexion of the other fingers or a transient full extension of all fingers. The former resembled a pointing gun posture, while the latter, a newly described phenomenon, was termed the full-finger extension posture. In addition, groping movements with the pointing gun posture were observed. Atypical frontal release signs, including the pointing gun posture and full-finger extension posture, may reflect specific thalamocortical excitation resulting from a combination of contralateral striatal dopaminergic denervation and frontal lobe infarction involving the supplementary motor area."

    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is a disorder of copper metabolism due to variants in the <i>ATP7B</i> gene. This autosomal recessively inherited disorder is characterized by the accumulation of copper in various body parts, mainly the liver, brain, and kidneys. Initially, WD was described to involve the hepatic and neurological systems. Subsequently, diverse presentations have been reported with skeletal and hematological manifestations and various constellations of symptoms. Neurological manifestations of WD are varied, ranging from asymptomatic neurological state to refractory dystonia. Earlier, the diagnosis was based only on measuring serum ceruloplasmin levels, urinary copper levels, and imaging. Advanced genetic testing has provided an additional mode of diagnosis in the patient, screening of the family members and, a way to better understand the genotype-phenotype associations of the disease if there are any. In the last few decades, the treatment of WD has evolved from symptomatic treatment and chelation therapy to many new advanced measures for both copper chelation and symptomatic relief. With a better understanding of the genetic aspects of WD in recent years, there has been more focus on gene therapy, novel therapies targeting ATP7B genes, and therapies targeting mutant proteins to prevent copper accumulation. This article highlights the advances in diagnostic methods and treatment modalities in WD."

    "abstract": "To evaluate effect of long-term BTA treatment on cervical dystonia (CD) symptoms control and patient satisfaction with botulinum therapy in real life setting. A total of 1050 patients took part in the international observational study INTEREST IN CD2, the analysis included data from 995 patients (overall population), of which 56 patients were enrolled In Russia. CD clinical assessment was performed at baseline and on the days of BTA injections using the TWSTRS scale and tremor component of the Tsui scale. Patient satisfaction with CD symptoms control was evaluated using 5-point Likert scale on the day of the visit (today satisfaction) and the highest level of satisfaction at any time since the last BTA injection (highest satisfaction). This article presents the results of the analysis of the Russian subgroup of patients in comparison with the overall study population. In 5 Russian investigational sites, 44 (78.6%) women and 12 (21.4%) men were enrolled in the study; the patients' mean age was 51.1±9.6 years, the mean duration of the disease was 7.3±5.6 years. The baseline characteristics of the Russian patients were comparable to the overall population, but severity of CD symptoms was numerically higher in the Russian subgroup: the mean TWSTRS severity scores were 17.4±5.0 and 15.9±5.7, respectively; segmental dystonia was observed more frequently (14.3% and 7.4% of patients), as well as shoulder elevation (73.2% and 50.5%) and jerk (21.4% and 9.6%). The vast majority of Russian patients (82.1%) received treatment with abobotulinumtoxin (Dysport). In the Russian subgroup, higher doses of Dysport (median doses 800.0 U and 500.0 U), larger number of targeted muscles (4.3±1.5 and 3.5±1.5) and injection points (11.7±5.5 and 8.1±5.0) were used compared to the overall population. In the Russian subgroup, the mean TWSTRS total score (assessed at the end of each injection cycle) decreased from 32.3±11.2 to 25.2±15.7 over the 3 years follow-up; there was also decrease in severity score from 17.4±5.0 to 12.6±7.5 and disability score from 9.8±4.0 to 7.4±4.8, comparable to the overall population. Patients' satisfaction with CD symptoms control at peak of the BTA injection effect increased from 92.5% to 98.1% and was higher than in the overall population. At the end of the treatment cycle, patients' satisfaction was consistently lower than at peak effect. The results of the Russian subgroup analysis showed a high level of long-term effectiveness of botulinum therapy in controlling CD symptoms and patients' satisfaction with treatment in real clinical practice. Dysport is the most frequently used BTA preparation In Russia, the optimal level of effectiveness with repeated injections of Dysport remains stable and is maintained within the framework of real-life practice, which supports the clinical guidelines recommendations of its use as the drug of choice in the treatment of patients with CD."

    "abstract": "AGTPBP1 regulates microtubule stabilization through post-translational modification of alpha-tubulin. Mutations in the AGTPBP1 gene are associated with clinical phenotypes such as early postnatal cerebellar atrophy, ataxia, spasticity, and dystonia, highlighting its critical roles in both neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. However, how AGTPBP1 affects neurite development and its function in dopaminergic neurons remains unclear. To investigate the role of AGTPBP1, we utilized both in vitro AGTPBP1 knockout (KO) cell models and zebrafish models. Our findings reveal that AGTPBP1 KO in cells leads to excessive neurite outgrowth and significantly increases expression of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2). Additionally, AGTPBP1 KO results in mitochondrial dysfunction and a hyperdopaminergic state in differentiated neurons. In zebrafish, knockdown of AGTPBP1 caused reduced brain volume and impaired swimming behavior, indicating disrupted neurodevelopment and motor function. Given CRMP2's involvement in both cytoskeletal dynamics and mitochondrial activity, we tested lacosamide, a drug known to modulate CRMP2 expression and phosphorylation. Lacosamide treatment in vitro improved cell morphology and restored mitochondrial function, while in vivo, it rescued brain volume deficits and enhanced swimming performance in AGTPBP1-deficient zebrafish. In conclusion, AGTPBP1 knockout impairs neuronal differentiation, induces mitochondrial dysfunction, increases oxidative stress, and promotes a hyperdopaminergic state. Our study suggests that elevated CRMP2 expression may underlie the pathophysiology of cerebellar degeneration in AGTPBP1-related disorders. Targeting CRMP2 with lacosamide represents a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating AGTPBP1-mediated neurodegeneration."

    "abstract": "Dystonia, characterized by repetitive twisting movements or abnormal postures, has been linked to the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). However, the specific roles of distinct neuronal populations within the DCN in driving dystonic behaviors remain unclear. This study explores the contributions of three distinct groups of DCN neurons in an animal model of paroxysmal dystonia harboring a mutation in the proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (<i>Prrt2</i>) gene. We observed sustained calcium activity elevation across glutamatergic, glycinergic, and GABAergic inferior olive (IO)-projecting neurons within the DCN during episodes of dystonia in <i>Prrt2</i>-mutant mice. However, only the optogenetic activation of DCN glutamatergic neurons, but not glycinergic or GABAergic IO-projecting neurons, elicited dystonia-like behaviors in normal mice. Selective ablation of DCN glutamatergic neurons effectively eliminated aberrant cerebellar DCN outputs and alleviated dystonia attacks in both <i>Prrt2</i>-associated and kainic acid-induced dystonia mouse models. Collectively, our findings highlight the pivotal role of aberrant activation of DCN glutamatergic neurons in the neuropathological mechanisms underlying cerebellar-originated dystonia."

    "abstract": "Lingual dystonia, a type of oromandibular focal dystonia, involves sustained tongue contractions, often causing protrusion during actions such as speaking or chewing. It is classified as either primary or secondary, depending on the underlying cause. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is a recognized treatment for focal dystonias, including lingual dystonia. However, precise administration of BoNT can be challenging, limiting its efficacy and potentially causing adverse effects. This review focuses on selecting target muscles and using ultrasound guidance for accurate BoNT administration. Using ultrasound, with or without electromyography, a submental injection approach is employed to target the genioglossus and hyoglossus muscles, which are most affected in lingual dystonia. The suprahyoid muscles are critical anatomical considerations during submental injections to avoid aspiration. Additionally, as drooling is a common symptom of lingual dystonia, BoNT injections into the submandibular glands are also discussed. A case series with X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism was our way to clinically demonstrate BoNT injections in those with severe lingual dystonias."

    "abstract": "Dystonia is a movement disorder with varied clinical features and diverse etiologies. Here we present a revision of the 2013 consensus definition and classification of dystonia in light of subsequent publications and experience with its application during the last decade. A panel of movement disorder specialists with expertise in dystonia reviewed the original document and proposed some revision. There was broad consensus to retain the definition of dystonia with only minor clarifications to the wording. Dystonia is defined as a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent abnormal movements, postures, or both. Dystonic movements and postures are typically patterned and repetitive and may be tremulous or jerky. They are often initiated or worsened by voluntary action and frequently associated with overflow movements. The two-axis structure for classification of the many different presentations of dystonia was also retained, with some revision. Axis I summarizes key clinical characteristics of dystonia, including age at onset, family history, body distribution, temporal dimensions, phenomenology, and whether dystonia is isolated or combined with other neurological or medical problems. Axis II organizes information regarding its etiological basis, including genetic, acquired, and anatomical, and common disease mechanisms. This consensus provides an update to the original definition and classification of dystonia with the aim of facilitating its clinical recognition and management. The revision retains the essence of the original proposal and aims particularly to provide a structure facilitating a uniform implementation. © 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Evaluation of movement disorders primarily relies on phenomenology. Despite refinements in diagnostic criteria, the accuracy remains suboptimal. Such a gap may be bridged by machine learning and video technology, which permit objective, quantitative, non-invasive motor analysis. Markerless automated video-analysis, namely Computer Vision, emerged as best suited for ecologically-valid assessment. To systematically review the application of Computer Vision for assessment, diagnosis, and monitoring of movement disorders. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we searched Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases for articles published between 1984 and September 2024. We used the following search strategy: (\"video analysis\" OR \"computer vision\") AND (\"Parkinson's disease\" OR \"PD\" OR \"tremor\" OR \"dystonia\" OR \"parkinsonism\" OR \"progressive supranuclear palsy\" OR \"PSP\" OR \"multiple system atrophy\" OR \"MSA\" OR \"corticobasal syndrome\" OR \"CBS\" OR \"chorea\" OR \"ballism\" OR \"myoclonus\" OR \"Tourette's syndrome\"). Out of 1099 identified studies, 61 met inclusion criteria, and 10 additional studies were included based on authors' judgment. Parkinson's disease was the most investigated movement disorder, with gait as the prevalent motor task. OpenPose was the most used pose estimation software. Automated video-analysis consistently achieved diagnostic accuracies exceeding 80% across most movement disorders. For tremor, dystonia severity and tic detection, Computer Vision strongly aligned with accelerometery and clinical assessments. Computer Vision holds potential to provide non-invasive quantification of presence and severity of movement disorders. Heterogeneity in video settings, software usage, and definition of standardized guidelines for videorecording are challenges to be addressed for real-word applications."

    "title": "Pallidal Deep Brain Stimulation Enhances Habitual Behavior in a Neuro-Computational Basal Ganglia Model During a Reward Reversal Learning Task.",
    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) within the basal ganglia is a widely used therapeutic intervention for neurological disorders; however, its precise mechanisms of action remain unclear. This study investigates how DBS may affect decision-making processes through computational modeling of the basal ganglia. A rate-coded model incorporating direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways was utilized alongside a cortico-thalamic shortcut known for promoting habitual behavior. Simulations of a two-choice reward reversal learning task were conducted to replicate data from patients with dystonia in ON and OFF DBS conditions. We demonstrate that plasticity in the cortico-thalamic shortcut, which bypasses the basal ganglia, is crucial for reproducing the patients' behavioral data, emphasizing the role of habit formation. Simulated DBS increased habitual behavior following reward reversal. Integrating different DBS mechanisms revealed that suppression of stimulated neurons, stimulation of efferent axons, and a combined variant promoted habitual behavior. Analyses of thalamic inputs showed that, despite differing effects on the model's activity and plasticity, these DBS variants consistently reduced the influence of the basal ganglia while enhancing the role of the cortico-thalamic shortcut. Notably, the DBS variants were distinguishable by their divergent behavioral effects following discontinued stimulation. These findings underscore the potential multifaceted effects of DBS on decision-making processes. In particular, our model proposes that DBS modulates the balance between reward-guided and habitual behavior."

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with disrupted neural activity in the substantia nigra, but its electrophysiological changes remain underexplored. This study investigates the oscillatory patterns of substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) in PD, compared to dystonia (DT). Intraoperative recordings of the SNr were obtained from 20 PD and 16 DT patients during DBS surgery. Spectral power, neuronal firing rate, beta burst dynamics, and correlation analysis of the SNr signal were analyzed. PD patients exhibited increased alpha and beta power, elevated firing rates, and reduced aperiodic exponent values in SNr compared to DT. PD beta bursts showed prolonged durations and fewer short bursts. Beta power negatively correlated with motor symptom improvement rates in PD but not in DT patients. These findings highlight pathological beta power in SNr of PD, which indicates that SNr-DBS may offer a future therapeutic avenue for PD."

    "title": "[Rarely occurring or rarely diagnosed? Spasmodic dysphonia].",
    "abstract": "Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is a rare, chronic voice disorder characterized by involuntary spasms of the laryngeal muscles, leading to disrupted voice quality. The disorder is classified as a type of focal dystonia. The laryngeal spasms cause the voice to break, tremble, or sound strained and can manifest as adductor SD, which results in a tight, strangled voice, or abductor SD, which produces a breathy, whisper-like sound. The precise etiology of spasmodic dysphonia remains unclear, but it is believed to have a neurological basis, often associated with abnormalities in the central nervous system. Patients with SD typically experience a significant impact on communication and quality of life, as the condition can make speaking effortful and socially challenging. The diagnosis is based on a thorough medical history, voice assessment, and clinical-endoscopic examination. While there is no cure for SD, treatment options focus on symptom management. The most common intervention is the injection of botulinum toxin A (Botox) into the affected laryngeal muscles, temporarily reducing muscle overactivity and improving voice quality. Other therapeutic approaches include voice therapy and, in some cases, surgical procedures, although these may offer varying degrees of efficacy."

    "abstract": "Hypermanganesaemia with Dystonia 1 and 2 (HMNDYT1 and 2) are inherited, autosomal recessive disorders caused by pathogenic variants in the genes encoding the manganese transporters SLC30A10 and SLC39A14, respectively. Impaired hepatic and enterocytic manganese uptake (SLC39A14) and excretion (SLC30A10) lead to deposition of manganese in the basal ganglia resulting in childhood-onset dystonia-parkinsonism. HMNDYT1 is characterized by additional features due to manganese accumulation in the liver causing cirrhosis, polycythaemia, and depleted iron stores. High blood manganese levels and pathognomonic MRI brain appearances of manganese deposition resulting in T1 hyperintensity of the basal ganglia are diagnostic clues. Treatment is limited to chelation therapy and iron supplementation that can prevent disease progression. Due to their rarity, the awareness of the inherited manganese transporter defects is limited. Here, we provide consensus expert recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with HMNDYT1 and 2 in order to facilitate early diagnosis and optimize clinical outcome. These recommendations were developed through an evidence and consensus-based process led by a group of 13 international experts across the disciplines of metabolic medicine, neurology, hematology, genetics, and radiology, and address the clinical presentation, diagnostic investigations, principles of treatment, and monitoring of patients with HMNDYT1 and 2."

People with AS often exhibit multiple types of abnormal movements, including nonepileptic myoclonus, tremor, and dystonia, which hamper attempts to identify phenomenology and appropriate treatments. We sought to better clarify movement disorder phenomenology in AS to aid in diagnostic clarity and treatment identification. Caregivers of people with AS completed a survey focused on abnormal movements in AS and submitted video examples of the movements, when possible. The video data were evaluated by a team of 10 movement disorder experts. Survey data were obtained for 47 subjects, of whom 20 had accompanying video data; 33% of subjects reported 3 or more abnormal movements, complicating the evaluation of the survey data. Expert review of video data demonstrated 9 people with myoclonus, 9 with dystonia, and 3 with tremor. Five people had both myoclonus and dystonia, and 1 had both tremor and dystonia. Three people demonstrated stereotypy, one of which also had a focal seizure. Dystonia onset averaged 18.1 years. Fever, constipation, and menses were the most notable triggers. According to caregivers, only 4 treatments, clonazepam, diazepam, lorazepam, and trihexyphenidyl, resulted in improvement in dystonic symptoms. These data reinforce that dystonia is a common finding in people with AS, often in combination with myoclonus. The identification of both isolated dystonia and myoclonic dystonia in people with AS may suggest therapeutic options that heretofore may not have been widely considered."

To date, none of the KIF5A variants was linked with dystonia. This study presents the first family with autosomal-dominant dystonia exhibiting incomplete penetrance, potentially linked to a KIF5A variant. Seven family members were recruited between 2017 and 2024. Detailed medical history and neurological examination were conducted for all. Genetic screening, including Sanger sequencing, MLPA analysis of SGCE, and PCR RFLP/BseRI for the common dystonia TOR1A mutation (c.907-909del), followed by whole exome sequencing, was performed on the proband and one affected relative. The genetic status of the remaining five individuals was assessed with Sanger sequencing. A missense variant in the KIF5A c.118G > A was found in four affected and one asymptomatic individual, while it was absent in two non-affected individuals. The variant is rare in the general population (0.00001 in gnomAD 4.0), affects a highly conserved amino acid, and in silico models (M-CAP) indicates it is pathogenic. It was classified as likely pathogenic per ACMG criteria (PM1, PM2, PP2, PP3). Our study suggests that KIF5A could represent a potential dystonia gene and sheds light on the broader role of motor proteins in human health and disease. This further expands the phenotypes associated with KIF5A and highlights the importance for clinicians to include this variant in their screening panels, as it tends to be underrepresented in current databases."

    "abstract": "Racial and ethnic disparities in utilization of functional neurosurgical procedures have been extensively documented. However, few studies have focused on the differences between Hispanic and non-Hispanic White populations in regions with high representation of both groups. Given the large Hispanic population within our hospital's catchment area, we aimed to compare the utilization of functional neurosurgery between the Hispanic and White populations in our practice. We conducted a retrospective review of patients undergoing functional neurosurgery procedures from 2017 to 2024 at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Rates of epilepsy, pain, and movement disorder procedures were compared by ethnicity, focusing on Hispanic vs non-Hispanic White populations. Correlations with age, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, income, insurance status, distance from the treatment center, and complications were examined. A total of 750 procedures were performed among 702 patients. Deep brain stimulation accounted for 27.73% of procedures, spinal cord stimulation for 35.87%, epilepsy surgery for 22.53%, and intrathecal pump placement for 13.7%. Among the included patients, 43.3% were treated for chronic pain, 22.5% for epilepsy, 18.1% for Parkinson's disease, 4.8% for essential tremor, 2.3% for spasticity, 0.9% for dystonia, and 8.0% for other/unknown diagnoses. Regarding ethnicity, 74.3% of our cohort identified as non-Hispanic White, 18.1% as Hispanic, and 7.6% as other or unknown ethnicity. Hispanic patients were significantly underrepresented relative to Southern Arizona demographics (χ<sup>2</sup> [1, n = 693] = 280.38, p < 0.0001, ϕ=0.64). This disparity was consistent and significant across all procedure types. Significant differences in five-year median inflation-adjusted household income were observed between Hispanic and White non-Hispanic groups (Welch t-test [n = 693] = 5.79, p < 0.0001, Cohen d = 0.53). Cluster analysis revealed four distinct clusters based on multiple predictors, and multinomial regression identified several significant predictors of undergoing each procedure type. Functional procedures are underutilized among Hispanic patients in Southern Arizona, with disparities associated with age, income, and distance from the treatment center."

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is well suited to target disorders with network dysregulation, as is the case in many neuropsychiatric diseases. While DBS is a well-established therapy for Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia, and medically refractory epilepsy, it is actively being studied in clinical trials for neuropsychiatric disorders including treatment-refractory major depressive disorder (MDD). Due to the nature of symptomology and participant characteristics, special care must be taken in the design and implementation of clinical trials testing DBS for neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, these studies typically include multi-year relationships between participants and study staff with frequent interactions, high burden of study activities on participants, and disclosure by participants of sensitive information related to symptoms and disease state. Through our experience with six participants across more than 5 years of the Presidio clinical trial assessing personalized closed-loop DBS for treatment-refractory MDD, we have gathered experience and evidence to inform best practices for conducting these interaction-intensive clinical studies in a vulnerable population. Here, we present these Key Practices along with discussion, informed by multiple fundamental principles: The Belmont Report; emotional and physical safety for study participants and staff; and integrity and validity of scientific outcomes."

We performed genetic analysis, functional studies including Western blot and immunocytochemistry, and urinary sepiapterin measurements in a Chinese patient presenting with levodopa-responsive dystonia and parkinsonism. We identified a novel homozygous mutation (c.380 A > T, p.N127I) in the SPR gene. Functional studies demonstrated reduced expression of the mutant protein while maintaining normal subcellular localization, confirming its pathogenicity. Additionally, we detected elevated urinary sepiapterin levels in this patient, who represents the oldest documented case receiving levodopa treatment. This study not only expands the genetic spectrum of SRD but also validates the utility of urinary sepiapterin as a reliable, non-invasive diagnostic biomarker, even in older treated patients."

'Gastrointestinal dystonia' (GID) has been applied by clinicians when symptoms become debilitating and potentially life-limiting.

We performed a systematic review, created an online survey and distributed this to a panel of 27 experts from five stakeholder groups from 13 UK specialist centres across the British Isles (gastroenterology, neurology/neurodisability, surgery, palliative care and allied health professionals). A Disagreement Index ≥1 indicated disagreement. The panel rated the appropriateness of 250 statements covering the following in GID: definition, clinical evaluation, nutritional assessment/feeding strategies, investigations, medications and prescribing, surgical interventions, safeguarding, palliative care and ethics. Agreement was reached except in selected statements regarding uncommon diagnostic features. There was uncertainty in specific clinical scenarios regarding: investigation, the use of blenderised diet, certain pharmacological agents and surgical interventions. The only intervention deemed inappropriate was antireflux surgery in the context of GID and gastrointestinal dysmotility without reflux disease. The remaining statements (198) were considered appropriate. We present a comprehensive review, agreement on the definition of GID and recommendations on management pathways agreed by a selected panel of multidisciplinary experts. Clear diagnostic criteria will enable important epidemiological work to record outcomes for this complex patient group. Identifying the associated morbidity, burden of care and mortality will help advocate for appropriate health resources and support to carers and families."

Some mutations in the human <i>hTPH2</i> gene are associated with psychopathologies and resistance to antidepressant therapy. The C1473G polymorphism in the mouse <i>Tph2</i> gene decreases the TPH2 activity in the mouse brain. In the present paper, B6-1473C and B6-1473G congenic mice that were different only in the C > G substitution were used. The molecular mechanism of decrease in the mutant enzyme activity and some physiological and behavioral traits affected by this mutation were revealed for the first time. Analysis of thermal denaturation curves in vitro revealed that the C > G substitution reduces the free energy of denaturation, stability and lifetime of mutant TPH2. Later, we evaluated the effect of the 1473G allele on the hierarchical state, competition for a sexual partner in adult mice, mouse embryos, hind legs dystonia and the response to LPS treatment in young mice. No effect of this mutation on the hierarchical state and competition for a female was observed in adult males. The C > G substitution does not affect survival, body mass or the TPH activity in the brain of 19-day-old mouse embryos. At the same time, we found that the 1473G allele causes hind legs dystonia in juvenile (3 weeks old) mice, which can affect their escape capability in threatening situations. Moreover, a significant increase in the vulnerability to LPS in juvenile B6-1473G males was shown: a single ip LPS administration killed about 40% of young mutant mice, but not wild-type ones. The body mass of mutant males was lower compared to wild-type ones, which also can indirectly decrease their concurrent and reproductive success."

Five potentially treatable disorders were identified, and treatment was initiated in three families, showing satisfactory responses, particularly in dopa-responsive dystonias. Our study contributes four additional genes-CYP27A1, NDUFAF3, FUCA1, and FIG4-to the list of genes associated with complex dystonia. Exome sequencing proved crucial in diagnosing the etiology of dystonia, identifying treatable forms, and aiding genetic counseling.

In this case, a 59 year-old woman with a longstanding misdiagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy was ultimately diagnosed with <i>ADCY5</i>-RD following video EEG. She had been followed for paroxysmal episodes of nonvoluntary movements mostly occurring during sleep since 2 years of age. She also exhibited continuous progressive dysarthria and axial hypotonia. Episodic orofacial dystonia was present as well. For 57 years, these symptoms had been treated with various combinations of antiseizure medications. However, the diagnosis was reconsidered when prolonged video-EEG monitoring recorded sleep-onset nonepileptic events, starting during N1 and N2 stages of NREM sleep. Genetic testing of <i>ADCY5</i> confirmed the diagnosis. Caffeine and progressive withdrawal of antiseizure medications except clonazepam resulted in clinical improvement in paroxysms, which became less intense and less frequent. Given that <i>ADCY5</i>-RD was first described in 2012, there may be more adult patients misdiagnosed in childhood. Thus, we recommend considering alternative diagnosis for adult patients with paroxysmal sleep-related events to detect <i>ADCY</i>5-RD in adults.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of DaTscan on diagnostic decisions regarding movement disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes, under real-world circumstances in Greece. <b>Methods</b>: We retrospectively analyzed data from 360 patients who underwent a DaTscan examination between 2018 and 2023 at a tertiary hospital in Greece, including referrals from both movement disorder specialists and general neurologists, either hospital-based or in private practice. Demographics, primary referral symptoms, and both pre-scan and post-scan diagnoses were collected and analyzed. <b>Results</b>: The mean age in our cohort was 60 ± 13.5 years, and tremor was the leading referral symptom (40.8%). The initial diagnosis changed in nearly half of the cases (48.3%) following DaTscan. Significant shifts included transitions from an \"Unclear\" or \"Dystonia\" diagnosis to \"Parkinson's disease\" in 78.1% and 72.7% of patients, respectively. However, the particularly high concordance rates between pre-scan and post-scan diagnosis for \"Vascular parkinsonism\" (100%), \"Parkinson's disease\" (89.3%), and \"Essential/Dystonic Tremor\" (86%) suggest that the test may have been over-utilized or ordered beyond its intended indications. <b>Conclusions</b>: DaTscan markedly enhances diagnostic accuracy for movement disorders, particularly for general neurologists, addressing the complexities of overlapping clinical presentations. Continuous medical training is essential to ensure the cost-effective utilization of DaTscan in routine clinical practice; ongoing technological advancements will further refine and expand their applications, benefiting both patients and the broader medical community."

To date very little is known about loneliness in Parkinson's disease (PD) and focal/segmental craniocervical dystonia (FSCD). To explore whether level of loneliness is disease-specific by comparing PD, FCSD and healthy controls (HCs), and to define predictors of loneliness in both PD and FSCD. Eighty-two people with PD, 63 people with FSCD and 50 HC were surveyed. The UCLA Loneliness Scale was used to assess loneliness. Various non-motor symptoms, psychosocial variables and measures of subjective well-being were assessed and used as potential predictors of loneliness. There was no significant difference in reported levels of loneliness between people with PD and matched HCs, and between people with PD and people with FSCD, but people with FSCD reported higher levels of loneliness than HCs (p = 0.018). Perceived stigma predicted loneliness in both disease groups (p < 0.001). Additionally, non-motor symptoms (p = 0.006), lack of optimism (p = 0.015) and practical social support (p = 0.006) predicted loneliness in people with PD. Patients with PD and FSCD with higher perceived stigma levels felt lonelier (p < 0.001), as did female patients with PD (p = 0.004), younger patients with FSCD (p = 0.007) and older patients with PD (p = 0.023). We identified important predictors of loneliness in PD and FSCD. The identified age- and gender-specific differences in loneliness in people with PD and FSCD contribute to our better understanding of this complex and not yet fully understood concept."

    "abstract": "Neurotransmitters play important roles in brain function, influencing cognition, movement, and behavior. Disruption in neurotransmitter biosynthesis, expression, transport, or function due to genetic mutations can lead to various neurological and psychiatric disorders with variable age of onset. Catecholamines like dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and serotonin are key monoamines transported by specific transporters, including the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). Disorders that involve monoamine neurotransmitter transport include dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome (DTDS) and brain dopamine-serotonin vesicular disorders (PKDYS2). These rare syndromes manifest with movement disorders and neuropsychiatric symptoms. DTDS results from a mutation in the <i>SLC6A3</i> gene affecting dopamine reuptake, while PKDYS2 involves a mutation in the <i>SLC18A2</i> gene impairing the transport of dopamine and serotonin. This review provides a comparative analysis of the diagnostic approaches, the management strategies, and the outcomes for these distinct disorders."

    "abstract": "Dystonia is a common, debilitating, and often treatment-refractory motor symptom of cerebral palsy (CP), affecting 70%-80% of this population based on research assessments. However, routine clinical evaluation for dystonia in CP has failed to match these expected numbers. Addressing this diagnostic gap is a medical imperative because the presence of dystonia rules in or out certain treatments for motor symptoms in CP. Therefore, our objective was to optimize rates of clinical dystonia screening to improve rates of clinical dystonia diagnosis. Using the quality improvement (QI) infrastructure of the Cerebral Palsy Research Network (CPRN), we developed and implemented interventions to increase the documentation percentage of 5 features of dystonia in young people with CP, aged 3-21 years. This QI initiative was implemented by 7 physiatry and pediatric movement disorders physicians at 4 tertiary-care pediatric hospitals between October 10, 2021, and July 1, 2023. Using a prospective cohort study design, we collected visit data across all participating sites every 2 weeks and tracked our progress using control charts. We assessed 847 unique visits, mostly for established patients (719/847, 85%) who were 9.2 years old on average (95% CI 8.8-9.5). By April 10, 2022, the mean percentage of dystonia screening elements documented across all sites increased from 39% to 90% and the mean percentage of visits explicitly documenting the presence or absence of dystonia increased from 65% to 94%. By October 23, 2022, the percentage of visits diagnosing dystonia increased from 57% to 74%. These increases were all sustained through the end of the study period on July 1, 2023. Using a rigorous QI-driven process across 4 member sites of a North American learning health network (CPRN), we demonstrated that we could increase screening for dystonia and that this was associated with increased clinical dystonia diagnosis, matching expected research-based rates. We propose that similar screening should take place across all sites caring for people with CP."

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) elicits oscillatory local field potentials in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and other movement disorders. Greater knowledge about the fast dynamics of these neural responses could shed light on circuit pathophysiology and inform novel approaches to neuromodulation therapies. To compare short-term neuroplasticity in the globus pallidus interna (GPi) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the canonical functional targets for PD and dystonia. During surgery for DBS lead implantation, we delivered pairs of stimuli across various interstimulus intervals and amplitudes and recorded DBS-evoked responses from unused contacts on the lead. After stimulus artifact removal, we contrasted the magnitude and timing of the local responses by paired pulse interval and brain target. Additionally, we compared the amplitudes of the DBS-evoked potentials versus resting local field potentials at the same recording site. In 14 patients undergoing STN DBS and 9 undergoing GPi DBS, evoked potentials in the STN exhibited greater amplitudes than those in the GPi. However, paired pulse neuroplasticity was larger in the GPi than in the STN. Otherwise, the responses at both sites exhibited similar paired pulse hastening and refractoriness, onset latencies, and frequencies measured by the first two peaks. Single and paired DBS pulses elicit local oscillations with larger amplitudes in the STN than in the GPi. Otherwise, the responses display similar time dynamics and short-term neuroplasticity. These findings could inform therapeutic innovation with future DBS systems that utilize sensing technologies. © 2025 The Author(s).

    "title": "Mixed Methods Survey to Identify Barriers to Accessing Deep Brain Stimulation for Movement Disorders in Canada.",
    "abstract": "Movement disorders (Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia) are debilitating, progressive conditions that profoundly impact patients' quality of life. Surgical therapies, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) can provide tremendous relief to patients but remain costly and, therefore, limited in availability. It is critical to understand regional barriers to accessing this service to improve access for all patients who may benefit from it. This is a mixed methods survey of stakeholders (patients/family members, advocacy groups, family physicians, neurologists, neurosurgeons) assessing perceived barriers to DBS for movement disorders. Closed and open-ended questions were used. Descriptive statistics were used to highlight regions of Canada where perceived access is poor and to identify barriers to access. A total of 220 responses were recorded (12 neurosurgeons, 22 neurologists, 30 family physicians, 153 patients and caregivers and 3 advocacy group personnel). Themes included limited resources/centralization of resources, education, burdensome referral patterns and personal patient factors. Barriers included costs associated with travel, waitlists, lack of specific resources and poor understanding of movement disorders, DBS indications and referral pathways. A number of barriers to access to DBS have been identified, related to geography and centralization of services, referrals and need for further education of indications and safety. The use of virtual care, centralized referral pathways and further research to determine the true prevalence of candidates for this therapy are required to improve access to DBS for movement disorders in Canada."

    "abstract": "Cervical dystonia (CD) is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary contractions that affect the muscles of the cervical region, causing movements in a twisting pattern. Its chronic-progressive nature can lead to pain, impaired mobility, and greater propensity to falls. To verify gait and balance characteristics and their correlation with the risk and fear of falling in 46 CD patients. The present was a descriptive and cross-sectional study. For the assessments, we sued the Berg Balance Scale (BBE), the Tinetti Scale (also known as the Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment, POMA), the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), the Fall Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I), and the Functional Reach Test (FRT). The patients were recruited during their routine consultations, before the administration of botulinum toxin. For data analysis, we used the BioEstat 5.0 software (free) to verify the distribution of samples (Shapiro-Wilk test) and the correlations among variables (Spearman test) considering <i>p</i> ≤ 0.05%. The results showed that the patients presented gait changes related to static and dynamic components of balance. Therefore, we observed a greater propensity to falls, with a correlation involving lack of balance, a greater risk of falling and, consequently, more fear of falling. We verified that changes in the balance of CD patients have a negative impact on gait, increase the risk and the fear of falling, and can lead the individual to restrict their activity levels."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Blepharospasm (BSP) is a focal dystonia characterized by involuntary, bilateral spasms of the orbicularis oculi muscle. While botulinum toxin (BoNT) is the standard treatment, cognitive tasks such as reading and writing may exert transient modulatory effects on spontaneous blinking and dystonic spasms. This study investigates the potential of cognitive training, including reading and writing tasks, as a complementary therapeutic approach to BoNT in BSP patients. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 16 BSP patients were randomly assigned to two groups: Group A (n = 6) received cognitive training alongside BoNT, while Group B (n = 10) received only BoNT. Cognitive training included structured reading and writing exercises over three months. Blink rate (BR) and dystonic spasms were assessed at baseline (T0), one month (T1), and three months (T2) post-treatment. <b>Results:</b> Both groups exhibited a significant reduction in BR at T1 (<i>p</i> = 0.001), but Group A exhibited a greater improvement in BR (45.4%) compared to that of Group B (12.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.04). Reading and writing tasks were the most effective in reducing BR and dystonic spasms (<i>p</i> < 0.001). No significant correlation was found between the clinical and demographic features (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Conclusions: Cognitive training significantly enhances the therapeutic effects of BoNT on BR in BSP patients, suggesting its potential as a non-invasive complementary intervention. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation using larger cohorts and employing neurophysiological assessments."

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the central effects of Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) on the somatosensory system in patients with cervical dystonia (CD), focusing on the thalamocortical pathway using high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) and short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI). An observational longitudinal study was conducted on 10CD patients and 10 healthy controls (HC). HFOs and SAI were assessed for CD and HC at baseline (T0; the day before BoNT-A treatment). Then only for CD patients, SAI and HFOs were assessed again 30 days after (T1) BoNT-A treatment. Changes in SAI values and HFO early and late area between T0 and T1 in CD patients were evaluated with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. At T0, CD patients exhibited significantly reduced early HFOs compared to HC, with no significant differences in late HFOs or SAI values. After BoNT-A treatment, a significant increase in early HFOs was observed in CD patients at T1, while late HFOs and SAI values remained unchanged. The findings suggest that BoNT-A treatment may have central effects on thalamocortical activity, as evidenced by changes of early HFOs in CD patients following injections. This study provides neurophysiological evidence supporting the central effects of BoNT-A on the somatosensory system and corroborates the idea of a somatosensory involvement in CD pathogenesis. This funding could pave the way for future integrated treatment approaches."

Here, we report a teenager who presented with symptoms and signs of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency in association with a rare underlying metabolic disorder. A teenager in his early adolescence presented with acute febrile illness with clinical signs of hypopigmented hair, knuckle hyperpigmentation, dystonia and spasticity. Neuroimaging showed bilateral putamen signal changes and batwing sign features with a deranged metabolic profile (elevated serum homocysteine with low serum vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, free carnitine and acylcarnitine). Further, exome sequencing identified a novel, likely pathogenic frameshift deletion, c.1021delA, with the change of amino acid from threonine to leucine at position 341 with the introduction of stop codon after 16 amino acids with subsequent protein truncation, in the GCDH gene. Thus, we started the patient on parental cobalamin therapy with a glutaric aciduria type-1 specific diet. On follow-up, the child showed significant improvement, with a decrease in hyperpigmentation and dystonia."

    "abstract": "The relationship between major depressive disorder (MDD) and mild motor signs (MMS) remains to be elucidated. The present study aims to assess the association between neurological symptoms and medications and treatment response. Neurological signs in 790 patients with MDD were correlated with treatment outcome. Three hundred ten (39.2%) were responders and 480 (60.8%) were non-responders. 342 (43.3%) presented neurological signs. In the whole sample negative associations between dystonia and rigidity and various medications was observed. Non-response was associated with dystonia, rigidity, and hypokinesia independent from age and medications. This study highlighted an association between MMS and specific medications. Moreover, MMS were associated with non-response to treatment, regardless of medication use. This may suggest that a subgroup of patients with MDD may respond less to therapy because of an underlying still undetected neurological disorder."

This retrospective study focused on patients treated with complex-free (incobotulinumtoxinA) and complex-containing (onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA) BoNT/A formulations over an up to 10-year period. The novel dose-effect parameter \"DEff\" was introduced to quantify the relationship between dose adjustments and clinical outcomes, enabling the identification of partial treatment failures. The primary endpoint was a comparison of a clinically meaningful worsening in DEff in treatment year 7 compared to year 2 between complex-free and complex-containing botulinum neurotoxin type A. The RELY-CD study provides unique insights into long-term treatment patterns, clinical resistance phenomena, and the implications of formulation differences on treatment outcomes, addressing a critical gap in the literature on real-world botulinum neurotoxin type A application. The study methodology, including the definition and calculation of the novel DEff, as well as clinical baseline characteristics, are presented."

    "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element and a cofactor for several key enzymes, such as mitochondrial superoxide dismutase. Consequently, it plays an important defense role against reactive oxygen species. Despite this, Mn chronic overexposure can result in a neurological disorder referred to as manganism, which shares some similarities with Parkinson's disease. Mn levels seem regulated by many transporters responsible for its uptake and efflux. These transporters play an established role in many inherited disorders of Mn metabolism and neurotoxicity. Some inherited Mn metabolism disorders, caused by mutations of SLC30A10 and SLC39A14, assume crucial importance since earlier treatment results in a better prognosis. Physicians should be familiar with the clinical presentation of these disorders as the underlying cause of dystonia/parkinsonism and look for other accompanying features, such as liver disease and polycythemia, which are typically associated with SLC30A10 mutations. This review aims to highlight the currently known Mn transporters, Mn-related neurotoxicity, and its consequences, and it provides an overview of inherited and acquired disorders of Mn metabolism. Currently available treatments are also discussed, focusing on the most frequently encountered presentations."

    "abstract": "Defects of mitochondrial ATP synthase (ATPase) represent an emerging, yet incompletely understood group of neurodevelopmental diseases with abnormal movements. The aim of this study was to redefine the phenotypic and mutational spectrum of movement disorders linked to the ATPase subunit-encoding genes ATP5F1A and ATP5F1B. We recruited regionally distant patients who had been genome or exome sequenced. Fibroblast cultures from two patients were established to perform RNA sequencing, immunoblotting, mass spectrometry-based high-throughput quantitative proteomics, and ATPase activity assays. In silico three-dimensional missense variant modeling was performed. We identified a patient with developmental delay, myoclonic dystonia, and spasticity who carried a heterozygous frameshift c.1404del (p.Glu469Serfs*3) variant in ATP5F1A. The patient's cells exhibited significant reductions in ATP5F1A mRNA, underexpression of the α-subunit of ATPase in association with other aberrantly expressed ATPase components, and compromised ATPase activity. In addition, a novel deleterious heterozygous ATP5F1A missense c.1252G>A (p.Gly418Arg) variant was discovered, shared by three patients from two families with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). This variant mapped to a functionally important intersubunit communication site. A third heterozygous variant, c.1074+1G>T, affected a canonical donor splice site of ATP5F1B and resulted in exon skipping with significantly diminished ATP5F1B mRNA levels, as well as impaired ATPase activity. The associated phenotype consisted of cerebral palsy (CP) with prominent generalized dystonia. Our data confirm and expand the role of dominant ATP5F1A and ATP5F1B variants in neurodevelopmental movement disorders. ATP5F1A/ATP5F1B-related ATPase diseases should be considered as a cause of dystonia, HSP, and CP. © 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Tremor is frequently observed in patients with Parkinsońs disease (PD). Tremor most commonly affects the upper limbs but may also affect the axial muscles in PD. Head tremor (HT) is usually identified in patients with essential tremor (ET) and cervical dystonia (CD), but rarely reported in PD. We aimed to assess the frequency, clinical features, correlates, and underlying mechanisms of HT in PD. Among 229 patients with PD, we identified 19 (8.3 %) of patients with HT. There were 11 males and 8 females with a median age at evaluation of 62.0 years. Five patients had slight, ten had mild and four had moderately severe HT. Yes-yes HT was the most common type. HT was associated with PD in 13 patients, eight of them had severe tremor-dominant presentation. In 3 patients there were signs suggesting underlying ET, while 3 patients had CD. Complete resolution of HT was observed with levodopa and/or deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with PD only, but inconsistent improvement was observed with comorbid ET or CD. Longer evolution time since PD onset (<i>P</i> = 0.024), rest tremor (<i>P</i> = 0.001) and CD (<i>P</i> = 0.003) were independently associated with HT in the multivariate analysis. HT was identified in 8.3% of patients with PD. It associated with longer evolution since PD onset, the severity of rest tremor and presence of CD. HT is observed in the context of PD only, particularly in those with severe tremor-dominant presentation, comorbid ET or CD. Most patients improve with dopaminergic therapy or DBS."

Reports of AEs related to Viloxazine were retrieved from FAERS (Q2 2021 to Q2 2024). Signal detection methods were used to calculate signal strength, categorizing events by system organ class (SOC) and preferred terms (PT). Out of 16,392,056 AE reports, 546 involved Viloxazine as the primary suspect drug. FAERS signal mining identified 64 PT signals across 23 SOCs. Common AEs included psychiatric and nervous system disorders, such as suicidal ideation (EBGM = 29.51), anxiety (EBGM = 3.47), irritability, and headache. Gastrointestinal disorders and systemic reactions were also noted. Novel AEs with strong signals included behavioral disorders (e.g., panic attacks, homicidal ideation), metabolic abnormalities (e.g., abnormal skin odor), and neuromuscular dysfunctions (e.g., dystonia). Hyperacusis (EBGM = 54.04) and photophobia (EBGM = 16.07) suggested sensory processing impacts. Most AEs occurred within 30 days of treatment initiation. Viloxazine has shown efficacy and tolerability but poses potential safety risks, particularly regarding mood, behavior, and sensory processing. Ongoing monitoring and further studies are needed."

The disorder's pathophysiology involves a range of factors including genetic mutations, neurochemical imbalances, and structural abnormalities in the brain. Acupuncture has emerged as a promising complementary treatment for various types of dystonia, including post-stroke, cerebral palsy (CP)-related, limb, and cervical dystonia, as well as other hyperkinetic movement disorders. Clinical studies indicate that acupuncture may help to alleviate symptoms, decrease muscle spasticity, and improve overall patient outcomes. However, the effectiveness of acupuncture can vary depending on the specific type and severity of dystonia, with some studies reporting significant improvements, while others show more modest results. The variability in treatment response highlights the need for more robust research to better understand the mechanisms underlying acupuncture's effects and to develop standardized treatment protocols. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of dystonia's pathophysiology and to assess the current evidence on the role of acupuncture in its treatment, identifying areas in which further research is needed to optimize therapeutic approaches."

The condition features episodic increases in sympathetic nervous system activity, which creates significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This study aims to comprehensively characterize the clinical presentation, diagnostic challenges, and treatment outcomes of pediatric PSH in a tertiary care setting. Additionally, we investigate factors contributing to delayed diagnosis and assess the impact of various clinical and management variables on patient outcomes. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at King Abdullah Specialist Children's Hospital (KASCH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, encompassing 42 pediatric patients diagnosed with PSH between 2016 and 2023. We extracted comprehensive data from patient records, including demographic profiles, clinical presentations, diagnostic findings, and treatment outcomes. Statistical analyses were employed to identify factors influencing mortality and clinical improvement, including univariate and multivariate regression. The cohort had a mean age of 6.53 years, with PSH onset typically around 4.19 years. The majority (88.1%) of PSH cases stemmed from non-traumatic causes, notably hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (31%). Key clinical features included fever, tachycardia, and dystonia, with a significant rate of initial misdiagnosis (69%). Healthcare providers frequently administer gabapentin as a preventive medication, while they commonly use benzodiazepines for abortive therapy. Clonidine use was associated with a statistically significant reduction in mortality (P < 0.05), whereas delayed diagnosis correlated with poorer clinical outcomes. PSH in pediatric patients predominantly arises from non-traumatic brain injuries, presenting with nonspecific symptoms that often lead to misdiagnosis. This study underscores the importance of early and accurate diagnosis in improving patient outcomes. Clonidine shows potential as a life-saving intervention in this context. These findings highlight the need for further research to refine diagnostic criteria and optimize treatment strategies for pediatric PSH."

To determine the objective characteristics of alcohol responsiveness in LD using a standardized alcohol challenge test and genetic testing. A total of 109 patients with isolated focal LD participated in the study. Patients were administered two non-diluted drinks of 40-proof vodka 30 min apart, followed by assessments of voice symptoms, breath alcohol content, and side effects. Patients were considered alcohol-responsive (EtOH+) if their symptoms changed by ≥10% from baseline. Whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify genetic variants associated with the alcohol responsiveness of LD. All patients tolerated the standardized alcohol challenge test without major adverse events. Fifty-two patients (47.7%) had an average of 44.4 ± 25.0% improvement of LD symptoms about 45 min after alcohol intake. Five genetic variants in GABAergic pathway-related genes were enriched in EtOH+ patients, and two of these, rs11644926 (ADCY7) and rs2230741 (ADCY9), were associated with the improvement of dystonic voice symptoms. Alcohol responsiveness of LD symptoms is a robust feature related to the genes regulating the GABAergic synapses. This finding provides support for the evaluation of novel oral medications with mechanisms of action similar to alcohol for the treatment of patients with alcohol-responsive dystonia."

Increases in throughput and ongoing reductions in cost will facilitate the incorporation of long-read approaches into mainstream diagnostic practice. Although these developments are likely to transform clinical care, there is currently a discrepancy between the potential benefits of long-read sequencing and the application of this technique to dystonia. In this review we highlight current opportunities and limitations of adopting long-read sequencing methods for the investigation of patients with dystonia. We provide examples of long-read sequencing integration into diagnostic evaluation and the study of pathomechanisms in individuals with dystonic disorders.

    "abstract": "Primary cervical dystonia (PCD), or spasmodic torticollis, is a focal dystonia characterized by involuntary and often painful muscle contractions, leading to abnormal cervical movements and postures. While botulinum toxin injections are the first-line treatment, additional therapies, such as segmental muscle vibration (SMV), remain underexplored. SMV, a non-invasive neuromodulation technique, may enhance motor cortex excitability and promote neuroplasticity, offering potential benefits in PCD management. This single-center triple-blinded randomized controlled trial evaluates SMV's efficacy in reducing dystonic pain and improving quality of life in PCD patients undergoing standardized rehabilitation after botulinum toxin treatment. Participants with a pain level of ≥3 on the Numerical Rating Scale will be randomized into two groups. The experimental group will receive 80 Hz SMV during a 10-session rehabilitation program, while the control group will undergo sham SMV. Both groups will follow identical physiotherapy and occupational therapy protocols. The primary outcomes include changes in pain intensity and function, assessed at baseline, mid-treatment, and post-treatment using validated scales. The secondary outcomes will evaluate quality of life and patient satisfaction. This study hypothesizes that SMV will significantly reduce dystonic pain and enhance quality of life, supporting its integration into multidisciplinary rehabilitation for dystonic disorders.

Parental genetic analyses for the targeted variant were heterozygous. In conclusion, the diagnosis of AGS relies on clinical characteristics and genetic testing. Basic neurological characteristics include developmental delay, dystonia, microcephaly, brain calcification, and leukodystrophy. Although data concerning genotype-phenotype in AGS type 4 have been reported in the literature, these are still limited."

    "abstract": "PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN) encompasses a spectrum of phenotypes caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in PLA2G6. Initially linked to infantile and atypical neuroaxonal dystrophy, PLAN now includes adult-onset conditions such as dystonia-parkinsonism, ataxia, and spastic paraplegia. We report a female patient presenting young-onset parkinsonism with pyramidal tract signs, cerebellar atrophy, and autonomic dysfunction, mimicking multiple system atrophy (MSA). Neuroimaging showed decreased dopamine uptake and cerebellar hypoperfusion. Genetic analysis identified a homozygous pathogenic variant in PLA2G6 (c.967G>A, p.Val323Met), confirming a diagnosis of PLAN. Interestingly, elevated serum autotaxin levels (4.67 ng/mL) without liver abnormalities. Bilateral brachymetatarsia was also observed, which may indicate an association with the PLA2G6 variant. This case underscores the importance of considering PLAN in cases of young-onset parkinsonism with multisystem involvement. Genetic testing is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management of such cases. Elevated serum autotaxin levels may be associated with decreased phospholipase activity in PLAN and warrants further investigation."

    "abstract": "Differences in clinical characteristics between juvenile-onset Huntington disease (JHD) and adult-onset HD (AHD) are hypothesized but not directly compared. This study compares clinical characteristics occurrence and severity across age-at-onset (AO) subtypes. Using the national juvenile-onset HD patient cohort and the international Enroll-HD registry (NCT01574053), we compared childhood-onset JHD (cJHD; AO 0-10), adolescent-onset JHD (aJHD; AO 11-20), and adult-onset HD (AHD; AO 21-65) on proportions of clinical characteristics at onset and psychiatric characteristics in pooled datasets. Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to UHDRS-Total Motor Score (UHDRS-TMS) items of the Enroll-HD dataset to compare the severity of motor disease characteristics 6-10 years after onset. The combined datasets provided data from 46 patients with cJHD (mean AO 6.70, 45% female), 243 patients with aJHD (mean AO 16.70, 46% female), and 9,504 patients with AHD (mean AO 44.70, 51% female). At onset, neurocognitive symptoms occurred in 47.50% of patients with cJHD (n = 46; 95% CI 31.80%-63.70%), significantly more often compared with 24.88% of patients with aJHD (n = 209; 19.30%-31.40%) and 15.02% of those with AHD (n = 8,177; 14.30%-15.80%). Psychiatric symptoms occurred in 47.12% of patients with aJHD (95% CI 40.20%-54.10%), significantly more compared with 31.04% of patients with AHD (30.10%-32.00%). Throughout the disease, aggressive behavior occurred in 73.91% of patients with cJHD (n = 46; 95% CI 58.60%-85.20%) and 55.88% of those with aJHD (n = 238; 49.30%-62.30%), significantly more compared with 40.65% of patients with AHD (n = 9,501; 39.70%-41.70%). Psychosis occurred in 23.53% of patients with aJHD (95% CI 18.40%-29.50%), significantly more compared with 12.77% of those with AHD (12.10%-13.50%). The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed significantly higher median UHDRS-TMS scores in one or both JHD subtypes compared with AHD for dysarthria (AHD: n = 4,163, median 1.00, interquartile range (IQR) 0.70; cJHD: n = 12, 2.20, 2.00, <i>p =</i> 0.039; aJHD: n = 93, 1.00, 1.00, <i>p</i> = 0.031), parkinsonism (AHD: n = 4,158, median 6.00, IQR 4.70; cJHD: n = 12, 11.00, 9.40, <i>p</i> = 0.008; aJHD: n = 93, 8.50, 6.80, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and dystonia (AHD: n = 4,161, median 2.00, IQR 5.20; cJHD: n = 12, 6.50, 8.20, <i>p</i> = 0.141; aJHD: n = 93, 4.00, 7.20, <i>p =</i> 0.015) and significantly lower median scores for chorea (AHD: n = 4,163, median 9.20, IQR 7.00; cJHD: n = 12, 5.00, 4.20, <i>p</i> = <0.001; aJHD: n = 93, 6.30, 9.50, <i>p</i> < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic commonly used in the treatment of schizophrenia. Despite its effectiveness, several adverse drug reactions can be bothersome to patients. This study aimed to examine the prevalence and characteristics of adverse effects in outpatients with schizophrenia treated with low (<4 mg/day) and standard (≥4 mg/day) doses of risperidone. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 64 patients at a tertiary psychiatric hospital. Data on adverse effects were collected through a self-report questionnaire, and causality was assessed using Naranjo's Algorithm. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were employed for data analysis. The participants comprised 51.56% females, with a mean age of 45.16±14.32 years. Significant gender differences were observed between dose groups, with more females in the low-- dose group (63.16%) than in the standard-dose group (34.62%) (P = 0.02). A total of 221 adverse effects were confirmed after assessment. The most common effects were weight gain (57.81%), increased appetite (48.44%), and dystonia (32.81%). Weight gain was more prevalent in the low-- dose group (68.42%) than the standard-dose group (42.31%; Cohen's h = 0.53, 95% CI: 2.0%-50.2%), while insomnia was higher in the standard-dose group (23.08%) compared to the low-dose group (5.26%; Cohen's h = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.1%-35.5%). Other ADRs, such as dystonia and gastrointestinal symptoms, showed no significant differences between groups. Weight gain was the most prevalent adverse effect associated with risperidone use, particularly at lower doses, while insomnia was more frequent at standard doses, emphasizing the need for careful monitoring and personalized dose adjustments to optimize patient safety. Future studies with larger, longitudinal cohort designs are warranted to confirm these findings and evaluate long-term safety outcomes."

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) of the central nervous system (CNS) is a severe complication of TB, with movement disorders representing an under-recognized yet impactful manifestation. Despite their clinical significance, knowledge gaps persist in epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of TB-related movement disorders (TBRMDs). This scoping review synthesizes evidence on TBRMDs, aiming to characterize their spectrum, evaluate diagnostic approaches, and summarize management strategies and outcomes. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus (final search: December 31, 2024) identified studies of all designs and languages reporting movement disorders in CNS TB. Data extraction, quality assessment (Joanna Briggs Institute tools), and thematic synthesis were conducted. Of 36 included studies (91 cases), tremor (27.5%), chorea (26.4%), and dystonia (16.5%) were most prevalent. Tremor predominated in tuberculous meningitis (48.9%), while chorea was common in tuberculomas (42.3%). Lesion location correlated with phenomenology: basal ganglia lesions linked to chorea/dystonia, cerebellar involvement to ataxia. Pathogenesis included meningitis (54.9%), tuberculomas (32.9%), and vasculitis (8.8%). Treatment with anti-tubercular therapy and corticosteroids resulted in complete resolution in 43.9% of cases, but 32.9% showed no improvement. Geographically, South America (61.8%) and Asia (19.7%) reported most cases, with a temporal surge post-2000. TBRMDs are heterogeneous in presentation, linked to lesion location and pathogenic mechanisms. Early recognition, multimodal management, and neuroimaging are critical. Significant variability in diagnostic and reporting standards highlights the need for consensus criteria and prospective studies, particularly in high-burden regions. This review underscores the need of global collaborations to optimize clinical care and advance research in this neglected domain."

    "abstract": "Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. A current unresolved issue is the worsening of neurological symptoms during the initial treatment phase, particularly with chelation therapy. This phenomenon, termed \"early neurological worsening,\" is attributed to the rapid mobilization and redistribution of copper during treatment initiation. We report the case of a 10-year-old boy, with neuro-hepatic Wilson's disease who developed treatment-refractory generalized dystonia, which improved with intrathecal baclofen therapy. The patient experienced walking discomfort 5 months before referral to our hospital, with rapid progression to dysphagia and a 3 kg weight loss. Initially, he presented with dystonia, including foot inversion. Wilson's disease was diagnosed based on physiological, clinical, and imaging findings, with confirmation of a homozygous mutation in the <i>ATP7B</i> gene. The patient was treated with trientine hydrochloride, followed by zinc monotherapy. Despite appropriate chelation therapy, dystonia progressed to severe axial torsion involving the trunk. His condition deteriorated to status dystonicus, with high-grade fever, elevated creatine phosphokinase levels, and dehydration, requiring midazolam sedation. These symptoms were attributed to \"early neurological worsening.\" A trial of intrathecal baclofen injection provided symptom relief, leading to the implantation of a baclofen pump, which significantly reduced the status dystonicus. At discharge, the patient had a modified Rankin Scale score of 5. Three years later, although wheelchair-dependent, his oral intake and speech are progressively improving with training. This is the first reported case of status dystonicus in Wilson's disease successfully treated with intrathecal baclofen, highlighting its potential as a viable treatment option for Wilson's disease-associated debilitating dystonia."

In 90% of patients with intellectual disability, the etiology can be attributed to variants in the genome. to determine intragenic variants in patients with intellectual disability between 5 and 18 years old at Instituto Nacional de Salud del Niño. It is a descriptive cross-sectional study with convenience sampling. A total of 124 children diagnosed with intellectual disability were selected based on psychological test results and availability for whole exome sequencing. In addition, a chromosomal analysis of 6.55 M was performed on ten patients with a negative result in sequencing. Relative and absolute frequencies and measures of central tendency and dispersion were determined according to their nature. In addition, multiple linear regression and Poisson regression were used to determine the association between some clinical characteristics and the probability of occurrence in patients with positive results. The median age of the patients was 6.3 (IQR = 5.95), males accounted for 57.3%, and 91.9% of the cases had mild intellectual disability. Exome sequencing determined the etiology in 30.6% of patients with intellectual disability, of which 52.6% were autosomal dominant inheritance. The most frequent genes found were MECP2, STXBP1 and LAMA2. A broad genotype-phenotype correlation was identified, highlighting the genetic heterogeneity of intellectual disability in this population. The presence of dermatologic lesions, dystonia, peripheral neurological disorders, and fourth finger flexion limitation were observed more frequently in patients with intellectual disability with \"positive results\". This study shows that one-third of patients with intellectual disability exhibit intragenic variants, highlighting the importance of genetic analysis for accurate diagnosis. The identification of genes such as MECP2, STXBP1, and LAMA2 underscores the genetic heterogeneity of intellectual disability in the studied population. These findings emphasize the need for genetic testing in clinical management and the implementation of early detection programs in Peru."

This study aims to compare demographic and clinical features, including the distribution of dystonia at onset, dystonia-associated features, and the propensity for spread between patients with combined dystonia-parkinsonism and those with idiopathic adult-onset dystonia. Patients were selected from the Italian Dystonia Registry. The study cohort included 130 patients with combined dystonia-parkinsonism and 355 age- and sex-matched patients with isolated adult-onset idiopathic dystonia. The comparison between combined dystonia-parkinsonism and idiopathic dystonia revealed differences in the distribution of dystonia across body regions, with non-task-specific upper limb dystonia, lower limb dystonia, and trunk dystonia occurring more frequently in patients with combined dystonia-parkinsonism. Additionally, this group exhibited a lower frequency of head tremor, eye symptoms associated with blepharospasm, and sensory tricks, alongside a comparable frequency of neck pain related to cervical dystonia and a family history of dystonia or tremor. The clinical presentation of dystonia differs between combined dystonia-parkinsonism and idiopathic dystonia, especially in terms of the body regions affected. These differences underscore the necessity for additional research and suggest underlying pathophysiological disparities between etiological categories that could significantly influence future diagnostics and therapeutic approaches."

However, limited research has explored patients' attitudes toward RP and its clinical outcomes in this population. This study aimed to assess patient perceptions of RP and its clinical efficacy in individuals with isolated dystonia who have undergone DBS. A cross-sectional web-based survey on RP was conducted between April 25, 2024, and July 15, 2024, among patients with isolated dystonia who underwent DBS. The survey evaluated programming burdens and patient satisfaction. Additionally, a subgroup of patients underwent follow-up motor assessments using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS). A total of 46 patients completed the survey, and 14 patients who exclusively used RP for postoperative programming underwent motor assessments. Among participants, 40 (87%) reported that in-clinic programming sessions cost more than $42 per visit, with five patients incurring costs exceeding $421. Furthermore, 26 patients (57%) expressed a preference for RP as their primary programming method. Motor assessments of the 14 RP-only patients showed significant improvements, with BFMDRS disability scores decreasing by 30% (p = 0.045) and movement scores by 64% (P < 0.001). The study highlights the substantial burden of in-clinic DBS programming for patients with isolated dystonia and underscores the clinical and economic advantages of RP. These findings support RP as a viable and effective alternative for DBS programming."

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to define a structural network of stroke-induced and spasticity-related lesions and to relate this network to target sites and reported effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat poststroke spasticity. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed (online suppl. Table 2). We performed two separate systematic literature reviews, collecting data from previously published voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) studies for poststroke spasticity patients searching the Medline database on Pubmed using the keywords \"stroke,\" \"spasticity,\" and \"lesion mapping\" as well as data from previously published cohorts undergoing DBS for poststroke spasticity using the keywords \"brain stimulation\" and \"spasticity.\" Data collected from each study included patient demographic characteristics, stroke diagnosis, movement disorder, DBS target, stimulation parameters, complications, and outcomes. Data from VLSM studies were used to calculate coordinate-based activation likelihood clusters, which were then used as seeds for enhanced fiber tracking to analyze affected networks. Data from five studies on voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping for stroke-induced spasticity were included in the analysis. Meta-analytical mapping of stroke-related lesions identified significant clusters located in the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical network which were predominantly connected to the sensorimotor cortex. We identified eight studies (four retrospective case series, two prospective open-label non-randomized trials, and two prospective double-blind trials) fulfilling our inclusion and exclusion criteria on DBS for spasticity reporting on 107 patients in total. Most studies reported outcomes in patients with cerebral palsy, a condition associated with both stroke-related spasticity and hypertonia-related dystonia, which are difficult to differentiate clinically. Target sites included different parts of the cerebellum and the motor thalamus with overall mixed results. Because all reported effective DBS target sites are situated along the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network, we hypothesize that the therapeutic effect of DBS on spasticity might be induced by resetting a functional imbalance between the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical networks in patients with a supraspinal etiology of spasticity. However, the results need to be interpreted cautiously due to the inevitable inclusion of stroke-related dystonia."

This study aims to systematically review the literature about movement disorders (MDs) associated with AChEIs for AD, which include donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, tacrine, and ipidacrine. Two reviewers conducted a comprehensive review of relevant studies across six databases, without language restrictions, covering publications from 1992 to 2024. Overall, 74 studies containing 92 cases were found of MDs related to ACHEIs. The MDs found were Pisa syndrome in 33 patients, parkinsonism in 31, myoclonus in 11, dystonia in 10, dyskinesia in 6, and extrapyramidal symptoms in 1. Regarding the medications, the abnormal movements were associated with donepezil in 62 cases, rivastigmine in 15, galantamine in 10, and tacrine in 5. No case of ipidacrine-induced MD was found. Overall, the most commonly affected sex was the female, accounting for 61.9% of the cases. The mean and median age was 74.1 (standard deviation: 8.9) and 75 years (range: 49-93 years). The MD occurred within 6 months of the starting of AChEI in approximately 70% of the patients. Furthermore, the full recovery of the MD after the main management was noticed within 6 months in about 80% of the patients. About 86.3% of the individuals fully recovered after treatment, which included AChEI discontinuation, dose adjustment, and prescription of additional therapy. The occurrence of tacrine-induced tremor indicated a potential predisposition to movement disorders associated with AChEI therapy. Based on the drug class side effect profile, it is possible that future studies may observe abnormal movements with other AChEIs."

    "abstract": "Dystonia presents as a complex neurological disorder that can be challenging to manage, often impacting specific parts of the body and involving dysfunction in the cortico-subcortical loop, particularly the basal ganglia. Emerging evidence points to heightened motor cortex excitability, hyperplasticity of the sensorimotor cortex, and abnormal sensorimotor integration as pivotal factors contributing to dystonia. Consistent research findings underscore the significance of contralateral motor cortex hyper-excitability in the progression of focal dystonia. Therefore, neuromodulation techniques like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation hold promise in modulating focal cortical activity and addressing dystonia. This case study details the treatment of a 70-year-old male patient with progressive left upper limb dystonia and associated pain. The patient received all recommended treatments for hand dystonia, including botulinum toxin injections. Accelerated continuous theta burst stimulation (acTBS) was used to mitigate the challenges posed by the condition. This case underscores the potential advantages of neuromodulation techniques, such as acTBS and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), in managing upper limb dystonia and its related pain symptoms. It highlights the promise of non-invasive interventions in enhancing function and quality of life for individuals with similar conditions."

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for primary disorders, but its efficacy in secondary ones remains variable. Although quality of life (QoL) assessment is crucial in disabling conditions to understand the comprehensive impact of surgical treatment on daily life, the available questionnaires are not well adapted. Herein, QoL after DBS was evaluated using a \"homemade\" scale. The DBS-QoL scale is a new questionnaire specifically designed for generalized dystonia patients. Twenty-one DYT1 patients and 40 cerebral palsy patients underwent globus pallidus internus DBS during the inclusion period. Clinical improvement was measured using the BFMDRS and compared to QoL evolution using the DBS-QoL. We identified a significant positive impact of DBS on motor and functional aspects for both groups, with superior gains in DYT1 patients. In this group, we found significant improvement in functional aspects, whereas in perinatal hypoxic patients, the opposite trend was reported, with better satisfaction in terms of wellbeing. Across both etiologies, patients expressed satisfaction with the surgical outcomes (83%). QoL assessment, using a dedicated scale, was shown to complement BFMDRS, enhancing the detection of subtle symptom improvements in DBS-treated patients."

    "abstract": "Currently, the pathophysiology of myoclonus-dystonia (M-D) remains insufficiently understood. This study addresses this gap by adding innovative multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to traditional univariate analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Data from 18 M-D patients and 18 age-matched healthy volunteers who performed a finger tapping fMRI task were analyzed. Whole-brain univariate and searchlight (MVPA) analysis with varying hemodynamic response function (HRF) delays were employed to examine brain responses associated with the visually guided motor task. Distinguishing response patterns between M-D patients and healthy volunteers revealed significant response reductions in the putamen, insula, and visual cortex. Compared to univariate analysis, searchlight analysis was more sensitive for brain activity patterns associated with finger tapping in both M-D patients and healthy volunteers. At short HRF delays, increased (pre)motor cortical responses were evident in M-D patients, whereas such responses emerged at a later HRF delay in healthy volunteers. The task-related effects observed in M-D patients support the involvement of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical network. Notably, cerebellar involvement was not strongly implicated in our study. We postulate that inherent deficits in the putamen trigger either premature or downstream compensatory (motor) cortical effects. The potential involvement of the visual cortex in the M-D pathophysiology is new, but its role has been suggested by a previous study investigating visual sensory processing in SGCE gene-positive M-D patients. Our findings, including the innovative searchlight method, pave the way for further studies investigating the complex interplay between brain regions and networks and their role in M-D pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "Intracranial germinoma (GEM) originates from primordial germ cells, more frequently in the pineal and suprasellar regions. Basal ganglia (BG) presentations are rare, especially associated with diabetes insipidus (DI) and without a neurohypophysis lesion or an \"occult germinoma.\" The management of GEM is controversial, although conventional wide-field irradiation with or without chemotherapy is the usual treatment. The potential role of radiosurgery in the management of these lesions remains unclear. A 15-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital, presenting with DI and right-hand dystonia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a paraventricular BG tumor near the left caudate nucleus. A stereotactic biopsy was performed, confirming the GEM diagnosis. The patient was treated by stereotactic radiosurgery (13 Gy), with remission of all symptoms. Eleven years after the onset of symptoms, the patient remained stable on a regular desmopressin regimen, maintaining normal water intake and urinary volume with improvement in the hand's dystonia. The brain MRI performed annually during the past 10 years after radiosurgery revealed no tumor recurrence or other abnormalities at the neurohypophysis and pituitary stalk. BG GEM is rare and it may manifest with DI, a possible consequence of peritumoral edema surrounding the hypothalamus. Radiosurgery alone may be an effective treatment option. The occult GEM of the neurohypophysis could also cause DI preceding the radiological onset of GEM. Hence, it is mandatory to follow-up on patients with BG GEM presenting with central DI closely for a long time with periodic clinical and neuroimaging evaluations."

    "title": "Efficacy of deep brain stimulation in treating monogenic dystonia symptoms: protocol for a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Complexity leads to some dystonias being considered as rare diseases with scarce synthesised evidence. Despite the deficit of scientific evidence, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently an effective treatment for dystonias using different brain targets, providing significant improvement of dystonic symptoms regardless of their cause. However, there is considerable variability and non-response rate due to factors such as classification, semiology, duration, aetiology and genetic cause of the disease. This protocol presents the methodology of a planned systematic review to assess the efficacy of DBS as a treatment for monogenic dystonia symptoms, a broad spectrum of pathogenic dystonias due to variants in single genes not yet explored. This protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines. With the aim to test the efficacy of DBS in monogenic dystonias, the research question in population, intervention, comparator and outcomes format will cover patients with monogenic dystonia treated with DBS with a minimum of 3 months' follow-up after surgery. The outcomes will be assessed using generic and specific scales to measure the efficacy and safety of the intervention. The search will be performed in generic and specific databases and bibliographic resources from 2000. We will include systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials and primary studies in English. In this protocol, the initial search strategy in MEDLINE is presented. Additionally, the protocol provides a description of the prospective assessment of the risk of bias in the selected studies. If studies appear homogeneous and the sample of patients is sufficiently large, a meta-analysis and a subgroup analysis are planned. Ethics committee approval is not required. The results of the review will be published through an open access journal. CRD42023448145."

We aimed to describe our experience of asleep macrostimulation mapping of implanted DBS leads using intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) techniques, which were used to guide electrode placement-in addition to intraoperative computed tomography imaging and in place of awake neurophysiological testing. This was a single institution retrospective study of asleep DBS surgery with IONM mapping for Parkinson's disease, ET, and dystonia targeting the ventral intermediate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, and globus pallidus interna. A series of 88 consecutive patients from a single surgeon were included. 67 patients received DBS for Parkinson's disease, 14 for essential tremor, and 7 for dystonia. The DBS target was globus pallidus interna for 60 patients, subthalamic nucleus for 14, and ventral intermediate nucleus for 14, with 95.5% undergoing bilateral lead placement. The mean single stage surgery time was 170 minutes. No patients required surgical lead revision, and no unanticipated sensorimotor side effects were noted during DBS programming. Compared with patients undergoing awake DBS surgery, there was no significant difference in patient-reported outcomes. Asleep IONM mapping offers valuable physiological data to guide electrode asleep DBS placement and complement intraoperative imaging techniques."

    "abstract": "Rare neurological diseases (RNDs) result in severe health burdens worldwide. Data from China are limited. We aimed to investigate the health burden of 20 RNDs in Guangdong Province (GD), which contains two-thirds of the population of South China. The hospitalization data of 20 RNDs were described using hospital-based front sheet data from 3,037 hospitals of GD from 2016 to 2022. The 20 RNDs included amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, congenital myotonia, congenital myasthenic syndrome, Dravet syndrome, Fabry disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia, Huntington disease, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, mitochondrial encephalopathy (ME), multi-focal motor neuropathy, myotonic dystrophy, primary hereditary dystonia, progressive muscular dystrophy (PMD), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), spinocerebellar ataxia, Wilson disease (WD) and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Age were presented as mean and standard deviation while length of hospital stay as median and interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles). The other variables were described as number and percentage. The data were analyzed by Joinpoint regression. There were 9,351 cases, including 330 ICU and 155 death cases. The average age was 33.7 ± 22.0 y, and 63.8% of patients were male. From 2016 to 2022, the number of RND (and juvenile RND) cases were 1034 (184), 1174 (293), 1443 (374), 1422 (320), 1331 (337), 1432 (409) to 1515 (515). ICU (and juvenile ICU) cases rose from 28 (3), 34 (6), 24 (4), 38 (11), 46 (13), 54 (24) to 106 (56). Joinpoint regression showed significant upward trend in percentages of juvenile and juvenile ICU cases (APC = 8.13, P< 0.05; APC = 28.42, P< 0.05). The fop five RNDs were WD, ASL, PMD, ME, and SMA, which accounted for 79.7% of all, 99.1% of ICU, and 94.8% of death cases. We demonstrated that the increase in health burden of RNDs was mainly evident in juveniles in South China from 2016 to 2022. The top 5 RNDs accounted for majority of the critical patients."

    "abstract": "Postoperative peri-lead edema (PLE) is an increasingly recognized complication of deep brain stimulation (DBS), a therapeutic intervention commonly used for neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD), essential tremor (ET), intractable focal epilepsy, and dystonia. In this study, we conducted a retrospective chart review to evaluate the incidence of PLE and explore potential clinical and demographic risk factors. A single physician performed DBS electrode placements. To check for complications, postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were conducted on the day of surgery and approximately 12-15 days afterward. Data on age, gender, complications, edema size, electrode laterality, lead target, lead brand, indication, and use of robotic assistance versus Starfix were collected and analyzed statistically. 133 leads were implanted in 63 patients, with peri-lead edema (PLE) observed in 65 electrodes (48.87%). Minor postoperative complications, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and subdural hematoma (SDH), were noted in some patients. A few cases of severe PLE were recorded, with the most significant volume of edema reaching 85.11 cm³. No statistically significant differences were found between PLE-positive and PLE-negative patients based on age, sex, lead target, indication, or robotic assistance versus Starfix. However, the use of Boston Scientific electrodes was significantly associated with PLE, with a p-value of 0.047. A logistic regression model (p = 0.013, R² = 0.219) correctly classified 63.2% of cases, with no significant predictors of PLE, but imaging complications (p = 0.057) and electrode brand (p = 0.086) approached significance, with Boston Scientific electrodes linked to higher PLE risk compared to Abbott electrodes (p = 0.027, OR = 3.729). PLE appears more prevalent than previously reported and generally presents with delayed onset post-surgery. This retrospective analysis identified the use of Boston Scientific electrodes as a potential risk factor for PLE. Further research, particularly more extensive studies, is necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms of PLE, improve prevention strategies, and enhance our understanding of this complication."

    "abstract": "A 22-year-old female presented with drug-resistant focal motor seizures with onset at age 14. This manifested as daily episodes of right facial dystonia triggered by toothbrushing, but also by eating, talking, and strenuous exercise. On ictal scalp EEG, there was low-voltage fast activity over the left pericentral area. Structural MRI did not identify a definite lesion. Functional MRI (fMRI) of a reflex seizure, as well as task-based fMRI during toothbrushing, both demonstrated focal activation at the left low pericentral cortex. Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) showed recurrent ictal trains of focal spiking concordant with the fMRI activation. Radiofrequency (RF) thermocoagulation was applied at the posterior bank of the left low pre-central gyrus, with post-operative MRI confirming small ablative lesions immediately deep to the ictal fMRI activation, and the patient remains seizure-free more than 3 years after this treatment. Toothbrushing epilepsy is a rare form of reflex epilepsy where seizures are induced by toothbrushing. In this unique case, ictal fMRI assisted targeting of the sEEG implantation, to confirm seizure onset and enable minimally invasive treatment via RF thermocoagulation, resulting in seizure freedom."

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 deficiency (ECHS1D) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder affecting valine metabolism, with clinical severity ranging from neonatal death to survival into adulthood. Despite advances in understanding ECHS1D, the genetic basis remains underexplored, particularly in underrepresented populations. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and genetic characteristics of ECHS1D in two unrelated Chinese families and identify novel pathogenic variants. Clinical and genetic data were collected, and whole-genome sequencing was performed to identify pathogenic variants in the ECHS1 gene. The first proband, a 15-month-old girl, presented with developmental delays and metabolic acidosis, with an MRI revealing abnormal signals in the basal ganglia. The second proband, a 6.5-year-old girl with movement-induced dystonia, exhibited lethargy following recurrent fever and vomiting, with similar MRI findings. Genetic testing identified novel compound heterozygous variants: c.759_762del (p.Gly255Valfs*21) and c.489G>A (p.Pro163=) in Proband 1 and c.518C>T (p.Ala173Val) and c.244G>A (p.Val82Met) in Proband 2. The c.759_762del (p.Gly255Valfs21) variant, identified for the first time, likely results in severe symptoms due to a loss of normal function. These findings expand the ECHS1 mutational spectrum and emphasize the importance of genetic testing for early diagnosis and personalized management of ECHS1D. Interventions such as dietary valine restriction and the avoidance of triggering factors may improve clinical outcomes, while further research is needed to explore targeted therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Systemic primary carnitine deficiency (SPCD) is a rare congenital fatty acid metabolism disorder causing impaired β-oxidation and energy production, leading to hypoglycemia, metabolic encephalopathy, and sudden death. Early diagnosis and treatment, including L-carnitine supplementation and fasting avoidance, can improve prognosis. However, newborn screening (NBS) criteria differ by region, and standardized guidelines are lacking. This report presents a case of SPCD undetected by NBS, resulting in basal ganglia damage and dystonia due to metabolic decompensation. A 1-year-9-month-old girl with no abnormalities on NBS presented with impaired consciousness. She exhibited hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and myocardial hypertrophy. Suspecting a fatty acid metabolism disorder, L-carnitine and high-calorie infusion were initiated. Laboratory tests revealed markedly low serum total and free carnitine levels, and genetic analysis confirmed a homozygous <i>SLC22A5</i> mutation. Brain MRI on day 7 revealed bilateral basal ganglia and substantia nigra abnormalities. The patient developed severe dystonia and respiratory failure, requiring ECMO management. L-DOPA was initiated on day 62, resulting in improvements in dystonia, swallowing, and motor function. By day 88, MRI showed resolution of basal ganglia abnormalities, though cerebral atrophy persisted. Basal ganglia damage is a rare but severe SPCD complication. L-DOPA may alleviate dystonia by acting on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Early ketone measurement during emergencies is crucial for diagnosing fatty acid metabolism disorders. A standardized NBS protocol with a defined carnitine cutoff value is essential for early detection and prevention of SPCD complications."

Specialist physiotherapy presents a possible treatment option, but there is limited evidence for clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Physio4FMD is a multicenter randomized controlled trial of specialist physiotherapy for FMD compared with treatment as usual (TAU). The aim of the analysis was to conduct a randomized trial based on economic evaluation of specialist physiotherapy compared with TAU. Eleven centers in England and Scotland randomized participants 1:1 to specialist physiotherapy or TAU (referral to community neurologic physiotherapy). Participants completed the EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L, Client Service Receipt Inventory, and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. The mean incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for specialist physiotherapy compared with TAU over 12 months was calculated from a health and social care and wider societal perspective. The probability of cost-effectiveness and 95% CIs were calculated using bootstrapping. The analysis included 247 participants (n = 141 for specialist physiotherapy, n = 106 for TAU). The mean cost per participant for specialist physiotherapy was £646 (SD 72) compared with £272 (SD 374) for TAU. Including the costs of treatment, the adjusted mean health and social care cost per participant at 12 months for specialist physiotherapy was £3,814 (95% CI £3,194-£4,433) compared with £3,670 (95% CI £2,931-£4,410) for TAU, with a mean incremental cost of £143 (95% CI £-825 to £1,112). There was no significant difference in QALYs over the 12-month duration of the trial (0.030, 95% CI -0.007 to 0.067). The mean incremental cost per QALY was £4,133 with an 86% probability of being cost-effective at a £20,000 threshold. When broader societal costs such as loss of productivity were taken into consideration, specialist physiotherapy was dominant (incremental cost: £-5,169, 95% CI £-15,394 to £5,056). FMD was associated with high health and social care costs. There is a high probability that specialist physiotherapy is cost-effective compared with TAU particularly when wider societal costs are taken into account.

Of 74 patients included, 57 were diagnosed with spasticity and 17 with dystonia. In total, 276 therapeutic cycles were administered. The dropout rates were 45.6% in the spasticity group and 41.2% in the dystonia group (P = 0.48). There was no significant difference in subjective motor improvement between dystonia and spasticity (P = 0.16). Dystonia patients reported significantly better pain relief (98.5 ± 4.9% vs. 72.4 ± 35.6% respectively, P < 0.001). Notably, 74.3% of dystonia treatments reported moderate or marked improvement, whereas only 54.0% of spasticity treatments did (P > 0.05), based on patient the global impression of change (PGI-C) scale. Side effects were infrequent. BT injections for limb spasticity and dystonia are partially effective. Nonetheless, the dropout rate is high. While BT injections are more effective in relieving pain for dystonia compared to spasticity, disease severity gradually improves over time in treated patients with spasticity but not with dystonia."

Herein, 3D T1-weighted MRI images were obtained from 159 patients with primary MS (31 with MS-I, 92 with MS-II, and 36 with MS-IV). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM), surface-based morphometry (SBM), and causal structural covariance network (CaSCN) were utilized to investigate morphological variations and causal relationships in structural changes across subtypes. The study revealed a decremental trend in gray matter volume (GMV) of the right precentral gyrus (PreCG.R), right calcarine cortex (CAL.R), left parietal association cortex (PAL.L), and left hippocampus (HIP.L) from MS-I to MS-IV, which negatively correlated with BFMDRS scores. The progression of GMV atrophy was followed by a trajectory from HIP.L to PAL.L with disease duration and from PAL.R to HIP.L/CAL.L/PreCG.R with increasing BFMDRS scores. Support vector machine (SVM) analysis indicated that these GMV changes might be served as potential biomarkers for diagnosing MS subtypes, with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.935, 0.864, and 0.882, respectively. The results suggest that the PreCG.R is a key region affected early in MS, with GMV reductions extending to other brain areas as the disease progresses, indicating a hierarchy of structural brain changes associated with disease duration in MS progression. Our study further provides evidence for the association of MS with extensive gray matter abnormalities."

    "abstract": "Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by repetitive muscle contractions, twisting movements, and abnormal posture, affecting 20% of pediatric arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) survivors. Recent studies have reported that children with dystonia are at higher risk of cognitive deficits. The connection between impaired motor outcomes and cognitive impairment in dystonia is not fully understood; dystonia might affect motor control alone, or it could also contribute to cognitive impairment through disruptions in higher-order motor processes. To assess the functional correlates underlying motor control in children with dystonia, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure frontal theta (4-8 Hz), motor beta (15-30 Hz), and sensorimotor gamma (60-90 Hz) activity during a \"go\"/\"no-go\" task. Beamformer-based source analysis was carried out on 19 post-stroke patients: nine with dystonia (mean age = 13.78, SD = 2.82, 8 females), 10 without dystonia (mean age = 12.90, SD = 3.54, 4 females), and 17 healthy controls (mean age = 12.82, SD = 2.72, 8 females). To evaluate inhibitory control, frontal theta activity was analyzed during correct \"no-go\" (successful withhold) trials. To assess motor execution and sensorimotor integration, movement time-locked beta and sensorimotor gamma activity were analyzed during correct \"go\" trials. Additionally, the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) color-word interference task was used as a non-motor, inhibitory control task to evaluate general cognitive inhibition abilities. During affected hand use, dystonia patients had higher \"no-go\" error rates (failed withhold) compared to all other groups. Dystonia patients also exhibited higher frontal theta power during correct withhold responses for both affected and unaffected hands compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, dystonia patients exhibited decreased movement-evoked gamma power and gamma peak frequency compared to non-dystonia patients and healthy controls. Movement-related beta desynchronization (ERD) activity was increased in non-dystonia patients for both hands compared to healthy participants. These results confirm that post-stroke dystonia is associated with impaired frontally mediated inhibitory control, as reflected by increased frontal theta power. Post-stroke dystonia patients also exhibited reduced motor gamma activity during movement, reflecting altered sensorimotor integration. The increased beta ERD activity in non-dystonia patients may suggest compensatory sensorimotor plasticity not observed in dystonia patients. These findings suggest that differences in motor outcomes in childhood stroke result from a combination of cognitive and motor deficits."

This enzyme is crucial for the production of thiamine pyrophosphate, the active form of thiamine, a vital coenzyme in numerous metabolic pathways. The clinical presentation exhibits a diverse range of manifestations. In this review, we explore reported cases in the literature and present two cases representing the extremes of the clinical spectrum: recurrent ataxia and Leigh syndrome. The former phenotype follows a milder course. The second one is characterized by early onset and severe symptoms, including dystonia, epilepsy, and developmental regression, progressing rapidly to severe disability with high mortality. Typically, children exposed to infectious or traumatic triggers display episodes marked by ataxia and dystonia, with periods of good health or only mild disabilities in between. Treatment with the phosphorylated thiamine active bioform, TPP, is more effective in the recurrent ataxia form, especially when initiated promptly at symptom onset. Further studies are needed to identify available biomarkers and establish correlations between different variants, severity, and treatment response."

Recently, several studies have led to the discovery of a new drug for the treatment of NEDAMSS. CuII (atsm) (copper II diacetylbis(4-methylaminouracil)) (CuATSM) is a small-molecular-weight drug that can be administered orally and then used in the human body. The literature suggests that the underlying mechanism of CuATSM involves the restoration of mitochondrial function, including correction of the mitochondrial differentiation and mislocalization observed in cells from NEDAMSS patients, but extensive trials are needed to demonstrate its efficacy in IFR2BPL-related diseases."

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation offers a unique opportunity to record neural activity of the basal ganglia. While much work in dystonia has focused on the globus pallidus internus, expanding research to investigate subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity in various dystonia types is critical to provide a comprehensive understanding of dystonia pathophysiology. STN and cortex activity were recorded from 17 patients with cervical dystonia (CD), 19 with Meige syndrome, and 9 with generalized dystonia (GD) during the lead externalized period. We investigated local and network oscillatory characteristics, including power, bursts, and coherence. Additionally, we explored the relationship between these features and the severity of dystonic symptoms within each group and conducted a comparative analysis across the different dystonia types. Peaks of low-frequency (4-13 Hz) and beta (14-30 Hz) power were present in the STN of all patients; most of the beta peaks are distributed in the high beta range (20-30 Hz). The CD and GD groups showed longer low-frequency bursts and greater high beta power in STN than the Meige group. Interestingly, the CD group showed stronger STN-cortex low-frequency coherence, while the GD group had stronger STN-cortex high beta coherence. Combined, low-frequency and beta features could predict symptom severity with a performance of 73% in the CD group and 82% in the GD group. Low-frequency and high-beta oscillations are present in the STN across all three types of dystonia. The distinct patterns may be associated with different underlying pathological mechanisms."

    "abstract": "A comprehensive, patient-centered conceptual model of early Parkinson's is lacking and is greatly needed. A systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative and quantitative research was conducted by a multi-stakeholder taskforce using JBI Mixed Methods Review criteria and GRADE-CERQual standards for assessment of evidence. Over 340 symptoms and impacts were identified across ten symptom domains (Movement, Cognitive, Psychiatric, Sleep, Sensory, Speech, Digestive, Urinary, Sexual, Autonomic) and two impact domains (Physical and Psychosocial functioning). A wide range of motor and non-motor symptoms were present in early disease, with strongest support for tremor, dexterity, gait, stiffness, slow movements, cognitive, mood, and sleep alterations, urinary dysfunction, constipation, pain, and fatigue. These affected mobility, self-concept, coping, effort of living, interactions and important activities, with evidence of many understudied concepts. This model offers the most comprehensive catalogue of symptoms and impacts in Parkinson's to date and will support clinical practice and endpoint selection for therapeutic trials."

    "abstract": "Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia is a rare movement disorder that typically has a genetic basis, with PRRT2 being the primary causative gene. However, TMEM151A mutations have recently emerged as causative factors. Here, we report the cases of two Japanese siblings diagnosed with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia caused by a novel heterozygous TMEM151A frameshift variant (c.760_761insT). Case 1 was a 17-year-old male who had experienced involuntary movements triggered by sudden actions since the age of 12 years. Carbamazepine alleviated the symptoms but caused side effects, leading to a switch to lacosamide, which was effective. Case 2 was a 14-year-old female who experienced subtle discomfort at the onset of physical activity. Genetic analysis confirmed the presence of the same TMEM151A variant in both siblings. Lacosamide effectively managed the patients' symptoms. TMEM151A-positive paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia differs phenotypically from PRRT2-positive paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, presenting later onset and shorter-duration dystonia. Case 1 presented with dystonia with a relatively long duration of 15 s. We also found differences in involuntary movements among siblings. This report emphasizes the clinical and genetic diversity of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, which may lead to challenges in diagnosing sporadic cases, and finally, reports on the efficacy of lacosamide as a treatment."

    "abstract": "Writer's cramp (WC) dystonia is a disabling brain disorder characterized by abnormal postures during writing tasks. Although abnormalities were identified in the sensorimotor, parietal, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, the network-level interactions between these brain regions and dystonia symptoms are not well understood. This study investigated the relationship between peak accelerations, an objective measure of writing dysfluency, and functional network (FN) activation in WC and healthy volunteers (HVs). Twenty WC and 22 HV performed a writing task using a kinematic software outside an MRI scanner and repeated it during functional MRI. Group independent component analysis identified 21 FNs, with left sensorimotor, superior parietal, cerebellum, and basal ganglia FNs selected for further analysis. These FNs were activated during writing and no group differences in FN activity were observed. Correlational analysis between FN activity and peak acceleration behavior revealed that reduced activity in left sensorimotor and superior parietal FNs correlated with greater writing dysfluency in WC, a pattern distinct from HVs. These findings suggest that enhanced activation of the left sensorimotor and superior parietal networks may mitigate writing dysfluency in WC. This study provides a mechanistic hypothesis to guide the development of network-based neuromodulation therapies for WC dystonia."

A systematic review of the literature was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines searching Embase, Medline, and Cochrane with the cover period January 1960-August 2024. The search strategy used was ((\"Laryngeal Dystonia\" OR \"Spasmodic Dysphonia\") AND (\"Neuromodulation\" OR \"Deep Brain Stimulation\")). Articles were reviewed and screened based on the set inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklists were used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. Patient demographics and diagnosis, neuromodulation therapy used and its details, voice outcomes, and complications were extracted from each of the studies. A narrative review was subsequently synthesized. Twelve studies met the selection criteria and were included. In total, 130 LD patients were identified with the following neuromodulation therapies being evaluated for their use in LD: vibro-tactile stimulation, laryngeal electrical stimulation, pharmacologic (sodium oxybate), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and deep brain stimulation (DBS). All included studies reported various degrees of improvement in patients' voice symptoms with the neuromodulation therapy used. No definitive conclusion could be drawn for their efficacy within the included studies consisting of six case reports, three proof-of-concept/pilot studies, and three phase I clinical trials that used a number of different voice outcome measures used to report treatment effects, and a general lack of long-term follow-up. No significant complications were reported for any of the neuromodulation therapies. Most neuromodulation therapies being explored for LD are at a very early exploratory stage. Although more clinical trials are required, from the available evidence, sodium oxybate and DBS currently appear to have the most potential for translation into clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a rare hereditary autoinflammatory disease of subacute encephalopathy, characterized by a wide range of neurological and extra-neurological manifestations, primarily affecting the brain and skin. Key features include increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), acquired microcephaly, dystonia, spasticity, chilblains, and panniculitis. Radiological findings include cerebral calcifications, leukodystrophy, cerebral atrophy, and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities such as chronic lymphocytosis and elevated interferon-alpha (INF-α) levels. Seven pathogenic genes have been identified in association with AGS. The management of AGS is primarily supportive, as there is currently no definitive cure for the condition. The primary goals are to address symptoms, improve quality of life, and prevent complications. The aim of this study was to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis of this rare genetic condition, as timely identification enables prompt intervention and management. Early diagnosis improves clinical outcomes, enhances the quality of life for affected individuals, and provides valuable guidance for family planning and genetic counseling."

    "abstract": "Leigh syndrome (LS) is a severe neurodegenerative condition with an early onset, typically during early childhood or infancy. The disorder exhibits substantial clinical and genetic diversity. From a clinical standpoint, Leigh syndrome showcases a broad range of irregularities, ranging from severe neurological issues to minimal or no discernible abnormalities. The central nervous system is most affected, resulting in psychomotor retardation, seizures, nystagmus, ophthalmoparesis, optic atrophy, ataxia, dystonia, or respiratory failure. Some patients also experience involvement of the peripheral nervous system, such as polyneuropathy or myopathy, as well as non-neurological anomalies, such as diabetes, short stature, hypertrichosis, cardiomyopathy, anemia, renal failure, vomiting, or diarrhea (Leigh-like syndrome). Mutations associated with Leigh syndrome impact genes in both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Presently, LS remains without a cure and shows limited response to various treatments, although certain case reports suggest potential improvement with supplements. Ongoing preclinical studies are actively exploring new treatment approaches. This review comprehensively outlines the genetic underpinnings of LS, its current treatment methods, and preclinical investigations, with a particular focus on treatment."

This review seeks to summarise all available data on the recently identified autosomal recessive subtype of dystonia caused by variants in <i>AOPEP</i>, focusing on the geographical origins of affected families, mutational spectrum, phenotypic expressions and pathophysiology. <i>AOPEP</i>-related dystonia, documented as Zech-Boesch syndrome in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database, has been diagnosed in cohorts around the globe including under-represented populations with increased rates of consanguinity. Predictably leading to loss of protein function, the majority (74%) of disease-associated <i>AOPEP</i> alleles are protein-truncating variants comprising homozygous and compound heterozygous stop-gain, frameshift and splice-site changes. The dystonic disorder shows onset from childhood to the fourth decade and generalises in a significant proportion of cases (60%). Variable expressivity and age-related penetrance are likely to play a role in manifestation of the condition, consistent with occasional occurrence of <i>AOPEP</i> homozygous pathogenic variants in subjects without a diagnosis of dystonia. <i>AOPEP</i> encodes aminopeptidase O, a proteolytic processing enzyme that is preferentially expressed in glia and potentially linked to endosomal-lysosomal pathways. <i>AOPEP</i>-related autosomal recessive Zech-Boesch syndrome is of worldwide relevance for the diagnosis of genetic dystonia.

This review takes a dive into the pharmacological side of this important part of CNS function, taking into consideration muscarinic receptors and cholinesterase enzymes. Targeting a specific subtype of five primary muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1-M5) through agonism or antagonism may benefit patients; thus, there is a great pharmaceutical research interest. Inhibition of AChE and BChE, orthosteric or allosteric, or partial agonism of M1 mAChR are correlated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms improvement. Agonism or antagonism on different muscarinic receptor subunits may lessen schizophrenia symptoms (especially positive allosteric modulation of M4 mAChR). Selective antagonism of M4 mAChR is a promising treatment for Parkinson's disease and dystonia, and the adverse effects are limited compared to inhibition of all five mAChR. Additionally, selective M5 antagonism plays a role in drug independence behavior. M3 mAChR overexpression is associated with malignancies, and M3R antagonists seem to have a therapeutic potential in cancer, while M1R and M2R inhibition leads to reduction of neoangiogenesis. Depending on the type of cancer, agonism of mAChR may promote cancer cell proliferation (as M3R agonism does) or protection against further tumor development (M1R agonism). Thus, there is an intense need to discover new potent compounds with specific action on muscarinic receptor subtypes. Chemical structures, chemical modification of function groups aiming at action enhancement, reduction of adverse effects, and optimization of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics (DMPK) will be further discussed, as well as protein-ligand docking."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Botulinum toxin (BoNT), produced by Clostridium botulinum, has transitioned from being a lethal neurotoxin to a versatile therapeutic agent. Its ability to inhibit neurotransmitter release by targeting Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment Protein Receptor (SNARE) proteins underpins its applications in treating conditions such as spasticity, dystonia, chronic pain, and overactive bladder. The clinical and pharmacological properties of BoNT have been extensively studied, with significant advancements in its therapeutic use, safety profile, and understanding of associated adverse effects. <b>Objective:</b> This comprehensive review aims to consolidate historical developments, molecular mechanisms, clinical applications, and challenges associated with BoNT, with a focus on expanding its therapeutic scope while ensuring safety and efficacy. <b>Method:</b> A narrative approach was used to analyze and synthesize insights from 155 references spanning experimental studies, clinical trials, and reviews. Key topics included BoNT's historical milestones, mechanisms of action, therapeutic applications, and adverse events. <b>Findings:</b> BoNT demonstrates remarkable efficacy in a wide range of medical and cosmetic applications. In movement disorders such as dystonia and spasticity, it reduces muscle overactivity and improves functional outcomes. In chronic pain management, including migraines and neuropathic pain, BoNT significantly alleviates symptoms by modulating neurotransmitter activity. Cosmetic use for conditions like glabellar lines and hyperhidrosis highlights its precision and safety when administered appropriately. For conditions like strabismus and blepharospasm, BoNT effectively restores muscle control, reducing involuntary contractions. In urological applications, BoNT has proven to be an effective therapy for overactive bladder, offering significant symptom relief in refractory cases. However, concerns about long-distance effects, where the toxin may spread beyond the injection site to affect distant muscles or systems, have been reported in certain high-dose or sensitive populations. These findings emphasize the importance of dose optimization and patient-specific approaches. Adverse effects such as localized pain, hematoma, dysphagia, and systemic effects, particularly in high-risk groups, underscore the need for careful monitoring. The development of immunogenicity, leading to neutralizing antibodies, remains a challenge that impacts long-term therapeutic efficacy. Emerging research on novel serotypes, including BoNT/X, and innovations in delivery mechanisms, offer promising avenues to address current limitations. Advances in optimizing dosing regimens and refining injection techniques have also contributed to minimizing complications and improving outcomes across diverse patient populations. <b>Conclusions:</b> BoNT remains a cornerstone in neurology and cosmetic medicine, with its therapeutic potential still expanding. The balance between efficacy and safety, driven by innovations in formulation and application, underscores the importance of continued research. Future directions should focus on minimizing adverse effects, reducing immunogenicity, and exploring novel indications to further enhance its clinical utility."

As a treatable condition, it must be diagnosed and treated to improve the patients' functional outcome and quality of life. We describe the case of a woman affected by progressive gait impairment and lower limb rigidity, started at the age of 15. For talipes equinovarus (clubfoot), she underwent Achilles tendon lengthening and anterior tibial haemitendon transposition surgery. Family history collection revealed that her mother had been diagnosed with spastic paraparesis in adolescence. Clinical phenotype and family history suggested a diagnosis of hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP), supported by a mild involvement of the pyramidal tract in lower limbs at the motor evoked potential. Clinical evaluation revealed the presence of mild signs of dystonia, as a foot and cervical dystonia and upper limbs dystonic tremor. Indeed, a virtual panel for dystonia genes showed a pathogenic splice-site variant in GCH1. The patient was diagnosed with DRD and low doses of levodopa were started with clinical improvement of both gait and dystonia. We describe the clinical history of a patient with dopa responsive dystonia, which was initially diagnosed with HSP. Misdiagnosis can result in a significant delay in diagnosis and treatment initiation, so it is of the utmost importance to identify these patients without delay, looking for the presence of soft dystonia signs and performing an empirical trial with low doses of levodopa."

This retrospective cohort study used longitudinal patient-level data from Optum's de-identified Market Clarity Data to evaluate rates of dysphagia in patients with CD exposed and unexposed to BoNT. Patients ≥18 years of age with ≥2 CD diagnoses ≥30 days apart during the study period (1 January 2017-30 September 2021) who had ≥180 days of continuous health plan enrollment prior to the cohort entry date (first CD diagnosis) were included. Overall, the mean (SD) age of all CD patients (Cohort 1; N = 81,884) was 54.00 (16.21) years, and they were mostly female (67.9%) and white (76.96%). BoNT-Exposed patients (Cohort 2; N = 19,244) had a higher incidence of dysphagia (16.3%) and comorbid conditions when compared with BoNT-Unexposed patients (Cohort 3; N = 61,154 [12.1%]). Overall, patients with pre-existing dysphagia, other dystonias, and comorbid neurologic conditions at baseline also had higher proportions of dysphagia. This real-world analysis indicates that comorbid conditions predispose patients with CD to a greater dysphagia risk during treatment."

Here, we assessed the residual therapeutic efficacy of BoNT injections at the time of a patient-desired re-treatment. In pivotal trials for daxibotulinumtoxinA (DAXI) in CD, subjects could request re-treatment before returning to pre-treatment symptom levels (defined as ≤20% of peak efficacy remaining). In this post hoc analysis of the Phase 3 ASPEN-OLS trial, the median percent efficacy remaining (based on change in TWSTRS total score) was determined in subjects who requested re-injection before returning to pre-treatment symptoms. Dysphagia and muscle weakness were evaluated in patients requesting re-treatment with efficacy remaining, relative to those waiting to return to baseline. There were 264 (28.7% of 920 total treatments) patient requests for re-treatment before returning to pre-treatment status across the study. The median percent efficacy remaining at the time of requested re-injection was 45.5%, which corresponded to a median of 16.0 weeks (range 10.9-40.3) post-treatment. The rates of dysphagia (≤4.9%) and muscle weakness (≤6.8%) were low and were not significantly different in those who waited for return to pre-treatment symptom status versus subjects who requested re-injection with efficacy remaining. A significant proportion of CD patients wished to be re-treated with efficacy still remaining from prior BoNT injections as early symptoms re-emerged. With the overall clinical profile of DAXI, physicians can safely provide individualized treatment regimens based on the treatment goals or symptomatic needs of their patients."

Treatment of RD is challenging and often confounded by significant diagnostic delays due to overlapping symptomatology with other conditions. This case series examines the relationship between stiff knee gait RD and musculoskeletal (MSK) knee pathology. Eight RD cases, evaluated at the NIH Movement Disorders Clinic since 2018, were retrospectively reviewed. Patients underwent neurological, biomechanical, and MSK evaluations, including 3D motion analysis, surface electromyography, and knee ultrasound. Therapeutic interventions, including botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injections, were assessed. Seven patients demonstrated stiff knee gait subtypes, with all having ipsilateral and/or contralateral knee effusions or tendinopathies. Three patients who received MSK interventions (e.g., aspiration, corticosteroid injections) combined with BoNT therapy experienced significant symptom improvement. One patient with isolated foot dystonia displayed different biomechanical patterns without knee pathology. RD patients with stiff knee gait often exhibit knee pathology, most likely due to altered biomechanics and running history. Addressing both issues is essential for optimizing treatment outcomes, reducing pain, and improving function, especially since pain can trigger dystonia. Future research should determine the ideal sequence of interventions for RD patients with MSK issues to develop effective, personalized treatment algorithms."

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus on chromosome 6 is a polymorphic region with complex linkage patterns that has been implicated in several autoimmune and neurological disorders. The HLA locus has not been systematically examined in PSP. It is unclear whether tau and HLA can interact to induce an autoimmune disease mechanism. We evaluated an autopsy confirmed PSP cohort (n = 44) and compared allele/haplotype frequencies to those of the reference group of a local deceased Canadian donor pool. We performed HLA-Tau peptide binding prediction and modelling of HLA Class II - Tau Peptide interactions. Odds ratio was 2.94 (95 % CI 1.01 to 8.55; p = 0.047) for DQB1*06:01 allele, and 2.59 (95 % CI 1.39 to 4.83; p = 0.0025) for the narcolepsy-associated haplotype (DRB1*15:01-DQB1*06:02). One patient with 4-repeat tau PSP-type pathology was a carrier of the IgLON5-associated haplotype (DRB1*10:01-DQB1*05:01). HLA-Tau peptide binding prediction and modelling of HLA Class II - Tau Peptide interactions revealed strong-binding tau peptides but not the PSP-protofilament fold for alleles DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02 and DQA1*01:03-DQB1*06:01.

Retrotransposons are a type of mobile genetic element that are increasingly revealed to play a role in these diseases. This review provides a detailed overview of recent developments in the study of retrotransposons in neurodevelopment, neuroaging, and neurological diseases. Retrotransposons, including long interspersed nuclear elements-1, Alu, SINE-VNTR-Alu, and endogenous retrovirus, play important regulatory roles in the development and aging of the nervous system. They have also been implicated in the pathological processes of several neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Retrotransposons provide a new perspective for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neurological diseases and provide insights into diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of these diseases."

    "title": "Sleep disturbances are related to glymphatic dysfunction in blepharospasm.",
    "abstract": "Research has shown a close relationship between sleep and glymphatic function, with impaired glymphatic function potentially contributing to sleep problems in a bidirectional way. However, its role in sleep disturbances associated with dystonia remains unknown. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate whether glymphatic function is impaired in dystonia and to explore its relationship with sleep disturbances. We conducted structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) on two large cohorts: patients with blepharospasm (BSP, n = 45) and cervical dystonia (CD, n = 43), alongside age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Anxiety, depression, and sleep quality were evaluated using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. Analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index and choroid plexus volume (CPV) was used to assess glymphatic function in these participants. Patients with BSP and CD had higher HAMA, HAMD, and PSQI scores than those of HCs. Patients with BSP exhibited a lower DTI-ALPS index and larger CPV than those of HCs, while no significant differences were found between CD and HCs. In BSP and CD, PSQI scores positively correlated with HAMA and HAMD scores and negatively with the DTI-ALPS index in BSP. Multivariate analysis identified the DTI-ALPS index as a dependent predictive factor of the PSQI in patients with BSP. Our findings suggest that glymphatic function varies across types of focal dystonia, with glymphatic dysfunction potentially playing an important role in the pathogenesis of sleep disturbances in BSP."

    "title": "Positive Pyramidal Sign as an Unexpected Presentation in Antipsychotic-Induced Acute Dystonia: Case Reports and Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Acute drug-induced dystonia (DID) is an extrapyramidal side effect triggered by certain medications, primarily antipsychotics. It presents as acute involuntary muscle contractions, causing twisting, repetitive movements, or abnormal postures. Pyramidal signs, typically from upper motor neuron damage, are characterized by positive pathological reflexes, increased muscle tone, and hyperactive tendon reflexes. This study describes 2 cases of acute DID following antipsychotic treatment, both presenting with positive pyramidal sign. A literature review was conducted to find reports of abnormal pyramidal signs in acute DID cases, focusing on medical tests for differential diagnosis and neurological assessments related to DID. After reviewing the detailed medication history and conducting comprehensive tests, it was concluded that risperidone and haloperidol caused DID. Adjusting the medication and providing symptomatic treatment led to significant improvement. These cases highlight the importance of being alert to the possibility of acute DID when using antipsychotics and pyramidal signs appear, providing insights for future research into the mechanisms of these unusual symptoms."

    "title": "Case Report: Monitoring neuromuscular fatigue through jump performance over two seasons in a cerebral palsy sprinter.",
    "abstract": "World Para Athletics classifies athletes with brain injury, cerebral palsy, and motor coordination impairments into Group Class 31 to 38. Para athletes who can run and jump but are affected by impairments such as athetosis, ataxia, and dystonia, which impact all four limbs and the trunk, are categorized as Class T36. Monitoring training load and performance is essential for guiding training programs and preventing injuries in this population. Vertical jumps are commonly used to assess neuromuscular parameters in athletes with cerebral palsy. In this study, we tracked performance changes and monitored vertical jump height and power over two competitive seasons in a sprinter with cerebral palsy. The sprinter has had cerebral palsy since birth and is classified in the T36 class. Over two competitive seasons, his neuromuscular performance was monitored weekly using vertical jump tests, particularly Countermovement and Squat Jumps. His running performance was assessed through competition results. The parameters measured included Jump height and Peak power (W<sub>PEAK</sub>), which was calculated as the highest value from the curve obtained by multiplying the ground reaction force by the velocity during the concentric phase of the jump, normalized by body mass. Additionally, his official race times for the 100 m, 200 m, and 400 m events were recorded from January 2017 to October 2018. The absolute and relative sprint performance values improved significantly between the first and the best official results: 100 m (from 15.05 s to 13.97 s = -7.1%), 200 m (from 31.30 s to 29.05 s = -7.1%); and 400 m (from 71.60 s to 66.24 s = -7.4%). The correlation between vertical jump parameters and sprint performance results was large to very large for the 100 m and 200 m events (<i>r</i> = 0.55-0.87). The Para athlete demonstrated improved performance over two seasons and didn't sustain any injuries. These findings suggest that monitoring jump performance is a valuable and practical method for tracking training loads and predicting sprint performance. Further, longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the applicability of vertical jumps as a tool for coaches to monitor training load and performance across athletes with CP from various track classifications and event types."

    "abstract": "Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment option for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and dystonia, so more and more patients (over 160,000 patients till 2019) worldwide have undergone DBS for a variety of neurological and non-neurological conditions, with numbers increasing each year. This case series primarily discusses a very rare complication following DBS surgery -- brain abscess. We administered vancomycin and metronidazole to patients who developed brain abscesses after undergoing DBS surgery based on previous literature. After treatment, the abscess lesions and infection symptoms completely resolved, resulting in a good therapeutic outcome without the removal of the DBS system. In previous studies, similar cases always involved surgical intervention to drain the pus while also removing the DBS system; however, in our cases, the patient did not have the DBS system removed and achieved a good prognosis. To our knowledge, our two cases are among the few where a conservative treatment approach has been used for brain abscesses after DBS surgery."

    "abstract": "Musician's dystonia is the most common form of focal task-specific dystonia and is suggested to be the result of dysfunctional communication among sensory-motor networks. Thus far, few functional connectivity studies have investigated musician's dystonia specifically, leaving its exact pathophysiological mechanisms unclear. The goal of this study was to verify connectivity findings from other task-specific dystonias on a large sample of musician's hand dystonia patients and to analyze associations with possible adverse childhood experiences, a suggested risk factor for dystonia. Forty professional musicians suffering from musician's hand dystonia and a matched control group of healthy musicians underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and answered the childhood trauma questionnaire. Using a seed-to-whole brain approach, functional connectivity alterations between motor cortices, the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia and the thalamus were analyzed. Musician's dystonia patients showed increased functional connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the putamen and the pallidum, especially in right-side affected patients. Patients further displayed increased connectivity of the left thalamus and the right lateral premotor cortex. No associations between functional connectivity, duration of disorder and childhood adversity were observed. The findings are consistent with previous research, highlighting the pathophysiological importance of the basal ganglia. Altered resting-state functional connectivity may reflect underlying neuroplastic changes in musicians with dystonia that lead to an altered flow of information, disrupting movement inhibition. Involvement of the dorsolateral prefrontal and premotor cortices further suggests that motor disturbances occur in the early planning phase of a movement. The findings indicate that a holistic re-training approach with and without the instrument could be beneficial for regaining motor control."

    "abstract": "Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) is commonly used to treat secondary generalized dystonia. Intraventricular baclofen (IVB) has been shown to be a safe alternative treatment with low complications. The objective of this study was to report the long-term effects of IVB. This retrospective analysis included patients who underwent IVB therapy from April 2005 to June 2024. The decision to use IVB and the surgical technique have been previously described. Data collection included sex, race, etiology of dystonia, Gross Motor Functional Classification System scores, Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale (BADS) scores, Ashworth Scale scores, medical and surgical management of dystonia, follow-up duration, and complications. Patients whose IVB pump was removed within 1 year and those with less than 1 year of follow-up were excluded. Thirty-six patients with IVB were identified, and 27 patients (median age 12.9 years) were ultimately included. The most common cause of secondary dystonia was cerebral palsy in 21 patients (78%), followed by metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders in 4 (14%), infection in 1 (4%), and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in 1 (4%). The follow-up duration ranged from 1.2 to 16.7 years, with a median of 7.7 years and mean of 8.4 years. The baclofen dosage was twice as high in patients with metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders compared with those with cerebral palsy, TBI, and infection, with median dosages of 1455 μg/day and 725 μg/day, respectively. Both posttreatment BADS and Ashworth Scale scores showed statistically significant improvement. Complications included infection that necessitated pump removal in 1 patient (4%), wound dehiscence that was treated with wound revision and antibiotics in 1 patient (4%), and hydrocephalus that required CSF diversion in 4 patients (15%). In 2 patients, IVB therapy was ineffective at controlling dystonia and, thus, was discontinued after 1.3 and 2.7 years. One patient asked for the pump to be removed after 1.2 years due to \"does not like the physical pump itself.\" Four patients (15%) developed hydrocephalus, which required CSF diversion via a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in 3 patients and a lumboperitoneal shunt in 1 patient, with no further shunt or IVB complications. IVB is well tolerated in patients with generalized secondary dystonia refractory to conventional medical therapy, ITB, and deep brain stimulation. Positive long-term outcomes were reported in this cohort, with significant improvement in dystonia and overall complication rates similar to those reported with ITB."

    "abstract": "Dystonias are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that result in altered physiology associated with motor movements. Both the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, brain regions involved in motor learning, sensory perception integration, and reward, have been implicated in the pathology of dystonia, but the cellular and subcellular mechanisms remain diverse and for some forms of dystonia, elusive. The goal of the current review is to summarize recent evidence of cerebellar involvement in different subtypes of dystonia with a focus on Purkinje cell (PC) and cerebellar nuclei (CN) dysfunction, to find commonalities in the pathology that could lay the groundwork for the future development of therapeutics for patients with dystonia. Here we will briefly discuss the physical and functional connections between the basal ganglia and the cerebellum and how these connections could contribute to dystonic symptoms. We proceed to use human and animal model data to discuss the contributions of cerebellar cell types to specific dystonias and movement disorders where dystonia is a secondary symptom. Ultimately, we suggest PC and CN irregularity could be a locus for dystonia through impaired calcium dynamics."

We optimized an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-compatible variant of the <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> Cas9 nuclease ortholog (SaCas9-KKH) in DYT1 patient-derived human neuronal progenitor cells (hNPCs). On-target editing of the <i>TOR1A</i> DYT1 allele was confirmed at the genomic level from brain tissue in a xenograft mouse model. To avoid brain biopsy for demonstrating <i>TOR1A</i> DYT1 editing, we developed a non-invasive monitoring method using extracellular RNA (exRNA). <i>TOR1A</i> exRNA was retrieved from the extracellular vesicle (EV) secretions of hNPCs and plasma samples, indicating whether the donor was a <i>TOR1A</i> DYT1 carrier. This technique enabled us to assess AAV-mediated disruption of the <i>TOR1A</i> DYT1 allele in the brains of mice using blood samples."

Mutations in the gene have been linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, resulting in developmental delay, intellectual disability, ataxia, tremor, autism, seizures, and visual impairment. A patient who has a missense mutation in the MAPK8IP3 gene (c. 1714 C>T, Arg578Cys) (R578C) manifests dystonia, gross motor delay, and developmental delay. Here, we showed that the mutation was a toxic gain-of-function mutation that altered the interactome of JIP3; disrupted axonal transport of late endosomes; increased signaling via c-Jun N-terminal kinase, resulting in apoptosis; and disrupted dopamine receptor 1 signaling while not affecting dopamine receptor 2 signaling. Furthermore, in the presence of the mutant protein, we showed that an 80% reduction of mutant JIP3 and a 60% reduction of WT JIP3 by non-allele-selective phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides was well tolerated by several types of cells in vitro. Our study identifies what we believe to be several important new roles for JIP3 and provides important insights for therapeutic approaches, including antisense oligonucleotide reduction of JIP3."

    "abstract": "Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by childhood-onset dystonia and a dramatic and sustained response to low doses of levodopa. Typically, DRD presents with gait disturbance due to foot dystonia, later development of parkinsonism, and diurnal fluctuation of symptoms. Since the discovery of mutations responsible for DRD in <i>GCH1</i>, coding for GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GTPCH) that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>: the cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase [TH]) biosynthesis, and in <i>TH</i>, coding for TH in catecholamine biosynthesis, our understanding of this syndrome has greatly increased. However, the underlying mechanisms of phenotypic heterogeneity are still unknown and physicians should learn from genetic, pathological, and biochemical findings of DRD. Neuropathological studies have shown a normal population of cells with decreased melanin and no Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra of classic GTPCH-deficient and TH-deficient DRD. Neurochemical investigations in GTPCH-deficient DRD have indicated that dopamine reduction in the striatum is caused not only by decreased TH activity resulting from low cofactor content but also by actual loss of TH protein without nerve terminal loss. This striatal TH protein loss may be due to a diminished regulatory effect of BH<sub>4</sub> on stability of TH molecules. Neurochemical findings in an asymptomatic <i>GCH1</i> mutation carrier versus symptomatic cases suggest that there may be additional genetic and/or environmental factors modulating the regulatory BH<sub>4</sub> effect on TH stability and that the extent of striatal protein loss in TH (rather than that in GTPCH) may be critical in determining the symptomatic state of GTPCH-deficient DRD."

Here we examined TUS-induced changes in the basal ganglia of 10 individuals with movement disorders (Parkinson's disease and dystonia) and 15 healthy participants. Local field potentials were recorded using deep brain stimulation (DBS) leads in the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Compared to sham, theta burst TUS (tbTUS) increased theta power during stimulation, while 10 Hz TUS enhanced beta power, with effects lasting up to 40 min. In healthy participants, a stop-signal task assessed tbTUS effects on the GPi, with pulvinar stimulation serving as an active sham. GPi TUS prolonged stop-signal reaction times, indicating impaired response inhibition, whereas pulvinar TUS had no effect. These findings provide direct electrophysiological evidence of TUS target engagement and specificity in deep brain structures, suggesting its potential as a noninvasive DBS strategy for neurological and psychiatric disorders."

Utilizing laryngeal high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV), this study investigates the glottal attack time (GAT) and glottal offset time (GOT) during soft, habitual, and hard glottal attack modalities in sustained phonation for several neurogenic voice disorders. HSV data and audio recordings were obtained simultaneously from 14 participants with neurogenic voice disorders and 14 normophonic participants during two productions of the /i/ vowel at soft, habitual, and hard glottal attacks. Using HSV, GAT, defined as the time interval between the first oscillation and the first contact of the vocal folds at phonation onset, and GOT, the time interval between the last oscillation and the last contact of the vocal folds at phonation offset, were measured. GAT and GOT for different glottal attack modalities were compared within each group, also among the different disorders and normophonic participants. Additionally, these values were compared between sustained phonation and connected speech for the normophonic participants and those with AdLD. The neurogenic disorders group exhibited significantly higher GAT values than the normophonic participants during the hard glottal attack modality. Habitual GOTs for vocal tremor were significantly different than those of unilateral vocal fold paralysis and AdLD. Moreover, the normophonic participants shared similar trends between connected speech and sustained phonation across glottal attack modalities for GAT, while the AdLD group did not. AdLD participants shared the same trend for GOT, while normophonic participants did not. This study provides evidence of differences in GAT and GOT values during sustained phonation across different neurogenic voice disorders, contributing to the understanding of their pathophysiology. These findings may inform the development of strategies and speech tasks for clinical assessment of neurogenic voice disorders."

We aimed to study the changes in these neurophysiological parameters in patients with dystonia using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Patients with primary dystonia of presumed genetic etiology (<i>n</i> = 36) and an equal number of healthy controls (HC) (<i>n</i> = 36) were recruited from May 2021 to September 2022. TMS was done using single and paired pulse paradigms. The left motor cortex was stimulated, and responses were recorded from the contralateral first dorsal interosseus muscle. Resting motor threshold (RMT), central motor conduction time, contralateral silent period (cSP), ipsilateral silent period (iSP), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) were recorded. All patients underwent whole exome sequencing. The mean age of patients was 36.6 ± 13.5 years.

A phenomenon suspected to be a sensory trick was observed, in which pressing on the frontal region above the eyebrows ceased the involuntary movements and was accompanied by compensatory contraction of the frontalis muscle. It was considered that this sensory trick, induced by pressure stimulation, led to the simultaneous occurrence of two distinct behaviors: the improvement of auricular dystonia and the emergence of involuntary contraction of the frontalis muscle. Botulinum toxin A was administered to both the auricular muscles and the frontalis muscle, resulting in favorable control of the symptoms. Reports of bilateral auricular dystonia are exceedingly rare. Moreover, the concurrent appearance of two types of sensory tricks - one alleviating dystonia and the other exacerbating it - is also uncommon. When administering botulinum toxin A injection in such cases, it may be beneficial to consider not only for the primary dystonia but also for the sites where reverse sensory tricks manifest, potentially achieving better outcomes."

Previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies examining whole-brain gray matter (GM) volume alterations in patients with ID have reported inconsistent and occasionally contradictory findings. We performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) using the latest seed-based d mapping with permutation of subject images (SDM-PSI) technique to identify consistent GM alterations in patients with ID at the whole-brain level. Additionally, meta-regression analyses were conducted to explore the potential moderating effects of age, gender, and disease duration on GM volume. The CBMA incorporated 27 VBM studies, comprising 32 datasets with a total of 840 patients with ID and 834 healthy controls. Our analysis did not identify consistent or reliable GM alterations in patients with ID. The robustness of these findings was confirmed through a jackknife sensitivity analysis. Meta-regression analyses revealed that disease duration significantly influenced GM volume in the right insula. Based on the best practice guidelines for CBMA, we utilized the most recent SDM-PSI algorithm to perform a new CBMA that included a larger group of individuals with ID. However, in contrast to previous CBMAs, we did not observe any consistent alterations in GM in ID. The findings suggest that using GM volume assessed by VBM as an imaging marker for ID may not be reliable. This could be attributed to ID being a functional disorder, or the inconsistency in GM alterations may be influenced by demographic and clinical variations, differences in imaging protocols and analysis methods, or small sample sizes. It is imperative to control for subject characteristics, employ standardized VBM methodologies, and enhance sample sizes in future research."

Over the past decade a number of inborn errors of metabolism have been identified, that affect different steps in vitamin absorption, transport, activation or recycling and repair of active vitamin cofactors. According to the respective cofactor function this may result in acute or chronic multisystem disease or in disorders that selectively affect the nervous system. Most of these disorders are amenable to specific treatment with excellent results, but diagnostic delay can lead to rapid, irreversible damage or even death. Therefore, especially in case of acute and severe neurologic presentations compatible with one of the here discused disorders, a vitamin trial should be considered while awaiting results of biochemical and genetic testing. Diagnosis of these disorders is especially rewarding, as treatment is often per oral, available worldwide and comparably cheap. This article will review current knowledge of the clinical presentation, biomarkers and specific treatment of inborn errors of vitamin metabolism and illustrates why child neurologists should have vitamins in their pockets."

The aim was to develop and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm for classifying tremors from hand-drawn pen-on-paper spirals. We recruited participants with dystonic tremor (DT), essential tremor (ET), essential tremor plus (ETP), Parkinson's disease (PD), cerebellar ataxia (AT), and healthy volunteers (HV). Participants drew free-hand spirals on paper, which were used to train a DL algorithm based on transfer learning using InceptionResNetV2 and Keras sequential model. We validated the model externally in two independent tremor cohorts, evaluating accuracy and F1 scores, and compared its performance to expert raters. We recruited 521 participants and obtained 2078 spirals (365 DT, 215 ET, 208 ETP, 212 PD, 78 AT, and 525 HV). Mean age of the participants was 46.1 ± 12.4 years, duration of illness was 8.9 ± 8.3 years, and the mean Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale score in patients was 32.4 ± 14.7. The DL classifier demonstrated an overall accuracy of 81% [95% confidence interval, CI: 0.77-0.85] in distinguishing among tremor syndromes. To mitigate the potential risks of data leakage and digital fingerprinting, the algorithm was redeveloped and reanalyzed, yielding an adjusted accuracy of 70% [95% CI: 0.66-0.74]. External validation on an independent cohort of 1535 spiral drawings resulted in an accuracy of 61% [95% CI: 0.59-0.63], with the adjusted algorithm achieving 59% [95% CI: 0.58-0.60], outperforming human raters (accuracy: 46%). Supervised DL algorithms can effectively detect tremor syndromes from hand-drawn spirals, offering unbiased, feature-independent classification with higher accuracy than human raters. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."

In this review, we focus on the shared genetic landscape of NDDs and movement disorders. Cumulative research has shown that up to 30% of cases labelled as \"cerebral palsy\" have a monogenic etiology. Causal pathogenic variants are particularly enriched in genes previously associated with adult-onset progressive movement disorders, such as spastic paraplegias, dystonias, and cerebellar ataxias. Biological pathways that have emerged as common culprits are transcriptional regulation, neuritogenesis, and synaptic function. Defects in the same genes can cause neurological dysfunction both during early development and later in life. We highlight the implications of the increasing number of NDD gene etiologies for genetic testing in movement disorders. Finally, we discuss gaps and opportunities in the translation of this knowledge to the bedside."

While effective settings reduce dystonia, excessive stimulation can worsen symptoms. Assessing DBS effects during office visits is challenging, as clinical changes can be delayed hours to days. We evaluated whether local field potentials (LFPs) could serve as an acute biomarker of excessive stimulation in dystonia patients. Real-time LFP band power and dystonia severity were quantified and compared during sequential changes in stimulation amplitude. Dystonia worsening was temporally associated with clinically evident and statistically significant increases in LFP band power during in-office DBS programming sessions. Although increased LFP band power correlated with clear clinical worsening in these patients, we anticipate that not all patients with dystonia will have such immediate signs of worsening. Increased LFP band power during incremented stimulation amplitude may represent a biomarker for patients at-risk of manifesting delayed clinical worsening."

SCAN is thought to interface between the phylogenetically newer primary motor regions that control fine movements and the cingulo-opercular network (CON) that putatively conveys cognitive intentions for action. We hypothesized that the effector-agnostic nature of SCAN may constitute a central pathology shared across focal dystonia subtypes affecting different body parts. Additionally, the effector-specific areas in the primary sensorimotor cortex may show distinct functional changes depending on the dystonic body region. We collected functional MRI from patients with either of two subtypes of focal dystonia (laryngeal dystonia or LD, <i>N</i> =24, and focal hand dystonia or FHD, <i>N</i> =18) and healthy control participants ( <i>N</i> =21). Regions of interest were selected based on prior work that suggested dystonia-related abnormality within the basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical and cerebello-thalamo-cortical sensorimotor circuitries. We investigated if focal dystonia is associated with resting-state functional connectivity changes 1) between SCAN and other cortical regions (effector-specific areas and CON), 2) between cortical and non-cortical regions, or 3) between non-cortical (subcortical and cerebellar) regions. Cortical regions were individualized based on resting-state data. Separately, individualized hand and mouth/larynx regions were also generated from task-based MRI (finger-tapping and phonation, respectively) for comparison. There was a shared interaction effect in both focal dystonia subtypes ( <i>p</i> =0.048 for LD, <i>p</i> =0.017 for FHD) compared to controls, which was driven by SCAN's higher functional connectivity to task-derived mouth/larynx region and concomitantly lower connectivity to CON. This dystonia-dependent interaction was not observed with the resting-state mouth/larynx region. No significant resting-state functional changes were observed involving subcortical and cerebellar regions when LD and FHD were modeled as independent groups. However, exploratory analysis combining LD and FHD suggested a dystonia-dependent asynchronization between SCAN and sensorimotor cerebellum ( <i>p</i> =0.010) that may indicate a pathological rather than compensatory process. For the first time, our study systematically tested circuitry-based functional connectivity changes in two focal dystonias. Our results show that SCAN is uniquely associated with dystonia dysfunction beyond the dystonic effector regions, potentially offering insights on pathophysiology and treatments."

    "abstract": "Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS, OMIM #300322) is a rare X-linked genetic disorder caused by variants in the <i>HPRT1</i> gene, which codes for the Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). <i>HPRT1</i> gene variants disrupt normal purine metabolism, leading to the involvement of multiple organ systems, primarily characterized by hyperuricemia, dystonia, and neurological abnormalities, which makes LNS clinically heterogeneous and diagnostically challenging. Here, we report a rare case of a 27-year-old Chinese male exhibiting severe lower limb motor disorders, hyperuricemia, and intellectual development delay. Blood tests showed hyperuricemia and whole exome sequencing (WES) identified a novel hemizygous variant in the <i>HPRT1</i> (NM-000194.3) gene: c.104T > C in exon 2, respectively. Bioinformatics techniques indicated that the variant may disrupt the activity of HGPRT. According to the clinical presentation, diagnostic examination, and WES results, the patient was finally diagnosed with LNS. This study identified a previously unreported pathogenic variant in the <i>HPRT1</i> gene. Although no curative therapy is currently available for <i>HPRT1</i> gene variants at present, a definite diagnosis of its genetic etiology is of great significance for genetic counseling and family planning."

    "abstract": "Thalamic infarctions represent a rare subset of ischemic strokes, characterized by a diverse array of clinical manifestations and significant diagnostic challenges. These infarctions can lead to a wide range of neurological deficits, depending on the specific vascular territory involved. Infarctions within the posterior circulation territory of P2, particularly those affecting the inferolateral and posterior choroidal arteries, are associated with distinct neurological symptoms, including contralateral sensory loss, hemiparesis, hemiataxia, thalamic hand, and various sensory and motor disturbances. We present the case of a 47-year-old woman with a unilateral thalamic infarction involving occlusion of the P2 branch of the posterior cerebral artery. The infarction, caused by a paradoxical embolism secondary to a high-grade patent foramen ovale (PFO) with an interatrial septal aneurysm, occurred in the absence of classic vascular risk factors. The patient exhibited a clinical syndrome consistent with ischemic lesions in the inferolateral and posterior choroidal arteries, manifesting as right-sided hemiparesthesia, hemiataxia with neuropathic pain, thalamic hand, dystonia, and tremor in the upper right limb. Early and precise clinical identification of thalamic infarctions, especially in rare cases involving multiple vascular territories, is essential for improving patient care and outcomes. Recognizing the spectrum of potential symptoms facilitates effective symptom management, minimizes the risk of secondary complications, and optimize neurological rehabilitation."

    "abstract": "Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by genetic and clinical heterogeneity. A recurring p.(Glu303del)-deletion in TOR1A is a well-established cause for DYT-TOR1A (DYT1), an autosomal dominant early-onset isolated dystonia. TOR1A encodes TorsinA, an AAA + ATPase located in the nuclear envelope. By whole exome analyses of a family with a novel dystonia-hemichorea-/hemiballism phenotype, we identified a TOR1AIP2 NM_001199260.2 c.1234A > G p.(Arg412Gly) variant. The variant is very rare in databases and was absent from whole exome data from >1000 dystonia patients. TOR1AIP2 encodes LULL1, a transmembrane protein that activates TorsinA, and correct interaction between TorsinA and LULL1 is essential for proper nuclear envelope architecture. The p.(Arg412Gly) variant disrupts the binding interface between TorsinA and LULL1 around p.Arg412; this same interface is also impaired in DYT1. Functional analyses via a co-purification assay revealed that interaction between TorsinA-LULL1<sup>Arg412Gly</sup> is weaker than the wild-type interaction, and that it resembles the situation in DYT1 (TorsinA<sup>ΔE303</sup>-LULL1). A second family with milder dystonia, hemichorea, and stereotypic leg flexion during gait and a TOR1AIP2 p.(Gln338His) variant was identified. The clinical phenotype of both families shared proximal arm movements, and flutter in facial musculature. Expressivity of the movement disorder symptoms was variable. Several proteins in the nuclear envelope have been implicated in various forms of neurodevelopmental disorders with dystonia. Taken together, our findings suggest TOR1AIP2 as a new candidate gene implicated in a complex hereditary movement disorder with dystonia and hemichorea/hemiballism."

    "abstract": "Patients with mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8, SLC16A2) suffer from X-linked recessive Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), which is characterized by developmental delay and a severe movement disorder. Current trials using thyroid hormone derivatives to overcome the transporter defect have failed to achieve patient-oriented therapeutic goals. Our aim was to define the type of movement disorder in AHDS in an observational cohort study and to investigate the causative role of the dopaminergic system. We present longitudinal clinical data from the DEEPTYPE registry of 11 patients with video documentation, standardized phenotyping, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, neuroimaging data, and the treatment response to levodopa/carbidopa supplementation. Children presented with signs of childhood parkinsonism, including hypokinesia, hypomimia, inability to sit or stand, rigidity, dystonia, and autonomic dysfunction. CSF homovanillic acid concentrations were decreased (n = 12), suggesting an isolated dopamine pathway impairment. Seven out of 8 patients responded favorably to l-dopa/carbidopa supplementation and we did not observe any adverse drug reactions. AHDS is associated with childhood parkinsonism, which is linked with biochemical abnormalities of dopamine metabolism. It can be treated with l-dopa/carbidopa supplementation. However, further research is needed to elucidate the exact effect of MCT8 deficiency on dopamine metabolism. © 2025 The Author(s).

To evaluate the diagnostic and treatment strategies in MDS used by experts from the European Reference Network for rare neurological diseases (ERN-RND), and to assess the diagnosis and management experience in patients with MDS. Two different questionnaires were distributed: one among neurologists from ERN-RND, and another among patients and families with SGCE-related MDS. Twenty-nine adult and child neurologists from 14 countries, and 84 patients and caregivers from 12 countries, replied to the surveys. All the patients included in the analysis had SGCE-related MDS. The mean age was 30.8 years (SD 19,9; range 3-75). Sixty-nine percent of patients were diagnosed in childhood and 70% had a positive family history. Most participants suffered from predominant upper body myoclonus and focal/segmental dystonia, hindering daily activities in 80% of patients, such as handwriting, drinking, feeding, walking and speech. Botulinum toxin and DBS were effective options for managing movement disorders compared to pharmacological treatments. However, neither of these therapies were applied optimally. We found deficiencies in recognition and management of academic difficulties, and a high unemployment rate. Despite all but one patient reported psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, depression or OCD, there was a lack of formal psychiatric evaluations. SGCE-MDS is a well-known neurological disorder among movement disorder specialists in Europe. Offering a multidisciplinary approach that tackles both movement disorders and neuropsychiatric comorbidities could enhance the diagnosis and treatment of patients with SGCE-MDS."

A retrospective study was carried out in patients diagnosed with CMT from October 2020 to March 2023, of the 98 subjects who met the inclusion criteria, 52 subjects underwent arthroscope-assisted treatment and 46 subjects treated with traditional open operation were recruited for the study. Clinical follow-up evaluation was evaluated using the modified Cheng scoring. Besides, the intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded. There was no statistically significant difference regarding gender proportion, surgical treatment age, and affected side (P > 0.05) between the two groups of patients. Besides, the difference on the operation duration between the two groups was not significant (P > 0.05). However, the incision length and postoperative hospitalization time in the arthroscope-assisted group were significantly shorter than those of the traditional open surgery group (P < 0.05). During the follow-up period, the torticollis deformity was effectively corrected and the postoperative scars were almost invisible in the arthroscope-assisted group. Based on the Cheng's scoring system, 50 (96.2 %) patients displayed excellent or good clinical results, and 2 (3.8 %) had fair outcomes in the arthroscope-assisted group, and the mean overall scores was comparable to the open surgery group (P > 0.05). Within the limitations of the study, arthroscope-assisted minimally invasive treatment represents a promising and effective surgical option for children with CMT."

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) for primary Meige syndrome has been increasingly reported in recent years. Despite the potential of this therapeutic approach, only a limited number of studies have evaluated its clinical benefits. Moreover, the efficacy of STN-DBS varies among patients with Meige syndrome, and stable prognostic predictors are scarce. In this study, the authors assessed the therapeutic effect of STN-DBS for Meige syndrome and explored reliable prognostic indicators to facilitate patient selection and postoperative programming. The authors enrolled 65 consecutive patients with Meige syndrome who underwent bilateral STN-DBS at their institution. Preoperative and postoperative motor symptoms were assessed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale movement (BFMDRS-M) and disability (BFMDRS-D) subscales. Leads were reconstructed in the standard space by using the Lead-DBS toolbox, and the volume of tissue activated (VTA) was calculated for each lead. Group comparisons and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate clinical and demographic factors influencing the improvement rates in BFMDRS-M scores. Significant postoperative improvements in the BFMDRS-M score (59.17% ± 28.0%, p < 0.001) and in the BFMDRS-D score (65.05% ± 38.9%, p < 0.001) were observed. Group comparisons indicated that the y-axis value of active contacts, the overlapping volume between VTAs and the STN sensorimotor region, as well as the distance from the center of active contacts to the surface of the STN sensorimotor region were significantly associated with the improvement rate of BFMDRS-M scores. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that both the overlapping volume between VTAs and bilateral STN sensorimotor regions-along with the involvement of the left STN limbic region-emerged as independent prognostic indicators for the improvement in BFMDRS-M scores. Bilateral STN-DBS proved to be a safe and effective treatment for Meige syndrome, and the STN sensorimotor region tended to be a desirable target. This study provided deeper insights into the clinical efficacy, patient selection, and targeting precision of STN-DBS treatment for Meige syndrome."

One of the most common causes is essential tremor, which needs to be distinguished from other types of tremors, such as those found in Parkinson's disease, cerebellar disease or dystonic tremor. This categorisation is important as their treatment and prognosis differ. This review focuses on two main characteristics of tremor to help with its differential diagnosis: 'The When', or conditions that enhance the tremor, which include action, postural, intentional components and resting tremor; and 'The Where' or the body location, which includes tremor in the upper limbs, head or voice."

Although neurological complications predominate and can lead to respiratory failure or death, no observational studies have specifically described their clinical features or prognoses. To characterise real-life clinical features and prognoses of botulinum toxin-related neurological complications. Observational, retrospective, nationwide pharmacovigilance study of all neurological adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to the use of botulinum toxin in France for neurological indications between 1994 and 2020. The characteristics of neurological complications were collected. In total, 141 people with systemic neurologic complications (ie, distant from the injection site) and 50 with local complications were included. Median (IQR) age was 53 (36; 66) years, and 107 (56 %) were women. The estimated incidence range (min-max) was 25 - 413 neurologic ADRs per 100 000 injection sessions for neurological indications. Except for 3 miscellaneous cases, all presented symptoms within the clinical spectrum of botulism, either as an isolated symptom (41 %) or as multiple symptoms (59 %), with a time to onset of 12 (7; 15) days after injection and a duration of 54 (28; 90) days. A total of 87 % of cases recovered spontaneously or were recovering on the date of the notification. Drug types were not different between cases with systemic or local ADRs, although the doses were higher in cases with systemic ADRs (P < 0.001). Serious cases were more frequent for systemic ADRs (67 % versus 34 %; P < 0.001). Three complications resulted in death, all after treatment for cervical dystonia or sialorrhea. In this pharmacovigilance study, the outcomes of botulism spectrum symptoms occurring after a botulinum toxin injection for a neurological indication were mostly favourable, although symptoms were often initially serious."

Currently, there are no standardized guidelines to treat this condition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of theophylline administration in improving symptoms and quality of life in patients with ADCY5-related dyskinesia. A retrospective study was conducted involving 12 patients (aged 2-41 years) with ADCY5-related dyskinesia. Participants completed a questionnaire about theophylline administration, including dosage, improvement of symptoms, adverse effects, and changes in quality of life. Data were analyzed for reported efficacy and side effects. Theophylline administration demonstrated substantial efficacy, with 92% (11 of 12) of patients reporting significant improvements in their movement disorders. The average improvement score was 7.0 ± 1.9 (mean ± SD) on a 10-point scale. Notable improvements included reductions in severity and frequency of episodes, improved gait, more independent mobility, psychosocial well-being, and quality of sleep. Adverse effects were reported by 6 patients, including dystonia, worsening of speech, headaches, nausea, impaired sleep, and agitation. Theophylline shows substantial promise as a treatment option for ADCY5-related dyskinesia, improving various aspects of patients' quality of life and movement disorder symptoms. Further research is needed to optimize dosing, to understand long-term effects, and to explore combinational drug therapies. Despite the small cohort size and the retrospective nature of this study, the results support theophylline administration to decrease dyskinetic movements and enhance overall quality of life in patients. © 2025 The Author(s).

Recent studies have highlighted the complexity of Mid-ET, but research on neurological soft signs (NSS) in Mid-ET remains insufficient. The patients with ET included in this cross-sectional study were divided into two subgroups based on whether or not the ET had a midline distribution: Mid-ET and No-Mid-ET. Comparative analyses were performed to assess clinical features and NSS prevalence in these subgroups. Among 1,160 patients, 567 (48.9%) were Mid-ET and 593 (51.1%) were No-Mid-ET. The prevalence rates of head, face (including the jaw), and voice tremors were 31.9%, 23.0%, and 25.8%, respectively. In Mid-ET, tremor often affects multiple midline structures simultaneously. In the entire cohort, 24.7%, 16.6%, and 7.6% of patients exhibited tremors in one, two, and three midline structures, respectively. The prevalence of common NSS, including mild cognitive impairment, impaired tandem gait, and questionable dystonic posturing, was significantly higher in the Mid-ET than the No-Mid-ET subgroup (all <i>p</i><0.001). Furthermore, we found that female sex (<i>p</i><0.001), olfactory dysfunction (<i>p</i>=0.003), and questionable dystonic posturing (<i>p</i>=0.004) were associated with Mid-ET. Mid-ET and No-Mid-ET presented significant clinical differences. The presence of questionable dystonic posturing may contribute to the distinct characteristics of Mid-ET, suggesting the presence of pathophysiological differences between the subgroups. Further investigations are warranted to determine the potential pathophysiological link between NSS and Mid-ET."

However, the impacts of the genetic etiology of dystonia on low-frequency GPi activity remain unclear; yet it holds importance for adaptive deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment. We compared the properties of GPi electrophysiology acquired from 70 microelectrode recordings (MER) trajectories of DYT-GNAL, DYT-KMT2B, DYT-SGCE, DYT-THAP1, DYT-TOR1A, DYT-VPS16, and idiopathic dystonia (iDYT) patients who underwent GPi-DBS surgery across standard frequency bands.

Additionally, theta band power was also significantly reduced in DYT-SGCE (4.42%) compared to iDYT and DYT-THAP1 (7.91% and 7.00%, p < 0.05). Instead, the genetic etiology of dystonia did not affect the spatial characteristics of GPi electrophysiology along MER trajectories.

    "abstract": "Dystonia is a movement disorder defined by involuntary muscle contractions leading to abnormal postures or twisting and repetitive movements. Classically dystonia has been thought of as a disorder of the basal ganglia, but newer results in idiopathic dystonia and lesion-induced dystonia in adults point to broader motor network dysfunction spanning the basal ganglia, cerebellum, premotor cortex, sensorimotor, and frontoparietal regions. It is unclear whether a similar network is shared between different etiologies of pediatric lesion-induced dystonia. Three cohorts of pediatric patients with lesion-induced dystonia were identified. The lesion etiologies included hypoxia, kernicterus, and stroke versus comparison subjects with acquired lesions not associated with dystonia. Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping and lesion network mapping were used to evaluate the anatomy and networks associated with dystonia. Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping showed that lesions of the putamen and globus pallidus were associated with dystonia (r = 0.41, p < 0.001). Lesion network mapping using normative connectome data from healthy children demonstrated that these regional findings occurred within a common brain-wide network that involves the basal ganglia, anterior and medial cerebellum, and cortical regions that overlap the cingulo-opercular action-mode and somato-cognitive-action networks. We interpret these findings as novel evidence for a unified dystonia brain network that involves the somato-cognitive-action network, which is implicated in the coordination of movement. Elucidation of this network gives insight into the functional origins of dystonia and provides novel targets to investigate for therapeutic intervention. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:152-162."

All exhibited neurodevelopmental delay, more severe in patients with LOF variants (<i>p</i> = 0.019). Neurodevelopmental regression was observed in 29.4% of patients with CLIFAHDD syndrome, associated with the onset of ataxia (70%). Patients with CLIFAHDD had more severe respiratory symptoms at birth (11.7% orotracheal intubation). Distal arthrogryposis (76.5%), episodic ataxia (41.2% of ambulatory patients), and paroxysmal dystonia (11.7%) were exclusively diagnosed in patients with CLIFAHDD. Patients with LOF variants presented more frequently with failure to thrive (88.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.001), central sleep apnea (CSA, 64.7%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and epilepsy (70.6%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Epilepsy was associated with more severe cognitive delays (<i>p</i> = 0.016) and was refractory in 58.8% of patients. Earlier seizure onset was associated with refractory epilepsy (<i>p</i> = 0.014). Patients with CLIFAHDD and premature death, epilepsy, or paroxysmal dystonia carried variants within NALCN pore domains. This study provides an in-depth clinical characterization of <i>NALCN</i>-related and <i>UNC80</i>-related disorders. Distal arthrogryposis, episodic ataxia, and paroxysmal dystonia were diagnosed in patients with CLIFAHDD while failure to thrive, CSA, and epilepsy were associated with LOF variants. We suggest potential genotype-phenotype associations, formulating hypotheses for validation in future studies with larger cohorts."

    "abstract": "Oromandibular dystonia and laryngospasm are defined as paraneoplastic syndromes of anti-Ri antibody. Herein, we report a 50-year-old woman admitted to the outpatient clinic with cervical contraction, speech and gait disturbance, and mental deterioration persisting for one year. She was diagnosed with undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma during further examination for two years of tinnitus and underwent radiotherapy. Her neurological symptoms started six months after radiotherapy. During this period, she underwent a tracheostomy due to a sudden laryngospasm. Anti-Ri antibody was positive in the paraneoplastic antibody screening. Her cervical dystonia and mental deterioration partially improved with intravenous pulse steroid and immunoglobulin therapies. However, the patient deceased due to aspiration pneumonia after six months. This rare clinical presentation, characterized by cervical dystonia, laryngospasm, spastic quadriparesis, and mental deterioration, should be considered anti-Ri antibody-associated paraneoplastic syndrome for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma."

    "abstract": "The spinal application of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) has been commonly used as treatment for severe dystonia as well spasticity. However, in rare cases, the use of ITB is not possible or ineffective. Therefore, intraventricular application of baclofen (IVB) mostly using endoscopic navigation has been rarely performed over the last years. As a valid alternative, we introduced navigated frameless stereotaxy for intraventricular catheter placement as the most minimally invasive approach feasible.We retrospectively report on surgical technique, clinical outcome, and long-term complications in all pediatric patients with severe generalized dystonia who received IVB using navigated frameless stereotaxy between April 2009 and June 2021 at our institution.Twenty patients (median age: 13 years; range: 2-23 years) were treated with IVB. Dystonia improved in 19/20 patients at the time of discharge (median 51 days; range 2-93 weeks). During the follow-up period (median: 19 months; range: 3-83 months), there was a total of five surgery-associated complications including 3/20 pump infections and 2/20 intraventricular catheter dislocations.This study reveals that navigated frameless catheter positioning in IVB therapy of generalized dystonia is a comparatively low risk and effective surgical procedure."

Although acute complications such as intracranial hemorrhage and infections are documented, delayed occurrences like normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) post-DBS has not been reported so far. We present a case series of seven PD patients (from 974) who developed NPH, an average of 10.9 + 3.1 years after DBS (6 STN, 1 GPi) with symptoms of cognitive decline and gait disturbances. Imaging confirmed hydrocephalus meeting NPH criteria (Radscale >4), which was further confirmed by the cerebrospinal fluid tap trial. Treatment with ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement showed significant symptom improvement. Recognizing NPH in PD patients even after DBS is crucial for early intervention and improved outcomes."

    "abstract": "Principal variables analysis (PVA) is a technique for selecting a subset of variables that capture as much of the information in a dataset as possible. Existing approaches for PVA are based on the Pearson correlation matrix, which is not well-suited to describing the relationships between non-Gaussian variables. We propose a generalized approach to PVA enabling the use of different types of correlation, and we explore using Spearman, Gaussian copula, and polychoric correlations as alternatives to Pearson correlation. We compare performance in simulation studies varying the form of the true multivariate distribution over a range of possibilities. Our results show that on continuous non-Gaussian data, using generalized PVA with Gaussian copula or Spearman correlations provides a major improvement in performance compared to Pearson. On ordinal data, generalized PVA with polychoric correlations outperforms the rest by a wide margin. We apply generalized PVA to a dataset of 102 clinical variables measured on individuals with X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP), a neurodegenerative disorder involving symptoms of both dystonia and parkinsonism. We find that using different types of correlation yields substantively different sets of principal variables; for example, parkinsonism-related metrics appear more explanatory than dystonia-related metrics on the observed data.

However, the biological rationale remains ambiguous. Our review aimed to systematically assessed which biochemical biomarkers have been reported in clinical research to evaluate BoNT analgesic and mood-lifting effects in head and neck chronic conditions related to inflammation. We searched databases and registries between inception and September 29, 2023. Of the nine included studies, there were concerns about risk of bias for six studies. The leading biomarker with five studies was the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), followed by serotonin with two studies. Oxidative stress biomarkers were only reported in one study. Several important players in inflammatory processes and different immune cell classes have been evaluated in four studies. There was only one trial measuring changes in beta Tubulin and SNAP-25, and another study evaluating cutaneous neuropeptide substance-P. After BoNT, a significant effect was reported in six studies, including decrease in plasma levels of CGRP in chronic migraine and trigeminal neuralgia; serotonin decrease when collected from human tears in refractory intractable dry eye disease and increase in peripheral blood platelets in painful cervical dystonia associated to depression and anxiety; decrease in plasma concentration of markers of oxidative damage to proteins and increase in biomarkers for antioxidant power; decrease in expression of gene sets involved in inflammatory pathways and immune cells classes in the periosteum and metalloproteinase-9 molecule in the tears. BoNT seems to affect some biomarkers present in chronic inflammatory conditions. However, the certainty evidence found was very low to moderate.

    "abstract": "Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia usually presents with behavioral and personality changes, social disinhibition, apathy, and lack of empathy, and is characterized by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes. Corticobasal syndrome is characterized by asymmetrical involuntary movements, rigidity, apraxia, tremor, dystonia, and cortical sensory deficits. We present the case of a 59-year-old patient with a frontotemporal presentation and parkinsonism linked to progranulin gene deletion. We also report the clinical workup needed to reach the diagnosis. Clinical, neuropsychological, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose and <sup>18</sup>F-Flutemetamol positron emission tomography (PET), dopamine-transporter-single-photon emission computed tomography imaging, electroencephalography, and genetic evaluations were conducted. Our patient presented initially with executive and mnesic deficits along with the presence of apathy and loss of autonomy. Subsequently the cognitive deficits became associated with parkinsonian-like movement disorders and apraxia. Structural images showed right onset temporal and insular atrophy, and the PET images demonstrated right frontotemporal hypometabolism and the absence of amyloid in the cortex. The molecular analysis revealed a heterozygous deletion c.813_816delCACT on the <i>GRN</i> gene. This variant has been reported in the literature as pathogenic and associated with autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia and corticobasal degeneration. Our patient presented different clinical features than those of the members of the families already described. In these families, some patients either presented immediately with motor syndrome with extrapyramidal features, or never developed extrapyramidal signs. Some subjects presented prevalent language dysfunction while others never presented memory disorders. The clinical case highlights the phenotypic variability of this entity."

    "abstract": "Continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring has become a standard of care in several contexts in the intensive care unit (ICU), especially for the management of refractory status epilepticus. ICU patients often present movement disorders that may be of epileptic or nonepileptic origin, and their correct identification is crucial for the diagnostic and therapeutic process. Video analysis is often insufficient to precisely detect or characterize movement disorders and the ICU environment is prone to many artifacts. Combined EEG electromyogram (EMG) monitoring can enhance the detection of epileptic seizures with subtle motor expression and help identify nonepileptic movement disorders, such as postanoxic myoclonus, dystonia, or tremor. We will review the various scenarios in which combined EEG-EMG monitoring is useful in routine ICU practice. We also provide a practical guide for easily placing surface EMG electrodes during continuous EEG recording, along with clinical examples to illustrate the significance of this combined approach."

This study identified the optimal target for botulinum toxin A based on the distribution of intramuscular nerves and spindles in the splenius muscles. This study included 24 adult individuals. The curve connecting the external occipital protuberance and the third thoracic spinous process was the longitudinal reference line (line L). The curve connecting the external occipital protuberance and the mastoid process was the horizontal reference line (line H). Modified Sihler's staining showed an intramuscular nerve-dense region in the splenius muscles. Muscle spindle abundance was calculated after hematoxylin and eosin staining. The center of the region of the highest muscle spindle abundance was localized using computed tomography. The projection points (P and P') of the center of the region of the highest muscle spindle abundance behind and in front of the neck, position of P (P<sub>L</sub> and P<sub>H</sub>) projected onto the L and H lines, and depth of the center of the region of the highest muscle spindle abundance were determined under the Syngo system. P<sub>L</sub>, P<sub>H</sub>, and depth of the center of the region of highest muscle spindle abundance of splenius capitis and splenius cervicis muscles were 17.33% and 40.59% of the L line, 42.42% and 60.44% of the H line, and 26.30% and 32.60% of the PP' line, respectively.

We describe the outcomes following deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the management of dystonia of children and adults with glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1). Cases with GA1 were identified from the institutional databases of two tertiary movement disorder services. Data were extracted from clinical records using a standardised proforma, including baseline clinical characteristics, imaging and neurophysiological findings, complications post-surgery, and outcomes as measured by the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BMFDRS) motor scores and the Canadian Occupation Performance Measure (COPM). A total of 15 children were identified aged 3-17.5 with a median age of 11.5 years at neurosurgery, and one adult undergoing DBS aged 31 years. Baseline BMFDRS motor score ranged from 58.5-114, median 105. GMFCS-equivalence level was 5 (i.e. non-ambulant) for 10/16 cases. Surgery was tolerated in all cases without evidence of metabolic decompensation. BFMDRS motor score 1-year post-surgery ranged from 57.5-108.5 (median 97.25) and at last follow-up 57.5-112 (median 104) (no statistically significant change compared to baseline at either time point, P > 0.05). COPM data were available for 11/13 children and young people (CAYP). Clinically significant improvement was reported in 7/11 at 1 year and 8/11 at last follow-up. Four CAYP transitioned to adult services. Death occurred in three cases during follow-up, in no case related to DBS.

We explored the challenges of people with dystonia (PwD) at the stages of diagnosis and botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) treatment. A multicenter survey was conducted face-to-face across seven university hospitals in Turkey. PwD receiving BoNT treatment for at least 6 months were invited. Data on demographics, diagnostic journeys, and treatment experiences were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression models. A total of 789 PwD participated, reporting significant burdens during both diagnostic and treatment stages. Diagnosis was delayed by approximately 1 year, with 15% receiving incorrect initial diagnoses. Additionally, 30.7% of PwD traveled to another city, and 42.6% applied to private clinics for diagnosis, leading to a substantial logistic and financial burden. The treatment stage revealed that a quarter of PwD had to travel significant distances every 3 months, or applied to a private clinic to receive BoNT injections, creating considerable cost and effort. In addition, PwD with oromandibular dystonia were three times and task-specific dystonia were around nine times less likely to be satisfied with BoNT treatment compared to facial dystonia. Alternative treatment was reported in 11%, with no substantial benefit. The findings highlight critical unmet needs in the diagnostic and treatment processes for PwD. These include improvement in diagnostic accuracy, reduced travel and financial burdens, and enhanced treatment satisfaction. An action plan emphasizing resource utilization policies and educational activities for healthcare providers is essential to address these challenges."

    "abstract": "Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor commonly used to treat depression and neuropathic pain. Duloxetine-associated parkinsonism has been previously reported in only two cases with psychiatric disorders. We present the first case where duloxetine unmasked motor manifestations of subclinical Parkinson's disease. A 41-year-old male underwent a discectomy for a lumbar herniation. As numbness in the left sole persisted postoperatively, duloxetine (20 mg/day) was initiated seven days after surgery. Two days later, the patient developed a slow gait, difficulty turning, and short steps. Neurological examination revealed resting tremor in the left foot, dystonic posturing of the left little toe, bradykinesia of both hands, reduced gait speed with short steps, and rigidity in the left lower limb and neck. Based on the temporal association, duloxetine-associated parkinsonism was suspected. Four days after discontinuing duloxetine, the patient's gait speed, step length, and right-hand bradykinesia improved, and the foot tremor and toe dystonia resolved. Dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography revealed reduced tracer uptake in the bilateral striatum, leading to a diagnosis of duloxetine-associated parkinsonism and subclinical Parkinson's disease. One year and four months later, gait impairment reappeared, characterized by short steps and slow speed, though without foot tremor or toe dystonia. In this case, duloxetine appeared to unmask parkinsonism associated with subclinical Parkinson's disease. Potential mechanisms include inhibition of dopamine release due to 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor activation, postoperative effects, drug hypersensitivity, or genetic phenotypes in serotonin receptors. This case highlights the importance of considering subclinical Parkinson's disease in patients with duloxetine-associated parkinsonism."

The symptoms lasted several minutes to a few hours. Video-polygraphic recordings revealed an electromyographic (EMG) pattern of brief, shock-like muscular contractions consistent with myoclonus that correlated with a high-amplitude (70-90 µV), 11-14 Hertz, bilaterally symmetric electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythm over the frontocentral regions. A time-locked relationship between the frontocentral EEG activity and the EMG myoclonic potentials demonstrated the cortical origin of myoclonus and therefore the epileptic nature of the disorder, whereas the oromandibular and cervical dystonic-like postures suggested the pathogenic involvement of subcortical structures. The intravenous administration of diazepam suppressed the clinical symptoms and the EEG-EMG correlate of myoclonus. The clinical and neurophysiological findings illustrate a form of myoclonic status epilepticus (SE) with dystonia-like symptoms resulting from the functional involvement of cortical and subcortical structures. The manifestation of subtle, rhythmic myoclonus and dystonic-like postures in patients with atypical EEG patterns of SE may require challenging differential diagnoses with myoclonus-dystonia syndrome and oromandibular dystonia."

Sensory tricks are considered signature characteristics of dystonia and were hypothesized to reduce voice symptoms in those with LD compared to EVT and NC groups. Five participants from each group (LD, EVT, and NC) completed speech recordings under control and sensory trick conditions (delayed auditory feedback [DAF], vibrotactile stimulation [VTS], and nasoendoscopic recordings with and without topical anesthesia). Comparisons between groups and conditions were made using (a) a paired-comparison paradigm (control vs. sensory condition) listener ratings of voice quality, (b) participant-perceived vocal effort ratings, and (c) average smoothed cepstral peak prominence (CPPS). Participants with EVT displayed significantly worse listener ratings under most sensory trick conditions, whereas participants with LD were rated significantly worse for DAF and VTS conditions only. However, participant vocal effort ratings were similar across all sensory trick conditions. Average CPPS values generally supported listener ratings across conditions and speakers except during DAF, wherein CPPS values increased (i.e., measurably improved voice quality), whereas listener ratings indicated worsened voice quality for both voice disorder groups. Outcomes of this study did not support the hypothesized influences of sensory trick conditions on LD voice symptoms, with both LD and EVT groups experiencing worsened symptoms under VTS and DAF conditions. These adverse effects on voice symptoms warrant further research to further evaluate neural pathways and associated sensorimotor response patterns that distinguish individuals with LD and EVT. https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.28462292."

    "abstract": "Yeast <i>TIM8</i> was initially identified as a homolog of human TIMM8A/DDP1, which is associated with human deafness-dystonia syndrome. Tim8p is located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and forms a hetero-oligomeric complex with Tim13p to facilitate protein transport through the TIM22 translocation system. Previous research has indicated that <i>TIM8</i> is not essential for yeast survival but does affect the import of Tim23p in the absence of the Tim8-Tim13 complex. Previous research on <i>TIM8</i> has focused mainly on its involvement in the mitochondrial protein transport pathway, and the precise biological function of <i>TIM8</i> remains incompletely understood. In this study, we provide the first report that yeast <i>TIM8</i> is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and chronological senescence. We found that deletion of <i>TIM8</i> leads to both oxidative stress and ER stress in yeast cells while increasing resistance to the ER stress inducer tunicamycin (TM), which is accompanied by an enhanced basic unfolded protein response (UPR). More importantly, <i>TIM8</i> deficiency can lead to a shortened chronological lifespan (CLS) but does not affect the replicative lifespan (RLS). Moreover, we found that improving the antioxidant capacity further increased TM resistance in the <i>tim8Δ</i> strain. Importantly, we provide evidence that the knockdown of TIMM8A in ARPE-19 human retinal pigment epithelium cells can also induce ER stress, suggesting the potential function of the <i>TIM8</i> gene in ER stress is conserved from budding yeast to higher eukaryotes. In summary, these results suggest novel roles for <i>TIM8</i> in maintaining ER homeostasis and CLS maintenance."

    "title": "Prevalence and proposed aetiologies of dystonias or yips in athletes playing overhand sports: a scoping review protocol.",
    "abstract": "Sports-related dystonia, also called the yips, are often seen in athletes in multiple sports. In this condition, an athlete abruptly loses the ability to perform a repetitive motion performed thousands of times. Such occurrences are often assumed to be psychological in nature, and thus evaluation for other causes is often lacking. All reviews on the topic have failed to focus on athletes in overhand sports. This scoping review will evaluate the available evidence regarding upper extremity focal dystonias (yips) in athletes participating in overhand sports in any worldwide clinical or sport setting. We will conduct our scoping review with guidance from the latest version of the Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) Manual for Evidence Synthesis, a widely accepted methodology for conducting reviews. We organised our research question and inclusion criteria to the JBI's mnemonic; Participants: athletes that participate in overhand sports; Concept: upper extremity focal dystonias or yips; and Context: any worldwide clinical or sports setting. Search results were retrieved on 26-27 June 2024, in the following databases: MEDLINE (Ovid) 1946-2024, SPORTDiscus (EBSCOhost) 1800-2024, APA PsycINFO (EBSCOhost) 1872-2024, Embase (Elsevier) 1974-2024, Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate) 1900-2024, Sports Medicine & Education Index (ProQuest) 1970-2024 and Dissertations and Theses Global (ProQuest) 1861-2024. Using Covidence, two reviewers from a team of three will independently screen titles and abstracts, screen full text articles for inclusion, and independently extract data from our included studies. Results will be presented as a narrative descriptive analysis along with tabular data on the prevalence, diagnostic criteria and treatment for yips in athletes of overhand sports. As this describes a scoping protocol, ethical approval is not necessary. Review findings will be submitted to peer-reviewed publications and presentations at local and national conferences. This protocol is registered with the Open Science Framework."

    "title": "Assessment of quality of life in patients with cervical dystonia and hemifacial spasm after botulinum toxin injections.",
    "abstract": "Botulinum toxin is now used to treat a variety of neurological and non-neurological disorders. Despite the fact that injections of botulinum neurotoxin may significantly reduce the involuntary muscular contractions associated with focal dystonia and hemifacial spasm (HFS), it is less certain whether the motor effect would result in an improvement in health-related quality of life (HR-QoL).Our goal was to evaluate how botulinum toxin affected individuals with cervical dystonia and hemifacial spasm in terms of their quality of life, self-esteem, pain, sleep, and depression. This is a prospective study that included 40 patients diagnosed with cervical dystonia or hemifacial spasm treated with Botulinum toxin. Quality of life, self-esteem, pain, sleep and depression were all assessed in the studied patients by self-reporting questionnaires to assess the impact of botulinum toxin on them. The quality of life with its components (physical, physical role, emotional role, vitality, mental health, social functioning and pain) showed significant improvement at the end of follow up compared to baseline with p values ≤ 0.001. Also, there was a significant improvement of self-esteem score, depression score, at the end of follow up period compared to baseline assessment with p value 0.012, < 0.001 respectively. Moreover, there was a significant improvement of all pain scales and sleep quality scores with p values < 0.05 except the habitual sleep efficiency. botulinum toxin is an effective therapy for motor and non-motor manifestations associated with focal cervical dystonia and hemifacial spasm as well as the quality of life and to conclude that its effectiveness is dependent not only on the elimination of physical symptoms, but also on improving the patients' and their families' emotional and social status to help providing the drug to all eligible patients."

    "title": "<i>KMT2B</i>-related disorders: expansion of the phenotypic spectrum and long-term efficacy of deep brain stimulation.",
    "abstract": "Heterozygous mutations in <i>KMT2B</i> are associated with an early-onset, progressive and often complex dystonia (DYT28). Key characteristics of typical disease include focal motor features at disease presentation, evolving through a caudocranial pattern into generalized dystonia, with prominent oromandibular, laryngeal and cervical involvement. Although <i>KMT2B</i>-related disease is emerging as one of the most common causes of early-onset genetic dystonia, much remains to be understood about the full spectrum of the disease. We describe a cohort of 53 patients with <i>KMT2B</i> mutations, with detailed delineation of their clinical phenotype and molecular genetic features. We report new disease presentations, including atypical patterns of dystonia evolution and a subgroup of patients with a non-dystonic neurodevelopmental phenotype. In addition to the previously reported systemic features, our study has identified co-morbidities, including the risk of status dystonicus, intrauterine growth retardation, and endocrinopathies. Analysis of this study cohort (<i>n</i> = 53) in tandem with published cases (<i>n</i> = 80) revealed that patients with chromosomal deletions and protein truncating variants had a significantly higher burden of systemic disease (with earlier onset of dystonia) than those with missense variants. Eighteen individuals had detailed longitudinal data available after insertion of deep brain stimulation for medically refractory dystonia. Median age at deep brain stimulation was 11.5 years (range: 4.5-37.0 years). Follow-up after deep brain stimulation ranged from 0.25 to 22 years. Significant improvement of motor function and disability (as assessed by the Burke Fahn Marsden's Dystonia Rating Scales, BFMDRS-M and BFMDRS-D) was evident at ł months, 1 year and last follow-up (motor, <i>P</i> = 0.001, <i>P</i> = 0.004, and <i>P</i> = 0.012; disability, <i>P</i> = 0.009, <i>P</i> = 0.002 and <i>P</i> = 0.012). At 1 year post-deep brain stimulation, >50% of subjects showed BFMDRS-M and BFMDRS-D improvements of >30%. In the long-term deep brain stimulation cohort (deep brain stimulation inserted for >5 years, <i>n</i> = 8), improvement of >30% was maintained in 5/8 and 3/8 subjects for the BFMDRS-M and BFMDRS-D, respectively. The greatest BFMDRS-M improvements were observed for trunk (53.2%) and cervical (50.5%) dystonia, with less clinical impact on laryngeal dystonia. Improvements in gait dystonia decreased from 20.9% at 1 year to 1ł.2% at last assessment; no patient maintained a fully independent gait. Reduction of BFMDRS-D was maintained for swallowing (52.9%). Five patients developed mild parkinsonism following deep brain stimulation. <i>KMT2B-</i>related disease comprises an expanding continuum from infancy to adulthood, with early evidence of genotype-phenotype correlations. Except for laryngeal dysphonia, deep brain stimulation provides a significant improvement in quality of life and function with sustained clinical benefit depending on symptoms distribution."

    "abstract": "Metoclopramide is a useful antiemetic drug that is widely used in medical emergencies. This drug can cause extrapyramidal side effects that are worrying. An 18-year-old girl student unintentionally consumed a large dose (60 mg) of metoclopramide, exceeding the recommended therapeutic dose, for the management of nausea and vomiting. Approximately six hours after the ingestion of the medication, she developed neck dystonia and upward deviation of the eyes. Seeing these symptoms and worrying about their child's physical condition, the parents took her to the local medical center in northern Iran. With the diagnosis of the extrapyramidal syndrome and intramuscular administration of biperiden 5 mg ampoule twice at 12-h intervals, unfortunately, the symptoms did not improve and finally he was referred to our hospital. Dystonic reactions caused by metoclopramide can be misdiagnosed and it is necessary to be monitored and treated appropriately to reduce the family's concern about its unpleasant side effects."

    "title": "Autoinflammatory encephalopathy due to PTPN1 haploinsufficiency: a case series.",
    "abstract": "Through the agnostic screening of patients with uncharacterised disease phenotypes for an upregulation of type I interferon (IFN) signalling, we identified a cohort of individuals heterozygous for mutations in PTPN1, encoding the protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). We aimed to describe the clinical phenotype and molecular and cellular pathology of this new disease. In this case series, we identified patients and collected clinical and neuroradiological data through collaboration with paediatric neurology and clinical genetics colleagues across Europe (Czechia, France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia, and the UK) and Israel. Variants in PTPN1 were identified by exome and directed Sanger sequencing. The expression of IFN-stimulated genes was determined by quantitative (q) PCR or NanoString technology. Experiments to assess RNA and protein expression and to investigate type 1 IFN signalling were undertaken in patient fibroblasts, hTERT-immortalised BJ-5ta fibroblasts, and RPE-1 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 editing and standard cell biology techniques. Between Dec 20, 2013, and Jan 11, 2023, we identified 12 patients from 11 families who were heterozygous for mutations in PTPN1. We found ten novel or very rare variants in PTPN1 (frequency on gnomAD version 4.1.0 of <1·25 × 10:sup>-6). Six variants were predicted as STOP mutations, two involved canonical splice-site nucleotides, and two were missense substitutions. In three patients, the variant occurred de novo, whereas in nine affected individuals, the variant was inherited from an asymptomatic parent. The clinical phenotype was characterised by the subacute onset (age range 1-8 years) of loss of motor and language skills in the absence of seizures after initially normal development, leading to spastic dystonia and bulbar involvement. Neuroimaging variably demonstrated cerebral atrophy (sometimes unilateral initially) or high T2 white matter signal. Neopterin in CSF was elevated in all ten patients who were tested, and all probands demonstrated an upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes in whole blood. Although clinical stabilisation and neuroradiological improvement was seen in both treated and untreated patients, in six of eight treated patients, high-dose corticosteroids were judged clinically to result in an improvement in neurological status. Of the four asymptomatic parents tested, IFN signalling in blood was normal (three patients) or minimally elevated (one patient). Analysis of patient blood and fibroblasts showed that tested PTPN1 variants led to reduced levels of PTPN1 mRNA and PTP1B protein, and in-vitro assays demonstrated that loss of PTP1B function was associated with impaired negative regulation of type 1 IFN signalling. PTPN1 haploinsufficiency causes a type 1 IFN-driven autoinflammatory encephalopathy. Notably, some patients demonstrated stabilisation, and even recovery, of neurological function in the absence of treatment, whereas in others, the disease appeared to be responsive to immune suppression. Prospective studies are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of specific immune suppression approaches in this disease population.

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the internal globus pallidus (GPi) is a well-established, effective treatment for dystonia. Substantial variability of therapeutic success has been the one of the drivers of an ongoing debate about proper stimulation site and settings, with several indications of the notional sweet spot pointing to the lower GPi or even subpallidal area. The presented patient-blinded, random-order study with cross-sectional verification against healthy controls enrolled 17 GPi DBS idiopathic, cervical or generalised dystonia patients to compare the effect of the stimulation in the upper and lower GPi area, with the focus on sensorimotor network connectivity and local activity measured using functional magnetic resonance. Stimulation brought both these parameters to levels closer to the state detected in healthy controls. This effect was much more pronounced during the stimulation in the lower GPi area or beneath it than in slightly higher positions, with stimulation-related changes detected by both metrics of interest in the sensorimotor cortex, striatum, thalamus and cerebellum. All in all, this study not only replicated the results of previous studies on GPi DBS as a modality restoring sensorimotor network connectivity and local activity in dystonia towards the levels in healthy population, but also showed that lower GPi area or even subpallidal structures, be it white matter or even small, but essential nodes in the zona incerta as nucleus basalis of Meynert, are important regions to consider when programming DBS in dystonia patients."

    "abstract": "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive congenital disorder of bile acid metabolism resulting from variants in the CYP27A1 gene. CTX presents with heterogenous clinical features. Descriptions from diverse populations remain sparse, particularly from the Indian subcontinent. We report a case series of nine Indian patients with CTX, accompanied by a systematized review of Indian literature. Our case series revealed inter- and intrafamilial heterogeneity. Our review of 36 published cases revealed that most Indian patients presented with neurobehavioral syndromes and spastic ataxia, and parkinsonism and dystonia were considerably rare; 34/36 cases eventually developed cataract, usually in childhood, which was a 'tell-tale' sign. Radiological findings revealed striking dentate T2/FLAIR hyperintensities, periventricular white matter involvement, and involvement of the corticospinal tract, and could detect clinically invisible tendon xanthomas. Missense and frameshift truncation variants were most common in the Indian literature, with the c.525delG variant being encountered most frequently. Several patients received a clinico-radiological/histopathological diagnosis as genetic testing was not performed in all patients. Most patients received ursodeoxycholic acid although it is ineffective in the treatment of CTX. CTX is a not-to-be-missed treatable ataxia syndrome with heterogeneous clinical features. Parkinsonism and dystonia seem to be less prevalent in Indian cases compared to world literature. Our review also highlights the difficulty in access to, availability of and the urgent need to provide chenodeoxycholic acid in our region, reflected in the small fraction of patients who received this definite treatment despite the 'reversible' nature of the disease."

    "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability of childhood. Its prevalence in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) is over 3/1000 live births, about double the 1.6/1000 in high income countries (HICs). Multimorbidity is highly prevalent in CP. In LMICs, there are higher rates of prevalence, severity, comorbidities and mortality in children with CP. The evidence base for the recommendations in CP emanates overwhelmingly from studies conducted in HICs. Research conducted in LMICs settings, involving local clinicians, considering local context and investigating local solutions are urgently needed. This scoping review aimed to identify and synthesise current evidence on management of clinical comorbidities in children with CP in LMICs. The Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines were followed for the data extraction and analysis phases. The following questions guided the scoping review: What are the main clinical comorbidities in children with CP? What are the gold standards for diagnosis and treatment of these comorbidities? What options do we have to diagnose and treat these comorbidities in LMICs when gold standards are not available? A total of 22 188 citations were identified by our search strategy, with 21 380 remaining after the removal of 808 duplicates. After screening titles and abstracts, 1918 citations progressed to full text review. A total of 194 articles met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. The guiding questions of the review were answered for the following morbidities: respiratory impairments, dysphagia and aspiration, gastroesophageal reflux disease, drooling, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, malnutrition, constipation, epilepsy, sleep disorders, spasticity, dystonia, pain, hip disorders, scoliosis and osteoporosis. This article highlights the need for interventions adapted to the realities of LMICs. Empowering paediatricians and healthcare professionals in LMICs is crucial for early diagnosis and proactive interventions. Specific guidelines for LMICs can better guide professionals in managing these complex conditions."

    "abstract": "Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) complicated with extraocular symptoms is called LHON plus. We describe a case of LHON plus with a rare mutation, which also caused dystonia. An 18-year-old male patient developed symptoms of dystonia at the age of 15 years. Two years later, he noticed decreased visual acuity and central scotoma in the left eye. One month later, the same symptoms occurred in the right eye. Although the optic discs in both eyes revealed mildly redness and edematous change, no abnormal findings were detected on fluorescence fundus angiography and orbital magnetic resonance imaging. Mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) sequencing detected the m.14487 T>C mutation. From clinical course and fundus findings, the case was diagnosed LHON. The optic nerve gradually atrophied and central scotoma remained. The m.14487 T>C mutation is one of the causative mutations in patients with dystonia or Leigh encephalopathy and a minor mutation in patients with LHON. However, in the present case, ocular symptoms were more severe than systematic symptoms and the disease course was consistent with LHON. For the above reasons, this case can be diagnosed as LHON plus. Whole mtDNA sequencing is important in diagnosing LHON if none of the three major mutations are detected."

    "abstract": "Congenital Muscular Torticollis (CMT) is the third most common musculoskeletal condition in infancy, and if untreated can lead to significant disability. While a range of conservative treatments are commonly used in the management of CMT, an understanding of their efficacy and safety is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis, without language or discipline restriction, was conducted to address this knowledge gap. Electronic searches of CENTRAL, PubMed, 22 other electronic databases, three trials registers and Google Scholar, were conducted for randomised controlled trials, which examined any non-surgical, non-pharmacological interventions, including but not limited to manual treatments, movement therapy, acupuncture, adjunctive therapies and physical support, in children aged 0 to 5 years with CMT. Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of bias 1 tool, rated their certainty of evidence using grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) framework, and performed random-effects meta-analyses. One hundred studies (80 from China) involving 8125 participants published between 1990 and 2023 were included. Adding manual therapy to an active control resulted in short-term improvements in passive cervical rotation (odds ratio (OR) 9.79, 95%CI 4.26,22.50), passive cervical lateroflexion (OR 2.66, 95%CI 1.17,6.04), active cervical rotation (OR 3.94, 95%CI 1.08,14.35), symmetric head posture (OR 4.55, 95%CI 2.57,8.05), sternocleidomastoid tumour thickness (mean difference (MD) -2.12 mm, 95%CI -2.98,-1.26) and development of symmetrical movement (standardised MD -0.70, 95%CI -0.95,-0.45). The addition of an electrophysical agent to an active control reduced sternocleidomastoid tumour thickness (MD -2.03 mm, 95%CI -2.67,-1.39) and optimised Tuina reduced tumour thickness more than traditional Tuina (MD -1.20 mm, 95%CI -1.80,-0.59). Adverse events were uncommon but poorly reported, with 71 (71%) of studies providing no data. Study heterogeneity limited pooling of data for meta-analysis, and there was very low to low certainty evidence for all results, due to high risk of bias, small sample sizes and study heterogeneity. This review found that non-surgical, non-pharmacological treatments may be effective for CMT, but the certainty of evidence is very low to low. These findings are important in informing clinical guidelines and management for CMT and highlight an urgent need for large definitive trials that address the limitations of current studies.

Data on clinical presentations, laboratory tests, hearing assessment and outcomes at discharge were collected. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the outcome at discharge: favorable outcome group and unfavorable outcome group. Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test and Fisher exact test was used to estimate the risk factors for an unfavorable outcome at discharge. <b>Results:</b> Thirty-four patients were enrolled. There were 16 males and 18 females. The age at onset ranged from 3 months to 12 years. Fever (34 patients (100%)), convulsions (17 patients (50%)), and coma (21 patients (62%)) were the common clinical presentations. Twenty-four patients (71%) developed complications. There were 15 patients (44%) needed treatment in the intensive care unit, 5 patients (15%) received intubation, and 4 patients (12%) had developed shock. The favorable outcome group included 23 patients, and the unfavorable outcome group included 11 patients.

    "abstract": "Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is an ultra-rare, X-linked dominant, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the <i>WDR45</i> gene. It manifests in neurodevelopmental delay and seizures followed by secondary neurological decline with dystonia/parkinsonism and dementia in adolescence and early adulthood and is characterized by progressive accumulation of iron in the basal ganglia. <i>WDR45</i> encodes β-propeller-shaped scaffold protein, or WD repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting protein 4 (WIPI4), which plays an important role in autophagosome formation. While the mechanisms of how WIPI4 loss of function results in neurological decline and brain pathology have not yet been established, findings of lower autophagic activity provide a direct link between impaired autophagy and neurological disease in BPAN. Here we performed phenotypical characterization of a novel mouse model of BPAN, Wdr45_ex9+1g>a mouse. We identified hyperactive behavior and reduction of autophagy markers in brain tissue in Wdr45_ex9+1g>a hemizygous males as early as at 2 months of age. Given the early onset and spectrum of neurological symptoms such as hyper-arousal and attention deficits in human patients, this model presents a disease-relevant phenotype and can be used in preclinical studies. We used this mouse model for a proof-of-concept study to evaluate whether adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated central nervous system (CNS)-targeted gene transfer of <i>WDR45</i> can provide therapeutic benefit and be considered a therapeutic paradigm for BPAN. We observed successful expression of human <i>WDR45</i> transcripts and WIPI4 protein in the brain tissue, rescue of hyperactive behavior, and correction of autophagy markers. These data demonstrate that <i>WDR45</i> gene transfer can be a promising therapeutic strategy for BPAN."

In humans, homozygous null mutations in <i>FITM2</i> are associated with a syndrome characterized by deafness and dystonia. Here, we report two families with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) in whom exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygosity for <i>FITM2</i> mutations. In each family, the affected probands carry one putative null allele and one G100R missense allele. Functional analyses demonstrated that the G100R allele is hypomorphic, with FIT2 protein levels reduced to 20% of wild type, leading to proportionately decreased enzyme activity. The occurrence of similar HSP disease phenotypes and the same hypomorphic mutation in these families suggests that the G100R mutation and its associated reduced enzyme activity represent a newly recognized clinical manifestation of <i>FITM2</i> mutations, expanding the spectrum of conditions associated with this gene."

    "abstract": "While multiple oral medications are used to treat dystonia, limited information exists on current prescribing practices. This study analyzes real-world prescribing practices for pediatric dystonia in the United States, evaluating prescription frequency, dosing, and the impact of comorbidities. Oracle electronic health record real-world data were queried from 2014 to 2019 for encounters of patients under age 18 with a dystonia diagnosis and available medication records. Information was extracted on prescriptions for dystonia medications (baclofen, clonidine, carbidopa-levodopa, gabapentin, tetrabenazine, trihexyphenidyl, and select benzodiazepines), dosing, and comorbid diagnoses of cerebral palsy (CP), epilepsy, or spasticity. A total of 4010 pediatric patients with dystonia were included. Benzodiazepines were most commonly prescribed (midazolam in 53.5% of patients, diazepam 46.7%, lorazepam 41.9%, clonazepam 28.3%). This was followed by baclofen (33.4%), clonidine (26.3%), and gabapentin (19.7%). Dystonia patients with epilepsy were more commonly prescribed benzodiazepines than patients without epilepsy (diazepam 79.1% vs. 29%; clonazepam 50.9% vs. 16%) and baclofen was more often prescribed in patients with CP (59.4%) or spasticity (63.8%) than those without (17%). All medications showed decreased milligram per kilogram dosage as patient weight increased. Benzodiazepines, baclofen, and clonidine were the most common medications prescribed to pediatric patients with dystonia in the United States, although medical comorbidities impact prescribing practices. There was significant variability in weight-based dosing of all medications. There remains a need to determine which dystonia medications are most effective for each patient and the necessary drug exposure to maximize therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse effects."

Nine patients (6 males and 3 females) failed a trial of physical therapy and all conservative measures. All patients were diagnosed with CMT refractory to conservative therapy. Nine patients were treated with unipolar SCM (6 right and 3 left). The mean age at the time of surgery was 9.3±3.4 years. There were no surgical complications. No patients required subsequent revision surgery. One patient had prior surgery on the SCM.At final follow-up, 8 (88.9%) patients had a neutral head position. Rotation in the direction of the release significantly improved from preoperative to final follow-up (from 59.7±26.5 to 85.6±7.3 degrees, P = .01). Rotation in the opposite direction (away from the release) was maintained from preoperative to final follow-up (83.8±11.1 vs. 85.6±8.8 degrees, P = .71). No cases of overcorrection or defect in the area of the resection were observed. Bipolar release with partial resection may be a promising form of treatment for CMT as head position was improved without overcorrection, defects, or other complications."

    "title": "Eye movement disorders in genetic dystonia syndromes: A literature overview.",
    "abstract": "With the growing possibilities in genetic testing, the number of genetic disorders associated with dystonia has constantly increased over the last few years. Accurate phenotyping is crucial to guide and interpret genetic analyses in the search for an etiological diagnosis. Although eye movements examination has proven a valuable tool in the assessment of patients with inherited movement disorders such as ataxia or parkinsonism, less is known about the association between eye movement disorders and genetic dystonia. This study aimed to summarize the most frequent eye movement disorders in monogenetic forms of dystonia as classified by the Movement Disorders Society (MDS). More than sixty genetic disorders causing dystonia were repeatedly associated with eye movement disorders. Among these, 24 are classified as DYT genes, 22 were classified by MDS as having another prominent movement disorder, and 19 are genetic disorders that manifest with dystonia but are not included in the MDS classification. Six different eye movement disorders have consistently been reported (saccadic slowing and supranuclear gaze palsy, saccadic initiation failure and oculomotor apraxia, saccadic dysmetria, oculogyric crisis, nystagmus and ophthalmoplegia). The phenotypic association of each disorder with monogenic dystonic diseases, as well as the possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, is described here. Our findings suggest that eye movement disorders, along with the movement phenotype, may help delineate subgroups of dystonia by reflecting disruptions in specific brain networks. Therefore, eye movement examination is a crucial part of the neurological evaluation, providing valuable insights into patients with inherited forms of dystonia."

    "title": "Emerging Techniques for the Personalization of Deep Brain Stimulation Programming.",
    "abstract": "The success of deep brain stimulation (DBS) relies on applying carefully titrated therapeutic stimulation at specific targets. Once implanted, the electrical stimulation parameters at each electrode contact can be modified. Iteratively adjusting the stimulation parameters enables testing for the optimal stimulation settings. Due to the large parameter space, the currently employed empirical testing of individual parameters based on acute clinical response is not sustainable. Within the constraints of short clinical visits, optimization is particularly challenging when clinical features lack immediate feedback, as seen in DBS for dystonia and depression and with the cognitive and axial side effects of DBS for Parkinson's disease. A personalized approach to stimulation parameter selection is desirable as the increasing complexity of modern DBS devices also expands the number of available parameters. This review describes three emerging imaging and electrophysiological methods of personalizing DBS programming. Normative connectome-base stimulation utilizes large datasets of normal or disease-matched connectivity imaging. The stimulation location for an individual patient can then be varied to engage regions associated with optimal connectivity. Electrophysiology-guided open- and closed-loop stimulation capitalizes on the electrophysiological recording capabilities of modern implanted devices to individualize stimulation parameters based on biomarkers of success or symptom onset. Finally, individual functional MRI (fMRI)-based approaches use fMRI during active stimulation to identify parameters resulting in characteristic patterns of functional engagement associated with long-term treatment response. Each method provides different but complementary information, and maximizing treatment efficacy likely requires a combined approach."

    "abstract": "Botulinum toxin is considered first-line treatment for focal hand dystonia in musicians. Mild, temporary weakness is a common accompaniment of effective injection. We present a unique case of delayed-onset, severe, prolonged weakness and atrophy in a patient with musician's dystonia, successfully treated with botulinum toxin for over 10 years, following injection of his usual muscles at his well-established dose. This pianist received botulinum toxin treatment for more than 10 years, with a stable response. Six weeks after an injection, he developed progressive severe weakness and atrophy of the affected forearm involving both injected and uninjected muscles. Weakness and atrophy took over one year without further injections to resolve. The clinical course and laboratory testing were not suggestive of brachial neuritis, plexopathy, or neuralgic amyotrophy. The literature contains rare case reports of severe weakness and atrophy after botulinum toxin injection, sometimes with delayed onset and sometimes affecting distant muscles. Frequently presenting with pain, such cases often have evidence of plexopathy or neuralgic amyotrophy which were absent in our patient. Clinicians should be aware of this rare potential severe adverse event associated with botulinum toxin."

    "abstract": "Congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) is one of the most common congenital musculoskeletal deformities, and is defined as tilted head position with hypertonic sternocleidomastoid muscle and limited cervical spine mobility. Incidences up to 16% have been recorded, more often in male children. Clinical features are characterized by an inclined position of the head on the diseased side and a gaze directed towards the healthy side, deformities such as plagiocephaly, and various complications. In order to prevent this, it is recommended to screen all infants up to four months of age. Diagnosis is usually made through history and physical examination. CMT treatment is carried out conservatively, and the habilitation program is created individually, depending on the degree of CMT. The habilitation program includes neck stretching exercises, neck muscle strengthening exercises, motor activities that encourage a symmetrical movement pattern, adaptation to the environment, and education and support of parents or guardians to ensure a daily, intensive home program. Early treatment is one of the main prognostic factors on which the outcome and duration of treatment depend. As this is the only prognostic factor that we can act on, our goal is to speed up the diagnosis and therapy implementation until the cure."

Nine patients (five females) were included from five French movement disorders centers. The mean age at symptom onset was 10.78 ± 2.22 years (median, 11; range, 7-14). Dystonia was the first most common motor symptom (six patients). The mean time from symptom onset to genetic diagnosis was 13.33 ± 9.21 years (median, 11; range, 3-32). The most commonly reported non-motor symptoms were sleep disorders (seven patients), anxiety (six patients), and depression (five patients). The first treatment was L-dopa in four patients, dopamine agonist in two, carbamazepine in two, and rasagiline in one. Dyskinesia and impulse control disorders were the most common treatment-related side effects (nine and six patients, respectively). Four patients underwent deep brain stimulation surgery. The last available follow-up was at 27.22 ± 14.05 years (median, 28; range, 6-56) after the diagnosis. This is the first study reporting detailed clinical features and long-term management of <i>PRKN</i> patients with pediatric onset.

    "abstract": "The proteasome plays a pivotal role in protein degradation, and its impairment is associated with various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. It is well understood that Nrf1 coordinates the induction of all proteasome genes in response to proteasome dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanism regulating the basal expression of the proteasome remains unclear. Here we identify the transcription factor THAP1, the causative gene of DYT6 dystonia, as a regulator of proteasome activity through a genome-wide genetic screen. We demonstrated that THAP1 directly regulates the expression of the PSMB5 gene, which encodes the central protease subunit β5. Depletion of THAP1 disrupts proteasome assembly, leading to reduced proteasome activity and the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. These findings uncover a regulatory mechanism for the proteasome and suggest a potential role for proteasome dysfunction in the pathogenesis of dystonia."

    "abstract": "Physiotherapy is considered part of first line treatment for functional motor disorder (FMD) although not all patients benefit. Predictors of treatment outcome may help to inform triage decisions. We aimed to determine which baseline variables predicted treatment outcome in the pragmatic multicentre Physio4FMD randomised controlled trial of specialist physiotherapy for FMD. Participants randomised to the specialist physiotherapy arm of the trial were included in the analysis. Treatment outcome was dichotomised into improvement vs no improvement, based on two measures, Short Form 36 Physical Functioning (SF36 PF) and participant-rated Clinical Global Impression Scale of Improvement (CGI-I). Predictors of outcome were selected from baseline variables. Univariate logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio of improvement for each variable. Variables associated with improvement at p < 0.1 were considered for inclusion in a multiple logistic regression model. A greater perception of having control over recovery predicted improvement on the CGI-I (OR 1.18, 95 % CI 1.07, 1.31). Predictors of lack of improvement were an increased perception of the permanence of symptoms, predicting lack of improvement on the SF36 PF (OR 0.91, 95 % CI 0.84, 0.99) and older age, predicting lack of improvement on the CGI-I (OR 0.97, 95 % CI 0.95, 0.998). Age and perceptions of symptom control were weak predictors of outcome from specialist physiotherapy. In contrast, a number of factors commonly believed to predict poorer treatment response, including illness duration and levels of pain and fatigue, were not related to the outcomes measured in this study."

    "abstract": "The effect of botulinum toxin A (BoNTA) on non-motor symptoms (NMS) in patients with cervical dystonia remains an area of significant clinical interest, given the profound impact of these symptoms on patients' quality of life. While the therapeutic efficacy of BoNTA in alleviating motor symptoms of cervical dystonia is well established, its impact on NMS such as depression, anxiety disorder, and sleep disturbance requires further investigation. This systematic review synthesizes the latest evidence on the effects of BoNTA on these selected non-motor symptoms. A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases identified 266 articles, of which eight studies met our strict inclusion criteria. Pre- and post-intervention changes in depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance were assessed in a total of 280 adult patients with cervical dystonia treated with BoNTA. The results indicate that BoNTA has a positive effect on depressive symptoms, with most studies showing a statistically significant improvement after treatment. Similarly, studies are reporting significant reductions in anxiety scores following BoNTA treatment. However, the effects of this treatment method on sleep disturbances were less conclusive, with none of the reviewed studies showing significant improvements in sleep quality or daytime sleepiness. The results highlight the potential of BoNTA to positively influence non-motor symptoms, particularly depression and anxiety, in patients with cervical dystonia, although its effects on sleep remain unclear. These findings underscore the need for further research to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the non-motor effects of BoNTA and to develop comprehensive treatment strategies."

    "title": "Thalamic deep brain stimulation improves movement in a cerebellar model of lesion-based status dystonicus.",
    "abstract": "Dystonia is the third most common movement disorder and an incapacitating co-morbidity in a variety of neurologic conditions. Dystonia can be caused by genetic, degenerative, idiopathic, and acquired etiologies, which are hypothesized to converge on a \"dystonia network\" consisting of the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex. In acquired dystonia, focal lesions to subcortical network regions lead to dystonia that can be difficult to manage with canonical treatments, including deep brain stimulation (DBS). While studies in animal models have begun to parse the contribution of individual nodes in the dystonia network, how acquired injury to the cerebellar outflow tracts instigates dystonia; and how network modulation interacts with symptom latency remain unexplored questions. Here, we present an electrolytic lesioning paradigm that bilaterally targets the cerebellar outflow tracts. We found that lesioning these tracts, at the junction of the superior cerebellar peduncles and the medial and intermediate cerebellar nuclei, resulted in transient, acute, and severe dystonia with immobility and fixed posturing similar to status dystonicus. We observed a rapid reduction in dystonia with 1 ​h of DBS of the centrolateral thalamic nucleus, a first order node in the network downstream of the cerebellar nuclei. In contrast, 1 ​h of stimulation at a second order node in the short latency, disynaptic projection from the cerebellar nuclei, the striatum, did not show similar rapid modulation of dystonia. Our study introduces a robust paradigm for inducing acute, severe dystonia, and demonstrates that targeted modulation based on network principles powerfully rescues motor behavior. These data inspire the identification of a short latency therapeutic target for acquired dystonia and status dystonicus."

The ADR occurred two times within 3 weeks of the two-injection start and was effectively treated with benztropine each time. The patient tolerated maintenance treatments of AOM 400 mg without recurrent ADR. A key risk factor in this patient was a prior ADR to a different antipsychotic. We also speculate on the potential roles of strenuous physical activity and infection in increasing the sensitivity to the two-injection initiation regimen compared with the conventional one-injection start. The two-injection start of AOM has been approved by regulatory bodies on the basis of population pharmacokinetic modelling. Our case may, therefore, identify a new safety concern with this alternative initiation option that was not captured in the modelling."

    "abstract": "The deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has attracted more attention for primary Meige syndrome due to easier target location and lower power consumption. However, potential and reliable preoperative predictors of longitudinal outcomes of STN-DBS to guide therapeutic decisions remain largely unexplored. Herein, we used preoperative structural MRI and Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) from 55 patients with primary Meige syndrome who finished STN-DBS after 5 years. They were further classified into response (<i>n</i> = 23) and super-response (<i>n</i> = 32) based on the improvement rates of BFMDRS. Voxel-based morphology, partial correlation analyses, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses and support vector machine were performed. We identified that improved rates of BFMDRS were 63, 71.97, 76.64, 79.51, 81.02, 81.36, 81.16, 80.80 and 80.93% at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after STN-DBS, respectively, and remained steady across 1-5 years. Further voxel-based morphology analyses revealed significantly lower grey-matter volume in the right hippocampus, left putamen, right supramarginal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus in response when compared with super-response. The grey-matter volumes in the left putamen, right supramarginal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus were not only positively correlated with improvement rates of BFMDRS after STN-DBS for 5 years in the primary Meige syndrome, but also presented a reliable classification ability in distinguishing response and super-response (area under curve = 0.855). These results suggested that STN-DBS is an effective treatment for primary Meige syndrome, and preoperative grey-matter volume of putaminal-cortical circuits could be used as potential biomarkers to predict longitudinal outcomes."

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) involves a group of rare neurogenetic disorders often linked with iron overload in the basal nuclei of the brain presenting with spasticity, dystonia, muscle rigidity, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and retinal degeneration. Among NBIA subtypes, beta-propeller-protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is associated with mutations in the autophagy gene WDR45 (WD repeat domain 45). Previously, we demonstrated that WDR45 mutations in BPAN cellular models impaired autophagy, iron metabolism, and cell bioenergetics. In addition, antioxidant supplementation partially improved cell physiopathology; however, autophagy and cell bioenergetics remained affected. In this work, we explored the possibility of expressing the normal WDR45 allele present in the inactive chromosome X (Xi) of BPAN cells through treatment with epigenetic modulators. The aim of this study was to demonstrate whether biotin, an epigenetic nutrient, was able to restore the expression levels of WDR45 by a mechanism involving Xi reactivation and, consequently, correct BPAN defects. Our study demonstrated that biotin supplementation increases histone biotinylation and allows for the transcription of the WDR45 allele in Xi. Consequently, all physiopathological alterations in BPAN cells were notably corrected. The reactivation of Xi by epigenetic modulators can be a promising approach for the treatment of BPAN and other X-linked diseases."

    "abstract": "Dystonia is a rare-disease trait for which large-scale genomic investigations are still underrepresented. Genetic heterogeneity among patients with unexplained dystonia warrants interrogation of entire genome sequences, but this has not yet been systematically evaluated. To significantly enhance our understanding of the genetic contribution to dystonia, we (re)analyzed 2,874 whole-exome sequencing (WES), 564 whole-genome sequencing (WGS), as well as 80 fibroblast-derived proteomics datasets, representing the output of high-throughput analyses in 1,990 patients and 973 unaffected relatives from 1,877 families. Recruitment and precision-phenotyping procedures were driven by long-term collaborations of international experts with access to overlooked populations. By exploring WES data, we found that continuous scaling of sample sizes resulted in steady gains in the number of associated disease genes without plateauing. On average, every second diagnosis involved a gene not previously implicated in our cohort. Second-line WGS focused on a subcohort of undiagnosed individuals with high likelihood of having monogenic forms of dystonia, comprising large proportions of patients with early onset (81.3%), generalized symptom distribution (50.8%) and/or coexisting features (68.9%). We undertook extensive searches for variants in nuclear and mitochondrial genomes to uncover 38 (ultra)rare diagnostic-grade findings in 37 of 305 index patients (12.1%), many of which had remained undetected due to methodological inferiority of WES or pipeline limitations. WGS-identified elusive variations included alterations in exons poorly covered by WES, RNA-gene variants, mitochondrial-DNA mutations, small copy-number variants, complex rearranged genome structure, and short tandem repeats. For improved variant interpretation in WGS-inconclusive cases, we employed systematic integration of quantitative proteomics. This aided in verifying diagnoses related to technically challenging variants and in upgrading a variant of uncertain significance (3 of 70 WGS-inconclusive index patients, 4.3%). Further, unsupervised proteomic outlier-analysis supplemented with transcriptome sequencing revealed pathological gene underexpression induced by transcript disruptions in three more index patients with underlying (deep) intronic variants (3/70, 4.3%), highlighting the potential for targeted antisense-oligonucleotide therapy development. Finally, trio-WGS prioritized a de-novo missense change in the candidate PRMT1, encoding a histone-methyltransferase. Data-sharing strategies supported the discovery of three distinct PRMT1 de-novo variants in four phenotypically similar patients, associated with loss-of-function effects in in-vitro assays. This work underscores the importance of continually expanding sequencing cohorts to characterize the extensive spectrum of gene aberrations in dystonia. We show that a pool of unresolved cases is amenable to WGS and complementary multi-omic studies, directing advanced etiopathological concepts and future diagnostic-practice workflows for dystonia."

    "abstract": "Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is an invaluable strategy for preventing the inheritance of genetic disorders and promoting the birth of healthy children. Nevertheless, the general public's limited understanding of genetics and low awareness of available services obstruct effective utilization of genetic counseling. Our analysis of a family affected by mitochondrial genetic disease aims to improve public understanding of genetic knowledge and the importance of genetic counseling. We gathered comprehensive data on a family with mitochondrial disease and scrutinized the genetic sequencing and diagnostic procedures used to identify mitochondrial disease within the family. In a case involving a family with two daughters, both began to exhibit symptoms such as abnormal gait, myodystonia, and excessive fatigue at the age of 4. These symptoms were incorrectly assumed to be paternally inherited, as the mother believed the father had a mild intellectual disability. As a result, the family opted for ART, specifically in vitro fertilization (IVF) with donor sperm, without thorough genetic counseling or a conclusive diagnosis for the children. Despite these precautions, the son born from IVF presented with symptoms mirroring his sisters' at the age of 6, including typical MRI abnormal signals in the bilateral basal ganglia. Furthermore, the eldest daughter's naturally conceived child also started to show identical symptoms by the age of 3. Subsequent genetic testing revealed a homoplasmic pathogenic mutation in the MT-ND6 gene (m.14459G>A), confirming that the dystonia was maternally inherited, with the mother exhibiting an 89.2% heteroplasmic variation in the same gene. This case study demonstrates the significant consequences of a lack of genetic knowledge and prevailing misconceptions when applying ART. It underscores the urgent need to bolster genetic literacy and emphasizes the vital importance of informed decision-making within genetic healthcare services."

To identify factors associated with MD and analyze their impact on disability. We conducted a prospective study starting in 2017, with annual visits according to a structured protocol. Patients were selected from the study database and their clinical and genetic features analyzed. The cohort comprised 193 symptomatic patients. Machado-Joseph disease (MJD, also SCA3 or ATX-ATXN3) and cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (ATX-RFC1) were the most common autosomal dominant (AD) or recessive forms, with a frequency of 14.0% and 15.0%, respectively. MD were present in 95 (54.4%), with dystonia being the most common (49.2%). Tremor was identified in 10.9%, Parkinsonism in 4.1% and chorea in 3.6% patients. Myoclonus and tics were rare (2.6% and 0.5%). The presence of MD was associated with AD inheritance and ATXN3. MD, regardless of type, correlated with higher SARA score at baseline, increased fall frequency, confinement to wheelchair, and earlier occurrence of falls and of permanent use of walking aid. Movement disorders, particularly dystonia, were common in our cohort. This highlights the possible role of the cerebellum in MD, but also extra-cerebellar involvement in some HCA. Presence of MD significantly worsened motor disability, highlighting the need for strategies of early identification and tailored management."

The observed phenotypic spectrum ranged from childhood-onset dystonia (N = 2) over unspecific intellectual disability syndromes (N = 2) to undiagnosed behavioral symptoms in adulthood (N = 1). Samples bearing p.Arg2565Gly had a KMT2B-typical episignature, although the effect on methylation was less pronounced than in carriers of loss-of-function KMT2B variants.

This report presents a rare case of severe isolated cervical dystonia in a young male patient that progressed to type IV atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation, highlighting the clinical presentation and diagnostic challenges associated with this condition. A 27-year-old male patient presented with abnormal head posture and severe cervical pain. Clinical examinations revealed severe cervical muscle spasms and a unique head posture, as if he was looking at the tip of his right shoulder. Radiological evaluation revealed a type IV atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation. Despite initial attempt of close reduction under anesthesia, recurrence of the subluxation occurred, and surgical intervention was necessary. This case underscores the importance of thorough clinical evaluation and imaging in the diagnosis of isolated cervical dystonia, particularly given its potential to present with atypical features. These findings suggest that early recognition and intervention may be critical for preventing complications and improving patient outcomes."

While spasticity and dystonia are well studied, the review emphasizes the need for interventions addressing muscle morphology and extracellular matrix stiffness. It introduces emerging therapies like cryoneurolysis, hyaluronidase, and extracorporeal shockwave therapy, calling for more research on their long-term efficacy and safety."

    "title": "Loss-of-function mutations in the dystonia gene THAP1 impair proteasome function by inhibiting PSMB5 expression.",
    "abstract": "The 26S proteasome is a multi-catalytic protease that serves as the endpoint for protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Proteasome function requires the concerted activity of 33 distinct gene products, but how the expression of proteasome subunits is regulated in mammalian cells remains poorly understood. Leveraging coessentiality data from the DepMap project, here we characterize an essential role for the dystonia gene THAP1 in maintaining the basal expression of PSMB5. PSMB5 insufficiency resulting from loss of THAP1 leads to defects in proteasome assembly, impaired proteostasis and cell death. Exploiting the fact that the toxicity associated with loss of THAP1 can be rescued upon exogenous expression of PSMB5, we define the transcriptional targets of THAP1 through RNA-seq analysis and perform a deep mutational scan to systematically assess the function of thousands of single amino acid THAP1 variants. Altogether, these data identify THAP1 as a critical regulator of proteasome function and suggest that aberrant proteostasis may contribute to the pathogenesis of THAP1 dystonia."

    "abstract": "<i>PLA2G6</i>-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN) is a complex heterogenous group of neurodegenerative diseases that results from mutations in a gene known as <i>PLA2G6</i>. PLAN comprises three phenotypes with overlapping clinical and radiologic features: (1) Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD), (2) Atypical neuroaxonal dystrophy (ANAD), and (3) <i>PLA2G6</i>-related dystonia-parkinsonism complex (PLAN-DPC). The onset of <i>PLA2G6</i>-related DPC occurs in adulthood, and patients often have normal birth and development. These patients show clinical manifestations of Parkinsonian syndrome, characterized by bradykinesia and tremors with dystonia, in addition to cognitive regression as well as gait instability. Here, we report a case of PLAN-DPC phenotype in a 20-year-old girl. This case report highlights the detection of a novel variant of <i>PLA2G6</i> gene mutation, c.757G>A, which has an allelic frequency of 0.001% in the gene database."

    "title": "The epidemiology and phenomenology of non-antipsychotic-induced dystonia: a hybrid systematic-narrative review.",
    "abstract": "Medication-induced dystonia (MID) is a movement disorder (MD), characterized by involuntary sustained or intermittent muscle contractions, causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements, postures, or both. Although MID is commonly associated with the use of antipsychotics, it also occurs with many other medications widely used in clinical practice. A systematic literature search (from inception to November 2023), using the PubMed and Embase databases, was conducted without language restriction for articles reporting on MID in people without pre-existing MDs, and this for all potentially relevant non-antipsychotic medications. A narrative synthesis of the available evidence was undertaken. MID is common (1 to 10%) with certain antiemetics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the antiepileptics valproate, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine are rarely (0.01 to 0.1%) or very rarely (<0.01%) associated with MID. All other medications are very rarely (<0.01%) associated with MID or have a risk that cannot be precisely estimated. The actual rate of dystonic reactions with most non-antipsychotic agents remains unknown, owing to misdiagnosis and underreporting in the scientific literature. In general, MID seems to occur more often in children and adolescents, even with a single low dose, and with polymedication. In most cases, MID is acute in onset (occurring within hours to days) and involves the head and neck. Although MID is most common with dopamine receptor-blocking antiemetics, many other medications may also produce dystonic reactions, particularly in children and adolescents. Although such incidents remain rare, there are indications that MID is underreported for many classes of medications."

In the field of movement disorders, investigators are facing an increasing growth in the volume of produced patient-derived datasets, providing substantial opportunities for precision medicine approaches based on extensive information accessibility and advanced annotation practices. Integrating data from multiple sources, including phenomics, genomics, and multi-omics, is crucial for comprehensively understanding different types of movement disorders. Here, we explore formats and analytics of big data generated for patients with movement disorders, including strategies to meaningfully share the data for optimized patient benefit. We review computational methods that are essential to accelerate the process of evaluating the increasing amounts of specialized data collected. Based on concrete examples, we highlight how bioinformatic approaches facilitate the translation of multidimensional biological information into clinically relevant knowledge. Moreover, we outline the feasibility of computer-aided therapeutic target evaluation, and we discuss the importance of expanding the focus of big data research to understudied phenotypes such as dystonia."

    "abstract": "Writer's cramp (WC) dystonia is an involuntary movement disorder with distributed abnormalities in the brain's motor network. Prior studies established the potential for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to either premotor cortex (PMC) or primary somatosensory cortex (PSC) to modify symptoms. However, clinical effects have been modest with limited understanding of the neural mechanisms hindering therapeutic advancement of this promising approach. This study aimed to understand the motor network effects of rTMS in WC that correspond with behavioral efficacy. We hypothesized that behavioral efficacy is associated with modulation of cortical and subcortical regions of the motor network. In a double-blind, cross-over design, twelve WC participants underwent rTMS in one of three conditions (Sham-TMS, 10 Hz PSC-rTMS, 10 Hz PMC-rTMS) while engaged in a writing task to activate dystonic movements and measure writing fluency. Brain connectivity was evaluated using task-based fMRI after each TMS session. 10 Hz rTMS to PSC, but not PMC, significantly improved writing dysfluency. PSC-TMS also significantly weakened cortico-basal ganglia, cortico-cerebellum, and intra-cerebellum functional connectivity (FC), and strengthened striatal FC relative to Sham. Change in PSC and SPC BOLD activity were associated with reduced dysfluent writing behavior. 10 Hz rTMS to PSC improved writing dysfluency by redistributing motor network connectivity and strengthening somatosensory-parietal connectivity. A key signature for effective stimulation at PSC and improvement in writing dysfluency may be strengthening of intra-cortical connectivity between primary somatosensory and superior parietal cortices. These findings offer mechanistic hypotheses to advance the therapeutic application of TMS for dystonia."

    "abstract": "The management of forearm tumors requires a precise clinical examination and the performance of further examinations before considering possible surgical management is necessary, particularly in the case of professional musicians. In this specific population, certain differential diagnoses may fail to identify an organic cause for a painful symptomatology. Among the known causes is musician's focal dystonia (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20590806/, n.d.; Rozanski et al., 2015). 65-year-old patient, professional violinist, who consulted for a tumor of the forearm, with involuntary tremor-like movements which recently made it impossible to play the violin. Tumor removal was performed and anatomopathological analysis revealed a schwannoma. The patient was able to play the violin from the first week after surgery and the tremors disappeared. Musician's dystonia could be envisaged here, given the presence of discomfort only during instrumental practice. The management of this tumor required a precise clinical examination, with the musician's instrument. Musician's dystonia must remain a diagnosis of elimination. We report a misleading case of a nerve tumor in a musician that could easily be mistaken for dystonia at first glance."

This study reports a rare case of adult-onset Leigh syndrome (LS) and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and dystonia (LDYT) overlap syndrome caused by the m.10197G>A mutation in ND3. A review of the literature was conducted to investigate the clinical spectrum, treatment and outcome resulting from the m.10197G>A mutation. Phenotypes associated with the m.10197G>A mutation were classified into three categories: LS/LS+ (LS-involved overlap syndrome), Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)/LHON+ (LHON-involved overlap syndrome) and other mitochondrial encephalopathies or presentations. A total of 84 participants (78 patients and 6 asymptomatic carriers) with the m.10197G>A mutation retrieved from 33 articles and the patient whose case we reported were included in the review and meta-analysis. Among all the participants, 55.3% (47/85) and 28.2% (24/85) presented with LS/LS+ and LHON/LHON+, respectively. The median age at onset for LS/LS+ was significantly younger than that for LHON/LHON+ [median, (Q1-Q3), 3.0 (0.58-9.5) vs. 13.5 (5.75-41.75), P = 0.001]. A negative linear correlation was observed between mutation load and age of onset in patients who presented with LS/LS+ (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.592, P < 0.001), with the age of onset ranging from infancy to adulthood. Patients with an older age at onset [OR (95% CI), 1.46 (1.12-1.91), P = 0.005] or higher mutation loads [OR (95% CI), 1.14 (1.03-1.26), P = 0.011] were more likely to present with LHON/LHON+ than with LS/LS+. A total of 17 patients were documented as having received a combination of mitochondrial cofactor treatments. Compared with patients with LHON/LHON+, patients with LS/LS+ exhibited an exceedingly high probability of a stable or worsen outcome (93.8% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.006). LS/LS+ and LHON/LHON+ are the predominant presentations of the m.10197G>A mutation. An older age at onset and greater mutation load increases the probability of an LHON/LHON+ presentation. Patients presenting with LS/LS+ have an exceedingly high possibility of an unfavorable outcome. The identification of factors and outcomes associated with phenotypes in patients with the m.10197G>A mutation facilitates the provision of improved prognostic counseling for patients and their family members who are carriers of this mutation."

    "abstract": "Craniocervical dystonia (CCD) is a large-scale network disorder that involves functional changes in multiple brain regions. However, the association between these functional changes and the underlying molecular mechanisms has not been explored. We aimed to characterize the molecular changes associated with the imaging-defined functional architecture of the brain in CCD. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data were obtained from 146 patients with CCD and 137 healthy controls (HCs). Differences in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF), and regional homogeneity (ReHo) were compared between groups. Transcriptomic data were obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas to identify the gene expression patterns underlying the affected functional architecture in CCD using partial least squares regression. Compared to HCs, patients with CCD showed common functional alterations, mainly in the left middle occipital gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus, right calcarine, right precentral gyrus, and left postcentral gyrus. These functional alteration patterns were positively associated with 1763 genes (including five risk genes for dystonia) enriched for synaptic signaling, regulation of trans-synaptic signaling, and neuronal systems, while they were negatively associated with 2318 genes (including eight risk genes for dystonia), which were enriched for monoatomic cation transport, DNA damage response and neurodevelopment. Our study reveals a genetic pathological mechanism explaining CCD-related brain functional changes."

    "abstract": "Movement disorders after dengue virus (DENV) infection have been increasingly recognized. We aimed to synthesize the clinical and paraclinical characteristics, treatment responses, and outcomes of these neurologic complications. We systematically reviewed PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and LILACS databases up to September 2023 following a published protocol. We identified 73 cases of DENV-induced movement disorders. Cerebellar ataxia was the most common, followed by parkinsonism, opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome, and dystonia. Movement disorders typically developed within 14 days of DENV infection and were associated with a range of neurological symptoms, including cognitive impairment and psychiatric disturbances. Neuroimaging studies frequently showed abnormalities in the basal ganglia and brainstem. Treatment varied depending on the specific movement disorder and included corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and symptomatic medications. Whereas a handful of cases met the criteria for acute encephalitis, many lacked sufficient data to establish a definitive diagnosis. Para-infectious and postinfectious immune-mediated movement disorders were also reported. A rare case of chronic progressive panencephalitis due to DENV infection highlights the potential for long-term neurological consequences. Other DENV-related complications, such as stroke, pituitary apoplexy, subacute thyroiditis, and metabolic disturbances, can also cause movement disorders. We emphasize the importance of recognizing the diverse neurological manifestations of DENV infection and the need for further research to improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and optimize treatment strategies. We propose a more rigorous approach to determining the causality between infection and movement disorder, demanding stronger evidence beyond mere association and advocating for targeted research to fill the existing knowledge gaps. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."

    "abstract": "Although the motor symptoms of Wilson's disease have received particular attention from researchers and medical professionals, non-motor symptoms might become increasingly prevalent with the advancement of the disease and can even appear before the onset of motor symptoms. However, clinicopathological correlations for most of these non-motor features are still poorly understood. The correlations between non-motor and motor symptoms have been examined in this study. Fifty patients with Wilson's disease participated in this study. Each subject was administered the Global Assessment Scale and the Non-Motor Symptom Questionnaire (NMS Quest) for the assessment of motor and non-motor symptoms, respectively. Cognitive functions were evaluated with Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (Bengali version) and the Digit Span Test. Sleep-related problems were assessed with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Of the patients who participated in this study, 82%, 56%, 90%, 18%, 82%, 8%, 60%, 56%, and 66% had digestive, urinary, apathy-attention-memory, hallucinations/delusions, depression/anxiety, sexual function, cardiovascular, sleep disorder, and miscellaneous (pain, weight, swelling, sweating, and diplopia) symptoms, respectively. NMS-Digestion ( P ≤ 0.001), NMS-Urinary ( P = 0.007), NMS-Miscellany ( P = 0.001), NMS-Memory (0.011), and NMS-Sleep Disorder ( P = 0.031) significantly predicted parkinsonism. NMS-Digestion was a significant predictor of dystonia ( P < 0.001). Awareness regarding non-motor symptoms and their associations with motor symptoms might help physicians develop more efficient treatment regimens that can alleviate non-motor symptoms which can be equally troublesome and disabling for these patients. Management of non-motor symptoms is crucial for the overall well-being of these patients."

Altered gait is the defining feature, along with a range of associated motor and nonmotor symptoms. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence and impact of these symptoms in people with functional gait disorder. A total of 156 people with functional gait disorder completed an online survey that included demographic information, self-reported symptoms, and standardized questionnaires. Weakness (85.9%) and reduced balance (80.1%) were the most prevalent motor symptoms, while fatigue (85.9%), somatosensory (69.9%), and cognitive (69.9%) symptoms were the most prevalent nonmotor symptoms. Logistic regression indicated that dependent ambulation had the greatest association with fear of falling and functional seizures (X<sup>2</sup> (11, n = 128) = 40.68, p < 0.001). Stepwise regression indicated that functional seizures, muscle rigidity, depression, fear of falling, pain, and speech symptoms were associated with reduced participation in work and social function (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.39, F (6, 120) = 14.31, p < 0.001).

We report the first Korean familial case involving twin boy and girl carrying a novel pathogenic <i>BCAP31</i> variant which was inherited from their mother. The male proband, born prematurely with very low birth weight (VLBW), exhibited severe global developmental delay, microcephaly, failure to thrive, dystonia, seizures, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) requiring cochlear implantation, and mild facial dysmorphism. A brain MRI revealed white matter atrophy, thinning of the corpus callosum, and delayed myelination. The twin sister presented with mild developmental delays and bilateral SNHL but did not experience seizures or dystonia. Their mother also had bilateral SNHL. Whole genome sequencing identified a hemizygous pathogenic variant, c.247C>T (p.Gln83Ter), in the <i>BCAP31</i> in the proband.

    "abstract": "This perspective article addresses the critical and up-to-date problem of task-specific musician's dystonia (MD) from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Theoretically, MD is explored as a result of impaired sensorimotor interplay across different brain circuits, supported by the most frequently cited scientific evidence-each referenced dozens of times in Scopus. Practically, MD is a significant issue as it occurs over 60 times more frequently in musicians compared to other professions, underscoring the influence of individual training as well as environmental, social, and emotional factors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel application of the FeeSyCy principle (feedback-synchrony-plasticity), which emphasizes the pivotal role of feedback in guiding inter-neuronal synchronization and plasticity-the foundation of learning and memory. This model integrates with established literature to form a comprehensive framework for understanding MD as an impaired FeeSyCy-mediated relationship between the individual and their environment, ultimately leading to trauma. The proposed approach provides significant advantages by enabling the development of innovative therapeutic and preventive strategies. Specifically, it lays the groundwork for multimodal psycho-physical therapies aimed at restoring balance in the neural circuits affected by MD. These strategies include personalized psychotherapy combined with physical rehabilitation to address both the psychological and physiological dimensions of MD. This integration offers a practical and value-added solution to this pressing problem, with potential for broad applicability across similar conditions."

To evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of pallidal neurostimulation in patients with isolated generalized or segmental dystonia. Extension study of the prospective multicenter trial (n = 40; July 2002 to May 2004), all patients received effective stimulation and underwent regular follow-up. The 10-year follow-up (n = 31) included Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) motor and disability score, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale. Primary and secondary endpoints compared motor symptoms, disability scores, mood, and cognition changes. Thirty-one patients (12 female), aged 23-72 years, completed the 10-year study extension. Per protocol analysis showed sustained significant improvement in BFMDRS motor scores at 10 years compared with baseline, without significant change from the 6-month or 5-year follow-up. On average, motor scores decreased by 25.3 ± 5.2 points at 10 years (P < 0.0001; 56% improvement). Individual outcomes varied, with 27 responders (≥25% improvement; mean improvement 65.2 ± 21.4%) and 13 non-responders compared with baseline. Sustained improvements were seen in disability, mood, and anxiety scores. Cognition remained stable. This study presents the longest prospective, multicenter follow-up of pallidal neurostimulation in generalized and segmental dystonia. Two-thirds of patients showed strong and stable long-term improvements of dystonia, confirming sustained efficacy and safety over 10 years in treatment-refractory dystonic patients. However, one-third experienced primary (3/40) or secondary (10/40) treatment failure. Diagnostic advances, including genetic testing, and technological progress in pallidal neurostimulation may help to reduce the non-responder rates in the future. © 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Psychotropic medications, particularly antipsychotics, are known to elicit various adverse effects, with ocular complications being underreported yet significant. This case series presents three instances where atypical antipsychotics, namely Risperidone, Cariprazine, and Olanzapine, led to ocular dystonias and nystagmus. These adverse effects occurred at relatively low doses, highlighting the need for vigilant monitoring even with second-generation antipsychotics. Case descriptions delineate patients experiencing acute dystonic reactions and nystagmus following initiation or dose adjustment of atypical antipsychotics, leading to upward deviation of the eyes, involuntary movements, and nystagmus. Prompt recognition and management were crucial, with cessation of the offending medication resulting in symptom remission and subsequent stabilization with alternative treatments. Factors contributing to these adverse effects, such as dopamine receptor blockade and individual susceptibility, are explored, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive evaluation and open patient-physician communication. The present case series underscores the necessity of vigilant monitoring for ocular adverse effects, even with atypical antipsychotics, given their potential to induce acute dystonias and nystagmus. The presented cases advocate for heightened awareness among clinicians to promptly recognize and manage such rare complications, ensuring optimal patient care and treatment outcomes."

There are currently no effective treatments available, apart from symptomatic options. In this work, we suggest harnessing personalized RNA therapy to treat <i>GNAO1</i> patients and focus specifically on a recurrent pathogenic variant (E246K). We systemically screened allele-specific antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting the mutated allele to identify a potent and specific sequence using both reporter-based platforms and a patient-derived cellular model. We show that reduction of mutated <i>GNAO1 in vitro</i> by knockout or by ASO has a beneficial functional outcome, which can be measured by cAMP accumulation and gene expression changes. We established a Gnao1-E246K mouse model that shows a neurological phenotype, which partially recapitulates the human condition. Due to sequence similarity, the mouse can be treated with the selected ASO to test treatment efficacy in animal models, as shown <i>in vitro</i> using murine neural progenitor cells.

Although tremors are the most commonly reported movement disorder in MS, less frequent manifestations such as paroxysmal tonic spasms, dystonia, chorea, ballism, myoclonus, myokymia, restless leg syndrome, and hemifacial spasms can also occur. Chorea and ballism are particularly rare in MS. We report the case of a 20-year-old female who presented with a 1-month history of unsteady gait and involuntary movements of the right upper limb. Neurological examination revealed slight deviation of the angle of the mouth, hypertonia of both lower limbs, brisk knee reflexes, and involuntary, rapid, irregular, semi-purposeful movements of the right upper limb. The initial suspicion was Sydenham's chorea due to prolongation of PR interval (220 ms) and the presentation of choreiform movements. However, extensive workup including normal acute rheumatic fever markers, normal metabolic and infectious profiles, and negative autoimmune screenings did not support this diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed positive oligoclonal bands, and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple demyelinating plaques in characteristic locations for MS. The patient was diagnosed with MS and treated with steroids and valproate, followed by azathioprine. At 3-month follow-up, the patient showed significant improvement in motor functions, regaining the ability to walk and perform daily activities independently. Acute unilateral dyskinesia in young patients, especially when other common etiologies are ruled out, should prompt consideration of MS.

Motor function, quality of life, neuropsychological status, and emotional state were assessed using standardized scales at baseline and every 3-6 months thereafter. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors affecting long-term motor function after GPi-DBS in patients with steady-state (stable) Meige syndrome.

At the final postoperative evaluation, Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale movement and disability scores showed improvements of 69% (p < 0.001) and 61% (p < 0.001), respectively. A significant improvement from baseline was observed in postoperative scores on the 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey. Throughout continuous neurostimulation, global cognitive function, neuropsychological status, and mood remained stable. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that longer disease duration (standardized β-coefficient -0.375, 95% CI -0.033 to -0.011; p < 0.001) and reduced volume of activated tissue within the sensorimotor subregion of the GPi (standardized β-coefficient 0.597, 95% CI 0.002-0.003; p < 0.001) were independently associated with worse long-term motor performance. Bilateral GPi-DBS is an effective, safe, and promising treatment option for intractable Meige syndrome and provides sustained benefits in motor function and quality of life without inducing cognitive or mood-related side effects. Early intervention and accurate electrode placement in the sensorimotor subregion of the GPi are essential for optimizing long-term therapeutic outcomes."

    "abstract": "Genetic dystonia is a complex movement disorder with diverse clinical manifestations resulting from pathogenic mutations in associated genes. A recent paradigm shift emphasizes the functional convergence among dystonia genes, hinting at a shared pathomechanism. However, the neural dynamics supporting this convergence remain largely unexplored. Herein, we analyzed microelectrode recordings acquired during pallidal deep brain stimulation surgery from 31 dystonia patients with pathogenic mutations in the AOPEP, GNAL, KMT2B, PANK2, PLA2G6, SGCE, THAP1, TOR1A, and VPS16 genes. We identified 1,694 single units whose activity was characterized by a broad set of neural features. AOPEP, PANK2, and THAP1 displayed higher firing regularity, whereas GNAL, PLA2G6, KMT2B, and SGCE shared a large fraction of bursting neurons (> 26.6%), significantly exceeding the rate in other genes. TOR1A and VPS16 genes constituted an intermediate group, bridging these 2 groups, due to having the highest degree of spiking irregularity. Hierarchical clustering algorithms based on these dynamics confirmed the results obtained with first-order comparisons. Despite lacking common molecular pathways, dystonia genes share largely overlapping structures of neural patterns, in particular the degree of pallidal spiking regularity and bursting activity. We propose that the degree of desynchronization facilitated by pallidal neural bursts may explain the variability in deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) surgery outcomes across genetic dystonia syndromes. Lastly, investigating the effects of genetic mutations on low-frequency pallidal activity could optimize personalized adaptive DBS treatments in patients with genetic dystonia.

We present an axial spondylarthritis case revealed by atlantoaxial subluxation. Case Report: We report the case of a 30-year-old man diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) after being admitted to our department for acute atlantoaxial subluxation-related symptoms. We conducted a literature review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines using the MEDLINE database, including case reports and case series of atlantoaxial dislocation in axial spondylarthritis patients. We included 16 articles. There were 134 patients (including our case), mainly male (n=119). The mean age was 34.43±12.96 years. Atlantoaxial dislocation revealed axial spondylarthritis in 4 cases. The main clinical manifestations were neck pain (12 cases), limb weakness with numbness (7 cases), cervical range of motion limitation (6 cases), neck stiffness (4 cases), muscle dystonia (2 cases), and dyspnoea (1 case). Specific neurologic signs were found in 4 patients. The atlantoaxial dislocation was anterior in 118 cases, rotatory in 5 cases, lateral in 1 case, and posterior in 1 case. Surgical treatment was the preferred option in most cases, consisting of C1-C2 arthrodesis. Outcomes were not detailed in 121 cases and were favourable for the rest. Only one patient died following a recurrence of spinal cord compression. Physicians need to be aware of atlantoaxial dislocation, as it could lead to spinal cord compression, vascular compression, and other serious life-threatening complications that may require surgical management."

To assess the effect of Botulinum toxin on non-motor symptoms and quality of life in patients with adult-onset idiopathic focal dystonia. Patients aged > 18 years diagnosed with idiopathic focal dystonia were recruited in this longitudinal cohort study. The severity of dystonia, non-motor symptoms, and quality of life were evaluated using the BFMDRS, DNMSQuest, and EQ-5D at baseline and 1 and 3 months after botulinum toxin. 65 patients were recruited with a median age of 59 years. Blepharospasm was the most common phenomenology. 49.2% of patients had depression at baseline assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). There was a significant negative correlation between baseline BFMDRS, DNMSQuest, BDI, and HAM-A scores and quality of life, but there was no relation with the type of focal dystonia. The mean percentage improvement in the BFMDRS-M, BFMDRS-D, DNMSQuest, BDI, HAM-A and EQ-5D was 25%, 52%, 16%,20%,23% and 23%, respectively, at one month. There was no statistically significant correlation between percentage change in motor scores compared to depression and quality of life scores at one month. Botulinum toxin improved motor and non-motor scores and quality of life at 1 and 3 months after botulinum toxin therapy. The motor scores did not correlate with depression and DNMSQUEST scores but showed a weak positive correlation with anxiety scores."

    "abstract": "Gsx2 is a homeodomain transcription factor critical for development of the ventral telencephalon and hindbrain in mouse. Loss of Gsx2 function results in severe basal ganglia dysgenesis and defects in the nucleus tractus solitarius (nTS) of the hindbrain, together with respiratory failure at birth. De Mori et al. (2019) reported two patients with severe dystonia and basal ganglia dysgenesis that encode distinct recessive GSX2 variants, including a missense variant within the homeodomain (GSX2Q251R). Hence, we modelled the homologous Gsx2 mutation (i.e. Gsx2Q252R) in mouse, and our biochemical analysis revealed that this variant selectively altered DNA binding. Moreover, mice carrying the Gsx2Q252R allele exhibited basal ganglia dysgenesis, albeit to a lesser extent than did Gsx2 null mice. A notable difference between Gsx2Q252R and Gsx2 null mice was that Gsx2Q252R mice survived, and hindbrain analysis revealed relative sparing of the glutamatergic nTS neurons and catecholaminergic A1/C1 and A2/C2 groups. Thus, the Gsx2Q252R variant is a hypomorph that compromises a subset of Gsx2-dependent neuronal subtypes and highlights a critical role for distinct thresholds of catecholaminergic and/or glutamatergic nTS neurons for viability."

This study aimed to investigate the coupling correlation between morphological and microstructural alterations in patients with idiopathic dystonia. Structural T1 imaging and diffusion tensor imaging were performed on a relatively large cohort of patients. Multidimensional structural analyses, including voxel-based analyses, voxel-based morphology, fixel-based analyses and surface-based morphometry, were performed to explore these structural alterations. Probabilistic tractography and correlation analyses were employed to examine these relationships. A total of 147 patients with idiopathic dystonia and 137 healthy controls were recruited in this study. There were no significant differences in the cortical morphometry between patients with idiopathic dystonia and healthy controls using voxel- and surface-based morphometry. However, the grey matter volume of the bilateral thalamus, fractional anisotropy in the right anterior corona radiata, right retrolenticular part of the internal capsule and right posterior corona radiata, and the fibre density and cross-section combined in the fibre tract connecting the left ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus and left area 5 m, were significantly decreased in patients with idiopathic dystonia compared with those in healthy controls. Furthermore, the reduced grey matter volume in the right thalamus not only correlated with the disease duration but also with the reduced fractional anisotropy in the right posterior corona radiata and decreased the fibre density and cross-section combined in the fibre tract connecting the left ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus and the left area 5 m in patients with idiopathic dystonia. These findings suggest that the thalamus is structurally impaired in idiopathic dystonia and that microstructural disruption in thalamocortical projections occurs secondary to thalamic atrophy."

Tardive syndromes are usually mixed movement disorders, with specific phenotypes, which may lead to severe disability. The pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. Treatment ranges from medical options, particularly dopamine-depleting agents and chemodenervation (botulinum toxin), to surgical options (deep brain stimulation and lesioning surgeries).

The aims of this retrospective study were to determine (i) how often the planned (imaging based) placements of electrodes were changed due to MER and intraoperative test stimulation in Parkinson's disease (PD), dystonia and essential tremor (ET) patients; (ii) whether the frequency of repositioning changed over time; (iii) whether patients' age or disease duration (in PD) influenced the frequency of repositioning. Data on the planned and the final placement of 141 electrodes in 72 consecutive DBS treated patients (52 PD, 11 dystonia, 9 ET) was collected over the first 8 years of DBS implementation in a single center. An association between the rate of electrode repositioning and the patients' age, disease duration and the time/year of implementation was explored. Analysis of all targets showed a change in final electrode placement in 39.7 % (56/141); 39.8 % (41/103) in PD, 40.9 % (9/22) in dystonia and 37.5 % (6/16) in ET. Annual analysis showed a decrease in rate of repositioning between the centre's first and eighth year (p = 0.013) of implementation. No correlation was found between electrode repositioning rate and patient age (p = 0.42) nor disease duration (p = 0.09) in PD. This retrospective analysis confirms the benefit of MER and intraoperative test stimulation during DBS surgery in determining the final electrode position during the early / initial period of implementing the procedure.

Neurosurgery for mixed MRH includes intrathecal baclofen (ITB) and lumbosacral ventral-dorsal rhizotomy (VDR). Surgical efficacy limitations can be mitigated by combining the two into a multimodal strategy. The authors examined outcomes following a multimodal neurosurgical strategy combining intraspinal ITB catheter revision to the cervical level and lumbosacral VDR. Two patients with severe MRH resistant to ITB delivered through a thoracic catheter tip were identified: 1) a 16-year-old boy with quadriplegic mixed hypertonia and 2) a 17-year-old girl with secondary dystonia. The patient in case 1 experienced improvement in his Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale (BADS) score from 29 to 17 and lower-extremity modified Ashworth Scale score from 4 to 0 at 18 months postoperatively; the patient in case 2 experienced a decrease in her BADS score from 30 to 13 at 6 months postoperatively. Significant improvement in caregiving provisions, including patient positioning and transfers, was reported. The authors highlight favorable outcomes using multimodal surgery in pediatric patients. Multimodal therapy is surgically feasible and better addresses MRH, particularly in patients in whom ITB monotherapy and polypharmacy have failed.

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for essential tremor is remarkably effective, leading to over 80% reduction in standardized tremor ratings. However, for certain types of tremor, such as those accompanied by ataxia or dystonia, conventional DBS targets have shown poor efficacy. Various rationales for using cerebellar DBS stimulation to treat tremor have been advanced, but the varied approaches leave many questions unanswered: which anatomic target, stimulation settings, and indications seem most promising for this emerging approach. This article reviews the clinical experience published to date and explores some of the pre-clinical and human physiology data that might support a role for further systematic investigation of cerebellar DBS for clinical use. Four tremor disorders to date have been targeted with cerebellar DBS in humans: essential tremor, post-stroke tremor, dystonic tremor, and tremor associated with degenerative cerebellar ataxias, like spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. The dentate nucleus is the most frequently chosen target, but key stereotactic and imaging details are missing from many of the case reports. Interestingly, consensus on laterality has not been definitively established as there are conflicting models of the hypothesized mechanism of action of DBS of the dentate nuclei, and conflicting reports of benefit on the tremor ipsilateral to and contralateral toto the affected limb. Several points are highlighted, including the prediction from in vivo preclinical physiology studies and interventional studies, the remaining uncertainty regarding the preferred laterality of targets, and the lack of clear prioritization of tremor etiologies to be targeted in future rigorously designed interventional studies (e.g., preferably repeated n-of-1 or sham-controlled studies involving more than one patient)."

    "abstract": "Writer's cramp (WC) dystonia is an involuntary movement disorder with distributed abnormalities in the brain's motor network. Prior studies established the potential for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to either premotor cortex (PMC) or primary somatosensory cortex (PSC) to modify symptoms. However, clinical effects have been modest with limited understanding of the neural mechanisms hindering therapeutic advancement of this promising approach. This study aimed to understand the motor network effects of rTMS in WC that correspond with behavioral efficacy. We hypothesized that behavioral efficacy is associated with modulation of cortical and subcortical regions of the motor network. In a double-blind, cross-over design, twelve WC participants underwent rTMS in one of three conditions (Sham-TMS, 10 Hz PSC-rTMS, 10 Hz PMC-rTMS) while engaged in a writing task to activate dystonic movements and measure writing fluency. Brain connectivity was evaluated using task-based fMRI after each TMS session. 10 Hz rTMS to PSC, but not PMC, significantly improved writing dysfluency. PSC-TMS also significantly weakened cortico-basal ganglia, cortico-cerebellum, and intra-cerebellum functional connectivity (FC), and strengthened striatal FC relative to Sham. Changes in PSC and SPC BOLD activity were associated with reduced dysfluent writing behavior. 10 Hz rTMS to PSC improved writing dysfluency by redistributing motor network connectivity and strengthening somatosensory-parietal connectivity. A key signature for effective stimulation at PSC and improvement in writing dysfluency may be strengthening of intra-cortical connectivity between primary somatosensory and superior parietal cortices. These findings offer mechanistic hypotheses to advance the therapeutic application of TMS for dystonia. 10 Hz repetitive TMS to somatosensory cortex reduces writing dysfluency in dystoniaIncreased somatosensory cortex activity correlates with reduced writing dysfluencyIn dystonia + sham-TMS, writing dysfluency correlates with cerebellar connectivity.10 Hz rTMS to somatosensory cortex induces reorganization of the motor network."

But with the onset of BoNT therapy, the natural course of a disease is obscured. Nevertheless, the present study tries to analyze patients' \"suspected\" course of disease severity under the assumption that no BoNT therapy had been performed and compares that with the \"experienced\" improvement during BoNT treatment. <b>Methods:</b> For this cross-sectional study, all 112 BoNT long-term treated patients in a botulinum toxin out-patient department were recruited who did not interrupt their BoNT/A therapy for more than two injection cycles during the last ten years. Patients had to assess the remaining severity of their disease as a percentage of the severity at onset of BoNT therapy and to draw three different graphs: (i) the CoDB-graph showing the course of severity of patient's disease from onset of symptoms to onset of BoNT/A therapy, (ii) the CoDA-graph illustrating the course of severity from onset of BoNT/A therapy until recruitment, and (iii) the CoDS-graph visualizing the suspected development of disease severity from onset of BoNT/A therapy until recruitment under the assumption that no BoNT/A therapy had been performed. Three different types of graphs were distinguished: the R-type indicated a rapid manifestation or improvement, the C-type a continuous worsening or improvement, and the D-type a delayed manifestation or response to BoNT therapy. Four patient subgroups (cervical dystonia, other cranial dystonia, hemifacial spasm, and the migraine subgroup) comprised 91 patients who produced a complete set of graphs which were further analyzed. The \"experienced\" improvement and \"suspected\" worsening of disease severity since the onset of BoNT/A therapy were compared and correlated with demographical and treatment related data. <b>Results:</b> Improvement was significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and varied between 45 and 70% in all four patient subgroups, the \"suspected\" worsening was also significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) larger than 0, except in the migraine patients and varied between 10 and 70%. The \"total benefit\" (sum of improvement and prevented \"suspected\" worsening) was the highest in the other cranial dystonia group and the lowest in the migraine subgroup. The distributions of R-,C-,D-type graphs across CoDB-, CoDS-, and CoDB-graphs and across the four patient subgroups were significantly different. <b>Conclusions:</b> (i) Most BoNT long-term treated patients have the opinion that their disease would have further progressed and worsened if no BoNT/A therapy had been performed, (ii) The type of response to BoNT/A is different across different subgroups of BoNT/A long-term treated patients."

    "abstract": "Botulinum toxin (BoNT), the most potent substance known to humans, likely evolved not to kill but to serve other biological purposes. While its use in cosmetic applications is well known, its medical utility has become increasingly significant due to the intricacies of its structure and function. The toxin's structural complexity enables it to target specific cellular processes with remarkable precision, making it an invaluable tool in both basic and applied biomedical research. BoNT's potency stems from its unique structural features, which include domains responsible for receptor recognition, membrane binding, internalization, and enzymatic cleavage. This division of labor within the toxin's structure allows it to specifically recognize and interact with synaptic proteins, leading to precise cleavage at targeted sites within neurons. The toxin's mechanism of action involves a multi-step process: recognition, binding, and catalysis, ultimately blocking neurotransmitter release by cleaving proteins like SNAP-25, VAMP, and syntaxin. This disruption in synaptic vesicle fusion causes paralysis, typically in peripheral neurons. However, emerging evidence suggests that BoNT also affects the central nervous system (CNS), influencing presynaptic functions and distant neuronal systems. The evolutionary history of BoNT reveals that its neurotoxic properties likely provided a selective advantage in certain ecological contexts. Interestingly, the very features that make BoNT a potent toxin also enable its therapeutic applications, offering precision in treating neurological disorders like dystonia, spasticity, and chronic pain. In this review, we highlight the toxin's structural, functional, and evolutionary aspects, explore its clinical uses, and identify key research gaps, such as BoNT's central effects and its long-term cellular impact. A clear understanding of these aspects could facilitate the representation of BoNT as a unique scientific paradigm for studying neuronal processes and developing targeted therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "RINCH (Rhythmic Ictal Non-Clonic Hand movements), a lateralizing sign in frontotemporal epilepsy, has been well described in the adult epilepsy population but not in the pediatric setting. We looked for evidence of RINCH as an ictal sign in pediatric epilepsy monitoring unit reports in a large academic pediatric hospital. We found nine patients with RINCH ictal phenomenon over a five-year period. We compared the characteristics of their epilepsy to the known data in adult patients. The patient age range was 6-15 years. Five patients had a lesion in the temporal lobe; the remaining four were non-lesional. The ictal EEG onset was in one temporal lobe in five patients. The remaining patients had frontal or non-localizable onset. However, ictal activity was present in the frontal lobe(s) in six patients at the time of RINCH. Seven occurrences of RINCH were contralateral to the epileptogenic lesion and/or ictal scalp EEG activity. The remaining patients were non-lesional with bilateral frontotemporal ictal activity. Dystonia was ipsilateral to the RINCH in two patients. This study reinforces the lateralizing significance of RINCH as an ictal phenomenon when it is present. RINCH may be rare in the pediatric epilepsy population, but it may also be under-reported."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Meige syndrome, compare the efficacy of globus pallidus internus (GPi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) as targets, and identify potential outcome predictors. The PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched to collect individual data from patients with Meige syndrome receiving DBS. Outcomes were assessed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale motor (BFMDRS-M) and disability (BFMDRS-D) scores. Data were analyzed using pooled meta-analysis. The study is registered in the PROSPERO database. The analysis included 233 patients from 26 studies, with significant publication bias (p = 0.008, Egger's test), but showed significant improvements in BFMDRS-M (65.09% ± 26.65%) and BFMDRS-D (53.48% ± 42.44%) scores at the final follow-up (mean duration 27.10 ± 33.64 months). No significant differences were observed in BFMDRS-M score improvement (mean difference -2.58%, 95% CI -15.84% to 10.69%; p = 0.430) or risk difference for response (-0.97%, 95% CI -10.08% to 8.15%; p = 0.835) between the GPi and STN target groups at the final follow-up across all follow-up periods (0 to ≤ 6, > 6 to ≤ 12, > 12 to ≤ 24, > 24 to ≤ 36, and > 36 months). Multiple regression analysis revealed a negative correlation between disease duration and treatment efficacy and a positive correlation between preoperative BFMDRS score and treatment outcome. DBS significantly improves motor symptoms and disability in patients with Meige syndrome, with GPi and STN targets providing comparable efficacy. The efficacy of DBS diminishes with longer disease duration, underscoring the importance of early intervention."

This narrative review presents a comprehensive overview of their applications in this field, offering an updated perspective on their potential for early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and therapeutic evaluation. Emerging MRI modalities such as neuromelanin-sensitive imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, and relaxometry provide sensitive biomarkers that can detect early microstructural degeneration, iron deposition, and connectivity disruptions in key regions like the substantia nigra. These techniques enable earlier and more accurate differentiation of movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body and frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, and dystonia. Furthermore, MRI provides objective metrics for tracking disease progression and assessing therapeutic efficacy, making it an indispensable tool in clinical trials. Despite these advances, the absence of standardized protocols limits their integration into routine clinical practice. Addressing this gap and incorporating these techniques more systematically could bring the field closer to leveraging advanced MRI for personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving outcomes for individuals with movement disorders."

    "abstract": "Functional neurological movement disorders are common and disabling. Little is known about their coexistence with other non-functional movement disorders and their impact on the general disease burden. Investigating frequency and characteristics of functional movement disorders in GCH1-positive dopa-responsive dystonia patients. Twenty-one patients underwent a detailed clinical motor examination and completed self-questionnaires evaluating non-motor characteristics. Seven patients (33 %) had comorbid functional movement symptoms, including functional gait disorders (n = 7), balance disturbances (n = 7), and weakness (n = 5), dominating the clinical phenotype and resulting in disability with immobilization. None of them was previously diagnosed with or treated for the functional symptoms. Functional movement symptoms appeared suddenly (on average 18 years after the first dopa-responsive dystonia symptoms) and were unresponsive to L-Dopa. These patients showed significantly higher disability and received unnecessary treatments. Functional neurological movement disorders are common in patients with dopa-responsive dystonia and impact the clinical picture and the degree of disability. Diagnosing both disorders in an individual patient has substantial therapeutical implications because increases in L-Dopa dosages to treat functional symptoms should be avoided, and physiotherapy should relocate attention away from the affected body region so that movements in the affected body part can be executed without external control to facilitates automatic movements. Physiotherapy should be complemented by psychoeducation and psychotherapeutic approaches."

    "abstract": "Cervical dystonia (CD) is characterized by involuntary neck muscle spasms that lead to abnormal head movements or postures. It is associated with somatosensory (tactile and proprioceptive) dysfunction. Here we tested whether vibro-tactile stimulation (VTS) of the cervical muscles constitutes a non-invasive form of neuromodulation of the somatosensory system that can provide temporary symptom relief for people with CD. In a multi-centre study, 67 CD patients (44 female) received VTS to sternocleidomastoid and/or trapezius muscles for up to 45 min under 9 different stimulation conditions. Retention was assessed 1, 5 and 20 min past VTS. Head angles and neck muscle EMG were recorded. The primary outcome measure was a head angle index (HAI), a composite measure reflecting the head deviation across the three axes of the head. After identifying the most effective VTS condition for each participant, analysis showed that 85 % (57/67) of participants experienced an improvement in HAI of at least 10 % during the application of VTS. HAI improved by 50 % or higher in 26/67 of participants. For those responding to VTS, the effects tended to decay within 20 min. For the different CD phenotypes several stimulation sites could induce similarly large relative improvements in head posture. The study provides first systematic evidence that cervical VTS can induce fast-acting improvements in abnormal head posture in patients with CD. It demonstrates that a stimulation of somatosensory afferent networks modulates the innervation of dystonic muscles. It highlights the potential of cervical VTS as an adjuvant, non-invasive neuromodulation treatment in CD."

    "title": "Basal ganglia components have distinct computational roles in decision-making dynamics under conflict and uncertainty.",
    "abstract": "The basal ganglia (BG) play a key role in decision-making, preventing impulsive actions in some contexts while facilitating fast adaptations in others. The specific contributions of different BG structures to this nuanced behavior remain unclear, particularly under varying situations of noisy and conflicting information that necessitate ongoing adjustments in the balance between speed and accuracy. Theoretical accounts suggest that dynamic regulation of the amount of evidence required to commit to a decision (a dynamic \"decision boundary\") may be necessary to meet these competing demands. Through the application of novel computational modeling tools in tandem with direct neural recordings from human BG areas, we find that neural dynamics in the theta band manifest as variations in a collapsing decision boundary as a function of conflict and uncertainty. We collected intracranial recordings from patients diagnosed with either Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 14) or dystonia (n = 3) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus internus (GPi), and globus pallidus externus (GPe) during their performance of a novel perceptual discrimination task in which we independently manipulated uncertainty and conflict. To formally characterize whether these task and neural components influenced decision dynamics, we leveraged modified diffusion decision models (DDMs). Behavioral choices and response time distributions were best characterized by a modified DDM in which the decision boundary collapsed over time, but where the onset and shape of this collapse varied with conflict. Moreover, theta dynamics in BG structures modulated the onset and shape of this collapse but differentially across task conditions. In STN, theta activity was related to a prolonged decision boundary (indexed by slower collapse and therefore more deliberate choices) during high conflict situations. Conversely, rapid declines in GPe theta during low conflict conditions were related to rapidly collapsing boundaries and expedited choices, with additional complementary decision bound adjustments during high uncertainty situations. Finally, GPi theta effects were uniform across conditions, with increases in theta associated with a prolongation of decision bound collapses. Together, these findings provide a nuanced understanding of how our brain thwarts impulsive actions while nonetheless enabling behavioral adaptation amidst noisy and conflicting information."

This study aimed to identify effective sites for thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treating this condition. Four patients presenting with focal hand dystonia underwent thalamic DBS. Effective stimulation sites were identified through a combination of physiological and radiological mapping. All patients exhibited significant improvement in their hand dystonia. The most effective stimulation sites were localized in the anterior regions of the ventral intermedius nucleus (Vim), involving both Vim and the ventrooral nucleus. Thalamic DBS proves highly effective in managing focal hand dystonia. The identified effective stimulation sites suggest the involvement of both the pallidothalamocortical and cerebellothalamocortical pathways in its pathophysiology."

We analyzed adverse event (AE) reports from the FAERS database between Q4 2003 and Q2 2024, focusing on AEs associated with CsA and TAC in NS patients aged 18 years and younger. We employed three signal detection methods-Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Relative Reporting Ratio (RRR), and Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR)-to assess the risk of drug-related AEs. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the influence of gender on AE occurrence. A total of 207 CsA-related and 145 TAC-related AE reports were included. CsA was significantly associated with nephropathy toxic (ROR = 8.26, 95% CI: 4.21-16.20), urine output decreased (ROR = 29.93, 95% CI: 3.66-244.61), and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (ROR = 6.70, 95% CI: 3.17-14.14). TAC was associated with an increased risk of dystonia (ROR = 67.93, 95% CI: 8.63-534.86), kidney fibrosis (ROR = 22.65, 95% CI: 8.16-62.87), and diabetic ketoacidosis (ROR = 46.51, 95% CI: 5.68-380.97). Sensitivity analysis indicated that gender influenced the occurrence of AEs, with CsA showing higher nephrotoxicity in male patients, while TAC was more strongly associated with metabolic disorders and neurological AEs in female patients. In pediatric NS patients, CsA primarily induces nephrotoxicity and neurological complications, whereas TAC is more likely to cause kidney fibrosis and metabolic disorders. Enhanced monitoring of these AEs and individualized drug adjustments based on patient characteristics are recommended to optimize treatment outcomes and reduce AE incidence."

Copper accumulation in the basal ganglia, disrupts dopaminergic pathways, contributing to dystonia's development via neurotransmitter imbalance. Despite advances in diagnosis and management, WD with dystonia remains a challenging condition to treat. We aim to report the unprecedented co-occurrence of pathogenic genetic variants in both the ATP7B and KMT2B genes in a patient with WD. A 13-year-old male presented at 12 with dysarthria and bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings. Over months, dystonia spread to his left foot, upper limb, and trunk, accompanied by slowed daily activities. Diagnostic tests included MRI for brain structure, abdominal ultrasound for liver function, serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels to assess copper metabolism, and 24-hour urine copper tests for excretion levels. Whole exome sequencing was conducted using genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples. Variant classification followed guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. The sequencing revealed compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the ATP7B gene: NM_000053.4:c.2165dupT and NM_000053.4:c.813C>A. A pathogenic variant in the KMT2B gene, NM_014727:c.3052delA, was identified. This case highlights WD co-occurrence with ATP7B and KMT2B mutations, suggesting KMT2B as a potential genetic modifier."

One of the reasons for treatment failure is the in accuracy of injections. Some physicians rely on Anatomical Landmarks (AL) for injections, while others use either Ultrasound (US) or Electromyography guidance (EMGg) to improve accuracy. This retrospective two-center study compared the therapeutic outcomes of AL-based and EMGg injections with USg injections. Demographic and clinical assessments of previous visits and current visits were recorded between 2019 and 2023. Fifty-one patients were included. Six patients were injected using AL, 14 patients under EMGg, and 31 patients received USg injections. Pain relief was significantly lower for the AL group (40.0% ± 22.4%) compared to both USg and EMGg (81.2% ± 34.0% and 82.2% ± 10.3%, respectively; p = 0.001). Dysphagia was reported in 7.1% of EMGg and 16% of the USg group and none of those treated with AL (p > 0.05). The results of this study demonstrated that the clinical outcomes of USg and EMGg BonTA injections are comparable and both techniques are superior to AL. The main side effect observed was dysphagia, which was more common in the USg group, although without reaching statistical significance."

We analyzed data from the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database from April 2004 to November 2023. Cases involving oral SGAs, excluding clozapine, were extracted. We used the odds ratios to assess the reporting proportions among SGAs and sex, analyzed the median time-to-onset and interquartile ranges (IQRs), and conducted a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to investigate the time-to-onset of dystonia and its relationship to outcomes. We extracted 9837 cases involving oral SGAs. Lurasidone was associated with a significantly higher proportion of dystonia reports than risperidone, aripiprazole, quetiapine, and olanzapine. The reporting proportion of dystonia associated with aripiprazole was lower than that of paliperidone and risperidone, but higher than that of quetiapine and olanzapine. Female sex was significantly associated with a higher reporting proportion of dystonia compared with males. Among the 148 cases of oral SGA-induced dystonia, the median time-to-onset was 125 days (IQR, 19.75-453.25 days). Divided into the three outcome groups (recovered, improved, and unrecovered/residual), those with better outcomes had a shorter time-to-onset than those with poorer outcomes. ROC curve analysis suggested a threshold of 91.5 days for discriminating outcomes, with a sensitivity of 71.7% and specificity of 69.9%. The risks of dystonia may vary among SGAs and between sexes. SGA-induced dystonia often manifests in the tardive form."

BCAP31 encodes one of the most abundant chaperones, with several functions including acting as a negative regulator of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) concentration. Here, we characterize an X-linked syndrome, its underlying genotype, and a functional evaluation of the identified candidate genetic variant. Evaluation of motor features, neuroimaging studies, neurophysiological, and cognitive tests. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was applied, a plasmid encoding BCAP31 with and without a candidate variant was transfected into SH-SY5Y cells to assess subcellular location and to measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the cytoplasm. Adult-onset ataxia, cognitive impairment, and hearing loss leading to deafness are the predominant features. Reduced penetrance, slow progression with preserved ability to walk in advance age, and universal cerebellar atrophy are other features for this syndrome. This condition is associated with the new variant c.22G>A (V8I) in BCAP31 at Xq28. The subcellular location of the V8I BCAP31 protein was not altered but caused significant elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Our findings expand the spectrum of variants in BCAP31 from neurodevelopmental syndromes to include a progressive neurodegenerative disease with variable expressivity. This is the first time ataxia is described in association with a BCAP31 variant and functional evidence of pathogenicity is provided. Additional BCAP31 cases featuring ataxia are needed to establish an association. © 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and cervical dystonia (CD) are associated with abnormal neuronal activity in the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Reduced firing rate and presence of spiking bursts are typical for CD, whereas PD is characterized by high frequency tonic activity. This research aims to identify the most important pallidal spiking parameters to classify these conditions. We analysed the single unit activity of the globus pallidus externus (GPe) and internus (GPi) in 11 CD and 10 PD patients who underwent standard-of-care DBS implantation. We compared firing rate, firing pattern and oscillatory characteristics of tonic, burst and pause cells and used logistic regression and random forest models to classify patients according to their pallidal activity. In the GPi, we discovered prevalence of high firing rate tonic cells in patients with PD, whereas in dystonia, burst neurons with high firing rate were predominant. GPi pause cells were mostly observed in CD patients and exhibited less spike variability compared to PD. Characteristics of neurons and their distribution in the GPe was similar. Logistic regression and random forest models identified spike variability and randomness as the key features for distinguishing between PD and CD, instead of firing rate or oscillation properties. Our study demonstrates that pallidal activity can predict PD and CD with high accuracy. Burst dynamics and characteristics of spiking randomness including entropy appear to be the most meaningful reflections of the neurophysiology of studied diseases."

    "abstract": "Antibody-negative autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a form of encephalitis characterized by the absence of detectable autoimmune antibodies, despite immunological evidence. However, data on management of patients with antibody-negative AE in the intensive care unit (ICU) are limited. This study aimed to explore the characteristics and subtypes of antibody-negative AE, assess the effects of immunotherapy, and identify factors independently associated with poor functional outcomes in patients requiring intensive care. This retrospective, single-center study analyzed consecutive adult patients diagnosed with antibody-negative AE and admitted to the ICU of a large tertiary hospital between 2019 and 2023. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify factors linked to poor functional outcomes six months after ICU admission, as defined by a modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6. Generalized linear mixed models were applied to evaluate the effect of immunotherapy on longitudinal changes in the Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis and modified Rankin Scale scores. Of the 1220 patients with severe encephalitis admitted to the ICU, 107 were diagnosed with antibody-negative AE and included in the analysis. Six months after ICU admission, 67 patients (62.6%) had poor functional outcomes, including 28 deaths (26.2%). Factors independently associated with poor outcomes were high-dose corticosteroid therapy (odds ratio [OR] 8.734, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.483-30.717), older age at onset (OR 1.063, 95% CI 1.028-1.099), acute respiratory failure at ICU admission (OR 10.931, 95% CI 2.062-57.751), and dyskinesia/dystonia (OR 14.109, 95% CI 1.336-148.957). The generalized linear mixed model also indicated that high-dose corticosteroid therapy was associated with poorer longitudinal outcomes. While high-dose corticosteroids are frequently used to treat AE, their risks may outweigh their benefits in severe antibody-negative AE cases. Older patients and those with dyskinesia/dystonia or respiratory failure, may require more careful monitoring and timely intervention for improved outcomes. However, prospective validation of these findings is necessary to confirm their applicability and guide future treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "<i>VPS13D</i>-related disorders are autosomal recessive genetic disorders characterized by movement disorders primarily including ataxia and spasticity, mainly accompanying developmental delay, seizures, and neuroimaging abnormalities. <i>VPS13D</i>-related spectrum disorder (VSD) may better reflect the characteristics of the disease. So far, the relationship of <i>VPS13D</i> genotype and phenotype of VSD has not been established. We analyzed clinical data and collected DNA samples from a severe patient and his healthy parents. Whole exome sequencing was performed by next-generation sequencing. We presented a review of all cases with VSD to establish genotype-phenotype correlation. The patient had compound heterozygous mutations (c.9785T>C, p.L3262P; c.8687C>T, p.T2896M) in <i>VPS13D</i> gene, maternally and paternally inherited, respectively. The p.L3262P is a novel mutation. The individual presented with ataxia, dystonia, developmental delay, epilepsy and neuroimaging abnormalities, including bilateral caudate and putamen, cerebellum, and right temporal lobe, which are the first detailed imaging study reported in VSD to date. We first report that the patient has achieved significant improvement through active treatment. We first summarize genotype-phenotype correlation of VSD, highlighting that the severity of the phenotype is mainly due to the mutations affecting important domains of VPS13D protein or special severe missense mutations. Neuroimaging analysis is helpful to the etiology study of VSD. Active treatment of VSD is still meaningful. Important VPS13D regions correlated with severe phenotype need to be further studied."

However, there is a significant lack of multi-modal neuroimaging databases specifically focused on these conditions, which hampers our comprehensive knowledge of the neural foundations of facial paralysis. To address this critical gap and propel advancements in this area, we have released the Multimodal Neuroimaging Dataset of Meige Syndrome, Facial Paralysis, and Healthy Controls (MND-MFHC). This dataset includes detailed clinical assessments of 53 individuals with facial paralysis (FP), 31 patients with Meige syndrome (MS), and 102 healthy controls (HC). To promote open access, the BIDS-formatted data and associated quality control reports can be accessed through the Science Data Bank (SciDB). By sharing this comprehensive dataset, our aim is to facilitate further research and exploration into the intricate neural mechanisms underlying facial nerve-related pathologies."

    "abstract": "Variants in the <i>GCH1</i> gene, encoding guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase, are associated with dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) and are considered risk factors for parkinson's disease. Comprehensive neurological assessments documented motor and non-motor symptoms in a Chinese family affected by DRD. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was employed to identify potential mutations, with key variants confirmed by Sanger sequencing and analyzed for familial co-segregation. The proband, a 50-year-old woman with a 10-year history of limb rigidity, abnormal posture, and a 23-year history of neck deviation, showed significant symptom improvement with levodopa treatment. Family evaluation revealed similar motor symptoms in four additional affected members, all responding well to levodopa. WES identified a <i>GCH1</i> variant (NM_000161.3: c.-22C > T) in the 5'-untranslated region (5' UTR) in four symptomatic individuals (excluding deceased II-3). This variant likely affects translation by introducing an upstream initiation codon and open reading frame (uORF), leading to decreased BH4 levels and disrupted dopamine synthesis. This study reports a pathogenic variant in the 5' UTR of <i>GCH1</i> in a family with DRD, underscoring the phenotypic heterogeneity associated with this locus. A non-coding variant (c.-22C > T) in the 5' UTR of the <i>GCH1</i> gene is identified in a Chinese family with DRD.The findings reveal significant clinical heterogeneity within the family, highlighting the complex genotype-phenotype relationship."

    "title": "Genomic characterization of Huntington's disease genetic modifiers informs drug target tractability.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's disease is caused by a CAG repeat in the <i>HTT</i> gene. Repeat length correlates inversely with the age of onset but only explains part of the observed clinical variability. Genome-wide association studies highlight DNA repair genes in modifying disease onset, but further research is required to identify causal genes and evaluate their tractability as drug targets. To address these gaps and learn important preclinical information, we analysed genome-wide association study data from a large Huntington's disease age-of-onset study (<i>n</i> = 9064), prioritizing robust candidate Huntington's disease modifier genes using bioinformatic approaches and analysing related information for these genes from large-scale human genetic repositories. We supplemented this information with other Huntington's disease-related screens, including exome studies of Huntington's disease onset and high-throughput assessments of mHTT toxicity. To confirm whether Huntington's disease modifiers are shared across repeat expansion disorders, we also analysed age-of-onset genome-wide association study data from X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism caused by a (CCCTCT)<sub>n</sub> expansion. We also studied modifier-related associations with rare diseases to inform potential off-target therapeutic effects and conducted comprehensive phenome-wide studies to identify other traits linked to these genes. Finally, we evaluated the aggregated human genetic evidence and theoretical druggability of the prioritized Huntington's disease modifier genes, including characteristics recently associated with clinical trial stoppage due to safety concerns (i.e. human genetic constraint, number of interacting partners and RNA tissue expression specificity). In total, we annotated and assessed nine robust candidate Huntington's disease modifier genes. Notably, we detected a high correlation (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.78) in top age-of-onset genome-wide association study hits across repeat expansion disorders, emphasizing cross-disorder relevance. Clinical genetic repositories analysis showed DNA repair genes, such as <i>MLH1</i>, <i>PMS2</i> and <i>MSH3</i>, are associated with cancer phenotypes, suggesting potential limitations as drug targets. <i>LIG1</i> and <i>RRM2B</i> were both associated with neurofibrillary tangles, which may provide a link to a potential role in mHTT aggregates, while <i>MSH3</i> was associated with several cortical morphology-related traits relevant to Huntington's disease. Finally, human genetic evidence and theoretical druggability analyses prioritized and ranked modifier genes, with <i>PMS1</i> exhibiting the most favourable profile. Notably, <i>HTT</i> itself ranked poorly as a theoretical drug target, emphasizing the importance of exploring modifier-based alternative targets. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of human genomic information to prioritize Huntington's disease modifier genes as drug targets, providing a basis for future therapeutic development in Huntington's disease and other repeat expansion disorders."

    "title": "Disgust and Other Negative Emotions in the Relationship between Mental Contamination and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: A Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "Mental contamination (MC) refers to feelings of internal filthiness associated with contamination obsessions. Ego-dystonic memories and thoughts can trigger MC, although it can also be activated by trauma, which is associated with the onset of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Research shows that MC, negative emotions and PTSD can occur simultaneously. Despite considerable interest from researchers and clinicians, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has been carried out on the relationship between disgust and other negative emotions with MC and PTSD. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review to summarise and synthesise the current understanding of these constructs in PTSD. The main objective of this study was to review the association between MC, post-traumatic stress disorder and trauma; the role of disgust and other negative emotions in these associations; and whether the relationship between MC and trauma is limited to traumatic sexual experiences. We searched PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, PubMed, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, Cochrane Library, APA PsycNet, and the Online Library of the University of Algarve. We also included grey literature published in Google Scholar. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Among these, six studies used a randomised methodology, nine used a non-randomised methodology, and five used a descriptive methodology. The results showed that MC is associated with all types of interpersonal trauma, although the relationship with sexual trauma was the strongest. Both basic emotion and disgust sensitivity appear to be significantly associated with MC and the severity of PTSD symptoms. Similarly, other negative emotions are positively associated with MC, although the experience and reappraisal of negative emotions may potentially attenuate the experience of MC. Based on the findings, MC, disgust and negative emotions are important clinical constructs associated with trauma and PTSD. These results may contribute to our understanding and treatment of PTSD."

    "abstract": "The globus pallidus internus (GPi) is the traditional evidence-based deep brain stimulation (DBS) target for treating dystonia. Although patients with isolated \"primary\" dystonia respond best to GPi-DBS, some are primary or secondary nonresponders (improvement <25%), showing variability in clinical response. The aim was to survey current practices regarding alternative DBS targets for isolated dystonia patients with focus on nonresponders to GPi-DBS. A 42-question survey was emailed and distributed during a DBS conference to clinicians involved in DBS for dystonia. The survey covered (1) use of alternative DBS targets as primary or rescue options, (2) target selection based on dystonia phenomenology, (3) experience with secondary nonresponders to GPi-DBS, and (4) management of patients with additional DBS leads. The response rate was 53.8%, including neurologists and neurosurgeons from 28 DBS centers in 13 countries; 89% of neurologists and 86% of neurosurgeons used alternative DBS targets to GPi, with subthalamic nucleus being the most common initial or rescue alternative to GPi. Patients with additional tremor received DBS in the ventral intermediate nucleus or caudal zona incerta. Individual experience ranged from 5 to 25 patients. Most patients were still receiving dual target stimulation at the last follow-up. We show that more than 85% of surveyed clinicians use alternative DBS targets, mostly in some isolated dystonia patients not adequately responsive to GPi-DBS. More knowledge is needed to evaluate outcomes in alternative targets and establish the best strategies for managing insufficient GPi-DBS response in dystonia patients with diverse phenomenology. Our article contributes to establishing a clearer time frame and criteria for defining nonresponders in dystonia patients undergoing DBS."

    "title": "DaxibotulinumtoxinA Treatment for Laryngeal Respiratory Dystonia.",
    "abstract": "Laryngeal respiratory dystonia (LRD) is diagnosed based on clinical presentation, patient history, and physical examination. Key indicators include dyspnea, desynchronized breathing patterns, and laryngoscopic findings that reveal vocal fold adduction during inspiration. Treatment for LRD remains controversial and often yields limited effectiveness. While botulinum toxin type A (BtxA) is commonly injected into the thyroarytenoid-lateral cricothyroid (TA-LCA) muscle complex, there are cases where injections into the interarytenoid (IA) muscle have also proven beneficial. DaxibotulinumtoxinA (DAXI) is an emerging therapy that has shown promising effectiveness and safety across various conditions, including cervical dystonia. In this report, we present the first documented use of DAXI specifically for LRD, highlighting the significant benefits experienced by the patient compared to previous treatments with BtxA. A 77-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of significant shortness of breath. Laryngeal endoscopy demonstrated inappropriate adduction of the patient's vocal folds during respiration, suggestive of LRD. The patient received their first Botox (BtxA) injection in May 2018 and has since undergone a total of 40 injections. The patient had a variable response to BtxA injection into his TA-LCA muscle complex, experiencing general improvement in breathing but frequent negative impact on voice and swallowing function. In November of 2021, electromyography-guided BtxA injection into the patient's IA muscle was performed with significant improvement in results. The patient described near-complete resolution of his LRD breathing symptoms with minimal voice changes and a duration of benefit of ~50 days. In November of 2023, DAXI injection into the patient's IA muscle was performed. The patient self-reported a complete resolution of his symptoms for a total duration of benefit of 91 days. Subsequent injections with DAXI in February and May of 2024 had near identical responses. DAXI appears to provide ~80% better duration than the patient's average BtxA injection and a 57% improvement than his best BtxA injection. DAXI is a safe and realistic alternative to BtxA injection in patients with LRD."

    "abstract": "Lower extremity dystonia (LED) is a frequent complication of Parkinson disease (PD). Treatment with botulinum neurotoxinA (BoNTA) over 8 years was retrospectively reviewed.Cases14 patients with LED received an average of 3.86 injections (1-8). Mean interval was 40 weeks (median of 25). Average dose was 182 units. Injections were well-tolerated. Using a 6 point scale, there was an average of 3.37 point improvement in disability after each session, with average duration of 28.56 weeks (median 11 weeks). After mean follow-up of 101 weeks, disabling dystonia was not present in 11 of 14 patients. Botulinum toxin is safe and effective in PD related LED. Good response to the first two injection sessions was significantly associated with greater likelihood of long-term response. Assertive BoNTA dosing may lead to sustained remission of symptoms. As natural history of LED in PD has not been reported, prospective placebo-controlled studies are needed."

    "abstract": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a psychiatric-neurologic emergency that may require intensive care management. There is a paucity of information about NMS as a critical illness. We reviewed the Mayo Clinic experience. A comprehensive data extraction was completed within the Mayo Clinic system diagnosed with NMS using International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9); ICD-9, Clinical Modification; ICD-10; ICD-10, Clinical Modification; and Health Insurance Claim (HIC) codes between the years of 1995 and 2023. Major criteria included fever, rigidity, tachycardia, and exposure to a neuroleptic agent. Minor criteria included rhabdomyolysis and dysautonomia. Criteria for exclusion were Parkinson's disease, abrupt discontinuation of baclofen or levodopa, concomitant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors use or serotonin syndrome, malignant catatonia, or a classic dystonic reaction. A total of 332 patients had diagnostic codes of NMS, but only 20 patients fulfilled DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision), diagnostic criteria. The average age was 48.2 years (range 20-93 years). Four patients received antipsychotics following postoperative acute agitation or delirium (20%). Previous psychiatric diagnoses were schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in six patients (33%), major depressive disorder in five patients (20%), and bipolar disorder in two patients (10%). Haloperidol was the sole inciting neuroleptic in five patients (25%), but the remainder was associated with atypical or second-generation antipsychotics. A total of nine patients (45%) required mechanical ventilation. The majority of patients had rhabdomyolysis, which led to acute kidney failure in nearly half of them, but none required hemodialysis. Most patients recovered promptly, and no fatalities were directly attributable to NMS; however, four patients (20%) died within 1 month, and four patients died years from diagnosis and unrelated to NMS. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome can become a critical illness, but there is often rapid recovery. Mortality proximate to NMS was uncommon, but late mortality remained substantial. The overwhelming majority of cases coded as NMS did not meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Stricter criteria should be applied when diagnosing NMS in critical care and emergency medicine settings."

    "abstract": "Bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of subthalamic nucleus (STN) has demonstrated efficacy for ameliorating medication-refractory isolated dystonia. Nonetheless, the paucity of evidence regarding its long-term impact on quality-of-life (QoL) necessitates further investigation. This study aimed to elucidate the longitudinal effects of chronic STN stimulation on QoL in patients suffering from isolated dystonia. We enrolled 54 subjects diagnosed with isolated dystonia who underwent STN-DBS and maintained post-operative status for over 5 years. The 36-item Short Form General Health Survey (SF-36) assessed QoL, while the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) evaluated cognitive functioning. The average follow-up since implantation extended to 10.9 years. The data analysis revealed a significant enhancement in QoL following STN-DBS treatment, as Physical Component Summary (PCS), Mental Component Summary (MCS), and Global scores demonstrated substantial improvement from pre-DBS to post-DBS (p < 0.0001). The disease classifications yielded differential results; patients with generalized dystonia exhibited superior improvements in PCS (p = 0.0053) and Global scores (p = 0.0120) compared to other types. Patients aged < 36 at the time of implantation experienced greater improvements in PCS (p = 0.0109) and global scores (p = 0.0057) than older counterparts. Cognitive function, as per the MoCA scale, showed no significant difference between pre- and post-operative scores (p = 0.08). STN-DBS appears to confer enduring improvements to the QoL in dystonia patients, persisting an average of 10 years or more post-surgery. These findings underscore the long-term efficacy of STN-DBS for isolated dystonia and highlight the influence of patient age and disease classification on outcomes."

    "abstract": "Dystonia is a common neurological hyperkinetic movement disorder that can be caused by mutations in anoctamin 3 (ANO3, TMEM16C), a phospholipid scramblase and ion channel. We previously reported patients that were heterozygous for the ANO3 variants S651N, V561L, A599D and S651N, which cause dystonia by unknown mechanisms. We applied electrophysiology, Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements and cell biological methods to analyze the molecular mechanisms that lead to aberrant intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and defective activation of K<sup>+</sup> channels in patients heterozygous for the ANO3 variants. Upon expression, emptying of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> store (store release) and particularly store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) were strongly inhibited, leading to impaired activation of K<sub>Ca3.1</sub> (KCNN) K<sup>+</sup> channels, but not of Na<sup>+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sub>Na</sub>; SLO2). The data provide evidence for a strongly impaired expression of store-operated ORAI1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx channels in the plasma membrane of cells expressing ANO3 variants. Dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling by ANO3 variants may impair the activation of K<sup>+</sup> channels in striatal neurons of the brain, thereby causing dystonia. Furthermore, the data provide a first indication of a possible regulation of protein expression in the plasma membrane by ANO3, as has been described for other anoctamins."

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation is an efficacious treatment for dystonia. While the internal pallidum serves as the primary target, recently, stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been investigated. However, optimal targeting within this structure and its surroundings have not been studied in depth. Indeed, historical targets that have been used for surgical treatment of dystonia are directly adjacent to the STN. Further, multiple types of dystonia exist, and outcomes are variable, suggesting that not all types would profit maximally from the same target. Therefore, a thorough investigation of neural substrates underlying stimulation effects on dystonia signs and symptoms is warranted. Here, we analyze a multicenter cohort of isolated dystonia patients with subthalamic implantations (<i>N</i> = 58) and relate their stimulation sites to improvements of appendicular and cervical symptoms as well as blepharospasm. Stimulation of the ventral oral posterior nucleus of thalamus and surrounding regions were associated with improvements in cervical dystonia, while stimulation of the dorsolateral STN was associated with improvements in limb dystonia and blepharospasm. This dissociation was matched by structural connectivity analysis, where the cerebellothalamic, corticospinal, and pallidosubthalamic tracts were associated with improvements of cervical dystonia, while hyperdirect and subthalamopallidal pathways with alleviation of limb dystonia and blepharospasm. On the level of functional networks, improvements of limb dystonia were associated with connectivity to the corresponding somatotopic regions in the primary motor cortex, while alleviation of cervical dystonia to the cingulo-opercular network. These findings shed light on the pathophysiology of dystonia and may guide DBS targeting and programming in the future."

Recent advances suggest that standard rTMS may be improved by altering the pulse shape; however, there is a paucity of research investigating pulse shape, owing primarily to the technologic limitations of currently available devices. This pilot study examined the feasibility, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of biphasic and monophasic rectangular rTMS for TRD. Twenty adult participants with TRD received randomized biphasic and monophasic rectangular rTMS; 30 rectangular rTMS sessions (3000 pulses per session) were delivered as daily sessions over six weeks at 120% resting motor threshold. Neuropsychologic testing was conducted before and after the six-week treatment course, and at one, four, and 12 weeks after treatment. Two participants withdrew, leaving a final sample size of 18. Both monophasic and biphasic rTMS protocols significantly reduced depressive symptoms in patients with TRD without any significant side effects. In contrast to our hypothesis, there were no differences between the two treatment groups in terms of change in depressive scores, response rates, or remission rates. Findings from this pilot study revealed that both biphasic and monophasic rectangular rTMS are safe and well-tolerated. Larger, double-blind sham-controlled trials are needed to confirm the response and remission rates observed in this study. The Clinicaltrials.gov registration number for the study is NCT02667041."

These complications increase healthcare costs and necessitate surgical revisions. The frequency, timing, and clinical factors associated with lead fractures remain poorly understood. <b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to determine the incidence, timing, and clinical factors associated with lead fractures in a large cohort of DBS patients over a 10-year period. <b>Methods</b>: This retrospective study analyzed data from 325 patients who underwent bilateral DBS implantation at the National Centre for Neurosurgery from 2013 to 2023. The analysis specifically focused on 17 patients who experienced lead fractures during the long-term follow-up period. <b>Results</b>: Among the 325 patients, lead fractures were identified in 17 patients (5.23%), affecting 18 electrodes. The majority of cases involved patients with Parkinson's disease (76.5%) or dystonia (23.5%), with an average age of 59.17 ± 8.77 years. Nearly all patients with lead fractures had a history of trauma. Additionally, two cases were associated with active engagement in sports, particularly activities involving movements like pulling up on a horizontal bar, while Twiddler's Syndrome was identified in two other cases. All electrode fractures required surgical revision. <b>Conclusions</b>: Lead fractures, while rare, remain a significant complication in DBS systems. Precise surgical techniques, early detection, and advancements in DBS hardware design may help to mitigate this risk. Future innovations, such as durable leads or wireless systems, may improve long-term outcomes in DBS therapy for movement disorders."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive neuronal cell damage in some areas of the brain; symptoms are commonly associated with chorea, rigidity and dystonia. The symptoms in Huntington's Disease are caused by a pathological increase in the number of Cytokine-Adenine-Guanine (CAG) repeats on the first exon of the Huntingtin gene, which causes a protein to have an excessive number of glutamine residues; this alteration leads to a change in the protein's conformation and function. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to design, synthesize and evaluate an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO; 95 nucleotides) HTT 90-5 directed to the Huntingtin CAG repeats in primary leukocyte culture cells from a patient with Huntington's Disease; approximately 500,000 leukocytes per well extracted from venous blood were used, to which 100 pMol of ASO were administered, and the expression of Huntingtin was subsequently evaluated at 72 h by RT-PCR. Our results showed that the administration of the HTT 90-5 antisense decreased the expression of Huntingtin mRNA in the primary culture leukocyte cells from our patient. These results suggest that the use of long antisense targeting the CAG Huntingtin cluster may be an option to decrease the expression of Huntingtin and probably could be adjusted depending on the number of CAG repeats in the cluster."

We aim to describe the accumulated experience of a modern movement disorder genetic clinic, highlighting how different available genetic tests might be prioritized according to the clinical phenotype and pattern of inheritance. <b>Methods:</b> Participants were studied through WES analysis. Descriptive statistics, including the mean, standard deviation, counts, and percentages, were used to summarize demographic and clinical characteristics in all subjects and with each type of result [pathogenic or likely pathogenic, variants of uncertain significance (VUS), negative]. <b>Results:</b> We studied 88 patients (93.2% Caucasian, 5.72% African American, and 1.08% Hispanic or Latino). After excluding six family members from four index participants, the diagnostic yield of WES reached 27% (22/82 probands). The age at onset was significantly lower in patients with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants. The most common clinical phenotypes were ataxia and parkinsonism. Dystonia, ataxia, leukoencephalopathy, and parkinsonism were associated with most genetic diagnoses. <b>Conclusions:</b> We propose a comprehensive protocol with decision tree testing for WGS and LRS, a return of results, and a re-analysis of inconclusive genetic data to increase the diagnostic yield of patients with rare neurogenetic disorders."

We investigated the feasibility (ability to increase step counts) and usability of a behavioral intervention using a motivational smartphone application to remotely increase physical activity in PD. We performed a 4-week, double-blind pilot trial. Thirty people with PD who were able to walk independently and did not take more than 7000 steps at baseline were randomized to minimal, moderate, or large increases in step counts. Step counts were continuously collected with the participants' own smartphones. Usability was assessed with a translated version of the System Usability Scale. We reported the distribution of clinical characteristics in our participants. Step counts per day increased over 4 weeks in a dose-dependent pattern (mean ± standard deviation: minimal = 1064 ± 1030, moderate = 1689 ± 2060, large = 2745 ± 3817). The usability of the STEPWISE app (System Usability Scale) was perceived as excellent (mean ± standard deviation: 86.6 ± 12.7). Our findings support the notion that a titrated increase in daily step count is feasible over 4 weeks. This motivates and supports further development of a smartphone application to increase physical activity in people with manifest PD. If effective, this behavioral intervention could provide an accessible option for people with PD worldwide.

AS-Ⅳ ameliorated motor deficits and the incidence of dystonia in animal models of PD. AS-Ⅳ administration inhibited CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and increased dopaminergic neurons burst firing. Imaging studies have demonstrated that AS-Ⅳ alters the brain tissue microstructure in the substantia nigra (SN). After administering AS-Ⅳ, bilateral SN fractional anisotropy (FA) values increased, whereas mean diffusivity (MD) values decreased in mice, according to the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis. In addition, AS-Ⅳ treatment significantly reduced the T<sub>2</sub> values of the T<sub>2</sub>-mapping. In summary, AS-Ⅳ improved motor impairments and efficiently performed neuroprotective functions in the ROT-induced mouse model."

    "title": "Electromyographic and kinematic characteristics of baseball players with yips exhibiting different types of dystonic movements: A two-case report.",
    "abstract": "The yips is a coordination impairment partly attributed to task-specific dystonia in athletes. While previous research focused on comparisons between control and yips groups, this study aimed to highlight interindividual differences in the yips symptoms of two baseball players with distinct dystonic movements through electromyographic and kinematic analysis. Twelve male college baseball players with two exhibiting throwing yips symptoms participated in this study. A three-dimensional motion capture system was used to analyze the kinematic features of throwing motion. Electromyographic data was recorded from the throwing upper limb. Case 1 showed markedly greater elbow flexion before ball release than the control baseball players, likely due to excessive and delayed muscle contraction of the biceps brachii. Case 2 showed intermittent activity of the middle deltoid muscle impacting shoulder abduction movement, resulting in action tremor of the upper limb. This study revealed two distinct types of dystonic movements in baseball players with throwing yips: excessive joint motion, which may be caused by impaired timing and amount of muscle activity, and action tremor, associated with intermittent muscle activity. These findings underscore the importance of individualized kinematic and electromyographic analysis to understand and treat yips symptoms."

We present a case of a young woman with 10 days of diplopia and unsteadiness in the context of dysthymia and significant weight loss over 2 months. Initial examination demonstrated mixed dysconjugate nystagmus and ataxic gait. Presumed diagnosis was Wernicke's encephalopathy and intravenous thiamine was given, resulting in partial improvement. Subsequent examination revealed hyperekplexia with ocular flutter, cervical dystonia and startle myoclonus. Cerebrospinal fluid indirect immunofluorescence on primate cerebellum revealed granular layer pattern of staining, prompting testing for anti-dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein antibodies, which returned strongly positive. Given the phenotypic overlap, it is important to consider this rare disorder in the differential diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy. In this case, the emergence of ocular flutter, startle myoclonus and the specific type of nystagmus made it clear there was an alternative diagnosis."

In this study, the authors report outcomes of patients with mixed or isolated spasticity treated with IVB administration. A retrospective analysis was performed of consecutive patients treated with IVB between 2019 and 2023. Demographics, baseline clinical variables, and complications data were collected. The primary outcome of the study was the change in spasticity and dystonia as measured by the modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale (BADS) scores, respectively. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed to compare the change in the pre- and postoperative scores. Fifteen patients were implanted with IVB pumps for spasticity related to CP between 2019 and 2023. The median change in the MAS score was 2 (interquartile range [IQR] = 1) and the median change in the BADS score was 1 (IQR = 2). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test revealed a statistically significant change in both scores following IVB pump placement (BADS z = 2.90, p = 0.003; MAS z = 3.2, p = 0.001). Three patients (20%) experienced minor perioperative complications, all of which were self-limiting and none required additional surgery. This study reported on 15 cases of mixed or isolated spasticity and showed a relative improvement in the MAS and BADS scores after IVB pump placement. These results provide evidence that IVB can be a safe and effective treatment for spasticity-related CP in addition to dystonia. IVB may be advantageous when an intraventricular route of baclofen administration is preferred."

To identify genomic alterations associated with dystonia in the Asian Indian population using next generation sequencing approaches. From September 2018 to December 2023, we enrolled 745 individuals including probands with dystonia and family members, in the Indian Movement Disorder Registry and Biobank. Clinical and demographic data were captured on a REDCap platform. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on DNA specimens obtained from 267 individuals with isolated, combined or complex dystonia. Variants were classified according to joint guidelines of American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association of Molecular Pathology (AMP). The mean age of the WES cohort was 33.8 ± 16.2 years, and mean age at onset (AAO) of dystonia was 25.6 ± 17.7 years. 62.2% had isolated dystonia, 7.9% combined and 29.2% had complex phenotypes. WES identified pathogenic/ likely pathogenic variants in 54 patients (20.2%) including 14 novel variants in known dystonia genes. Variants in THAP1 were most common followed by PANK2, GLB1, PLA2G6, TOR1A, ANO3, VPS16, SGCE, SPG7, FTL and other genes. Multifocal/generalized distribution of dystonia [OR: 4.1; 95% CI 1.4-12.2, P = 0.011] and family history [OR: 4.3; 95% CI 2.1-8.9, P < 0.001] were associated with positive yield on WES. THAP1 was the most frequent dystonia associated gene in this cohort. Singleton WES identifiedpotentially pathogenic variants in approximately one out of five patients tested, and contributed to management decisions in 4%."

RNU7-1 is one of the most recently discovered genes for AGS, and the clinical effects of JAK inhibition in these patients have not been reported. Here, we describe the diagnosis and treatment of a South African infant with RNU7-1-related AGS. The patient presented with developmental delay at age 5 months and was diagnosed with cerebral palsy due to a suspected congenital infection. By 18 months of age, he had a vasculitic rash, prominent generalized dystonia, persistent transaminitis, recurrent stomatitis, moderate-range global developmental delay, and difficulty sleeping. AGS was considered after finding neuroimaging features of the disease; the diagnosis was confirmed when genetic investigations revealed two likely pathogenic RNU7-1 compound heterozygous variants in the patient. Elevated interferon gene expression was noted in the patient and his mother who was a carrier of one RNU7-1 variant. Baricitinib treatment was started, leading to modest, transient improvements in some clinical manifestations and a reduction in interferon-stimulated gene expression. Liver function, dystonia, and neurological function did not improve even after increasing the baricitinib dose. Baricitinib was discontinued due to persistent and worsening adverse effects."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the real experiences of patients with Meige Syndrome, which is an idiopathic dystonia, during the perioperative period and to explore the practical application and effectiveness of Individual and Family Self-Management Theory (IFSMT) in improving patient experiences. A qualitative descriptive research methodology was employed to elucidate the intricate psychological and social experiences encountered by patients with Meige Syndrome throughout the perioperative phase. This study conduct face-to-face, one-on-one, semi-structured interviews with 16 Meige Syndrome patients to gain an in-depth understanding of the patients' true feelings and needs. Interview data were organized and analyzed using Colaizzi's method, and themes were refined in conjunction with IFSMT to reveal patients' self-management practices and influencing factors. Through in-depth analysis using Colaizzi's method and the application of IFSMT to the perioperative experiences of patients with Meige Syndrome, and reported according to COREQ standards, three core themes were identified: (1) Context Dimension (specific disease factors, physical and social environmental factors, personal and family factors), (2) Process Dimension (knowledge and beliefs, self-regulation and self-efficacy, social facilitation), and (3) Outcome Dimension (proximal and distal outcomes of self-management behaviors). This study demonstrates that IFSMT has significant application value in the perioperative experiences of patients with Meige Syndrome. Enhancing patients' knowledge, beliefs, self-regulation abilities, and social support can promote effective self-management behaviors, thereby improving their quality of life and health status. Additionally, the study reveals the complexity of self-management in perioperative patients, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and comprehensive interventions in enhancing patient experiences. Future research can further explore how to apply these theories in clinical practice to optimize perioperative management and rehabilitation processes for patients with Meige Syndrome."

    "abstract": "Acute dystonia is a neurological condition characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that can affect various parts of the body. It is commonly triggered by the use of antipsychotic medications, especially within the first few days after administration. Respiratory acute laryngeal dystonia, a particularly severe form of this condition and a very subtype of laryngeal dystonia, can lead to respiratory distress and airway obstruction if not promptly treated. This case report describes a 23-year-old male who developed acute laryngeal dystonia within 24 hours of receiving haloperidol for agitation. The patient presented with hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and progressive respiratory distress, eventually requiring emergent intubation due to airway compromise. This case underscores the need for healthcare providers to recognize and promptly manage rare but potentially life-threatening side effects of antipsychotic medications. Particular attention must be directed toward patients with risk factors for developing extrapyramidal reactions. Early intervention is crucial to prevent progression to airway obstruction and respiratory failure."

This review provides a detailed account of a 71-year-old man with previous diagnosis of lung cancer who presented with subacute onset behavioural changes, urinary retention, and FBDS. Investigation revealed hyponatremia, bilateral mesial temporal lobe high signal abnormality worse on the right on MRI and CSF positive anti-LGI1 antibodies (1:30). The patient was treated with immunosuppressive therapy with consequent symptom improvement. This case emphasizes the need to have a high index of suspicion for this disease entity in patients presenting with new onset behavioural changes and the importance of identifying the typical FBDS, as early initiation of treatment confers a positive outcome for diseased patients."

    "abstract": "DYT-THAP1 dystonia is a monogenetic form of dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by the involuntary co-contraction of agonistic and antagonistic muscles. The disease is caused by mutations in the THAP1 gene, although the precise mechanisms by which these mutations contribute to the pathophysiology of dystonia remain unclear. The incomplete penetrance of DYT-THAP1 dystonia, estimated at 40 to 60 %, suggests that an environmental trigger may be required for the manifestation of the disease in genetically predisposed individuals. To investigate the gene-environment interaction in the development of dystonic features, we performed a sciatic nerve crush injury in a genetically predisposed DYT-THAP1 heterozygous knockout mouse model (Thap1<sup>+/-</sup>). We employed a multi-omic assessment to study the pathophysiological pathways underlying the disease. Phenotypic analysis using an unbiased deep learning algorithm revealed that nerve-injured Thap1<sup>+/-</sup> mice exhibited significantly more dystonia like movements (DLM) over the course of the 12-week experiment compared to naive Thap1<sup>+/-</sup> mice. In contrast, nerve-injured wildtype (wt) mice only showed a significant increase in DLM compared to their naive counterpart during the first weeks after injury. Furthermore, at week 11 after nerve crush, nerve-injured Thap1<sup>+/-</sup> mice displayed significantly more DLM than nerve-injured wt counterparts. Multi-omic analysis of the cerebellum, striatum and cortex in nerve-injured Thap1<sup>+/-</sup> mice revealed differences that are indicative of an altered energy metabolism compared to naive Thap1<sup>+/-</sup> and nerve-injured wt animals. These findings suggest that aberrant energy metabolism in brain regions relevant to dystonia may underlie the dystonic phenotype observed in nerve injured Thap1<sup>+/-</sup> mice."

The identification of the most relevant sets of motor and psychiatric manifestations may help better understand the specific phenomenology of the condition and delineate blepharospasm subtypes more accurately. Patients with idiopathic blepharospasm were from the Dystonia Coalition project. Factor analysis of several motor and psychiatric scales was performed to identify the relevant determinants of blepharospasm severity. The selected items were then used in a data-driven cluster analysis to subtype blepharospasm individuals. Factor analysis reduced the many variables in the motor and psychiatric scales to 13 variables distributed in four factors. When the four sets were used as clustering variables, three blepharospasm clusters were identified: cluster 1 was characterized by low levels of motor and psychiatric factors; cluster 2 showed high levels of both motor and psychiatric factors; and cluster 3 showed high levels of psychiatric factors (similar to cluster 2) but low level of motor factors (similar to that of cluster 1). Factor analysis enabled the identification of key motor and psychiatric determinants of blepharospasm severity. The derived factor sets provide a streamlined tool for predicting and measuring these dimensions. This approach also facilitated more precise cluster analysis and improved recognition of clinical subtypes."

We characterized the phenotypic evolution of 14 individuals positive for ATP1A3 mutations (7 females, 7 males; mean examination age = 37 years, mean age of onset = 20 years). We focused on neurologic, cognitive, and neuropsychological data collected during in-person visits (mean interval between testing = 5½ years). Initially, all participants exhibited bulbar symptoms. Headaches were noted in 50 %, seizures in 31 %, and tremors in 36 %. At follow-up, 29 % of those initially without headaches developed them, 22 % without prior seizures experienced them, and 56 % previously without tremors developed them. No improvements were seen in those with headaches; however, seizures and tremors improved in 25 % and 80 % of cases, respectively. For Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale scores, improvement consisted of the reduction of the symptom. Cognitive functions improved from mildly impaired to low-average, and psychiatric evaluations indicated mild anxiety levels, slight increases in obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and decreased depression scores over time. This longitudinal analysis highlights the complex evolution of RDP, demonstrating significant variability in motor function and other symptoms such as headaches, seizures, and tremors."

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting globus pallidus internus (GPi) is a recognised therapy for drug-refractory dystonia. However, the mechanisms underlying this effect are not fully understood. This study explores how pallidal DBS alters spatiotemporal pattern formation of neuronal dynamics within the cerebellar cortex in a dystonic animal model, the dt<sup>sz</sup> hamster. We conducted in vitro analysis using a high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA) in the cerebellar cortex. For investigating the spatiotemporal pattern, mean firing rates (MFR), interspike intervals (ISI), spike amplitudes, and cerebellar connectivity among healthy control hamsters, dystonic dt<sup>sz</sup> hamsters, DBS- and sham-DBS-treated dt<sup>sz</sup> hamsters were analysed. A nonlinear data-driven method characterised the low-dimensional representation of the patterns in MEA data. Our HD-MEA recordings revealed reduced MFR and spike amplitudes in the dt<sup>sz</sup> hamsters compared to healthy controls. Pallidal DBS induced network-wide effects, normalising MFR, spike amplitudes, and connectivity measures in hamsters, thereby countervailing these electrophysiological abnormalities. Additionally, network analysis showed neural activity patterns organised into communities, with higher connectivity in both healthy and DBS groups compared to dt<sup>sz</sup>. These findings suggest that pallidal DBS exerts some of its therapeutic effects on dystonia by normalising neuronal activity within the cerebellar cortex. Our findings of reduced MFR and spike amplitudes in the dt<sup>sz</sup> hamsters could be a hint of a decrease in neuronal fibres and synaptic plasticity. Treatment with pallidal DBS led to cerebellar cortical activity similar to healthy controls, displaying the network-wide impact of local stimulation."

    "title": "Challenges in Describing Tremor and Dystonia.",
    "abstract": "Tremor is defined as an oscillatory and rhythmical movement. By contrast, dystonia is defined by sustained or intermittent abnormal postures, repetitive movements, or both. Tremor and dystonia often coexist in the same individual. Sometimes tremor and dystonia occur in the same body region, and sometimes they occur in separate body regions. In other cases, dystonic movements are rapid and repetitive, and they may mimic tremor. The varied clinical phenomenology of dystonia and tremor were recognized in the earliest descriptions of dystonia, and various terms have been used to describe the relationships between tremor and dystonia. The term <i>dystonic tremor</i> was first introduced to distinguish tremor-like movements in dystonia from more common tremors such as essential tremor. Subsequently, the same term was adopted to refer to any combination of dystonia and tremor in the same body region. Both applications of this term continue to be used in the modern literature. Other related terms have also been proposed such as <i>tremor associated with dystonia</i>, <i>tremulous dystonia</i>, <i>dystonia-tremor syndrome</i>, and <i>dystonia with tremor</i>. The proliferation of terms has become confusing, and expert opinion regarding application of these terms is divided, so a group of specialists was assembled to review the terminology and to develop recommendations for a more consistent approach. The group agreed that the term <i>tremor</i> should exclusively refer to rhythmic movements. The group also agreed that repetitive dystonic movements that are grossly arrhythmic should not be labeled with terms that imply they are a type of tremor. Moreover, when tremor and dystonia coexist, it may be clinically more useful to describe them separately, using descriptive terms rather than hybrid terms that imply suspected etiology. Easy-to-use clinical terms are essential, although bedside discrimination of movements may sometimes be challenging. In the future, motion analysis or physiologic measures may aid in the discrimination of movements that remain clinically uncertain."

There is evidence for triplex H-DNA's role in polycystic kidney disease (PKD), cancer, and numerous repeat expansion diseases (REDs). In PKD, an H-DNA forming repeat region within the <i>PKD1</i> gene stalls DNA replication and induces fragility. H-DNA-forming repeats in various genes have a role in cancer; the most well-studied examples involve H-DNA-mediated fragility causing translocations in multiple lymphomas. Lastly, H-DNA-forming repeats have been implicated in four REDs: Friedreich's ataxia, GAA-<i>FGF14</i>-related ataxia, X-linked Dystonia Parkinsonism, and cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome. In this review, we summarize H-DNA's discovery and characterization, evidence for its existence and function <i>in vivo</i>, and the field's current knowledge on its role in physiology and pathology."

    "abstract": "Variants in <i>NDUFAF6</i> have been reported to be associated with Leigh syndrome. However, further expansion of the <i>NDUFAF6</i>-phenotype and variants spectrum of <i>NDUFAF6</i>-related Leigh syndrome are still required. Two patients diagnosed with Leigh syndrome were recruited, and whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify the genetic variants responsible for the abnormal gait, dystonia, and bilateral basal ganglia lesions, followed by validation using Sanger sequencing. Detailed medical records of the patients were collected and reviewed. Patient-derived immortalized B lymphocytes were generalized for functional assays. The clinical manifestations of the patients in this study and previously reported studies are summarized. Two patients developed gait dystonia followed by rapid progression to generalized dystonia and psychomotor regression. Brain magnetic resonance images showed lesions in bilateral symmetric basal ganglia. We identified that patient 1 and patient 2 had two missense changes (NM_152416 c.371 T > C, c.923 T > C and c.371 T > C, c.920 A > T) in <i>NDUFAF6</i>, respectively. The deficiency of mature super complex of complex I was confirmed in patient-derived immortalized B lymphocytes. Meanwhile, cellular ATP production was decreased, and mitochondrial ROS was increased. A literature review of 18 patients carrying variants in <i>NDUFAF6</i> was conducted, focusing on neurological presentation. <i>NDUFAF6</i>-related Leigh syndrome is a relevant cause of initial symptoms with abnormal gait, dystonia, and bilateral basal ganglia lesions. Two novel genetic variants, c.923 T > C and c.920 A > T were reported, which expands <i>NDUFAF6</i>-related Leigh syndrome and is advantageous for genetic counseling."

    "title": "Bromocriptine Versus Levodopa and other treatments in Parkinson's Disease: an updated Meta-analysis Involving more than 4000 patients across 12 randomized clinical trials.",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this meta-analysis was to conduct a comparative study by systematically examining and analyzing trials that studied the impacts of levodopa and bromocriptine, either separately or together, in treating Parkinson's disease (PD). An extensive literature search was conducted across PubMed (Medline), Scopus, and Web of Science databases, using targeted keywords for studies published up to October 2024. The methodological quality of included RCTs was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool, and bias evaluation was performed using RevMan (version 5). Statistical analyses were conducted in STATA version 17, applying random-effects models. The overall quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. The thorough evaluation identified 12 randomized controlled trials with a total of 4,060 participants, 1,956 in the intervention group and 2,104 in the comparison group, all diagnosed with PD. A combined effect size of 0.18 (SMD: 0.18; 95% CI: -0.03, 0.39) was found through quantitative analysis of motor scales for the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). An effect size of 0.50 (OR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.80) was determined for dyskinesia. Dystonia occurrences showed a significant effect size of 0.44 (OR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.81; I2: 87.28%; P value: 0.0001). Hallucination and dizziness occurrences showed effect sizes of 0.91 (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.36, 2.30) and 1.36 (OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.91, 2.04) overall, respectively. Quality assessment revealed high-certainty evidence for dyskinesia and dystonia reduction with bromocriptine, while other outcomes showed low to very low certainty. Meta-regression analyses showed no significant correlation between population characteristics and outcomes. This thorough meta-analysis offers an understanding of how bromocriptine compares in effectiveness to levodopa and other treatments for managing PD."

    "abstract": "Botulinum toxin (BT) therapy is the therapy of choice for most forms of dystonia. We want to describe its costs, if all dystonia patients in Germany would have access to optimal BT therapy. For this, we combined the latest data on epidemiology of dystonia and dosing of BT therapy for dystonia. Missing data were generated for this study. Based on official German pharmacy sales prices, optimal treatment for all dystonia patients in Germany with a population of 84.1 million would generate annual drug costs of €155.5 million (cervical dystonia 89.3, tardive dystonia 22.1, generalised dystonia 17.9, blepharospasm 9.3, segmental dystonia 5.9, writer's cramp 5.3, arm dystonia 3.2, oromandibular dystonia 2.3, musician's dystonia 0.3, spasmodic dysphonia 0.1) This is €1.85 annually per capita or 0.3% of the total 2021 drug budget and 42% of the 2021 Parkinson drug budget of German public insurance companies. Actual costs for the health care system are considerably lower, as there are various discounts to consider. Further reductions would be possible. BT therapy's individual costs are high. Its costs for the health care system, however, are marginal. Comparing projected and actual costs, would allow estimating availability and quality of BT therapy of dystonia in Germany."

For the first time, we wanted to explore the relationship between SD and dystonia from a combined neurological and phoniatric perspective. For this, we studied 115 patients with non-psychogenic SD by a combined neurological and phoniatric evaluation. Onset of SD was 49.7 ± 19.0 (6-68) years. The female/male ratio was 2. 63% had additional dystonia manifestations (cervical dystonia 35%, arm dystonia 15%, blepharospasm 11%, oromandibular dystonia 11%, writer's cramp 11%, pharyngeal dystonia 10%, generalised dystonia 4%, axial dystonia 2%, spasmodic dyspnoea 2% and segmental dystonia 1%). 71% occurred before, 25% after and 4% together with SD. 17% had a family history of dystonia and 6% a history of exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents. 41% had mixed SD (SD-M), 31% abductor SD (SD-AB) and 28% adductor SD (SD-AD). SD-M was significantly correlated with additional dystonia manifestations and tremulous SD. No patient showed essential tremor or Parkinsonian syndromes. Two third of SD patients have additional dystonia manifestations and one fifth have a family history of dystonia, considerably more than previously described. In half of all patients, SD starts with non-SD dystonia. Our combined approach revealed a high prevalence of SD-M associated with frequent additional dystonia manifestations including dystonic tremor and a family history of dystonia. Patients presenting with SD should be evaluated for additional dystonia manifestations and dystonia patients should be evaluated for SD. Relevant coexistence of essential tremor and Parkinsonian syndromes cannot be confirmed."

    "abstract": "Dopamine receptor antagonists like metoclopramide are frequently used in a variety of clinical contexts to treat gastrointestinal disorders and control nausea and vomiting. However, it is associated with a high incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) in children, including dystonic movements and torticollis. This is the instance of a 9-year-old girl who developed abnormal movements of the neck and tongue, along with torticollis, within 48 hours of receiving intravenous metoclopramide for gastroenteritis. The metoclopramide therapy was discontinued, and supportive measures, including diphenhydramine, were initiated, resulting in the resolution of symptoms. This case highlights the importance of recognizing and managing metoclopramide-induced EPS in pediatric patients."

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative brain disease characterised by motor and non-motor symptoms. Motor disabilities, including dystonia and dyskinesia, cause speech and movement difficulties and limit many aspects of life. Factors affecting PD refer to the various internal and external conditions that contribute to the onset, severity and progression of the disease. These factors can be broadly categorised into genetic, environmental and lifestyle-related factors. The primary objective of this prospective cohort study is to investigate the association between environmental exposures and genetic predisposition and the risk of developing PD. Secondary objectives include examining the relationships between these factors and clinical outcomes in PD, such as disease severity and progression. We have utilised the data from other research studies, which primarily involve recruiting a cohort of individuals at high risk for PD based on their family history and/or environmental exposure history. These research studies also include participants who will undergo clinical evaluations, including neurological examinations and cognitive assessments, and provide biospecimens for genetic analysis. Environmental exposure histories will be obtained through questionnaires and medical records fetched by the authors of these research studies. In all these studies, participants were followed up regularly over several years to monitor the development of PD and to assess disease progression. This study provided valuable insights into the role of environmental exposures and genetic predisposition in the development and progression of PD. The results of this study may inform strategies for preventing or delaying the onset of PD in high-risk individuals, as well as guide the development of targeted interventions for those already diagnosed with the disease."

This highly deleterious variant (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion [CADD] score-28.8, Rare Exome Variant Ensemble Learner [REVEL] score -0.992) is not present in gnomAD v.4.1.0. Clinical manifestations include recurrent stereotypical episodes of paroxysmal dyskinesias that include jaw-opening dystonia superimposed on a baseline of developmental delay with static cognitive impairment, mild ataxia, and hypotonia. Paroxysmal episodes are triggered by emotional excitement, heat, cold, exercise, chocolate, and menses. The paroxysmal events typically last 5 min. Oxcarbazepine and clonazepam have reduced the frequency of paroxysmal episodes. <i>ATP1A3</i> mutations are associated with protean manifestations that may include paroxysmal non-epileptic events such as ataxia, dystonia, and paresis. Accordingly, <i>ATP1A3</i> mutation screening, most commonly as a multi-gene panel, and assessment of variant deleteriousness and population frequency should be completed in individuals with non-classical phenotypes. Benzodiazepines and drugs that target voltage gaited sodium channels (e.g., oxcarbazepine) may be effective therapeutic options. <i>ATP1A3</i> mutations should be considered in patients with paroxysmal non-epileptic neurological events which may show clinical overlap with paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesias."

    "abstract": "Tremor is one of the most frequent movement disorders encountered in clinical practice with heterogeneous phenomenology and etiology. Surface electromyography (SEMG) is a noninvasive and reproducible test that can diagnose tremor syndromes. In this retrospective study, the clinical and electrophysiologic records of 97 consecutive patients with tremor syndromes who visited our movement disorder clinic between January 2023 and March 2024 were examined. In our study, 28.8% (n = 28) of patients were of essential tremor (ET) syndrome. SEMG of ET syndrome patients showed synchronous bursts in 71.4% (n = 20), alternating bursts in 10.7% (n = 3), synchronous bursts with co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles in 10.7% (n = 3), and both synchronous and alternating bursts in 3.6% (n = 1) of patients. Tremor-ataxia syndrome formed 21.6% (n = 21) of our study population, with 71.4% (n = 15) of patients showing synchronous bursts and co-contraction and 28.6% (n = 6) patients having alternating bursts. Moreover, 12.3% (n = 12) patients were of parkinsonian tremor, of whom alternating bursts were present in 75% (n = 9) and synchronous bursts with co-contraction were present in 25% (n = 3) of patients. In addition, 11.3% (n = 11) of patients had dystonic tremor (DT), of whom 81.8% (n = 9) had synchronous bursts and co-contraction and 18.2% (n = 2) had alternating bursts. Synchronous bursts with co-contraction suggestive of DT were observed in most patients with tremor-ataxia syndrome and a small number of patients with ET syndrome. Our data suggests that SEMG helps differentiate these two clinical syndromes, which is difficult in a clinical setting."

Patients with MDS have a normal life expectancy with markedly reduced quality of life. Here, we report four family members diagnosed with MDS of variable severity due to a novel heterozygous splicing variant in SGCE (c.341-2A>G), including a 13-year-old female who presented with disabling dystonic spasms, myoclonic jerks, and psychiatric symptoms. She had shown little or no response to several conventional MDS treatments. However, disabling axial dystonia was significantly improved by sodium oxybate (1 g, twice daily). Although there was less effect on myoclonus, sodium oxybate treatment significantly improved the overall quality of life at the 3-years follow-up. Clinical trials are warranted to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of sodium oxybate for MDS-associated dystonia."

    "abstract": "Clinical rating scales often fail to capture the full spectrum of dystonic symptoms. Deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus interna (GPi-DBS) effectively treats dystonia, but response variability necessitates a reliable biomarker. Intermuscular coherence (4-12 Hz) has been linked to abnormal activity in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical (CBGTC) loop and may serve as an objective measure of dystonia and GPi-DBS effectiveness. A retrospective cohort study included 12 dystonia patients undergoing GPi-DBS implantation. Clinical rating scales and a neurophysiological assessment were performed before and one year post-DBS. Coherence in the 4-12 Hz range was analyzed from electromyography (EMG) of antagonistic arm muscles. Comparisons were made between patients with and without arm dystonia, t-tests evaluated the differences between pre- and post-DBS, and correlations between coherence and clinical scales were performed. Seven patients with arm dystonia appeared to have higher pre-operative intermuscular coherence compared to those without. Coherence was significantly decreased after GPi-DBS in the arm dystonia group. No strong correlations were found between coherence and clinical rating scales. Intermuscular coherence is present in dystonic muscles and decreases following GPi-DBS. Correlations with motor scores were inconclusive due to patient heterogeneity and ill-fitting clinical scales. Intermuscular coherence has potential to aid GPi-DBS patient selection and optimization but larger studies are needed to validate its use."

However, neurological adverse events have been reported in post-marketing surveillance studies and there are limited literatures comparing the neurological disorders associated with newer-generation H1-antihistamines from real-world datasets. We performed a comparative analysis of nervous system disorders and several newer-generation H1-antihistamines including: cetirizine, loratadine, levocetirizine, desloratadine and fexofenadine. Disproportionality analysis was used to identify the suspected drug neurological adverse events associated with H1-antihistamines of interest via the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System. The proportional reporting ratio (PRR), χ<sup>2</sup> (chi-square) and the reporting odds ratio (ROR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to estimate the association. AE reports of 43,815 cases from 2017 to 2021 were extracted from FAERS. The H1-antihistamines included in our study were associated with various neurological adverse events that could be classified into 12 aspects, containing 42 preferred terms. The majority of adverse event reports were concentrated at somnolence: cetirizine [N = 1342, ROR (95%CI) = 11.8 (11.2-12.5), PRR = 10.8, χ<sup>2</sup> = 11755.4], levocetirizine [N = 1276, ROR(95%CI) = 28.5 (26.7-30.3), PRR = 22.7, χ<sup>2</sup> = 26218.4], loratadine[N = 516, ROR(95%CI) = 4.6 (4.2-5.0), PRR = 4.4, χ<sup>2</sup> = 1378.1], desloratadine [N = 33, ROR(95%CI) = 6.1 (4.3-8.6), PRR = 5.8, χ<sup>2</sup> = 131.9], fexofenadine [N = 498, ROR(95%CI) = 5.0 (4.6-5.5), PRR = 4.8, χ<sup>2</sup> = 1519.0]. Neurological AEs associated with individual newer generation H1-antihistamines of interest varies a lot, whereas somnolence was the most common AE reports. Fexofenadine was highly associated with headaches. Sedative effects associated with levocetirizine and cetirizine should arouse more concern. Seizures significantly associated with levocetirizine and desloratadine were infrequently reported, further research is needed to avoid possible serious outcomes. Patients taking cetirizine probably have higher risk of dystonia and anticholinergic syndrome."

The lack of reliable safety data often leads to either under- or over-dose of medications during clinical management which make them either not responding well to treatment or susceptible to adverse drug reactions (ADRs). This study investigated ADR signalling techniques to detect serious ADRs in Malaysian children aged from birth to 12 years old using an electronic ADRs' database. Four techniques (Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS)) were tested on ADR reports submitted to the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency between 2016 and 2020. Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the techniques were compared. A total of 31 medicine-Important Medical Event pairs were found and examined among the 3152 paediatric ADR reports. Three techniques (PRR, ROR, MGPS) signalled oculogyric crisis and dystonia for metoclopramide. BCPNN and MGPS signalled angioedema for paracetamol, amoxicillin and ibuprofen. Similar performances were found for PRR, ROR and BCPNN (sensitivity of 12%, specificity of 100%, PPV of 100% and NPV of 21%). MGPS revealed the highest sensitivity (20%) and NPV (23%), as well as similar specificity and PPV (100%). This study suggests that medication safety signalling techniques could be applied on electronic health records to monitor medication safety issues in children. Clinicians and medication safety specialist could prioritise the signals for further clinical consideration and prompt response."

A prospective, single-centre study was conducted at a UK supra-regional centre from May 2013 to September 2022. All children with spasticity, dystonia and/or dystonic posture undergoing SDR were included. The primary outcome measure was pre- and postoperative assessment of dystonic posture. Dystonia severity was measured using the Barry-Albright dystonia (BAD) scale. Two hundred and fifty-seven patients (aged 3-18 years) underwent SDR. Forty-three patients had dystonia and 52 exhibited dystonic posture without dystonia. At 3-month follow-up (n = 29), GMFCS levels tended to decrease, returning to baseline at 6 months (n = 25). Two patients required medication adjustments post-surgery. Dystonia levels remained unchanged in the dystonia group. In the dystonic posture group, 33 patients showed no change, while 21 improved. SDR may be beneficial for carefully selected patients with dystonia or dystonic posture, without worsening these conditions. Optimal patient selection, clear communication of surgical goals and multidisciplinary involvement are crucial."

    "abstract": "Myoclonus and other jerky movement disorders are hyperkinetic disorders, the diagnosis of which heavily relies on clinical neurophysiological testing. However, formal diagnostic criteria are lacking, and recently the utility and reliability of these tests have been questioned. The aim of this review was to assess the utilization of clinical neurophysiology testing to identify possible gaps and boundaries that might guide the development of new methods for a more precise diagnosis and in-depth understanding of myoclonus. We reviewed electrophysiological features of cortical myoclonus, subcortical myoclonus (ie, myoclonus associated with dystonia, brainstem myoclonus), excessive startle reflex, spinal myoclonus (ie, spinal segmental and propriospinal myoclonus), peripheral myoclonus and mimics of myoclonus of peripheral origin (hemifacial spasm, minipolymyoclonus, myokymia), functional jerky movements, chorea, and tics. Electrophysiological features that support the recognition of myoclonus subtypes, such as muscle burst duration, muscle pattern of activation, measures of cortical excitability, or movement-related cortical potentials, have been identified. These significantly contribute to the diagnosis of jerky movement disorders, but their reliability is uncertain. Despite the significant advancements, several unresolved questions persist. Factors contributing to this include the absence of systematic neurophysiological assessment and standardized methods, alongside the limited number of patients investigated using these techniques. Although clinical neurophysiology remains the \"gold standard\" for defining and diagnosing myoclonus, our review highlighted the need to enhance the quality and reliability of neurophysiological testing in jerky movement disorders. Further studies including larger cohorts of patients recruited from different centers, employing standardized and optimized electrophysiological techniques, are warranted."

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) allow investigators to integrate multimodal instrumented movement measurements and imaging techniques and to analyze these data together at scale. In this systematic review, we aim to characterize AI's performance in diagnosing and quantitatively phenotyping these disorders. <b>Methods</b>: We searched PubMed and Embase using a semi-automated article-screening pipeline. <b>Results</b>: Fifty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 11,946 subjects). Thirty-five studies used machine learning, sixteen used deep learning, and four used both. Thirty-eight studies reported disease diagnosis, twenty-three reported quantitative phenotyping, and six reported both. Diagnostic accuracy was reported in 36 of 38 and correlation coefficients in 10 of 23 studies. Kinematics (e.g., accelerometers and inertial measurement units) were the most used dataset. Diagnostic accuracy was reported in 36 studies and ranged from 56 to 100% compared to clinical diagnoses to differentiate them from healthy controls. The correlation coefficient was reported in 10 studies and ranged from 0.54 to 0.99 compared to clinical ratings for quantitative phenotyping.

Myoclonus and dystonia were monitored using rating scales in two cohorts of participants from Spain and the Netherlands. Individual annualized rates of change were calculated and longitudinal trends were assessed using Bayesian mixed models. Psychiatric features were evaluated cross-sectionally in the Spanish cohort. Thirty-eight patients (21 males, 17 females) were evaluated at a mean age (SD) of 10 years (4 years 7 months; range 2-21 years) and 14 years 2 months (4 years 8 months; range 4-25 years). We observed a significant worsening of action myoclonus, global dystonia, and dystonia during writing (mean annual increases of 1.356, 0.226, and 0.518 in the Unified Myoclonus, Burke-Fahn-Marsden, and Writer's Cramp Rating Scales respectively). Accordingly, participants perceived a significant worsening in their speech, writing, and walking abilities. Twenty-six of 32 participants suffered from anxiety (n = 13), obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 9), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (n = 8). This study demonstrates that, unlike in the adult population, myoclonus dystonia syndrome in childhood and adolescence follows a progressive course that can be debilitating in the early stages of life. These findings, along with a high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms, highlight the need for early therapeutic interventions to prevent long-term motor and psychological sequelae."

    "title": "Genetic Diversity and Expanded Phenotypes in Dystonia: Insights from Large-Scale Exome Sequencing.",
    "abstract": "Dystonia is one of the most prevalent movement disorders, characterized by significant clinical and etiological heterogeneity. Despite considerable heritability (~25%) and the identification of several disease-linked genes, the etiology in most patients remains elusive. Moreover, understanding the correlations between clinical manifestation and genetic variants has become increasingly complex. To comprehensively unravel dystonia's genetic spectrum, we performed exome sequencing on 1,924 dystonia patients [40.3% male, 92.9% White, 93.2% isolated dystonia, median age at onset (AAO) 33 years], including 1,895 index patients, who were previously genetically unsolved. The sample was mainly based on two dystonia registries (DysTract and the Dystonia Coalition). Further, 72 additional patients of Asian ethnicity, mainly from Malaysia, were also included. We prioritized patients with negative genetic prescreening, early AAO, positive family history, and multisite involvement of dystonia. Rare variants in genes previously linked to dystonia (<i>n</i>=405) were examined. Variants were confirmed via Sanger sequencing, and segregation analysis was performed when possible. We identified 137 distinct likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants (according to ACMG criteria) across 51 genes in 163/1,924 patients [42.9% male, 85.9% White, 68.7% isolated dystonia, median AAO 19 years]. This included 153/1,895 index patients, resulting in a diagnostic yield of 8.1%. Notably, 77/137 (56.2%) of these variants were novel, with recurrent variants in <i>EIF2AK2</i>, <i>VPS16</i>, <i>KCNMA1</i>, and <i>SLC2A1</i>, and novel variant types such as two splice site variants in <i>KMT2B</i>, supported by functional evidence. Additionally, 321 index patients (16.9%) harbored variants of uncertain significance in 102 genes. The most frequently implicated genes included <i>VPS16</i>, <i>THAP1</i>, <i>GCH1</i>, <i>SGCE</i>, <i>GNAL</i>, and <i>KMT2B.</i> Presumably pathogenic variants in less well-established dystonia genes were also found, including <i>KCNMA1</i>, <i>KIF1A</i>, and <i>ZMYND11.</i> At least six variants (in <i>ADCY5</i>, <i>GNB1</i>, <i>IR2BPL, KCNN2</i>, <i>KMT2B</i>, and <i>VPS16</i>) occurred <i>de novo,</i> supporting pathogenicity. ROC curve analysis indicated that AAO and the presence of generalized dystonia were the strongest predictors of a genetic diagnosis, with diagnostic yields of 28.6% in patients with generalized dystonia and 20.4% in those with AAO < 30 years. This study provides a comprehensive examination of the genetic landscape of dystonia, revealing valuable insights into the frequency of dystonia-linked genes and their associated phenotypes. It underscores the utility of exome sequencing in establishing diagnoses within this heterogeneous condition. Despite prescreening, presumably pathogenic variants were identified in almost 10% of patients. Our findings reaffirm several dystonia candidate genes and expand the phenotypic spectrum of some of these genes to include prominent, sometimes isolated dystonia."

    "title": "Ultrasonography for Assessment and Intervention With Botulinum Toxin Injection for Tremors.",
    "abstract": "Tremors are caused by contractions of reciprocally innervated muscles. The role of ultrasound in diagnosing tremors has not yet been investigated, although it appears to be promising because it can visualize muscle movements. In the present study, we report four cases of tremor (Holmes' tremor, extremity tremor associated with palatal myoclonus, dystonic tremor, and tremor associated with dystonia), which were evaluated using ultrasound and treated with botulinum toxin injections. The muscles of patients with tremors were examined using B- or M-mode ultrasound while they were in the supine position. Tremor was determined by involuntary muscular contraction (B-mode) or fasciculation (M-mode) from recorded sonography clips. Thereafter, tremors were measured as frequency and amplitude of specific muscles. Ultrasound-guided botulinum toxin type A injection was administered, and follow-up ultrasonography was used to assess tremors. Tremors, which manifest as a specific set of muscle contractions, were measured using ultrasonography and treated with botulinum toxin injection. Follow-up ultrasonography revealed improved tremors as seen with decreased frequency and amplitude of specific muscle after the intervention, which included medication and botulinum toxin injections. Ultrasonography is an effective assessment tool for tremors, allowing further information regarding tremor characteristics with high sensitivity, playing a role in detecting specific muscles that are affected by tremors, and guiding an exact intervention with botulinum toxin."

    "title": "Harnessing machine learning in diagnosing complex hoarseness cases.",
    "abstract": "Traditional vocal fold pathology recognition typically requires expertise of laryngologists and advanced instruments, primarily through direct visualization. This study aims to augment this conventional paradigm by introducing a parallel diagnostic procedure. Our objective is to harness a machine-learning algorithm designed to discern intricate patterns within patients' voice recordings to distinguish not only between healthy and hoarse voices but also among various specific disorders. We employed a machine-learning algorithm, utilizing transfer learning on the HuBERT model with Saarbruecken Voice Database samples. The study was conducted in two stages: a binary classifier distinguishes healthy and hoarse voices, while a subsequent multi-class classifier identifies specific voice disorders. Data from 2103 sessions, including over 25,000 components, representing diverse pathologies and healthy individuals, was analyzed. The models were trained, validated, and tested with a focus on robustness and accuracy in diagnosis. The binary classifier achieved 82 % accuracy in distinguishing healthy from pathological voices. The multi-class algorithm which aims to identify specific laryngeal disorders obtained the highest accuracy (>93 %) for Laryngeal Dystonia. Noteworthy is the persistent challenge posed by Laryngeal Dystonia, a condition lacking a definitive diagnostic modality. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing machine-learning algorithms to process voice samples, categorizing them into distinct pathologies. This approach holds potential for enhance patient triage, streamline diagnostics, and elevate overall patient care. Particularly valuable for challenging diagnoses, such as Laryngeal Dystonia, this method underscores the transformative role of machine learning in optimizing healthcare practices."

    "abstract": "Identify consensus and variability in deep brain stimulation (DBS) programming practices for Parkinson's disease. DBS programming relies on the personal experience and skills of programmers. Despite consensus statements, there aren't official guidelines for DBS programming, making it likely for protocols to vary among providers. We administered an online survey to the Functional Neurosurgery Working Group of the Parkinson's Study Group to capture those actively programming DBS patients. We performed descriptive statistics and comparisons of responses based on career stage: early (0-10 years) versus later (>10 years). Boston Scientific (n = 15/31, 48%) and Medtronic (n = 14/35, 40%) are the two DBS systems ranked as most used, with less reported frequency of Abbott devices (n = 4/32, 12.5). Traditional monopolar review ranked as the most common initial programming strategy by 23/29 (79%) respondents, regardless of the device type implanted. Monopolar omnidirectional testing was the most often used approach for contact configuration at initial programming (24/33, 73%).For treating dyskinesia, tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, speech-related side effects, non-motor adverse effects, or swallowing-related side effects, the most likely optimization strategy selected was to modify amplitude of the active contact. When treating freezing of gait, there was a divergence between first modifying amplitude (n = 11/29, 38%) or frequency (n = 12/33, 36%). Initial programming practices generally align with published recommendations, which can reassure less experienced clinicians in practices with near consensus and allow them to devote more time to areas with wider variety of practice. Our data also highlights aspects of DBS programming with less consensus, demonstrating the need for future evidence."

    "abstract": "Recent new advances in myoclonus characterization and etiology justify an update of the 40-year-old respected classification of myoclonus proposed by Marsden, Hallett, and Fahn. New advances include genetic studies and clinical neurophysiology characterization. The IAPRD appointed an expert panel to develop a new myoclonus classification. The Delphi Method of consensus determination was employed using a panel of fifteen international experts in myoclonus. In an in-person meeting, an Axis approach, previously used for dystonia and tremor was ratified by the panel: Axis I included clinical and neurophysiology features, Axis II included etiology categories. As a unique part of our Axis approach, Clinical Neurophysiology was included as Axis Ib. The first Delphi survey round queried agreement on major headings in Axes Ia and Ib, myoclonus clinical syndromes, and Axis II. In the second round, the full expert panel was surveyed on constituents and specific characteristics of each feature that had consensus in the first round. In the first round, the percentage of agreement for the fifty-three out of the 56 items was greater than 60.0 %, indicating strong consensus among expert panel members. In the second round, for Axis Ia, Axis Ib, and Axis II, strong agreement was also achieved. For both rounds, Physiological Myoclonus had the lowest agreement. Comments from the whole panel were incorporated into the consensus results. This Myoclonus Classification, which reached consensus using the Delphi Method, will facilitate a collaborative effort among myoclonus investigators to find better diagnostics and treatment for myoclonus patients."

    "abstract": "Benign essential blepharospasm is a focal dystonia characterized by involuntary contractions of the orbicularis oculi. Botulinum toxin type A injections are often first-line treatment, but patients may experience refractory symptoms or decreased response over time. DaxibotulinumtoxinA, a novel botulinum toxin type A product, has shown promise in cervical dystonia and facial rhytids but has not been previously reported for benign essential blepharospasm treatment. This case highlights a 57-year-old male with severe, poorly controlled benign essential blepharospasm despite high-dose injections of onabotulinumtoxinA and incobotulinumtoxinA. He subsequently received 100 units of daxibotulinumtoxinA in the same periorbital injection pattern with subjective faster onset, extended duration of effect, and improved symptom management compared to previous treatments. Notably, the patient experienced 50% to 75% efficacy retention at 3 months postinjection, significantly better than his response to other botulinum toxin type A products. This case suggests that daxibotulinumtoxinA may be an effective treatment for benign essential blepharospasm including patients experiencing poor symptom control with other botulinum toxin type A products."

    "abstract": "This study explored whether the type of torticollis, amount of tummy time or container time, participant age at examination, and Alberta Infant Motor Scales score influence the length of physical therapy care for infants with torticollis. Data for 149 participants were extracted from medical records for infants with torticollis who received care between November 2018 and November 2021. Statistically significant correlations were found between length of care (LOC) and torticollis type, age at examination, active range of motion rotation deficit, and passive range of motion rotation deficit. A multiple regression model predicted LOC from age at examination in days, as well as passive and active rotation deficits. Higher passive and active rotation deficits lead to longer LOC. However, longer lengths of care were associated with younger ages at examination, different from earlier studies."

    "abstract": "Dystonia is a common hyperkinetic movement disorder observed in various genetic, infective, drug-induced, and autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune disorders can present with isolated or combined acute or subacute dystonia. The pattern and approach to dystonia in autoimmune disorders are poorly described and have never been established in a structured manner. This scoping review aims to summarize all available clinical literature and formulate a pattern and approach to dystonia in different autoimmune disorders. We included one hundred and three articles in this scoping review. Most articles identified were case reports or case series. In this review, we analysed data from 103 articles and summarized the epidemiological, clinical, and diagnostic features of dystonia associated with different autoimmune diseases. We highlight that dystonia can be isolated or combined in various autoimmune conditions and is responsive to immunotherapy. We point out the patterns of dystonia and associated neurological features and investigations that can suggest the underlying autoimmune nature, which can guide the most appropriate treatment. The clinical pattern of dystonia can be a unique feature in many autoimmune disorders. In isolated subacute dystonia, the presence of autoantibodies could have a temporal association, or this is just an epiphenomenon to be evaluated in further research. Many autoimmune disorders can present with isolated or combined dystonia.Subacute onset focal or segmental dystonia (craniocervical dystonia or limb dystonia) or hemidystonia could be secondary to an autoimmune condition and warrants investigations.They have a relapsing or progressive course.They usually have a good response to early immunotherapy.Symptomatic treatment, including botulinum toxin, can be useful in focal dystonia."

Our study aimed to examine the clinical factors determining spreading patterns in all adult-onset dystonia types. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients with a diagnosis of isolated dystonia followed longitudinally at our center. We included patients reporting symptom onset after 18 years. We then compared the clinical factors between groups with and without spreading. Among 434 patients (396 focal, 29 segmental, and nine generalized onset dystonia. mean follow-up of 8.6 ± 7.8 years), 48 (11.1%) experienced spread of dystonia, with 37 progressing from focal to segmental, two from focal to generalized, two from segmental to generalized, and seven from focal to segmental to generalized dystonia. Blepharospasm was the most common focal dystonia noted to spread, followed by oromandibular dystonia, cervical dystonia, laryngeal dystonia, and upper extremity dystonia, in decreasing order. A spreading pattern was observed in approximately one in 10 dystonia patients, and the spreading was more frequent in the segmental dystonia group. While there was no difference between the spreading groups regarding sensory tricks, tremor, and gender, family history was more common in the non-spreading group (p = 0.023). Older age at onset was independently associated with increased odds of spreading (hazards ratio: 1.054, p < 0.001, B = 0.053). Although risk factors for spread are variable, the underlying mechanisms are not fully known. Genetic factors may be possibly related to the spread, and future studies are needed on this subject."

    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting subthalamic nucleus (STN) versus the globus pallidus internus (GPI) in the treatment of dystonia. A comprehensive search strategy was implemented up to July 2024, across five databases, identifying studies relevant to STN-DBS and GPI-DBS in dystonia. Eligibility criteria included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing the two interventions. Two independent reviewers conducted the screening and data extraction. The risk of bias was assessed using RoB-2 for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. Statistical analysis involved meta-analysis using Review Manager, with heterogeneity assessed by I<sup>2</sup> and Chi-square tests. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Five studies, involving 154 patients, were included. No significant difference was found between STN-DBS and GPI-DBS in Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale motor and disability (BFMDRS-M and BFMDRS-D) scores at 1 months, 6 and 12 months. STN-DBS showed significant improvement in mental health (SMD = 0.43, 95 % CI: [0.05, 0.8], P = 0.03). STN-DBS also showed significant improvement in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) (SMD = -2.7, 95 % CI: [-5.38, -0.02], P = 0.05). No significant difference was found in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores. Both STN-DBS and GPI-DBS can improve motor symptoms in dystonia, with STN-DBS potentially resulting in more superior mental health benefits. Future research should address long-term outcomes, and regional effectiveness, and include diverse populations to enhance generalizability."

Compared to a traditional open-loop system, a closed-loop system allows for a higher degree of accuracy with minimal human intervention. Novel methods of closed loop 'adaptive' deep brain stimulation DBS (aDBS) are being developed. This review focuses on the current state of aDBS for various neuropsychiatric conditions: common movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, dystonia, essential tremor, and Tourette syndrome, as well as psychiatric disorders of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Finally, the future directions of closed-loop neuromodulation treatments are also discussed. Recently, aDBS has been shown to offer benefits compared to open-loop DBS. Understanding the biomarkers of pathological states across various disorders is, however, crucial to implementation of aDBS, and improved sensing-capable hardware and advances in machine learning are poised to allow its effective implementation."

Retrospective study including every patient with LD or VT injected with botulinum toxin guided by electromyography, from January 1, 2010, to September 30, 2022, at a tertiary hospital centre. Improvement was assessed with the VHI-10, grade of dysphonia in a visual analogue scale (VAS; 0-10), GRBAS(I) scale (0-3) and maximum phonation time (MPT). A total of 77 patients were included, 44 patients with LD and 33 with VT. There were no differences between groups on pre-treatment VHI-10, grade of dysphonia in the VAS, MPT and G, R, B, A and I at diagnosis (p > 0.05). S was significantly higher in patients with LD (p < 0.001). After the first injection, both groups showed an increase in the grade of dysphonia on the VAS and a decrease in VHI-10, G, S and I (p < 0.05), with a higher variation in the VAS and S parameters in the LD group compared to VT (p < 0.05). In the 54 patients that performed two or more injections, G, S and I had a higher decrease in patients with LD when compared to patients with VT (p < 0.05). BTX injection was successful in improving the VHI-10, grade of dysphonia on the VAS and G, S and I in the GRBAS-I scale for both DT and VT. LD seems to have a better response to BTX in comparison to VT."

    "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between patient-perceived vocal effort (VE) using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VE-VAS) and the OMNI Vocal Effort Scale (OMNI-VES) when measures were obtained after a vocal activity. A second purpose was to evaluate how VE related to other voice assessment measures. Fifty-three speakers with adductor laryngeal dystonia (ADLD) provided speech recordings. Directly after this vocal activity, speakers rated VE using the VE-VAS and the OMNI-VES. Speakers provided ratings of their own voice quality severity using a 100-mm VAS (ADLD-OS) and completed the Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQOL) scale. Ten experienced speech-language pathologists rated a subset of available speech samples (n = 39) for overall voice severity using a 100-mm VAS (SLP-OS). There was a strong, significant correlation (r = 0.78, P < 0.001) between the VE-VAS and the OMNI-VES. Both VE measures were strongly and significantly correlated with speakers' ratings of their voice: VE-VAS vs ADLD-OS, r = 0.75, P < 0.001; OMNI-VES vs ADLD-OS, r = 0.85, P < 0.001. In contrast, mostly weak correlations were found between perceived VE and V-RQOL total and physical domains, respectively (VE-VAS vs V-RQOL: r = -0.21 to -0.19, P > 0.05; OMNI-VES vs V-RQOL: r = -0.37 to -0.44, P < 0.01). Finally, VE measures were moderately and significantly related to SLPs' auditory-perceptual measures of voice severity: VE-VAS vs SLP-OS, r = 0.50, P < 0.001; OMNI-VES vs SLP-OS, r = 0.57, P < 0.001. ADLD speakers' perceptions of VE are strongly related when measures are obtained directly after a vocal activity, regardless of the VE scale. VE is strongly related to speaker-rated voice quality severity, but weakly related to V-RQOL. Measures of VE obtained directly after a vocal activity are moderately related to clinicians' perceptions of overall voice quality severity."

    "title": "Characterization of upper esophageal sphincter pressures relative to vocal acoustics.",
    "abstract": "Strength of vocal fold adduction has been hypothesized to be a critical factor influencing vocal acoustics but has been difficult to measure directly during phonation. Recent work has suggested that upper esophageal sphincter (UES) pressure, which can be easily assessed, increases with stronger vocal fold adduction, raising the possibility that UES pressure might indirectly reflect vocal fold adduction strength. However, concurrent UES pressure and vocal acoustics have not previously been examined across different vocal tasks. Doing so may offer insights into the potential use of UES pressure for relative quantification of the strength of vocal fold adduction and how this might contribute to vocal acoustics across different vocal tasks. We assessed UES pressure relative to vocal acoustics in 32 vocally healthy adults during sustained vowels, whispered sentences, and spoken sentences. Smoothed cepstral peak prominence (CPPs) and low-to-high spectral energy ratio (LHR) were derived from the acoustic signal. After controlling for resting UES pressure, age, and sex, we observed significant negative correlations between UES pressure and CPPs and a significant positive correlation between UES pressure and LHR. UES pressures were significantly higher during spoken sentences than whispered sentences and sustained vowels. Measuring UES pressure relative to vocal acoustics is a novel methodology for studying upper aerodigestive tract physiology during phonation and has the potential to enhance understanding of voice disruption in clinical populations. Clinical implications and considerations for implementation are discussed.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> We identified relationships between upper esophageal sphincter (UES) pressures and vocal acoustics during phonation in vocally healthy individuals, potentially reflecting the influence of strength of vocal fold adduction and other phonatory factors on vocal acoustics. This methodology could lead to the development of a clinical and research tool that could provide insight into the strength of vocal fold adduction, a critical factor influencing voice quality that has historically been difficult to assess."

DBS implants from 2016 to 2023 at the University of Alberta were analyzed. The neurologists' decision to proceed with DBS marks the start of the workup. The time required to see a neurosurgeon, psychiatrist, neuropsychologist and healthcare allies and to receive DBS surgery was assessed. The impact of COVID-19 was studied. The total time from starting the workup to DBS surgery was 387.76 ± 125.19 days prior to COVID-19, and marked delay occurred during and post-COVID-19 (840.15 ± 165.41 days and 839.78 ± 300.66 days, respectively). Most workups were done within 6 months pre-COVID-19, although a big range existed due to variable factors. The longest delay to surgery was from consent to DBS implantation, owing to a lack of operative time. There has not been a recovery post-pandemic. Time to DBS implantation surgery from initial decision is lengthy and more than doubled over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The biggest delay was in the time from consent to implantation surgery, which has not improved despite the pandemic having ended."

Difficulty swallowing has been linked to malnutrition in other populations; however, knowledge of this relationship is limited in XDP. As such, the purpose of this study was to determine the association between dysphagia and malnutrition in this population. 21 individuals with XDP, 26 controls, and 18 genetic carriers were included in the final data analysis. Spearman's rank order correlation coefficient was used to determine an association between baseline EAT-10 total scores and 12-month malnutrition status, and multiple linear regression to evaluate the predictive ability of the EAT-10. A baseline EAT-10 score cut-off point predicting 12-month malnutrition status was estimated. For the XDP group, the baseline EAT-10 total scores had a significant negative correlation (<i>r</i> = -0.68, <i>p</i> < 0.001) with and was a significant predictor (<i>p</i> = 0.001) of 12-month BMI. A baseline EAT-10 total score of ≥ 4 predicted malnutrition twelve months after administration (sensitivity = 0.93; specificity = 1; AUC = 0.95). Dysphagia, as measured using the EAT-10, was associated with BMI in the XDP population. Additionally, an EAT-10 total score ≥ 4 could predict malnutrition in twelve months after test administration. With these findings, healthcare providers could identify patients with XDP at high risk for malnutrition earlier and provide intervention sooner."

    "title": "Functional pathology of neuroleptic-induced dystonia based on the striatal striosome-matrix dopamine system in humans.",
    "abstract": "Neuroleptic-induced dystonia is a source of great concern in clinical practice because of its iatrogenic nature which can potentially lead to life-threatening conditions. Since all neuroleptics (antipsychotics) share the ability to block the dopamine D<sub>2</sub>-type receptors (D<sub>2</sub>Rs) that are highly enriched in the striatum, this drug-induced dystonia is thought to be caused by decreased striatal D<sub>2</sub>R activity. However, how associations of striatal D<sub>2</sub>R inactivation with dystonia are formed remains elusive.A growing body of evidence suggests that imbalanced activities between D<sub>1</sub>R-expressing medium spiny neurons and D<sub>2</sub>R-expressing medium spiny neurons (D<sub>1</sub>-MSNs and D<sub>2</sub>-MSNs) in the striatal striosome-matrix system underlie the pathophysiology of various basal ganglia disorders including dystonia. Given the specificity of the striatal dopamine D<sub>1</sub> system in 'humans', this article highlights the striatal striosome hypothesis in causing 'repetitive' and 'stereotyped' motor symptoms which are key clinical features of dystonia. It is suggested that exposure to neuroleptics may reduce striosomal D<sub>1</sub>-MSN activity and thereby cause dystonia symptoms. This may occur through an increase in the striatal cholinergic activity and the collateral inhibitory action of D<sub>2</sub>-MSNs onto neighbouring D<sub>1</sub>-MSNs within the striosome subfields. The article proposes a functional pathology of the striosome-matrix dopamine system for neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia or neuroleptic-withdrawal dystonia. A rationale for the effectiveness of dopaminergic or cholinergic pharmacotherapy is also provided for treating dystonias. This narrative review covers various aspects of the relevant field and provides a detailed discussion of the mechanisms of neuroleptic-induced dystonia."

    "title": "Unraveling the neural signatures: Distinct pallidal patterns in dystonia subtypes.",
    "abstract": "Dystonia manifests as slow twisting movements (pure dystonia) or repetitive, jerky motions (jerky dystonia). Dystonia can coexist with myoclonus (myoclonus dystonia) or tremor (tremor dystonia). Each of these presentations can have distinct etiology, can involve discrete sensorimotor networks, and may have characteristic neurophysiological signature. This study reports distinct neurophysiological signatures corresponding to the phenomenological subcategories and associations of dystonia. We studied 17 dystonia patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery. Video-based movement tracking classified them into four phenomenological subcategories: myoclonus dystonia, pure dystonia, jerky dystonia, and tremor dystonia. Microelectrode recordings from the globus pallidus interna (GPi) and externa (GPe) were analyzed to characterize single-neuron activity reflecting underlying physiology. Analysis of 1038 neurons revealed distinct patterns of burst, pause, and tonic activity across subtypes. Myoclonus dystonia had the highest prevalence of burst neurons in the GPi, while tremor dystonia showed a balanced distribution of burst and pause neurons. Myoclonus and pure dystonia had higher firing rates compared to tremor and jerky dystonia. Tremor dystonia showed the most irregular and bursty firing patterns. Overall, myoclonus and tremor dystonia had higher burst rates and lower interburst intervals than pure and jerky dystonia, highlighting distinct neuronal activity patterns across the different dystonia types. The differences in pallidal neuron activity across the phenoemenological subtypes and associations of dystonia depict distinct neural mechanisms. These findings offer crucial physiological insights into the diverse phenomenology of different dystonia types."

    "title": "Clinical neurophysiology for tremor: Common questions in clinical practice.",
    "abstract": "A thorough history and physical examination may be insufficient for comprehensively studying patients with tremor. In such instances, neurophysiology serves as an adjunct to the physical examination. Our aim is to present compelling evidence supporting the utilization of neurophysiological studies in various tremor conditions. A panel of global experts, convened by the Study Group on Clinical Neurophysiology for Movement Disorders, examined the application and utility of neurophysiology across diverse movement disorders. This manuscript provides a detailed methodology for electrophysiological studies in tremors helping to differentiate them from myoclonus, comparing tremor in parkinson vs atypical parkinsonisms, describing dystonic tremor, describing the differences between Parkinson and essential tremor and the characteristics of functional tremor. Neurophysiological studies play a crucial role in characterizing tremor syndromes and aiding in their differentiation from other hyperkinetic movement disorders."

    "title": "Lower-limb muscle synergies in musician's dystonia: a case study of a drummer.",
    "abstract": "Musician's dystonia (MD) is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions specifically triggered by playing an instrument. This condition often leads to a loss of fine motor control, threatening the careers of affected musicians. While MD is commonly associated with the hands, it can also affect the lower limbs, particularly in drummers. Understanding the muscle coordination involved in MD is crucial for comprehending its neurological mechanisms, yet the muscle coordination of lower-limb dystonia has not been thoroughly explored. This study aimed to investigate the differences in lower-limb muscle synergies in a drummer with MD, utilizing non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to analyze coordinated muscle activity patterns during drumming tasks. A 36-year-old male professional drummer with lower-limb MD was instructed to play a drum set in time with a metronome set at 80 beats per minute. The task involved striking the bass drum pedal in time with the downbeat. Electromyographic (EMG) data were collected from 10 muscles in the right lower limb. The data were analyzed using NMF to extract muscle synergies and compare the number of synergies, spatial modules, and temporal modules between the data with and without dystonia symptoms. The number of muscle synergies did not differ significantly between the data with and without symptoms. Notably, changes were observed in both the spatial and temporal modules of muscle synergies. Spatial modules revealed the appearance of dystonia-specific muscle synergy, which is considered related to compensatory movement. Temporal modules showed significant earlier overactivation in timing, which is considered the direct manifestation of dystonia symptoms. These findings indicate that lower-limb dystonia in drummers affects the spatial and temporal profiles of muscle synergies. This study underscores the importance of considering both spatial and temporal modules of muscle synergy in understanding and treating lower-limb dystonia in drummers. Further research is needed to validate these findings and apply muscle synergy analysis for the clinical assessment of lower-limb dystonia in drummers."

    "abstract": "To explore the mechanism of electroacupuncture pretreatment (EP) for relieving post-stroke spasticity in rats. Eighteen rats were randomized equally into sham-operated group, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group, and MCAO+EP group. In MCAO+EP group, the rats received electroacupuncture at the acupoints Qubin and Baihui for 3 consecutive days prior to MCAO. Neurological deficits and cognitive function of the rats were evaluated, and pathologies in the hippocampus were examined using HE, Nissl, and TUNEL staining. The expressions of IL-4, IL-6, TNF-α, and TMAO in the brain tissues were detected with ELISA, and the mRNA and protein expression levels of NF-κB p65, NLRP3, caspase-3, and caspase-9 were determined with qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. The rats receiving MCAO had significantly increased neurological deficit scores and showed increased muscle tension, number of apoptotic neurons, and expressions of IL-6, TNF-α, NF-κB p65, NLRP3, caspase-3 and caspase-9 in the hippocampus and significantly reduced length of time for new object recognition. Microscopically, the cells in the hippocampus of the MCAO rats showed uneven and loosened arrangement and unclear cell boundaries. In contrast, the rats in I/R+EP group showed significantly lowered neurological deficit scores and dystonia rating scores, reduced cell apoptosis, lowered hippocampal expressions of IL-6, TNF-α, caspase-3, caspase-9, and NF-κB p65, increased time for new object recognition, tightly arranged and uniformly stained hippocampal cells with clear boundaries, with also an increased number of active neurons and enhanced expression of IL-4 in the hippocampus. EP alleviates post-stroke spasticity in rats by inhibiting inflammatory responses and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis mediated by the NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway."

    "abstract": "To assess the influence of Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT-A) injection on meibomian gland function and dry eye in patients diagnosed with Blepharospasm (BPS) and Hemifacial spam (HFS). Adult patients aged 18 years or older who suffer from periocular dystonia, and were treated with BoNT-A injections, were recruited in this interventional prospective study between 2023 and 2024. Each patient was followed up for a period of three months. The following parameters were compared at baseline, 14 and 90 days post BoNT-A injections: Visual acuity, meibography, tear break up time (TBUT), Schirmer test, meibum expression, tear meniscus height, fluorescein corneal staining, meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) grading, and ocular surface disease index (OSDI). In addition, patients underwent subjective quality of life questionnaire for BPS and HFS. Thirty-six eyes of twenty-six patients were included in this study. The mean age ±SD was 59 ± 17.33 years. There was a significant statistical difference in vascular changes on the lid margin, TBUT, corneal and conjunctival fluorescein staining and meibum expression (P < 0.001 in all). The differences were statistically significant when compared to baseline vs visit 2, and visit 2 vs visit 3 (p-value<0.05). Jankovic rating scale and HFS score improved significantly between the time periods (P < 0.001 in both). There was no significant difference in meibomian gland loss, tear meniscus height, Schirmer test, and OSDI. BoNT-A injection is an effective treatment for periocular dystonia, but it worsens ocular surface and dry eye disease. Moreover, it affects the meibomian glands by disturbing their secretion."

This study aimed to describe the demographic and clinical features of uncommon SCA subtypes in Canada and compare them with international data. We conducted a case series and literature review of adult patients with rare SCA subtypes, including SCA5, SCA7, SCA12, SCA14, SCA15, SCA28, SCA34, SCA35 and SCA36. Data were collected from medical centers in Ontario, Alberta and Quebec between January 2000 and February 2021. We analyzed 25 patients with rare SCA subtypes, with onset ages ranging from birth to 67 years. Infantile and juvenile-onset cases were observed in SCA5, SCA7, SCA14 and SCA34. Most patients presented with gait ataxia, with no significant differences across groups. Additional common features included saccadic abnormalities (22 of 25), dysarthria (19 of 25) and nystagmus (12 of 22, except in SCA7). Less common findings included dystonia (8 of 25), cognitive impairment (7 of 25), tremor (9 of 25) and parkinsonism (3 of 25). Our study highlights the heterogeneity of rare SCA subtypes in Canada. Ongoing longitudinal analysis will improve the understanding, management and screening of these disorders."

    "abstract": "Neuromyotonia or Isaacs syndrome is a rare neuromuscular disorder secondary to hyperexcitable peripheral nerves which fire continuously causing motor unit activation and manifests clinically as cramps, muscle twitches, or visible muscle contraction associated with impaired muscle relaxation. Clinical suspicion and subsequent diagnostic work-up, including electrophysiology, aid in the diagnosis. However, when contractions are not appreciated clinically, there is a high possibility of misdiagnosis. Misdiagnosis may also be attributable to a lack of knowledge of symptoms among physicians and a paucity of diagnostic modalities, hence additional tools have been sought. Here we present the case of 15-year-old girl who presented to us with complaints of painful posturing and stiffness of both hands, which was initially diagnosed and managed as dystonia without symptomatic relief. We suspected the diagnosis of neuromyotonia only after we performed neuromuscular ultrasound, which became the main guiding light to reach the diagnosis."

    "abstract": "HIDEA syndrome (MIM: #618493) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypotonia, hypoventilation, intellectual disability, dysautonomia, epilepsy, and eye anomalies. We present the case of a Turkish female with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, highlighting a novel compound heterozygous variation in the P4HTM gene. A 6-year and 11-month-old girl with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy and abnormal eye movements since the neonatal period has been presented to our clinic. Despite severe developmental delays and a happy demeanor, she showed significant hypotonia and autistic behaviors. Genetic testing revealed a novel heterozygous splice-site variant (c.436+1G>T) in intron 2 and a previously reported missense variant (c.934G>A; p.E312 K) in exon 6 of the P4HTM gene. Imaging showed cortical atrophy and thin corpus callosum, but no dystonia was observed. The patient's phenotype aligns with most reported cases of HIDEA syndrome, yet developmental epileptic encephalopathy had not been documented previously in such patients, emphasizing the uniqueness of this case. This case is the first to associate P4HTM gene variants with epileptic encephalopathy, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of HIDEA syndrome. It underscores the importance of genetic testing and reanalysis in undiagnosed developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. The novel genetic variations identified in this study underscore the necessity for continuous genetic exploration and personalized clinical management to improve outcomes for patients with this rare but impactful syndrome. Finally, the association between developmental epileptic encephalopathy, the patient's clinical presentation, and EEG findings suggests a compelling link to the P4HTM gene."

    "abstract": "This article provides an overview of neurosurgical therapies for movement disorders (MDs), including Tourette syndrome, dystonia, Parkinson's disease (PD), and others. It focuses on the benefits of these treatments and suggests directions for further research. A total of 10 years' worth of English-language PubMed articles were combed through, with an emphasis on studies conducted in North America. To manage MDs like Parkinson's disease and Tourette syndrome, the results suggest that non-invasive neuromodulation techniques, closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS), and other advanced therapies may become the treatment of choice in the future. Research on dystonia is being focused on improving treatment methods by investigating new areas of the brain that might be stimulated through neurosurgery and looking at gene therapy. Modern technological developments, such as non-invasive neuromodulation procedures and improved imaging, provide promising substitutes for traditional surgical approaches. This study highlights the need for continuous clinical trials for better outcomes, which is why research and development in this area must continue."

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a group of genetic neurological disorders frequently associated with iron accumulation in the basal nuclei of the brain characterized by progressive spasticity, dystonia, muscle rigidity, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and retinal degeneration or optic nerve atrophy. Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is one of the most widespread NBIA disorders. The diagnosis of PKAN is established with clinical features and the \"eye of the tiger\" sign identified on brain MRI and the identification of biallelic pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing. PANK2 catalyzes the first reaction of coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis, thus, altered PANK2 activity is expected to induce CoA deficiency as well as low levels of essential metabolic intermediates such as 4'-phosphopantetheine which is a necessary cofactor for critical proteins involved in cytosolic and mitochondrial pathways such as fatty acid biosynthesis, mitochondrial respiratory complex I assembly and lysine and tetrahydrofolate metabolism, among other metabolic processes. In this manuscript, we examined the effect of a multitarget complex supplements (pantothenate, pantethine, omega-3 and vitamin E) on in vitro patient-derived cellular models and the clinical outcome of the adjuvant supplements in combination with the baseline neurological medication in three PKAN patients. Multitarget complex supplements significantly reduced iron accumulation and increased PANK2 and ACP expression levels in the cellular models derived from all three PKAN patients. In addition, the adjunct treatment to the standard neurological medication improved or stabilized the clinical symptoms of patients. Our results suggest that multitarget complex supplements can be clinically useful as augmentation therapy for PKAN patients harboring pathogenic variants with residual enzyme levels.

    "abstract": "Studies have linked the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) c.665C > T (rs1801133) with hyperhomocysteinemia. Mandatory folate fortification nullified this association. However, its relevance persists in regions with no folate fortification resulting in a relatively low frequency of this variant in healthy population. This study explored the MTHFR variant's association with 50 clinical manifestations in the absence of folate fortification. We performed mutation analysis via whole exome and Sanger sequencing in 2431 cases and 1265 healthy controls and the food frequency-based dietary folate intake assessment. The cohort's average dietary folate intake was 373 ± 141 μg/day. MTHFR rs1801133 variant demonstrated ≥4.49-fold increased risk for respiratory distress, recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), ischemic stroke, autism, global developmental delay, dysplasia, myoclonic jerks, intellectual disability, aggressive behavior, motor delay, Alzheimer's, cerebellar atrophy, failure to thrive, cerebral atrophy, increased tendon reflexes, and spasticity (p < 0.0001). MTHFR T-allele showed 1.81-4.04 folds increased risk for mental retardation, behavioral problems, dystonia, anemia, gait abnormality, hypotonia, recurrent pneumonia, liver disease, cerebral palsy, short stature, hyperactivity, and cognitive decline. The association of this variant with seizures was moderate (OR: 1.51, 95 % CI: 1.13-2.02, p = 0.009). MTHFR TT-genotype was associated with a 5.81-fold risk for the abnormal phenotype (95 % CI: 1.39-24.28, p = 0.005). MTHFR T-allele was associated with low 25-hydroxy vitamin D, Ferritin, TIBC, and elevated total cholesterol. The MTHFR rs1801133 increases the risk for RPL, developmental milestones, neuronal development, autism, ischemic stroke, and late-onset neurological functions. The MTHFR TT-genotype is strongly associated with abnormal phenotypes."

    "abstract": "Several systematic reviews have shown that physical exercise positively affects motor function (MF) and quality of life (QoL) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). After the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, numerous studies were conducted to reveal the effects of telerehabilitation for patients with PD. However, only a few empirical results of online programs for PD patients have been reported. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effects of an online physical and cognitive training program on MF and QoL in patients with PD. We evaluated the impact of our online program on the QoL and MF of patients with PD by comparing data at baseline and after six months of intervention. For the QoL assessment, we used the Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living scale and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), whereas, for MF, we measured movement status using the modified 20-m walk test and timed up-and-go (TUG) test. We enrolled 20 patients for QoL and 19 for MF in this study. For PDQ-39, social support (<i>p</i> = 0.046, <i>δ</i> = 0.320) and cognitions (<i>p</i> = 0.028, <i>δ</i> = 0.268) significantly improved. Additionally, cadence (<i>p</i> = 0.032, <i>g</i> = -0.377) in the modified 20-m walk and exam duration (<i>p</i> = 0.003, <i>δ</i> = 0.296) and forward gait (<i>p</i> = 0.003, <i>δ</i> = 0.341) in the TUG test showed significant differences before and after the intervention. Our results suggest that online physical and cognitive training programs positively affect MF and QoL in individuals with PD."

The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate spine alignment with a surface topography analysis of Parkinson's patients with Biometrical Holistic of Human Body (BHOHB®) and to compare results with their x-rays spine standard as already done for adolescent scoliosis. 32 adult patients affected by Parkinson disease, have been evaluated with BHOHB ®. The correspondence of the Cobb angles were evaluated using the BHOHB device and with standard spinal x-rays. A total of 32 patients were enrolled. The mean age was 67.45 years. In this pilot study the measurement of the correlations between the radiological and BHOHB® Cobb angles of the patients were excellent. This preliminary result supports the use of BHOHB® as a device useful to monitor and measure posture in Parkinson's. This needs to be evaluated on a larger sample and over time.

It can be seen in various medical conditions, both neurological and systemic, of genetic and acquired etiology. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) has been used to treat various types of chorea. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of GPi DBS for chorea in pediatric patients. The authors undertook a single-center retrospective study of all pediatric patients who underwent DBS in the period from July 2017 to April 2024 to identify those presenting with chorea. Three patients with chorea underwent bilateral posteroventral GPi DBS without surgical complications. The mean age at operation was 14.2 years (range: 1.5 years), and the mean follow-up was 49 months (range: 15 months). Two of the 3 patients experienced a positive effect on chorea with an improvement in functional status. In one patient, the pre- and postop Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) score was 4, while his Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Scale (BFMDS) score improved from 102/20 pre- to 53.5/20 postop. In the other patient the GMFCS score improved from 4 preop to 3 postop. His preop BFMDS score was not available, postop it was 83/120. In the patient who did not experience a positive effect on chorea the pre- and postop GMFCS score was 4, her BFMDS score was 84.5/120 pre- and 100/120 postop. Bilateral GPi DBS can be safely administered to pediatric patients with choreiform movement disorders, and it could be an effective treatment option for managing chorea in certain patients."

Three recurrent ATP1A3 variants are associated with approximately half of known AHC cases and mouse models of two of these variants (p.D801N, p.E815K) replicated key features of the human disorder, which include paroxysmal hemiplegia, dystonia and seizures. Epilepsy occurs in 40-50 % of individuals affected with AHC, but detailed investigations of seizure phenotypes were limited in the previously reported mouse models. Using gene editing, we generated a novel AHC mouse expressing the third most recurrent ATP1A3 variant (p.G947R) to model neurological phenotypes of the disorder. Heterozygous Atp1a3-G947R (Atp1a3<sup>G947R</sup>) mice on a pure C57BL/6J background were born at a significantly lower frequency than wildtype (WT) littermates, but in vitro fertilization or outcrossing to a different strain (C3HeB/FeJ) generated offspring at near-Mendelian genotype ratios, suggesting a defect in reproductive fitness rather than embryonic lethality. Heterozygous mutant mice were noticeably smaller and exhibited premature lethality, hyperactivity, anxiety-like behaviors, severe motor dysfunction including low grip strength, impaired coordination with abnormal gait and balance, reduced REM sleep, and cooling-induced hemiplegia and dystonia. We also observed a prominent seizure phenotype with lower thresholds to chemically (flurothyl, kainic acid) and electrically induced seizures, post-handling seizures, sudden death following seizures, and abnormal EEG activity. Together, our findings support face validity of a novel AHC mouse model with quantifiable traits including co-morbid epilepsy that will be useful as an in vivo platform for investigating pathophysiology and testing new therapeutic strategies for this rare neurodevelopmental disorder."

Her parents were first cousins, but there was otherwise no family history. Targeted gene sequencing for variants in <i>VPS13A</i>, mRNA splicing analysis, and Western blot for chorein were performed. A homozygous synonymous variant in exon 41 of <i>VPS13A</i> (NM_033305.3): c.5157C>T; p.Gly1719 = was identified; this was previously classified as a variant of uncertain significance. SpliceAI predicted a splice donor gain with a score of 0.75 2 base pairs upstream of the reported variant. RNA splicing analysis revealed the creation of a type III splice variant, resulting in a frameshift and a premature termination codon. Western blot showed absent chorein/VPS13A protein. The variant is reclassified as likely pathogenic based on the American College of Medical Genetics criteria. This is the first reported case of ChAc caused by a synonymous variant in <i>VPS13A</i> proven to affect splicing. Our report further expands the spectrum of variants known to cause ChAc."

Here, we describe two cases of NADGP in a Japanese family. We performed clinical and genetic laboratory evaluations of the two patients and their healthy parents. By whole-exome sequencing, we identified compound heterozygous variants in SQSTM1(NM_003900.5): c.1A>G p.(Met1?) in the initial codon, and c.969G>A, located at the 3' end of exon 6, which is novel and seemingly a synonymous but is actually a truncating variant causing aberrant splicing. An SQSTM1 protein expression assay using urine-derived cells (UDCs) demonstrated that both variants (c.1A>G and c.969G>A) were unable to induce normal splicing of premessenger RNA. Cerebellar ataxia is a characteristic manifestation of this disorder; however, brain magnetic resonance imaging studies have not shown significant cerebellar atrophy. Our patients experienced chorea during adolescence. Only a few reports have highlighted the presence of chorea; however, our findings suggest that NADGP should be considered as a differential diagnosis of hereditary chorea. This study also demonstrates the utility of UDCs, obtained using noninvasive approaches, in functionally analyzing genetic diseases."

Genome-wide methylation status was assessed using the EPIC methylation assay in peripheral blood samples from two subjects with early onset movement disorder and missense variants of uncertain significance in the KMT2B gene (p.Leu1720Phe and p.Tyr2515Cys). After QC and normalization steps, we compared the M values for all 144 probes, previously described as an EpiSign for KMT2B-related dystonia, between the two subjects and 14 controls individuals. The individual harboring the p.Tyr2515Cys variant exhibited a hypermethylation profile compatible with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in KMT2B, allowing for variant reclassification, conclusive genetic counseling, and patient stratification for deep brain stimulation. In contrast, the individual harboring the p.Leu1720Phe variant had a methylation status similar to controls, practically ruling out KMT2B-related dystonia. Investigation of methylation status can be a powerful tool to determine pathogenicity when facing KMT2B variants of uncertain significance. Methylation results may optimize genetic counseling and positively impact patient care."

Case 1 is a patient aged 30 years with preexisting DBS system (Medtronic Activa RC, Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) for idiopathic dystonia, who underwent cochlear implantation for severe-to-profound hearing loss. Cases 2 and 3 are patients aged 72 and 57 years, respectively, with cochlear implants in whom a neuropathic pain syndrome developed postoperatively. After unsuccessful medical and physiotherapeutic therapy, implantation of an ONS stimulator (Nuvectra-Algovita system, Plano, TX) and a permanent PNFS system with two periauricular electrodes (Boston Scientific WaveWriter R16, Marlborough, MA) was performed. In all three cases, the fitting parameters of the cochlear implant and the postoperative hearing impression were not affected. In the first case, the patient achieved speech understanding of 65% at 65 decibels sound pressure level (dB SPL) in the Freiburg monosyllabic test three months after surgery. In the second and the third case, speech comprehension remained good after ONS and PNFS intervention. DBS stimulation could be continued without complications and the occurrence of neurologic symptoms. Furthermore, a good and long-term reduction in pain intensity was achieved by implanting the ONS stimulator and the PNFS system. This case series shows that the simultaneous use of cochlear implants and other neuromodulation systems seems possible without complications and disruptive interactions."

    "title": "Endometrioma patients are under-treated with endocrine endometriosis therapy.",
    "abstract": "Is there a difference in the use of endocrine endometriosis therapy in endometriosis patients with and without endometrioma? Patients with endometriomas received significantly less endocrine endometriosis treatment (present intake in 42.5%) compared to patients with other forms of endometriosis and without endometriomas (present intake in 52.1%). Endocrine endometriosis therapy in patients with endometriomas reduces the risk of recurrence and therefore the risk of further surgery and subsequent irreversible damage to ovaries which results into reduced antral follicle counts (AFC), anti-Mullerian hormone levels (AMH), and early menopause. However, there is evidence of increasing rejection of endocrine endometriosis treatment in this population. A total of 838 premenopausal woman with dysmenorrhea and/or endometriosis (mean age 30.7 ± 6.9 years, range 15-54 years) were included in this observational cross-sectional multicenter study. Data including the extent of dysmenorrhea, prevalence of other comorbidities like migraine with aura and migraine never with aura, diagnosis of endometriosis, history of endometriosis surgery, and hormone therapy, were collected in a retrospective online survey from May to November 2023. Patients visiting two university hospital endometriosis centers between January 2017 and March 2023, and with available email address, were invited for study participation by email in May 2023. Further recruitment of participants was achieved through the website and social medial channels of the German Endometriosis Association. Participation in the online survey was open between May and November 2023. In the subgroup of women (with dysmenorrhea) without surgically confirmed endometriosis (SCE) (n = 277), 95 (34.3%) were currently undergoing endocrine treatment for dysmenorrhea and contraceptional purposes. On the contrary, in the subgroup of patients with SCE (n = 561), 275 (49.0%) were currently undergoing hormonal treatment. Subjects with SCE therefore significantly more commonly took endocrine treatment (F = 16.587, P < 0.001) compared to those without SCE. Endometriomas were present in 254 patients (45.2% of all SCE patients), and these patients were significantly less likely to have used hormonal treatment (i) in the present and (ii) in the past (i. n = 113 42.5%, ii. n = 187, 73.9%) compared to patients with other forms of endometriosis (n = 261) (i. n = 139, 52.1%, ii. n = 220, 84.3%) (i. F = 3.976, P = 0.047, ii. F = 8.297, P = 0.004). Various reasons for rejection of endocrine endometriosis treatment were analyzed, when comparing endometrioma subjects to patients with other types of endometriosis, but no statistical differences were found. This study is limited by its retrospective design and an online questionnaire with patient-reported outcomes. A selection bias due to the voluntary nature of the study and the online recruitment is also possible. The results show that patients often refuse endocrine endometriosis treatments without a rational medical reason. According to the literature, this unnecessarily exposes these patients to a higher risk for endometrioma recurrence and subsequently a higher risk of repeat surgery and permanent damage to ovarian function. This study was funded by the University of Luebeck (budget for university teaching and research). A.C. was supported by DFG (CRC/TR 296 'Local control of TH action', LocoTact, P07) and by funds of University of Luebeck, medical section (LACS01-2024).

    "title": "The role of osteopathic manipulative treatment for dystonia: a literature review.",
    "abstract": "Dystonia is a movement disorder that causes involuntary muscle contractions leading to abnormal movements and postures, such as twisting. Dystonia is the third most common movement disorder in the United States, with as many as 250,000 people affected. Because of its complexity, dystonia presents a significant challenge in terms of management and treatment. Despite limited research, osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) has been considered as an adjunctive treatment due to its inexpensive and noninvasive nature, as opposed to other modalities such as botulinum toxin injections, deep brain stimulation (DBS), and transcranial magnetic stimulation, which are often expensive and inaccessible. OMT treatments performed in case studies and series such as balanced ligamentous tension/articular ligamentous strain (BLT/ALS), muscle energy (ME), high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA), and myofascial release (MFR) have shown reduction of pain and muscle hypertonicity, including in patients with dystonia. The studies reviewed in this paper provide a snapshot of the literature regarding the current evidence of OMT's role for dystonia. A medical reference librarian conducted a thorough literature search across multiple databases including PubMed and Google Scholar to find articles relevant to the use of OMT for dystonia. The search employed a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords related to osteopathic medicine and dystonia to ensure precise retrieval of relevant articles within the last 20 years. Despite limited research on the topic, all four relevant reports found in the literature were selected for review. Of the four relevant reports, case series and studies highlighted the potential benefits of OMT in managing dystonia, particularly cervical dystonia and foot dystonia. OMT has shown promising results addressing pain, stiffness, and impaired motor function. In cases of foot dystonia in Parkinson's disease, OMT has helped improve gait and reduce pain by targeting somatic dysfunctions (SDs) associated with dystonia, such as abnormalities in foot progression angle (FPA) and musculoskeletal imbalances. Also, OMT has been found to alleviate symptoms of cervical dystonia, including tremors, muscle spasms, and neck stiffness. These interventions performed in case studies and series led to improvements in gait biomechanics in foot dystonia and overall symptom severity in patients with cervical dystonia. Currently, botulinum toxin, oral medications, physical therapy, and rehabilitation are commonly utilized in managing dystonia. The studies reviewed in this paper suggest that these treatments may lead to improvements in pain and muscle hypertonicity in patients with dystonia. It is important to investigate whether factors such as the type of dystonia (eg, focal vs. segmental) and its underlying cause (eg, idiopathic, trauma, infection, autoimmune, medication side effects) influence treatment outcomes. Further research is recommended to explore the role of OMT in managing dystonia."

    "title": "Expanding the phenotyping spectrum of Witteveen Kolk syndrome: first report of generalized dystonia and cerebellar ataxia.",
    "abstract": "Witteveen-Kolk syndrome (WITKOS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by distinct facial features, microcephaly, short stature, intellectual disability, and subtle neuroimaging abnormalities. The syndrome is attributed to a loss of function mutation in the SIN3A gene, a member of the switch-insensitive 3 transcription regulator family. Herein, we present a 21-year-old woman with dysmorphic facial features, short stature, and a chronic, progressively worsening symmetric cerebellar ataxia, along with generalized dystonia. Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous mutation in exon 7 of the SIN3A gene (c.1051 C>T, p.Pro351Ser), consistent with a diagnosis of WITKOS. Notably, dystonia has not been previously associated with this syndrome. This case underscores the clinical variability and broadens the phenotypic spectrum of WITKOS."

Seventy-two primary school age children suffering from the breath-holding spells were examined. Somatic, neurological and autonomic status has been followed-up and children developmental features have been analyzed. The Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) for children of 6-18 years old, Zakharov and Lavrentieva-Titarenko anxiety tests were used in the work in addition to clinical research methods. According to the data obtained, 47.2% of children with a history of breath-holding spells suffer from conditions such as somatoform dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract, tension headache, vegetative and vascular dystonia, dissomnia, emotional lability syndrome. The presence of breath-holding spells in children can be considered as a predictor of the autonomic dysfunction development, sleep disorders and anxiety disorders in future."

    "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) is characterized by upper limbs action tremor, sometimes extending to other body parts. However, ET can present with additional neurological features known as \"soft signs.\" These signs of uncertain clinical significance are not sufficient to suggest an alternative neurological diagnosis, and include, among others, questionable dystonia and subtle voluntary movement alterations, i.e., bradykinesia and related features. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and relationship between questionable dystonia and subtle bradykinesia features in ET. Forty ET patients were video-recorded during clinical examination. Five movement disorder experts reviewed the videos to identify soft motor signs, i.e., dystonia and movement alterations during finger-tapping namely, (i) bradykinesia (reduced velocity), (ii) dysrhythmia, and (iii) sequence effect. Inter-rater agreement was quantified using the Fleiss' Kappa index. Data analysis was performed using nonparametric tests. We found a fair inter-rater agreement for upper limb dystonia (Fleiss' K = 0.27). Inter-rater agreement was higher (moderate) for head dystonia (Fleiss' K = 0.49) and finger-tapping assessment (Fleiss' K = 0.45). Upper limb dystonia was identified in 70% of patients, head dystonia in 35%, and finger-tapping alterations (in variable combinations) were observed in 95% of individuals (P < 0.001 by Fisher's exact test), including subtle bradykinesia and related features. No significant concordance or correlation was found between the soft signs. Subtle bradykinesia and related features are the most easily identifiable and frequent soft signs in ET, appearing in a higher percentage of patients than subtle dystonia. These findings provide insights into the clinical and pathophysiological understanding of ET."

The recently released Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) v4 offers a >5-fold increased sample size compared to v2.1.1. Pathogenic variants absent from v2.1.1 are now registered in v4 at a considerable rate. The implications on variant interpretation in dystonia are unknown. All curated variants linked to the most common dominant forms of isolated dystonia were extracted from the International Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorder Society Gene database. We compared variant population-frequencies and gene constraint metrics between gnomAD v2.1.1 and v4. The majority of dystonia-causing variants (192/247, 77.7%) remained absent from the newer gnomAD version. Of 219 variants absent from v2.1.1, 27 (12.3%) appeared for the first time in v4.1, including well-established pathogenic alleles. Gene constraints for GNAL and KMT2B significantly decreased in v4. A growing number of dystonia-linked alleles are seen in gnomAD v4. The presence in population-scale data does not preclude pathogenicity. © 2024 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Creak is an acoustic feature found to discriminate speakers with adductor laryngeal dystonia (AdLD) from typical speakers with outstanding diagnostic accuracy. Yet creak is also used by typical speakers as a phrase-boundary marker. This study aims to compare the prevalence of creak across estimated breath groups in speakers with AdLD and controls to delineate physiological mechanisms underlying creak in AdLD. Thirty-four speakers read aloud the first paragraph of the Rainbow Passage (17 diagnosed with AdLD and 17 with no history of voice complaints). \"Breath-like\" pauses were defined as any in which technicians audibly heard a pause and all pauses >500 ms. For each phoneme, the time preceding the next breath-like pause was calculated, and the probability of creak occurrence was calculated. A generalized linear mixed-effects model was performed to determine the relationship between creak and time preceding a breath-like pause. Inter-rater and intrarater reliability of technicians were excellent. There was a statistically greater probability of creak in the AdLD group compared to controls (22% vs. 5%) and a statistically greater probability of creak as speakers approached a breath-like pause in both groups. The interaction between the time preceding a breath-like pause and group was significant, with a stronger relationship between the time preceding a breath-like pause and creak for control speakers (P < 0.001). Creak is more prevalent in speakers with AdLD and may not only be related to respiratory phrasing but possibly in response to or because of the hyperadduction of the vocal folds during a laryngeal spasm. The probability of creak occurring was greater towards the end of estimated breath groups in speakers with and without AdLD; however, for speakers with AdLD, creak was more prominent across the entire breath group."

    "abstract": "To examine the efficacy and safety of sodium oxybate versus placebo in a phase IIb randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 2-period cross-over clinical trial in patients with isolated laryngeal dystonia (LD). The study was conducted from January 2018 to December 2021, pausing during the COVID-19 pandemic, at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in 106 patients with alcohol-responsive (EtOH+) and alcohol-non-responsive (EtOH-) LD (53 to receive 1.5g of sodium oxybate first, 53 to receive matching placebo first). The primary outcome was a change from baseline in LD symptom severity 40 minutes after drug intake. Safety was based on vital signs, cognitive function, suicidality, daytime sleepiness, and adverse events. Patients, investigators, and outcome assessors were masked to study procedures. Compared to baseline, EtOH+ but not EtOH- patients had a statistically significant improvement in LD symptoms following sodium oxybate versus placebo (EtOH+: 98.75% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6-26.9; p = 0.008; EtOH-: 98.75% CI = -6.2 to 18.7; p = 0.42). Statistically significant minimum drug efficacy in EtOH+ patients was found at ≥16% symptom improvement (OR = 2.09; 98.75% CI = 0.75-5.80; p = 0.036), with an average of 40.81% benefits (98.75% CI = 34.7-48.6). Drug efficacy waned by 300 minutes after intake without a rebound. No changes were found in cognitive function, suicidality, or vital signs. Common adverse events included mild dizziness, nausea, and daytime sleepiness. Sodium oxybate showed clinically meaningful improvement of symptoms in EtOH+ LD patients, with acceptable tolerability. Sodium oxybate offers the first pathophysiologically relevant oral treatment for laryngeal dystonia. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:329-343."

This emerging technology holds promise for its precision and potential benefits in comparison to traditional surgical interventions. This investigation involves a scoping review, summarizing insights from various studies that explore the advantages, limitations, and outcomes associated with MRgFUS in the treatment of dystonia. This scoping review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Data available on MRgFUS use in the management of different types of dystonia were extracted. There is limited data available (n = 11). In the surveyed literature, MRgFUS has consistently shown clinical benefit in patients with dystonia. It is an emerging avenue of treatment and has its challenges. This scoping review highlighted the early but encouraging applications of MRgFUS in dystonia management. While data was limited, existing studies consistently demonstrated positive clinical outcomes. The non-invasive and precise nature of MRgFUS positions it as a promising avenue for further research, despite the challenges associated with its emergent status. This review sets the stage for future inquiries, emphasizing its potential as a valuable tool in dystonia treatment."

    "abstract": "Dystonia is common in Parkinson disease patients, affecting about 30% of them. Bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (DBS) can sometimes lead to dystonia, but this relationship is not well understood. Our aim was to provide a better understanding of dystonia's causes and its connection to DBS. We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data from 80 Parkinson disease patients who underwent bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation, focusing on dystonia before and after surgery and its relation to medication state (on-dystonia/off-dystonia). After DBS, off-dystonia had a higher recovery rate than on-dystonia (43.5% vs. 9.1%). Among patients suffering for on-dystonia, 74.4% had it for the first time after surgery; these patients assumed higher doses of levodopa before DBS. Patients with off-dystonia before surgery tend to improve after DBS. Otherwise, DBS could have the role of \"additive boost\" in the process of sensitization of striato-pallidal pathways and lead to on-dystonia in particular patients."

    "abstract": "Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is a rare neurological disorder marked by transient involuntary movements triggered by sudden actions. Current diagnostic approaches, including genetic screening, face challenges in identifying secondary cases due to symptom overlap with other disorders. This study introduces a novel PKD recognition method utilizing a resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) functional connectivity matrix and a deep learning architecture (AT-1CBL). Resting-state EEG data from 44 PKD patients and 44 healthy controls (HCs) were collected using a 128-channel EEG system. Functional connectivity matrices were computed and transformed into graph data to examine brain network property differences between PKD patients and controls through graph theory. Source localization was conducted to explore neural circuit differences in patients. The AT-1CBL model, integrating 1D-CNN and Bi-LSTM with attentional mechanisms, achieved a classification accuracy of 93.77% on phase lag index (PLI) features in the Theta band. Graph theoretic analysis revealed significant phase synchronization impairments in the Theta band of the functional brain network in PKD patients, particularly in the distribution of weak connections compared to HCs. Source localization analyses indicated greater differences in functional connectivity in sensorimotor regions and the frontal-limbic system in PKD patients, suggesting abnormalities in motor integration related to clinical symptoms. This study highlights the potential of deep learning models based on EEG functional connectivity for accurate and cost-effective PKD diagnosis, supporting the development of portable EEG devices for clinical monitoring and diagnosis. However, the limited dataset size may affect generalizability, and further exploration of multimodal data integration and advanced deep learning architectures is necessary to enhance the robustness of PKD diagnostic models."

    "title": "Psychotropic drug-induced adverse drug reactions in 462,661 psychiatric inpatients in relation to age: results from a German drug surveillance program from 1993-2016.",
    "abstract": "Clinical practice suggests that older adults (i.e., ≥ 65 years of age) experience adverse drug reactions (ADRs) more often than younger patients (i.e., < 65 years of age). ADRs such as falls, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), metabolic disorders, sedation, and delirium are particularly worrisome and often associated with psychotropic drugs. This observational study investigated the risk for psychotropic drug-related ADRs in older (n = 99,099) and younger adults (n = 363,562) in psychiatric inpatients using data from the German pharmacovigilance program \"Arzneimittelsicherheit in der Psychiatrie\" (AMSP) from 1993-2016. The aim was to assess whether age influenced the risk of specific ADR types and if certain psychotropic drugs posed particular concerns. The risk for ADRs did not differ between older and younger patients (relative risk 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.92-1.05). However, older patients had a higher risk for delirium (2.35, 1.85-2.99), hyponatremia (3.74, 2.85-4.90), and orthostatic syncope (2.37, 1.72-3.26), as well as certain types of EPS, e.g., parkinsonism (1.89, 1.45-2.48) and Pisa-/metronome syndrome (3.61, 2.51-5.18). The risk for other ADRs, such as acute dystonia (0.20, 0.10-0.37), akathisia (0.47, 0.29-0.76), liver dysfunction (0.63, 0.48-0.82), weight gain (0.07, 0.04-0.14), sexual dysfunction (0.03, CI 0.00-0.25), and hyperprolactinemia/galactorrhea (0.05, 0.02-0.17) was significantly lower for older patients. Older patients treated with any type of antidepressant drug (1.33, 1.26-1.40)-especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (1.57, 1.26-1.40) and selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (2.03, 1.80-2.29)-and lithium (1.74, 1.52-2.00) had a higher ADR risk than younger patients. Second-generation antipsychotic drugs had a lower (0.74, 0.71-0.77) and low-potency first-generation antipsychotic drugs a higher (1.19, 1.07-1.33) ADR risk in older patients. The risk for ADRs involving multiple drugs was higher in older patients (1.28, 1.22-1.34). ADRs in older patients were 6.4 times more likely to result in death. Clinicians and pharmacists should be aware of the types of ADRs and high-risk drugs across age groups and provide appropriate monitoring. Pharmacovigilance is crucial in psychiatric patients of all ages and should not be neglected, even for drugs generally considered \"safe\"."

Peripheral nervous system involvement is common and may present as axonal sensory/sensorimotor or demyelinating polyneuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, ganglionopathy, or cranial neuritis. It can also present with transverse myelitis, especially longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis in association with aquaporin-4 antibodies. It can also mimic central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis. The present case series highlights some uncommon neurological presentations of Sjogren's syndrome. In this series, patients presented with Miller-Fischer syndrome, recurrent Guillain-Barre syndrome, multifocal dystonia, and demyelinating disorder of CNS. None of the cases had presenting complaints of dry mouth or eyes. Special investigations such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nerve conduction studies, anti-ganglioside panel, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, depending on the clinical presentation of the cases, were conducted. Schirmer's test, tear breakup time, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) by immunofluorescent assay, ANA blot demonstrating the presence of anti-SSA (Ro) and/or anti-SSB (La) antibodies, and lip biopsy were conducted in all cases, which confirmed the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome. After the diagnosis was confirmed, other tests such as C- reactive protein, serum cryoglobulin, and rheumatoid factor were conducted. Treatment was initiated with steroids, followed by long-term immunosuppression with injection rituximab. Sjogren's syndrome may present with various presentations of neurological involvement, sometimes rare, and hence a high degree of suspicion is required when other usual causes are excluded."

    "abstract": "Antipsychotic polypharmacy remains a clinical reality, despite an increased risk of adverse events and little evidence of additional efficacy compared with antipsychotic monotherapy. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of antipsychotic polypharmacy prevalence, trends, and correlates across mental disorders. We searched MEDLINE and Embase from Jan 1, 2009 to April 30, 2024, for any original study (observational and interventional) reporting antipsychotic polypharmacy prevalence in populations with mental disorders or use of antipsychotics, regardless of age or diagnosis. Relevant studies before May 1, 2009, were identified from two previous systematic reviews of antipsychotic polypharmacy prevalence. Pooled antipsychotic polypharmacy prevalence was estimated using random-effects meta-analysis. Using subgroup and mixed-effects meta-regression analyses, we sought to identify relevant correlates of antipsychotic polypharmacy. People with lived experience were not involved in the project. This review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022329953). We analysed 517 studies with 599 individual timepoints reporting on 4 459 149 individuals (mean age 39·5 years [range 6·4-86·3]; data on sex and ethnicity were infrequently reported). Most studies included patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs; k=270, 52%). Overall, 24·8% (95% CI 22·9-26·7) of the populations received antipsychotic polypharmacy, ranging from 33·2% (30·6-36·0) in people with SSDs to 5·2% (4·0-6·8) in people with dementia. Antipsychotic polypharmacy prevalence varied by region from 15·4% (95% CI 12·9-18·2) in North America to 38·6% (27·7-50·6) in Africa. Overall antipsychotic polypharmacy prevalence increased significantly from 1970 to 2023 (β=0·019, 95% CI 0·009-0·029; p=0·0002) and was higher in adults than in children and adolescents (27·4%, 95% CI 25·2-29·8 vs 7·0%, 4·7-10·3; p<0·0001) and among inpatients than among outpatients (31·4%, 27·9-35·2 vs 19·9%, 16·8-23·3; p<0·0001). Compared with antipsychotic monotherapy, antipsychotic polypharmacy was associated with an increased risk of relapse (relative risk [RR] 1·42, 95% CI 1·04-1·93; p=0·028), psychiatric hospitalisation (1·24, 1·12-1·38; p<0·0001), worse global functioning (standardised mean difference [SMD] -0·31, 95% CI -0·44 to -0·19; p<0·0001), and more adverse events, including extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 1·63, 95% CI 1·13-2·36; p=0·0098), dystonia (5·91, 1·20-29·17; p=0·029), anticholinergic use (1·91, 1·55-2·35; p<0·0001), higher side-effect scores (SMD 0·33, 95% CI 0·24-0·42; p<0·0001), longer corrected QT interval (0·24, 0·23-0·26; p<0·0001), and greater all-cause mortality risk (RR 1·19, 95% CI 1·00-1·41; p=0·047). The prevalence of antipsychotic polypharmacy has increased globally over the past 50 years and is particularly high in patients with SSDs. Prescription of antipsychotic polypharmacy is associated with greater illness severity and poorer outcomes than is antipsychotic monopharmacy but does not resolve these issues. Furthermore, antipsychotic polypharmacy is associated with higher side-effect burden, including all-cause mortality. None."

    "abstract": "Head tremor poses diagnostic problems, especially when present as an isolated or predominant symptom. To assess how maneuvers activating upper limb postural tremor can help differentiate head tremor in essential tremor (ET) from dystonic tremor (DT) in cervical dystonia. 48 patients with head tremor (25 ET, 23 DT), underwent clinical examination and accelerometric evaluation of head and upper limb tremor during routine tremor-inducing tasks. While accelerometric power and clinical scores of head tremor did not significantly differ between patient groups, task-induced variations revealed distinctions. ET patients exhibited increased head tremor power and clinical scores during forward outstretched and lateral wing-beating arm positions, unlike DT patients. Coherence between head and upper limb tremor remained consistent. Tremor stability index showed no significant differences. Task-induced changes in head tremor could aid in distinguishing between ET and DT. Further research is needed to refine diagnostic approaches for head tremor."

    "abstract": "The hanger reflex is an automatic head rotation movement. When individuals wear a wire clothes hanger on the head to compress the frontotemporal region, the head spontaneously rotates toward the compressed side. The device to induce the hanger reflex was first developed for treating rotation-type cervical dystonia, followed by the development of a device for anterocollis-type cervical dystonia. However, there is a lack of comprehensive clinical reports on hanger reflex treatments, especially for anterocollis-type dystonia. We present the case of anterocollis that completely resolved after hanger reflex treatment without any other invasive treatment. In the treatment, patients wear the device on their heads for 30 min once per day. Hanger reflex treatment is an easy, simple, noninvasive, and inexpensiveness approach that may be considered the first choice for cervical dystonia."

    "abstract": "Mono-allelic DHDDS variants are associated with seizures, intellectual disability, and movement disorders. The age of onset and progression rates of symptoms vary greatly among patients, spanning from infancy to late adulthood. Yet, the reasons behind this clinical variability and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease have remained elusive. We investigated the age of onset and the progression of symptoms over time in 59 patients with heterozygous DHDDS variants, drawing from medical literature and incorporating five previously unreported cases from the FCDGC Natural History Study. Clinical symptoms typically emerged early in life. Ataxia, tremor, dystonia, and dyskinesia manifested slightly later in childhood. Global developmental delay usually presented as the initial symptom. We observed diverse rates of symptom accumulation over time: some patients exhibited the full spectrum of symptoms in early childhood, while others developed novel symptoms well into adulthood. Interestingly, neither the sex nor the underlying DHDDS variants correlated with the age of symptom onset or specific clinical symptoms. Additionally, we found that 19% of patients presented with autism spectrum disorder. This study offers insight into the age of symptom onset and the rate of symptom accumulation in patients with DHDDS variants. We found no correlation between the age of onset and progression of clinical symptoms with specific DHDDS variants or patient sex. Autism spectrum disorder is common in patients and warrants attention in clinical management."

    "abstract": "Lipoyl transferase 2 is involved in the biosynthesis of lipoate. Lipoate is the cofactor for the glycine cleavage system and four dehydrogenase enzymes. Biallelic variants in LIPT2 causing severe neonatal encephalopathy was first described in 2017. Clinical data were collected by retrospective chart review after obtaining consent from parents. The pathogenicity of these variants was further delineated using a yeast model. The YEp352-LIPT2 plasmid was used as a template to generate the two patient variants using QuickChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit. The patient was a 15-month-old female who presented at one month with dystonia, developmental delay, and feeding difficulties. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed cortical malformations including colpocephaly, polymicrogyria, and heterotopia. Patient had elevations in lactate (6.1 mmol/L) and glycine. Exome sequencing showed two variants of uncertain significance in trans in the LIPT2 gene: c.346 G>T and c.418C>T. Patient was started on lipoic acid, thiamine, and COQ10. Yeast complementation experiments indicate that both patient mutant variants result in diminished function versions of the LIPT2 protein. We report the fourth case of LIPT2-related disorder. Proband shared significant overlap with previous patients; however, there was a distinct movement disorder and brain malformations, which have not been previously described. Unlike most neurometabolic disorders where dystonia develops later after metabolic stroke in basal ganglia, LIPT2-related disorder seems unique due to early onset of dystonia due to energy deficit in the developing brain. Lipoic acid supplementation has not led to significant clinical improvement. Analyses in yeast indicate that novel variants are deleterious but have retained some functionality."

At high serum concentrations, manganese can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause neuronal damage. We report an interesting case of a middle-aged woman with underlying chronic liver disease presenting to the medical admissions unit with features suggestive of parkinsonism, dystonia, and cerebellar dysfunction that developed secondary to manganese deposition in the basal ganglia of the brain.

This rare neurological disease results from mutations in the PURA gene located on chromosome 5, leading to haploinsufficiency of the PUR-α protein. This protein is essential for early brain development and neuronal function. The patient, a seven-years-old boy, started showing dystonic hand movements at 14 days of age; at six, he had neurodevelopmental delay, generalized hypotonia, frequent episodes of apnea, and swallowing difficulties. Although other conditions were initially considered, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a whole exome sequencing revealed the pathogenic variant c.692T>C (p.Phe231Ser) in the exon 1 of the PURA gene, not previously reported in other patients. With this finding, we adopted a comprehensive management approach addressing the patient’s characteristics and alterations. Since the PURA syndrome is not on the list of orphan/rare diseases recognized by the Colombian Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, we hope our report will contribute to its official recognition. The case shows the importance of considering rare diagnoses in patients with uncommon neurological symptoms, underlining the usefulness of genomic sequencing in diagnosis and the need for collaboration to optimize healthcare for patients with PURA syndrome and similar diseases."

We report the occurrence of focal dystonia with uncontrolled hyperglycemia but no focal abnormalities on MRI. On admission, the patient's blood glucose was 861, and she claimed to have never missed insulin dosage. A physical exam revealed no cranial nerve abnormalities and weakness in the right upper extremity with no sensory involvement. Reflexes were 1-2+ in all extremities with down-going toes. The abnormal movements were triggered by overhead abduction of the right arm. Symptoms improved after a week with blood glucose control, as well as benzodiazepines and anticholinergics. This specific case emphasizes the occurrence of uncontrolled hyperglycemia causing movement disorders that can have normal imaging findings. Understanding the complex presentation of patients with HIIM is pivotal for effective patient diagnosis and treatment."

    "abstract": "Several surgical techniques have been used to treat cervical dystonia (CD), however, to date, the optimal surgical technique for CD remains controversial. We therefore conducted the first network meta-analysis to compare different surgical strategies for CD to inform clinical practice. Electronic databases were searched for surgical strategies for treating CD. The primary outcome was improvement in total Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) score. Subgroup analysis was performed to compare short-term (< 1 year) and long-term (≥ 1 year) outcomes. Safety outcomes included surgery-related adverse events (AEs). A total of 55 trials with 2032 patients employing five surgical strategies were identified, including globus pallidus internus (GPi)/subthalamic nucleus (STN)-deep brain stimulation (DBS), selective peripheral denervation (SPD), microvascular decompression (MVD) and pallidotomy. All strategies led to significant improvement in total TWSTRS score (mean improvement range 18.65-28.22). GPi-DBS showed significantly greater enhancement than SPD for the whole dataset (mean difference [MD] 7.03, 95% credible interval [Crl] 1.53-12.56), while both GPi-DBS (MD 8.05, 95% Crl 2.35-13.80) and STN-DBS (MD 10.71, 95% Crl 2.22-19.20) exhibited more long-term improvement than SPD. Regarding safety outcomes, GPi/STN-DBS and MVD were associated with fewer surgery-related AEs than SPD (ln odds ratio range -1.68 to -1.41). We conclude that DBS should be the preferred surgical option for CD, and the STN is a promising alternative target choice due to its comparable efficacy with the GPi. However, more direct evidence is still required."

    "abstract": "Mutations in the gene encoding the alpha3 Na+/K+-ATPase isoform (ATP1A3) lead to movement disorders that manifest with dystonia, a common neurological symptom with many different origins, but for which the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We have generated an ATP1A3 mutant mouse that displays motor impairments and a hyperexcitable motor phenotype compatible with dystonia. We show that neurons harbouring this mutation are compromised in their ability to extrude raised levels of intracellular sodium, highlighting a profound deficit in neuronal sodium homeostasis. We show that the spinal motor network in ATP1A3 mutant mice has a reduced responsiveness to activity-dependent rises in intracellular sodium and that this is accompanied by loss of the Na+/K+-ATPase-mediated afterhyperpolarization in motor neurons. Taken together, our data support that the alpha3 Na+/K+-ATPase is important for cellular and spinal motor network homeostasis. These insights suggest that it may be useful to consider ways to compensate for this loss of a critical afterhyperpolarization-dependent control of neuronal excitability when developing future therapies for dystonia."

While there have been case studies on yips-affected baseballers (YBBs), there has been no comprehensive demographic profile of YBBs, and contributing factors are only partially understood. We aimed to describe youth YBBs' demographic characteristics and explore contributing factors to yips symptoms. We analyzed a self-report questionnaire administered to 285 youth baseballers to investigate yips symptoms and identify both players' psychological characteristics and trigger factors for yips. We defined YBBs as players who exhibited symptoms of involuntary muscle contractions, characterized by jerks, tremors, or freezing during planned movements that resulted in unpredictability when throwing a baseball. Individuals without these symptoms were categorized as non-yips-affected baseballers (NBBs). In our total sample, there was a YBB prevalence of 10.2% with a significantly higher occurrence among pitchers than among players in other positions (<i>p</i> < .05). Additionally, YBBs showed a significantly higher incidence of self-reported anxiety during throwing compared to NBBs (<i>p</i> < .001), and a significantly greater proportion of YBBs than NBBs struggled particularly with gentle or light motion throws (<i>p</i> < .001), especially at short distances (75.0% of the YBBs). Furthermore, 62.1% of YBBs faced difficulties in appropriately releasing the ball. Thus, we found approximately one in 10 youth baseballers experienced yips symptoms that were influenced by throwing distance and high-pressure situations. Our descriptive study advances an understanding of yips-related performance problems in youth baseballers."

An ITB test dose is indicated in patients who have mixed tone, when the family remains unconvinced, or when insurance companies require it. Test doses are typically delivered by lumbar puncture; however, lumbar puncture in patients with heterotopic ossification of the lumbar vertebrae after a previous spinal fusion is not possible. To our knowledge, we present the first technical note describing a heterotopic osteotomy to access the subarachnoid space for a complex ITB test dose in a pediatric patient with a spinal fusion. We present a 14-year-old woman with spastic, dystonic quadriplegic cerebral palsy, neuromuscular scoliosis, and previous T3-pelvis posterior spinal fusion. She continued to have significant dystonia and spasticity despite maximal medical management and was offered ITB therapy. A complex ITB test dose through heterotopic osteotomy was performed with excellent clinical results, and the patient will ultimately receive an ITB pump. Heterotopic ossification following spinal fusion is not a contraindication to an ITB test dose. A heterotopic osteotomy is a feasible surgical approach to administer an ITB test dose in these pediatric patients."

Extra-cerebellar manifestations, including external ophthalmoplegia, dystonia, Parkinsonism, and peripheral neuropathy, are predominantly present in SCA3 cases. Here, we report a case of SCA3 presenting with a split hand and minipolymyoclonus. A 73-year-old female patient presented with a 5-year history of ataxic gait. Neurological examination revealed cerebellar ataxia and minipolymyoclonus in the digits on both sides and muscle atrophy in the right hand, consistent with the split hand pattern. Electrodiagnostic studies demonstrated decreased amplitude of compound muscle action potentials and neurogenic motor unit potentials, indicating lower motor neuron involvement. Our patient's case indicated a split hand and minipolymyoclonus in SCA3. Clinicians should consider these extra-cerebellar manifestations in patients with SCA3. Although neither split hand nor minipolymyoclonus are likely to directly result in a specific etiological diagnosis, a common pathophysiological mechanism for both may be lower motor neuron involvement. This extracerebellar manifestation contributes to narrowing down the diagnostic possibilities for cases presenting with progressive cerebellar ataxia."

A systematic review was conducted on March 1, 2023, in 6 databases using relevant keywords. Bias assessment was performed using JBI Critical Appraisal Tools. Studies were included if they described a prenatal exposure to an inhalant; focused on maternal, fetal, neonatal, or early childhood outcomes; and were published as peer-reviewed reports in English. The search yielded 1101 unique references with 22 studies meeting eligibility criteria and representing 205 pregnancies and 171 infants.The most common symptom of inhalant use reported in pregnant people was altered mentation, followed by renal tubular acidosis (RTA) reported with toluene use. Most common fetal outcomes included fetal growth restriction and preterm delivery (<37 weeks), while neonatal outcomes were withdrawal symptoms, such as jitteriness, trouble feeding, and dystonia. Child outcomes included developmental delays, including cognitive and speech impairments, and postnatal growth restriction, including microcephaly. Perinatal, fetal, and child outcomes associated with inhalant use among pregnant individuals are largely based on case reports and series.

Assessment of tremor as regular or irregular in context of its oscillation trajectory, frequency, and amplitude is a major clinical challenge and can confound the diagnosis of CD. The misdiagnosis may lead to therapeutic failures, poor quality of life, and poor utilization of medical and financial resources. We analyzed the largest cohort of CD patients (<i>n</i> = 3117) available to date, collected from 37 movement disorder centers in North America, Europe, and Asia. We used machine learning to determine what clinical features from clinician reports predicted the presence of tremor as well as its regular or irregular appearance. Out of 3,117 CD patients, 1,367 had neck tremor. The neck tremor was interpreted as irregular in 1,022, regular in 345, and mixed (both irregular and regular) in 442. A feature importance analysis determined that greater severity of CD, longer disease duration, and older age, in descending order, predicted the presence of neck tremor. The probability of neck tremor was reduced if the dystonia affected other body parts in addition to the neck. We also found a significantly heightened risk for developing neck tremor in women. An additional feature importance analysis indicated that increased severity of dystonia affecting other body parts, severity of CD, and prolonged disease duration was associated with a lower likelihood of regular neck tremor while increased age predicted a higher likelihood. Machine learning recognized the most relevant clinical features that can predict concurrent neck tremor and its irregularity in a large multi-center dystonia cohort. These results may facilitate a more accurate description of neck tremor and improved care path in CD."

    "abstract": "Variants in the PRKRA gene, which encodes PACT, cause the early-onset primary dystonia DYT-PRKRA, a movement disorder associated with disruption of coordinated muscle movements. PACT and its murine homolog RAX activate protein kinase R (PKR; also known as EIF2AK2) by a direct interaction in response to cellular stressors to mediate phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). Mice homozygous for a naturally arisen, recessively inherited frameshift mutation, Prkralear-5J, exhibit progressive dystonia. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical and developmental consequences of the Prkralear-5J mutation. Our results indicated that the truncated PACT/RAX protein retains its ability to interact with PKR but inhibits PKR activation. Mice homozygous for the mutation showed abnormalities in cerebellar development as well as a severe lack of dendritic arborization of Purkinje neurons. Additionally, reduced eIF2α phosphorylation was noted in the cerebellum and Purkinje neurons of the homozygous Prkralear-5J mice. These findings indicate that PACT/RAX-mediated regulation of PKR activity and eIF2α phosphorylation plays a role in cerebellar development and contributes to the dystonia phenotype resulting from the Prkralear-5J mutation."

    "title": "Targeting Myeloperoxidase to Reduce Neuroinflammation in X-Linked Dystonia Parkinsonism.",
    "abstract": "Although the genetic locus of X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP), a neurodegenerative disease endemic in the Philippines, is well-characterized, the exact mechanisms leading to neuronal loss are not yet fully understood. Recently, we demonstrated an increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in XDP postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC), suggesting a role for inflammation in XDP pathogenesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibiting MPO could provide a therapeutic strategy for XDP. MPO activity was measured by using an MPO-activatable fluorescent agent (MAFA) in human postmortem PFC. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and MPO activity were measured in XDP-derived fibroblasts and SH-SY5Y cells following MPO inhibition. MPO activity was significantly increased in XDP PFC. Additionally, treatment of cell lines with postmortem XDP PFC resulted in a significant increase in ROS levels. To determine whether increases in MPO activity caused increases in ROS, MPO content was immunodepleted from XDP PFC, which resulted in a significant decrease in ROS in SH-SY5Y cells. Consistently, the treatment with verdiperstat, a potent and selective MPO inhibitor, significantly decreased ROS in both XDP-derived fibroblasts and XDP PFC-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Collectively, our results suggest that MPO inhibition mitigates oxidative stress and may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for XDP treatment."

    "abstract": "To investigate the plastic effects of parieto-motor (PAR-MOT) cortico-cortical paired associative paired stimulation (cc-PAS) in patients with two forms of focal dystonia, writer's cramp and cervical dystonia, compared to healthy volunteers (HVs). We used cc-PAS to induce associative plasticity using repeated time-locked paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses over the parietal and motor cortices in 16 patients with writer's cramp (WC), 13 patients with cervical dystonia (CD), and 23 healthy volunteers. We measured parieto-motor corticocortical connectivity using posterior parietal cortex (PPC) to primary motor cortex (M1) facilitation and input-output curves (IOC) of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) before and after PAR-MOT cc-PAS. The PAR-MOT cc-PAS consisted of 100 pairs of TMS pulses every 5 s, with the conditioning pulse applied to the left angular gyrus in the intraparietal sulcus and the test pulse applied to the M1 hotspot of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. The cc-PAS increased the area under the IOC by increasing its maximum level in patients with WC but not in patients with CD or healthy volunteers. The cc-PAS had no significant effect on other IOC parameters. There were no significant differences in PPC to M1 facilitation changes after PAR-MOT cc-PAS among all groups. This study suggests that PAR-MOT cc-PAS abnormally increases M1 excitability in patients with WC but not in those with CD. Additionally, this increased plastic response in patients with WC does not appear to be directly linked to PPC to M1 corticocortical connectivity."

We conducted a case-control exploratory study of 15 visits over 12 weeks in the non-affected hand of a 4-finger sequence of 8 key presses in eight patients with FHD compared with eight age- and sex-matched, healthy volunteers (HVs). We studied the behavioral data and the physiological changes of the brain, including motor cortical excitability and cortical oscillations. There was no significant difference in the time to reach 100 % accuracy between FHD and HV during the 80-day follow-up period. There was a statistically significant difference in the accuracy of sequential finger movement tasks between patients with FHD compared with HVs over 12 weeks, but post-hoc analysis with multiple comparion correction did not show difference. There were no significant differences in recruitment curve changes and task-related power changes of alpha and beta bands. Over 12 weeks, FHD have motor learning capacity comparable to HVs and do not show pathophysiological abnormalities. Further studies would be valuable with more patients, more extended periods of practice, and more detailed electrophysiological explorations."

We aimed to confirm the efficacy and safety of FUS pallidothalamic tractotomy for cervical dystonia. This was a prospective, open-label, non-controlled pilot study. The primary outcome was defined as a change in the score for the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) from baseline to 6 months after FUS pallidothalamic tractotomy. The secondary outcomes included a change in the neck scale for the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS), mood scales including Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Apathy Evaluating Scale (AES), and adverse events. Patients were assessed for TWSTRS, BFMDRS, and adverse events at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after treatment. BDI, BAI, and AES were assessed at baseline and 6 months after treatment. Ten patients were enrolled in this study. The mean age of onset of dystonia was 51.6 ± 10.2 years. The TWSTRS at 6 months (29.9 ± 16.0, range: 3-55) was significantly improved by 43.4% (P < 0.001) from baseline. The BFMDRS-Neck scales at 6 months (4.2 ± 2.8) were significantly improved by 38.2% (P < 0.001) from baseline. The BDI, BAI, and AES at 6 months were improved by 23.2%, 10.9%, and 30.3%, respectively from baseline. Reduced hand dexterity in three patients and weight gain in two patients were confirmed at the last evaluation.

    "abstract": "Regular and long-term injections of botulinum toxin (BoNT) are considered the first line therapy for essential blepharospasm (BEB), but no data exists on the long-term effect of this therapy on depressive symptoms and quality of life. This study aims to prospectively evaluate the long-term effects of BoNT therapy on depressive symptoms as well as on daily activities, emotional well-being and quality of life using validated questionnaires (BEB-scale, Beck`s Depression Inventory (BDI)). 86 patients diagnosed with BEB were followed up for a median of 4 years. Clinical symptoms improved significantly after BoNT-injections. Everyday activities and subjective assessment of the overall situation improved gradually under long-term BoNT therapy. Significant correlations (p < 0.0001; r-values between 0.498 and 0.706) were found between the BDI and items of the BEB-scale. No significant antidepressive effect of long-term BoNT therapy was found with a low median BDI total score (5/max. 63), but up to 31.3% of BEB patients had a BDI score ≥ 11, indicating clinically relevant depressive symptoms. Of these, 65.4% had no known history of depression. Although, several studies reported an antidepressant effect of botulinum toxin injections in patients with major depression, this effect does not seem to be present in patients with BEB despite clinical improvement of symptoms. A high prevalence of previously undetected depressive symptoms was found in BEB patients. As this may influence BoNT therapy success, identifying potential depressive symptoms at the time of BEB diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment seems important."

    "abstract": "Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary neurodegenerative disorder, usually caused by mutations in the pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) gene. We report a young female patient with atypical PKAN, harboring a novel heterozygous PANK2 mutation, diagnosed through clinical imaging and genetic analysis. The patient presented with dystonia and motor dysfunction after onset, but early brain MRI showed normal findings. Due to progressive symptom deterioration, her MRI was reevaluated and the characteristic \"eye of the tiger\" sign was identified. Further genetic testing revealed that she was a carrier of two heterozygous PANK2 mutations, one being a known pathogenic variant and the other unknown. Given the patient's clinical presentation, progressive symptoms, and poor response to medication, we boldly attempted asymmetric bilateral deep brain stimulation (abDBS). Postoperative outcomes showed significant symptom improvement. This study suggests that early brain MRI in PKAN patients may not exhibit typical radiological features, leading to potential diagnostic omissions. Furthermore, it highlights the potential therapeutic effect of abDBS in atypical PKAN, particularly in patients with novel heterozygous PANK2 mutations. Asymmetric bilateral deep brain stimulation may represent a promising treatment approach."

    "abstract": "This article examines the surgical techniques used for the treatment of neuralgia and dystonia in Greece during the late 19th to the middle of the twentieth century. It emphasizes on the Greek contribution to neurosurgery. The aim of this study is achieved by examining unpublished archives as well as historical documents collected from both the National Library of Greece and the Library of the Hellenic Parliament. Greek medicine of the nineteenth century emerged through the practice of Greek physicians who have studied abroad. Many important figures on surgery, like Theodoros Aretaios, Nikolaos Taptas and Konstantinos Mermigas attempted myotomies, neurectomies, trasoraphies, and injections according the European protocols, though introducing some variants on well established procedures. This article also refers to the early stereotactic neurosurgery in Greece, especially in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease and extrapyramidal syndromes by Aggelos Karakalos, ultimately contributing toward a better understanding of the evolution of Greek surgery, highlighting its pivotal role in the international development of neurosurgical techniques. Greek school of surgery avoided brutal operations like trephination and proved worthy among most advanced school of the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. Neuralgias and dystonias constituted for the physicians of the past a riddle connected with the mystery of the central and peripheral neural system. Surgical procedures were proposed, finding ways of implication mainly in the cases of neuralgias. Gradually drug administration of simple substances like alcohol demonstrated some results. The study of Greek medical archives dated back to 19<sup>th</sup> and early twentieth century allow us to have a comprehensive idea about the therapeutical approaches and especially the operative ones used by the Greek physicians of the time to fight dystonias and neuralgias unveiling their capabilities and theoretical medical knowledge."

No controlled study has evaluated the effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on dystonia related to WD. This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of DBS on dystonia related to WD. A meta-analysis of an N-of-1 prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter DBS study was conducted at two French WD reference centers. Main inclusion criteria were patients with WD, stabilized for at least 6 months with significant disability due to dystonia despite optimized medical treatment. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) was targeted for bradykinetic patients with tonic dystonia, and the internal globus pallidus (GPi) was chosen for patients with hyperkinetic dystonia. Each patient underwent two periods of DBS \"on\" and two periods of DBS \"off,\" each lasting 4 months. The order of stimulation conditions was randomized. The primary outcome was the change in the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure Performance (COPM-P) and Satisfaction scores after each 4-month period. Secondary outcomes were changes in the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) severity and disability scores and Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) scores. Between 12 May 2016 and 7 October 2022, three patients were included. Two patients received bilateral GPi DBS, and one received bilateral STN DBS. There was no change of COPM-P (p = 0.956), BFMDRS, and UWDRS scores. No serious adverse events were reported. STN or GPi DBS are ineffective on dystonia related to WD."

The routine panel suggests both dengue and typhoid as potential culprits. Consequently, during the ward stay, the patient developed involuntary movements in bilateral upper limbs, lower limbs, and face. Co-infection with both dengue and typhoid is seldom seen, with an increasing number of cases in the recent few years. These situations can sometimes put the treating physician in a difficult situation with respect to management.

    "abstract": "Oculogyric crisis (OGC) is an acute dystonic reaction characterized by involuntary upward deviation of the eyes, often linked to the use of antipsychotic medications. While commonly associated with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) due to their higher propensity to cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), OGC remains a rare but documented occurrence with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). SGAs, including olanzapine, are generally preferred in clinical practice due to their reduced risk of EPS; however, they are not completely devoid of such adverse effects. The emergence of OGC in the context of SGAs, particularly in unique clinical scenarios, highlights the importance of awareness and careful management of potential adverse effects in clinical practice. This case report presents a rare instance of OGC in a 25-year-old postpartum woman following an independent reduction in her olanzapine dosage, a medication usually associated with a low risk of dystonia. The patient, with no previous psychiatric history, had been treated with olanzapine for postpartum depression with psychotic features and demonstrated stability. The onset of OGC, occurring three months after the initiation of olanzapine and precipitated by stressors such as interpersonal conflicts and high-pressure situations, underscores the critical need for comprehensive patient education on the dangers of unsupervised medication adjustments. It also highlights the importance of vigilant monitoring, particularly in vulnerable populations, such as postpartum patients. This case underscores the necessity for individualized treatment approaches and highlights the rarity and clinical significance of OGC in patients on SGAs, contributing to the understanding of atypical presentations associated with these medications."

The aim of the present study was to analyse the improvement in dystonic contractions in patients with dystonia following the use of a Hegab temporomandibular joint splint (HTS). The Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Movement Scale (DMS) and Disability Scale were used in the current study to evaluate dystonia. An HTS with a thickness ranging from 4 to 6 mm was used to treat the patients enrolled in the study. The final sample comprised 14 patients (10 female and four male) with mean (range) ages of 35.64 (18 to 55) years. Pre-treatment DMS ranged from 6.5 to 57 mean (SD) 18.21 (13.38). At the end of the study, DMS ranged from 0 to 15 mean (SD) 3.14 (3.86). Statistical analysis of the differences between pre-treatment and post-treatment DMS showed a significant decrease in DMS at the end of the treatment period (p = 0.0001). Regarding the disability scale, pre-treatment disability scale ranged from 7 to 18 mean (SD) 9.46 (3.02). At the end of the study, DMS ranged from 0 to 3 mean (SD) 1.46 (1.13). There was a statistically highly significant decrease in the Disability Scale at the end of the treatment period (p value ≤ 0.0001). This study suggests that the HTS can be considered an effective treatment modality for dystonia, as it significantly decreases both the DMS and the Disability scale."

    "abstract": "The first-line management of cervical dystonia (CD) symptoms is intramuscular injection of botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA). However, a comparison of safety among BoNTAs is difficult because, per regulatory authorities, units of BoNTA activity are not interchangeable. Dysphagia and muscle weakness are widely considered two key adverse events to monitor closely in the treatment of CD. This integrated analysis compared the safety of BoNTAs approved for CD in the US by evaluating relationships between the incidence of dysphagia and muscle weakness in prescribing information and the core neurotoxin content. Coefficients The coefficients of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) and trendlines were estimated via regression-based lines of best fit. Adverse drug reaction (ADR) rates were strongly correlated with core neurotoxin amounts for conventional BoNTAs (slope coefficients: dysphagia = 0.048, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.74; muscle weakness = 0.096, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.82). The published ADR rates at approved doses for conventional BoNTAs were higher compared with DaxibotulinumtoxinA (DAXI; DAXXIFY<sup>®</sup>, Revance Therapeutics, Inc., Nashville, TN, USA) by core neurotoxin content. The use of a core neurotoxin amount was found to be an effective method for comparing the safety of BoNTA products. Current clinical trials suggest that DAXI, a novel BoNTA formulation, provides a potentially wider safety margin compared with other approved BoNTAs for CD. The lower amount of core neurotoxin administered at approved doses compared with conventional BoNTAs may explain low on-target ADRs like muscle weakness, whereas reduced diffusion from the injection site is thought to be responsible for low off-target ADRs like dysphagia."

    "abstract": "Cervical dystonia is widely understood to benefit from botulinum toxin injections. The injection practices may be influenced by specific factors, including the method of injection. Three main guidance methods can be used: palpation of anatomical landmarks, ultrasound, and electromyography. We investigated how target muscles and doses of botulinum toxin were modified after the transition from surface anatomy (non-guided) to ultrasound (US-guided), in patients with cervical dystonia. We also determined the long-term dose trend. We studied a group of 82 patients, who received non-guided injections (median: 16.5 cycles/5.1 years) followed by US-guided injections (median: 12.0 cycles/3.8 years). More muscles, and especially deep muscles, were injected during the US-guided period. The total dose and number of injected muscles were higher when US guidance was used, but the mean dose per muscle was lower. Over the long term, the total dose stabilized, and the mean dose per muscle decreased during the US-guided period. According to our results, the guidance method has a strong impact on the botulinum toxin injection strategy in cervical dystonia (target muscles and dose). Also, the treatment appeared more stable when using US guidance; this could be explained by the good precision of such injections."

    "abstract": "Dystonia arises with cerebellar dysfunction, which plays a key role in the emergence of multiple pathophysiological deficits that range from abnormal movements and postures to disrupted sleep. Current therapeutic interventions typically do not simultaneously address both the motor and non-motor symptoms of dystonia, underscoring the necessity for a multi-functional therapeutic strategy. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effectively used to reduce motor symptoms in dystonia, with existing parallel evidence arguing for its potential to correct sleep disturbances. However, the simultaneous efficacy of DBS for improving sleep and motor dysfunction, specifically by targeting the cerebellum, remains underexplored. Here, we test the effect of cerebellar DBS in two genetic mouse models with dystonia that exhibit sleep defects-Ptf1a<sup>Cre</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fx/fx</sup> and Pdx1<sup>Cre</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fx/fx</sup>-which have overlapping cerebellar circuit miswiring defects but differing severity in motor phenotypes. By targeting DBS to the fiber tracts located between the cerebellar fastigial and the interposed nuclei (FN ​+ ​INT-DBS), we modulated sleep dysfunction by enhancing sleep quality and timing. This DBS paradigm improved wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep in both mutants. Additionally, the latency to reach REM sleep, a deficit observed in human dystonia patients, was reduced in both models. Cerebellar DBS also induced alterations in the electrocorticogram (ECoG) patterns that define sleep states. As expected, DBS reduced the severe dystonic twisting motor symptoms that are observed in the Ptf1a<sup>Cre</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fx/fx</sup> mice. These findings highlight the potential for using cerebellar DBS to simultaneously improve sleep and reduce motor dysfunction in dystonia and uncover its potential as a dual-effect in vivo therapeutic strategy."

The aim was to assess the prevalence and interrelationship between pain-modulating factors and pain-related determinants of functional impairment and quality of life in CD. We analyzed pain-aggravating and pain-relieving external factors, the degree of pain-related functional impact on routine activities, and the relationship between these and pain severity, using cross-sectional data collected using the Pain in Dystonia Scale (PIDS) from 85 participants with CD. Pairwise correlation analyses and age- and sex-adjusted linear regression models estimated the relationship between pain-modulating factors and pain severity, and the impact of pain severity, dystonia severity, and psychiatric symptoms on pain-related functional impairment and disease-specific quality of life (measured using the Craniocervical Dystonia Questionnaire-24). Stress and prolonged fixed position were the most frequent and impacting pain triggers, with women reporting larger impact. The average impact of pain-relieving factors was lower than that of pain triggers. Physical exercise and social gatherings were the most impacted activities by pain in CD. The intensity of external modulating factors was a predictor of pain severity. Severity of pain, CD, and psychiatric symptoms independently predicted pain-related functional impairment, whereas quality of life was predicted by pain severity, pain-related functional impairment, and psychiatric symptom severity, but not dystonia severity. The PIDS provides insight into external modulation and functional impact of pain in CD. The pattern of external modulation of pain in CD is in line with a multifactorial modulation and complex physiology."

    "abstract": "Preterm birth is a common cause of dystonia. Though dystonia is often associated with striatal dysfunction after neonatal brain injury, cortical dysfunction may best predict dystonia following preterm birth. Furthermore, abnormal sensorimotor cortex inhibition is associated with genetic and idiopathic dystonias. To investigate cortical dysfunction and dystonia following preterm birth, we developed a new model of preterm birth in mice. We induced preterm birth in C57BL/6J mice at embryonic day 18.3, ~24 h early. Leg adduction variability and amplitude, metrics we have shown distinguish between dystonia from spasticity during gait in people with CP, were quantified from gait videos of mice. Parvalbumin-positive interneurons, the largest population of cortical inhibitory interneurons, were quantified in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum. Mice born preterm demonstrate increased leg adduction amplitude and variability during gait, suggestive of clinically observed dystonic gait features. Mice born preterm also demonstrate fewer parvalbumin-positive interneurons and reduced parvalbumin immunoreactivity in the sensorimotor cortex, but not the striatum, suggesting dysfunction of cortical inhibition. These data may suggest an association between cortical dysfunction and dystonic gait features following preterm birth. We propose that our novel mouse model of preterm birth can be used to study this association. Mouse models of true preterm birth are valuable for studying clinical complications of prematurity. Mice born preterm demonstrate increased leg adduction amplitude and variability during gait, suggestive of clinically observed dystonic gait features. Mice born preterm demonstrate fewer parvalbumin-positive interneurons and reduced parvalbumin immunoreactivity in the sensorimotor cortex, suggesting dysfunction of cortical inhibition. Mice born preterm do not demonstrate changes in parvalbumin immunoreactivity in the striatum. Cortical dysfunction may be associated with dystonic gait features following preterm birth."

    "abstract": "Intraventricular baclofen has been reported as an alternative to intrathecal baclofen for managing refractory spasticity and dystonia in some circumstances. In this report, we described a frame-based stereotactic approach for precisely positioning of the infusion catheter into the third ventricle. High resolution contrast-enhanced anatomical MR sequences was acquired prior to surgery for pre-planning. Catheter trajectory was planned to pass from the lateral ventricle to the third ventricle through the Foramen of Monro. The surgical procedure was adapted from the frame-based deep brain stimulation surgery. The Touch-Loc kit (SceneRay, China) was used to temporarily secure the catheter in place during the surgery. From July 2022 to December 2022, three patients suffering from intractable spasticity and/or secondary dystonia received IVB successfully using the described technique. No severe adverse events, including death, intracranial hemorrhage, infection, catheter migration or fracture, were documented at the last follow-up (range: 12‒24 months). Transient side effects included mild nausea following the initiation of infusion or the increase in infusion rate. All three patients responded to the IVB. The described frame-based stereotactic technique for IVB catheter implant is feasible and could be quickly mastered by neurosurgeons in related fields. Larger prospective cohorts with longer follow-up periods are necessary to further evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of this procedure."

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), essential tremors, dystonia, and treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of DBS on Body Mass Index (BMI). Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, data from 49 studies were reviewed, with 46 studies specifically focusing on BMI and DBS. These studies involved 1,478 participants, predominantly PD patients, with an average age of 58.82 years. The primary DBS implantation site was the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Over six months, the mean BMI increased from 25.69 to 27.41, despite a reduction in daily energy intake from 1992 to 1873 kJ. While the findings suggest a correlation between DBS and weight gain, the study has limitations. The sample largely comprised PD patients (91%), preventing analysis of other subtypes. Additionally, most studies focused on the STN, limiting comparisons with other targets like the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Inconsistencies in assessing daily energy intake and food consumption further complicate the results. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) in future research could address these gaps. For example, machine learning algorithms, such as those used by Oliveira et al., can predict post-DBS weight changes based on pre-surgical BMI and demographic factors. Similarly, AI-driven models like CLOVER-DBS can optimize DBS settings for improved motor control in PD patients. In conclusion, DBS affects BMI, and AI has the potential to enhance the precision of future studies."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the impacts of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) on both motor and nonmotor symptoms in individuals with Meige syndrome, as well as further investigates prognostic factors for long-term postoperative outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed a consecutive cohort of patients with intractable Meige syndrome who underwent STN-DBS at our center from January 2016 to July 2023. Motor function, quality of life, neuropsychological status, and mood state were evaluated with standardized scales at baseline and every 3 to 6 months thereafter. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to determine independent risk factors that affect long-term motor function after STN-DBS. Fifty-five patients were ultimately analyzed with a mean follow-up of 62.1 ± 25.7 months. At the final postoperative assessment, movement and disability scores of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale demonstrated improvements of 61% ( P < .001) and 57% ( P < .001), respectively. Postoperative scores on the 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey showed significant improvement from baseline. Global cognitive function and neuropsychological status remained stable during continuous neurostimulation. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that longer disease duration (standardized β coefficient = -0.294, 95% CI -0.039 to -0.007, P = .006), older age at surgery (standardized β coefficient = -0.382, 95% CI -0.014 to -0.004, P = .001), and smaller volume of tissue activated within the sensorimotor subregion of STN (standardized β coefficient = 0.309, 95% CI 0.001-0.004, P = .004) were independently correlated with poorer long-term motor performance. Bilateral STN-DBS is an effective, safe, and promising treatment option for Meige syndrome, which can improve motor function and quality of life without cognitive and mood side effects. Early diagnosis, prompt intervention, and accurate lead placement in the dorsolateral STN are crucial to optimize long-term therapeutic outcomes."

    "abstract": "A 23-year-old woman with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) presented with medication-refractory generalized dystonia and an associated gait impairment. Bilateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) can be an effective treatment for dystonia. However, outcomes for PKAN DBS have been variable and there are no standardized criteria for patient selection. Bilateral GPi DBS implantation resulted in improvement in dystonia and gait. The benefit has persisted over one year after implantation. PKAN is a rare neurodegenerative disorder and evidence supporting the use of PKAN DBS has been largely limited to case reports and case series. Consequently, there is a paucity of long-term data, especially on gait-related outcomes. The clinical characteristics of dystonia that respond to DBS tend to respond in PKAN. Clinicians counselling patients about the effects of DBS for PKAN should thoughtfully discuss gait and postural instability as important aspects to consider, especially as the disease will progress post-DBS."

    "abstract": "The etiology and pathophysiology of idiopathic blepharospasm (BP) are still largely unknown. It has been hypothesized that BP is the consequence of a dysfunction of the basal ganglia loop, although cortical areas, cerebellum, and other brainstem structures may be involved. There is some evidence that the superior colliculus (SC), a sensorimotor brainstem structure, is involved in another adult-onset focal dystonia, the cervical dystonia. To date, there is no data concerning the implication of the SC in BP. Our study aims to investigate the role of the SC in people with idiopathic BP compared to controls using fMRI and a visual stimulation paradigm based on luminance contrast variations. People with idiopathic BP and controls underwent brain fMRI using a standardized protocol, allowing modulation of visual activity in the SC, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and the primary visual cortex (V1), at increasing luminance levels (1 %, 3 %, 5 %, 9 %). Ten BP women and ten sex- and age-matched controls were enrolled. Compared to controls, the BP group showed no modulation of visual responses at all luminance levels (p < 0.05) in both SC and LGN. In BP, BOLD responses in V1 were significantly lower at 5 % (p = 0.001), and 9 % (p = 0.002) luminance level. Our findings support the concept of SC and LGN dysfunction in idiopathic BP. Brain fMRI, targeting these sub-cortical visual structures, could play a future important role both as a biomarker and in our understanding of the pathophysiology of adult-onset focal dystonias."

    "abstract": "PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN) comprises three diseases with overlapping features: infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD), atypical neuroaxonal dystrophy (atypical NAD), and PLA2G6-related dystonia-parkinsonism. INAD is an early onset disease characterized by progressive loss of vision, muscular control, and mental skills. The prevalence of PLA2G6-associated diseases has not been previously calculated. To provide the most accurate prevalence estimate, we utilized two independent approaches: database-based approach which included collecting variants from ClinVar, Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) and high confidence predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) from gnomAD (Rare Genomes Project Genetic Prevalence Estimator; GeniE), and literature-based approach which gathered variants through Mastermind Genomic Search Engine (Genomenon, Inc). Genetic prevalence of PLAN was calculated based on allele frequencies from gnomAD, assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In the PLA2G6 gene, our analysis found 122 pathogenic, 82 VUS, and 15 variants with conflicting interpretations (pathogenic vs VUS) between two approaches. Allele frequency was available for 58 pathogenic, 42 VUS, and 15 conflicting variants in gnomAD database. If pathogenic and/or conflicting variants are included, the overall genetic prevalence was estimated to be between 1 in 987,267 to 1 in 1,570,079 pregnancies, with the highest genetic prevalence in African/African-American (1 in 421,960 to 1 in 365,197) and East-Asian (1 in 683,978 to 1 in 190,771) populations. Our estimates highlight the significant underdiagnosis of PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration and underscores the need for increased awareness and diagnostic efforts. Furthermore, our study revealed a higher carrier frequency of PLA2G6 variants in African and Asian populations, stressing the importance of expanded genetic sequencing in non-European populations to ensure accurate and comprehensive diagnosis. Future research should focus on confirming our findings and implementing expanded sequencing strategies to facilitate maximal and accurate diagnosis, particularly in non-European populations."

However, there are limited studies that investigate whether there is metal accumulation and microstructure changes in DGN of patients with WD with normal-appearing routine MRI. This study aimed to evaluate multiparametric changes in DGN of WD and whether the findings correlate with clinical severity in patients with WD. The study enrolled 28 patients with WD (19 with neurologic symptoms) and 25 controls. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and magnetic susceptibility in globus pallidus, pontine tegmentum, dentate nucleus, red nucleus, head of caudate nucleus, putamen, substantia nigra, and thalamus were extracted. Correlations between imaging data and the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) neurologic subitems were explored. FA, MD, and susceptibility values were higher in multiple DGN of patients with WD than controls (<i>P</i> < .05). Patients with WD without abnormal signals in DGN on routine MRI also had higher FA, MD, and susceptibility values than controls (<i>P</i> < .017). We found that UWDRS neurologic subscores correlated with FA and susceptibility values of DGN (<i>P</i> < .05). In addition, we also found that FA and susceptibility values in specific structures correlated with specific neurologic symptoms of WD (ie, tremor, parkinsonism, dysarthria, dystonia, and ataxia) (<i>P</i> < .05). Patients with WD have increased FA, MD, and susceptibility values even before the lesion is morphologically apparent on routine MRI. The increased FA and susceptibility values correlate with clinical severity of WD."

We reported twenty-seven (fourteen males and thirteen females) pediatric patients with KMT2B variants identified via next-generation sequencing from a single Chinese center. Moreover, transcriptomics and proteomics assays were performed on fibroblasts from patients with different genotypes to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms involved. Twenty-six patients had dystonia including generalized dystonia (n = 19), multifocal dystonia (n = 6), and segmental dystonia (n = 1), and one patient had nondystonic severe-developmental delay (DD). All the twenty-six patients had complex dystonia compounded with other manifestations of movement disorders (tremor (n = 6), myoclonus (n = 5), status dystonicus (n = 2), and tic (n = 1)) or dysmorphic features and developmental delay. The onset of dystonia was between 1 month and 13 years 8 months (median 4 years 4 months). Dystonia was aggravated by fever (n = 11), and diurnal and climate fluctuations (n = 4). Eleven patients underwent deep brain stimulation and experienced significant improvements in motor function and disability. We identified twenty-six intragenic heterozygous KMT2B pathogenic variants and one Chr:19q13.12 contiguous gene deletion. Sixteen variants were novel. Differentially expressed genes induced by KMT2B variants were significantly enriched for mitochondria-related biological processes in patient fibroblasts. As a result, mitochondrial morphology of mitochondria was altered, and aerobic respiration was impaired. Our study reports the pediatric cases of KMT2B-related disorder from a single center in China. Additionally, our study highlights the role of KMT2B variants in mitochondrial dysfunction."

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia are involved in motor control and action selection, and their impairment manifests in movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia, among others. The complex neuronal circuitry of the basal ganglia is located deep inside the brain and presents significant treatment challenges. Conventional treatment strategies, such as invasive surgeries and medications, may have limited effectiveness and may result in considerable side effects. Non-invasive ultrasound (US) treatment approaches are becoming increasingly recognized for their therapeutic potential for reversibly permeabilizing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), targeting therapeutic delivery deep into the brain, and neuromodulation. Studies conducted on animals and early clinical trials using ultrasound as a therapeutic modality have demonstrated promising outcomes for controlling symptom severity while preserving neural tissue. These results could improve the quality of life for patients living with basal ganglia impairments. This review article explores the therapeutic frontiers of ultrasound technology, describing the brain mechanisms that are triggered and engaged by ultrasound. We demonstrate that this cutting-edge method could transform the way neurological disorders associated with the basal ganglia are managed, opening the door to less invasive and more effective treatments."

    "abstract": "The diseases historically known as neuroacanthocytosis (NA) conditions include <i>VPS13A</i> disease (formerly chorea-acanthocytosis) and <i>XK</i> disease (formerly McLeod syndrome). Here we report a patient with a hyperkinetic syndrome associated with variants in <i>VPS13A</i> with a concomitant homozygous nucleotide expansion in Replication factor C, subunit 1 (<i>RFC1</i>) and evaluate the role of ektacytometry for the assessment of acanthocytes. Investigations included clinical assessments, neuroimaging studies, laboratory analyses, blood smears, ektacytometry, psychometric evaluation, and genetic analyses. Using ektacytometry, an osmoscan curve is obtained yielding a diffraction pattern as a measure of average erythrocyte deformability from circular at rest to elliptical at a high shear stress. The pattern allows the derivation of several parameters (mainly EI-max, O-min and O-Hyper points). Samples from two other patients with genetically proven <i>VPS13A</i> disorder and <i>XK</i> disease and varying numbers of acanthocytes as well as from a fourth with acanthocytosis due to liver failure were also analyzed. The patient has impulsivity, chorea and disabling feeding dystonia refractory to treatment and 15% acanthocytes in peripheral blood. Genetic workup revealed compound heterozygous variants c.1732_1733del; p.(V578Ffs*9) and c.8282C > A, p.(S2761*) in <i>VPS13A</i> with absence of chorein in the blood, the latter variant is novel. In addition, he harbors a homozygous nucleotide expansion in the <i>RFC1</i> gene, reported in cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). However, the patient does not display ataxia yet. Ektacytometry revealed significantly reduced erythrocyte deformability in this patient and in another man with <i>VPS13A</i> disease. In contrast, the patient with <i>XK</i> disease had 2% acanthocytes and mild abnormalities on ektacytometry. In the three cases, ektacytometry yielded a specific pattern, different from acanthocytosis due to liver failure. Pathogenicity of the <i>VPS13A</i> variants is confirmed by absence of chorein, long-term follow up is required to evaluate any synergistic impact of for the underlying CANVAS mutation. New generation ektacytometry provides an objective measurement of erythrocytes' rheological properties and may serve as a complement to blood smears. Finally, ektacytometry's ability to detect deformability of erythrocytes in NA seems to depend on the degree of acanthocytosis."

    "title": "Striatal cell-type-specific molecular signatures reveal therapeutic targets in a model of dystonia.",
    "abstract": "Striatal dysfunction is implicated in many forms of dystonia, including idiopathic, inherited and iatrogenic dystonias. The striatum is comprised largely of GABAergic spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that are defined by their long-range efferents. Direct SPNs (dSPNs) project to the internal globus pallidus/substantia nigra reticulata whereas indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) project to the external pallidum; the concerted activity of both SPN subtypes modulates movement. Convergent results from genetic, imaging and physiological studies in patients suggest that abnormalities of both dSPNs and iSPNs contribute to the expression of dystonia, but the molecular adaptations underlying these abnormalities are not known. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of SPN cell-type-specific molecular signatures in a model of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD mice), which is caused by gene defects that reduce dopamine neurotransmission, resulting in dystonia that is specifically associated with striatal dysfunction. Individually profiling the translatome of dSPNs and iSPNs using translating ribosome affinity purification with RNA-seq revealed hundreds of differentially translating mRNAs in each SPN subtype in DRD mice, yet there was little overlap between the dysregulated genes in dSPNs and iSPNs. Despite the paucity of shared adaptations, a disruption in glutamatergic signaling was predicted for both dSPNs and iSPNs. Indeed, we found that both AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated currents were enhanced in dSPNs but diminished in iSPNs in DRD mice. The pattern of mRNA dysregulation was specific to dystonia as the adaptations in DRD mice were distinct from those in parkinsonian mice where the dopamine deficit occurs in adults, suggesting that the phenotypic outcome is dependent on both the timing of the dopaminergic deficit and the SPN-specific adaptions. We leveraged the unique molecular signatures of dSPNs and iSPNs in DRD mice to identify biochemical mechanisms that may be targets for therapeutics, including LRRK2 inhibition. Administration of the LRRK2 inhibitor MLi-2 ameliorated the dystonia in DRD mice suggesting a novel target for therapeutics and demonstrating that the delineation of cell-type-specific molecular signatures provides a powerful approach to revealing both CNS dysfunction and therapeutic targets in dystonia."

This condition, resulting from progressive microtrauma, architectural and functional abnormalities, or iatrogenic factors, is challenging to diagnose and often underreported. Understanding the biomechanical nuances of microinstability is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective management. Upper limb joints, including the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand, each exhibit unique anatomical and functional characteristics that contribute to their susceptibility to microinstability. Movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia, and cerebral palsy, exacerbate joint instability due to impaired proprioception, altered muscle tone, and uncoordinated muscle contractions. Effective diagnosis involves physical examination techniques and advanced imaging modalities. Therapeutic interventions encompass physical therapy, pharmacological treatments, surgical procedures, and assistive devices, tailored to enhance joint stability and improve the quality of life for affected individuals."

The risk of pattern change was assessed by Kaplan Meyer curves and Cox regression analysis. Finally, Multivariate linear regressions were employed to assess if Tsui severity correlated with the change. Among 100 patients (60 women), 37 experienced a phenotype switch, mostly in the first five years of BoNT treatment, YES and NO groups were comparable. Multivariate Cox Regression revealed the presence of laterocollis or rotatocollis at T0 as predictors of switch (respectively P = 0.01, HR = 3.5; P = 0.03, HR = 1.5). Multivariate linear regressions revealed that high Tsui subscores for the tilt and low Tsui total scores were risk factors for the change of pattern (respectively P = 0.002, OR = 6; P = 0.03, OR = 0.8). Latero and Rotatocollis are the CD phenotypes most predisposed to change. CD characterized by neck tilt are more likely to change phenotype following treatment. Dystonias with a low degree of severity are more predisposed to switch. Both, the different degree of muscle activation and BoNT mechanism of action, may impact on that phenomenon."

CBS is commonly seen in tauopathies. Striking asymmetry in clinical and imaging findings in CBS raises questions about potential triggers initiating neurodegeneration. The objective of this study was to investigate potential central or peripheral triggers preceding CBS symptoms. In this retrospective observational study, we reviewed medical records of patients with CBS at our Parkinson's Disease Center and Movement Disorders Clinic, focusing on evidence of possible central or peripheral \"trigger\" occurring within a year before the onset of CBS. We also reviewed records of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) for comparison. Of the 72 patients with CBS, 15 (20.8%) reported potential focal triggers before the onset of CBS-related neurologic symptoms. By contrast, only 1 of 72 patients with PD (1.4%) had a documented trigger before the onset of PD-related symptoms (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Of potential triggers, 13 were peripheral (related to hand or shoulder surgeries or trauma) and 2 were central (stroke and head trauma). Patients with CBS with triggers were younger, had earlier symptom onset, comprised a higher proportion of men, and had a higher likelihood of limb onset of symptoms than those without. Our finding of relatively high frequency of focal triggers in CBS compared with PD suggests potential central or peripheral triggers initiating neurodegeneration, possibly explaining asymmetric clinical and imaging features in CBS. Further research is necessary to validate and explore this observation's implications for CBS pathogenesis."

A patient carrying aSyn missense mutation and his family members were studied. We present the clinical features, genetic testing - whole exome sequencing (WES), and neuropathological findings. The functional consequences of this aSyn variant were extensively investigated using biochemical, biophysical, and cellular assays. The patient exhibited a complex neurodegenerative disease that included generalized myocloni, bradykinesia, dystonia of the left arm and apraxia. WES identified a novel heterozygous <i>SNCA</i> variant (cDNA 40G>A; protein G14R). Neuropathological examination showed extensive atypical aSyn pathology with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and nigral degeneration pattern with abundant ring-like neuronal inclusions, and few oligodendroglial inclusions. Sanger sequencing confirmed the <i>SNCA</i> variant in the healthy, elderly parent of the patient patient suggesting incomplete penetrance. NMR studies suggest that the G14R mutation induces a local structural alteration in aSyn, and lower thioflavin T binding in in vitro fibrillization assays. Interestingly, the G14R aSyn fibers display different fibrillar morphologies as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy. Cellular studies of the G14R variant revealed increased inclusion formation, enhanced membrane association, and impaired dynamic reversibility of serine-129 phosphorylation. The atypical neuropathological features observed, which are reminiscent of those observed for the G51D aSyn variant, suggest a causal role of the <i>SNCA</i> variant with a distinct clinical and pathological phenotype, which is further supported by the properties of the mutant aSyn, compatible with the strain hypothesis of proteinopathies."

    "title": "Brain metabolic response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to lesion network in cervical dystonia.",
    "abstract": "A previous study identified a brain network underlying cervical dystonia (CD) based on causal brain lesions. This network was shown to be abnormal in idiopathic CD and aligned with connections mediating treatment response to deep brain stimulation, suggesting generalizability across etiologies and relevance for treatment. The main nodes of this network were located in the deep cerebellar structures and somatosensory cortex (S1), the latter of which can be easily reached via non-invasive brain stimulation. To date, there are no studies testing brain stimulation to networks identified using lesion network mapping. To assess target engagement by stimulating the S1 and testing the brain's acute metabolic response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in CD patients and healthy controls. Thirteen CD patients and 14 controls received a single session of continuous theta burst (cTBS) and sham to the right S1. Changes in regional brain glucose metabolism were measured using [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET. cTBS increased metabolism at the stimulation site in CD (P = 0.03) but not in controls (P = 0.15; group difference P = 0.01). In subcortical regions, cTBS increased metabolism in the brainstem in CD only (P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.04). The remote activation was positively associated with dystonia severity and efficacy of sensory trick phenomenon in CD patients. Our results provide further evidence of abnormal sensory system function in CD and show that a single session of S1 cTBS is sufficient to induce measurable changes in brain glucose metabolism. These findings support target engagement, motivating therapeutic trials of cTBS to the S1 in CD."

Patients diagnosed with essential tremor according to criteria of the International Parkinson Disease and Movement Disorder Society (IPDMDS), who had been previously studied, were included as controls. All patients underwent a battery of tests between 2019 and 2022, which enabled us to compare them. Relevant demographic and clinical information were collected. The following tools were applied: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); the Fahn-Tolosa-Marín Tremor Rating Scale (TRS); and the Quality of Life in Essential Tremor (QUEST). A simple brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed for all patients. The categorical variables were compared using the Chi-squared test and the <i>t</i>-test with Fisher correction if appropriate, and the quantitative variables were compared through the two-tailed Student <i>t</i>-test. Values of <i>p</i> ≤ 0.01 were considered statistically significant. The cases presented higher scores on the anxiety and depression subscales of the HADS than the controls (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.006 and 0.000 respectively). In all domains of the TRS, the cases scored significantly higher, as well as in the QUEST. History of enolism was higher among the controls, and history of orthostasis and rest tremor was higher among the cases (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.000). Cerebellar atrophy was present in every patient in the case group, and in 24 subjects in the control group. Dystonia was observed in 7 subjects in the case group, and in none of the patients in the control group. There are patients with unclassifiable and extremely disabling tremors who respond poorly to the pharmacological therapy options."

The movement disorder is a very common clinical problem and for the patients where an adequate control of muscle tone is not achieved with usual techniques or drugs, intrathecal baclofen therapy (IBT) should be considered. Descriptive retrospective study based on the review of clinical records of patients who received IBT being followed by the PPCIU of Madrid Autonomous Region in the timeframe between September 2012 and February 2021. IBT was implanted in 8 patients affected by infantile cerebral palsy (ICP) with a Gross Motor Function Scale (GMFCS) IV-V, 3 patients was a Pantothenate kinase deficit-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), 2 had Acquired Brain Damage, and the remaining 3 had, respectively, 2 glutaric aciduria type I (GA-1), and poly-malformative syndrome. In all patients we observed a period of clinical stability after IBT, we call this period \"honeymoon\". Two patients died while in the honeymoon period, at 24.9 and 19.6 months from implantation of the pump; the median of duration of the honeymoon period in the remaining 14 was 14.4 months (IQ: 8.3-25.8). IBT was not only used in patients with non-progressive diseases, but also in the group of patients with neurodegenerative or progressive diseases. In all of them, after implantation of the device, we have objectified a period of clinical stability and a better control of muscle tone disorders."

    "abstract": "Electromagnetic forces in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) coils generate a loud clicking sound that produces confounding auditory activation and is potentially hazardous to hearing. To reduce this noise while maintaining stimulation efficiency similar to conventional TMS coils, we previously developed a quiet TMS double containment coil (qTMS-DCC). To compare the stimulation strength, perceived loudness, and EEG response between qTMS-DCC and a commercial TMS coil. Nine healthy volunteers participated in a within-subject study design. The resting motor thresholds (RMTs) for qTMS-DCC and MagVenture Cool-B65 were measured. Psychoacoustic titration matched the Cool-B65 loudness to qTMS-DCC pulsed at 80, 100, and 120 % RMT. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded for both coils. The psychoacoustic titration and ERPs were acquired with the coils both on and 6 cm off the scalp, the latter isolating the effects of airborne auditory stimulation from body sound and electromagnetic stimulation. The ERP comparisons focused on a centro-frontal region that encompassed peak responses in the global signal while stimulating the primary motor cortex. RMT did not differ significantly between the coils, with or without the EEG cap on the head. qTMS-DCC was perceived to be substantially quieter than Cool-B65. For example, qTMS-DCC at 100 % coil-specific RMT sounded like Cool-B65 at 34 % RMT. The general ERP waveform and topography were similar between the two coils, as were early-latency components, indicating comparable electromagnetic brain stimulation in the on-scalp condition. qTMS- DCC had a significantly smaller P180 component in both on-scalp and off-scalp conditions, supporting reduced auditory activation. The stimulation efficiency of qTMS-DCC matched Cool-B65 while having substantially lower perceived loudness and auditory-evoked potentials."

This involves the application of a high-velocity, low-amplitude force directed to the joints with the intent of achieving joint cavitation. This current case report describes a female in her mid-20s who presented with excessive bilateral and involuntary hand muscle contractions after bilateral thrust manipulation. Dystonia appeared both at rest and during voluntary movements but was aggravated by actions such as finger flexion or spreading and disappeared during sleep. A diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I combined with dystonia was made. Prednisolone administered between 2 and 5 weeks after symptom onset significantly reduced CRPS symptoms, but intramuscular botulinum toxin injection 5 weeks after symptom onset was ineffective at controlling her symptoms. Seven weeks after symptom onset, the patient was administered 2 mg trihexyphenidyl oral twice a day, 2.5 mg diazepam oral twice a day and 5 mg baclofen oral three times a day for 1 month and this significantly reduced dystonia, but complete resolution was not achieved. Clinicians should be aware that dystonia is a rare complication of thrust manipulation."

    "abstract": "Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) and dystonia (DYS) are both hyperkinetic movement disorders effectively treated by deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the internal part of the globus pallidus (GPi). In this study, we compared single-neuron activity in the GPi between 18 GTS patients (with an average of 41 cells per patient) and 17 DYS patients (with an average of 54 cells per patient), all of whom underwent bilateral pallidal stimulation surgery, under general anesthesia or while awake at rest. We found no significant differences in GPi neuronal activity characteristics between patients operated on under general anesthesia versus those who were awake, irrespective of their diagnosis (GTS or DYS). We found higher firing rates, firing rate in bursts, pause duration and interspike interval coefficient of variation in GTS patients compared to DYS patients. On the opposite, we found higher number of pauses and bursts frequency in DYS patients. Lastly, we found a higher proportion of GPi oscillatory activities in DYS compared to GTS patients, with predominant activity within the low-frequency band (theta/alpha) in both patient groups. These findings underscore the complex relationship between the different neuronal discharge characteristic such as oscillatory or bursting activity within the GPi in shaping the clinical phenotypes of hyperkinetic disorders. Further research is warranted to deepen our understanding of how neuronal patterns are transmitted within deep brain structures and to develop strategies aimed at normalizing these pathological activities, by refining DBS techniques to enhance treatment efficacy and individual outcomes."

Ten participants with neck dystonia were interviewed and the data was analysed using an interpretative phenomenological analysis approach. Three themes were constructed: (1) dismissed by others for having an unfamiliar condition; (2) negotiating a new social identity; and (3) managing the stigma of a visible condition. It is proposed that psychological support could benefit people with neck dystonia who experience difficulties arising from identity management and stigma.

    "abstract": "L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is currently the preferred treatment for Parkinson's Disease (PD) and is considered the gold standard. However, prolonged use of L-DOPA in patients can result in involuntary movements known as Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), which includes uncontrollable dystonia affecting the trunk, limbs, and face. The role of ΔFosB protein, a truncated splice variant of the FosB gene, in LID has been acknowledged, but its underlying mechanism has remained elusive. Here, using a mouse model of Parkinson's disease treated with chronic levodopa we demonstrate that serum response factor (SRF) binds to the FosB promoter, thereby activating FosB expression and levodopa induced-dyskinetic movements. Western blot analysis demonstrates a significant increase in SRF expression in the dyskinetic group compared to the control group. Knocking down SRF significantly reduced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMS) and ΔFosB expression compared to the control. Conversely, overexpression of SRF led to an increase in ΔFosB expression and worsened levodopa-induced dyskinesia. To shed light on the regulatory role of the Akt signaling pathway in this phenomenon, we administered the Akt agonist SC79 to PD mouse models via intraperitoneal injection, followed by L-DOPA administration. The expression of SRF, ΔFosB, and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) significantly increased in this group compared to the group receiving normal saline to signify that these happen through Akt signaling pathway. Collectively, our findings identify a promising therapeutic target for addressing levodopa-induced dyskinesia."

This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in PD patients undergoing treatment at a tertiary care hospital from India. Patients were advised genetic testing if they had (i) age at onset (AAO) of motor symptoms at or before 50 years (EOPD), (ii) positive family history of PD, parkinsonism or dystonia. All patients underwent whole exome sequencing and potentially pathogenic variants were identified. Clinical and genetic data were available for 230 (163 males, 70.4 %) patients. Thirty-five pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in various PD genes were identified in 47 patients resulting in a yield of 20.4 %. In the remaining, 82 patients had either variants of uncertain significance or had variants in genes not associated with parkinsonism and 101 patients did not have any non-benign variants. Patients with genetically mediated PD had a lower AAO and statistically greater frequency of dystonia (36.2 %), postural instability (29.8 %) and mood disorder (29.8 %) and a higher Hoehn and Yahr score (2.9). Among the 47 patients, 11 patients had PARK-PRKN, six patients had PARK-PLA2G6, and 22 patients had PARK-GBA1. Around one-fifth of early-onset PD can have an underlying monogenetic cause. PARK-GBA1, PARK-PRKN and PARK-PLA2G6 are the commoner causes of genetically mediated PD in India. Patients with genetic cause had an earlier age at onset, and more frequent dystonia, postural instability and dyskinesia."

The inter-rater reliability of individual sub-items varied from poor (ICC = 0.29) to excellent (ICC = 0.9). The total severity score of both TWSTRS showed good inter-rater reliability in a multidisciplinary team, indicating their applicability for online patients' assessment. We recommend using the total subscale for outcome comparison. Furthermore, there is a need for more accurate definitions of duration factor and shoulder elevation."

    "abstract": "Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a common cause of neurological symptoms including seizures and movement disorders. It can be debilitating, is associated with high health and social care costs, and can have a poor prognosis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has suggested FND is a multi-network disorder. Converging evidence suggests that other mechanisms including dissociation, interoception, and motor agency may be abnormal in people with FND. Psychedelics are currently under investigation for numerous neuropsychiatric disorders and have been shown to disrupt functional brain networks. Administering psychedelics to people with FND will help us to probe mechanistic theories of the disorder. In this open-label neuroimaging study, we will administer 25mg oral psilocybin with psychological support to people with chronic FND (target n = 24). Participants will undergo resting-state and task-based (Libet's clock, a measure of motor agency) fMRI sequences which will be compared in a pre-post manner. Additional mechanistic outcomes including measures of interoception (heartbeat tracking task), somatisation, illness perceptions, suggestibility, and dissociation will be collected. Data on expectancy, preparedness, and subjective experience of the psychedelic experience will also be gathered. Participants will be followed up for three months following psilocybin administration. fMRI changes in networks will be analysed using seed-based approaches, and additional exploratory analysis of resting-state imaging will take place. The study will help us to probe the mechanisms thought to potentially underpin FND. As the first modern study of psychedelics in FND, it will also help us to understand whether psychedelic administration alongside psychological support might be safe and feasible in this patient population."

Although functional changes in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network in dystonia have been reported in several studies, structural information of this network remain sparse. To characterize the structural properties of the cerebellar motor network in isolated CD patients. This includes cerebellar lobules involved in motor processing, the dentate nucleus (DN), the thalamus, and the primary motor cortex (M1). Magnetic resonance imaging data of 18 CD patients and 18 healthy control subjects were acquired. In CD patients, the motor part of the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale was assessed to evaluate motor symptom severity. The volume of cerebellar lobules I-VI and VIII, the DN and thalamus, and the cortical thickness (CT) of M1 were determined for a region of interest (ROI)-based quantitative analysis. Volumes/CT of these ROIs were compared between groups and associated with motor symptom severity in patients. The volume of lobule VI and the CT of M1 were reduced in CD patients. The volumes of the other ROIs were not different between groups. No association was identified between the structural properties of lobule VI or M1 and the severity of CD motor symptoms. Atrophy within the cerebellum and M1 contributes to CD's complex motor network pathology. Further investigations are needed to ascertain the mechanisms underlying the local volume loss."

However, reports describing isolated dystextia without aphasia or other cognitive impairments are rare, and the detailed pathophysiology is not fully understood. Most Japanese people use the alphabetical spelling system (Romaji) for texting and typing. Herein, we report the case of a man with isolated dystextia and dystypia resulting from Romaji conversion difficulties. A 48-year-old, right-handed Japanese man developed texting and typing difficulties. The standard neuropsychological tests showed no signs of aphasia or other cognitive impairments, except for slight executive dysfunction. Thus, isolated dystextia and dystypia were diagnosed. Furthermore, the patient experienced Romaji conversion difficulties. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a subcortical infarction in the left cerebral hemisphere. Single photon emission tomography revealed hypoperfusion, including in the left dorsolateral frontal cortex. The left dorsolateral frontal cortex may be related to Romaji conversion in Japanese individuals. Therefore, diaschisis of the left dorsolateral frontal cortex due to subcortical lesions may have impaired Romaji conversion, leading to dystextia and dystypia, in this patient."

Whole-cell patch-clamp recording was applied to verify the electrophysiological impact of the identified variants. A mouse model with cerebellar heterozygous knockout of the candidate gene was developed via adeno-associated virus injection, and dystonia-like phenotype inducement and rotarod tests were performed. In vivo multiunit electrical recording was applied to investigate the change in neural excitability in knockout mice. Heterozygous variants of potassium inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J member 10 (KCNJ10) clustered in PKD patients were compared with those in the control groups. Fifteen variants were detected in 16 of 522 probands (frequency = 3.07%). Patients with KCNJ10 variants tended to have a milder manifestation compared to those with PRRT2 (proline-rich transmembrane protein 2) variants. KCNJ10 variants partially altered the transmembrane location of inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1 (Kir4.1). The Kcnj10 expression is consistent with the natural course of PKD. Variants resulted in different degrees of reduction in cell Kir4.1 currents, and mice with heterozygous conditional knockout of Kcnj10 in the cerebellum presented dystonic posture, together with poor motor coordination and motor learning ability in rotarod tests. The firing rate of deep cerebellar nuclei was significantly elevated in Kcnj10-cKO mice. We identified heterozygous variants of KCNJ10 in PKD.

The most common neurological symptoms are dysarthria, gait abnormalities, ataxia, dystonia, tremor, parkinsonism, and drooling. This case report aims to present a diagnostically challenging case of WD presenting with neurological symptoms. The 38-year-old male patient was admitted with complaints of imbalance, gait disturbance, weakness in the legs, speech impairment, tremors in the hands, syncope, and drooling. The MRI primarily revealed FLAIR, T1, and T hyperintensities in the bilateral globus pallidus of the basal ganglias. At first, the patient was evaluated according to the Leipzig scoring and received one point from the serum ceruloplasmin level and two points from the neurological symptoms and was evaluated as \"possible WD\" with a total of three points. 24-hour urine copper was collected during and after the D-Penicillamine challenge. After the test, there was an increase of more than 5 times the upper limit. The Leipzig score was recalculated, and a diagnosis of WD was made with a score of five. Even cases without important diagnostic findings such as Kayser-Fleischer ring or high 24-hour urine copper should be evaluated according to the Leipzig score.

    "abstract": "Laryngeal dystonia (LD) is an isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in laryngeal muscles selectively impairing speech production. Anecdotal observations reported the worsening of LD symptoms in stressful or vocally demanding situations. To examine the impact of surrounding audio-visual complexity on LD symptomatology for a better understanding of disorder phenomenology. We developed well-controlled virtual reality (VR) environments of real-life interpersonal communications to investigate how different levels of audio-visual complexity may impact LD symptoms. The VR experiments were conducted over five consecutive days, during which each patient experienced 10 h of 4100 experimental trials in VR with gradually increasing audio-visual complexity. Daily reports were collected about patients' voice changes, as well as their comfort, engagement, concentration, and drowsiness from using VR technology. After a weekly VR exposure, 82% of patients reported changes in their voice symptoms related to changes in background audio-visual complexity. Significant differences in voice symptoms were found between the first two levels of the audio-visual challenge complexity independent of study sessions or VR environments. This study demonstrated that LD symptoms are impacted by audio-visual background across various virtual realistic settings. These findings should be taken into consideration when planning behavioral experiments or evaluating the outcomes of clinical trials in these patients. Moreover, these data show that VR presents a reliable and useful technology for providing real-life assessments of the impact of various experimental settings, such as during the testing of novel therapeutic interventions in these patients. 3 Laryngoscope, 135:787-793, 2025."

    "title": "Successful Radiofrequency Lesioning of the Pallidothalamic Tract in Paretic Form Focal Hand Dystonia With Paradoxical Unexpected Response to Intraoperative Test Electrical Stimulation: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "We report a case with paretic focal hand dystonia, which at first glance was diagnosed as writer's cramp, with poor performance only when playing the guitar and writing but with increased muscle tension around the elbow rather than in the fingers and hands. The muscle tension was around the elbow and the pallidothalamic tract (PTT) was selected as the proximal muscle target with less permanent complications. During the operation, the PTT test electrical stimulation was impaired only for guitar playing, but not for other hand movements. Therefore, test lesioning at a lower temperature and for a shorter time improved the symptoms, so we were convinced that this was the target site and coagulated this site, i.e., the PPT, at the usual temperature and time. With only one target lesioning, the patient's symptoms disappeared for six months. Careful history taking and physical examination to identify the site of muscle tension is important in determining the target of paretic form dystonia. In addition, test lesioning at a lower temperature and for a shorter time is useful if the test electrical stimulation produces a paradoxically unexpected response."

    "abstract": "Dystonia is a hyperkinetic movement disorder that has been associated with an imbalance towards the direct pathway between striatum and internal pallidum, but the neuronal underpinnings of this abnormal basal ganglia pathway activity remain unknown. Here, we report invasive recordings from ten dystonia patients via deep brain stimulation electrodes that allow for parallel recordings of several basal ganglia nuclei, namely the striatum, external and internal pallidum, that all displayed activity in the low frequency band (3-12 Hz). In addition to a correlation with low-frequency activity in the internal pallidum (R = 0.88, P = 0.001), we demonstrate that dystonic symptoms correlate specifically with low-frequency coupling between striatum and internal pallidum (R = 0.75, P = 0.009). This points towards a pathophysiological role of the direct striato-pallidal pathway in dystonia that is conveyed via coupling in the enhanced low-frequency band. Our study provides a mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of dystonia by revealing a link between symptom severity and frequency-specific coupling of distinct basal ganglia pathways."

To summarize the neurologic phenotypes and genetic causes in pediatric AGS patients, providing insights for early recognition and diagnosis in the Chinese population. Clinical features and neuroimaging results of the patients diagnosed with AGS from Beijing Children's Hospital between January 2018 and January 2022 were collected. Whole exome sequencing was used for genetic analysis. A total of 15 patients was included, all presenting with various neurological symptoms, including developmental delay (100%), motor skill impairment (100%), language disability (78.6%), dystonia (93.3%), microcephaly (73.3%), sleep disorders (26.7%), regression (20.0%), vessel disease (6.7%), and epilepsy (6.7%). Neuroimaging revealed intracranial calcification (86.7%), cerebral atrophy (73.3%), and leukodystrophy (73.3%). Seven genes were identified, with <i>TREX1</i> being the most common (40.0%, 6/15), followed by <i>IFIH1</i> (20.0%, 3/15). Variant c.294dupA (p.C99Mfs*3) was detected in four unrelated patients, accounting for 66.7% (4/6) patients with the <i>TREX1</i> variant. A literature review showed that <i>TREX1</i> gene mutations in 35.6% (21/59) of AGS patients among the Chinese population. Neurological symptoms are the most prevalent and severe presentation of AGS. Diagnosis may be considered when symptoms such as developmental delay, dystonia, microcephaly, brain calcification, and leukodystrophy emerge. <i>TREX1</i> mutations are predominant in the Chinese population."

    "abstract": "Altered interaction between striatonigral dopaminergic (DA) inputs and local acetylcholine (ACh) in striatum has long been hypothesized to play a central role in the pathophysiology of dystonia and dyskinesia. Indeed, previous research using several genetic mouse models of human isolated dystonia identified a shared endophenotype with paradoxical excitation of striatal cholinergic interneuron (ChIs) activity in response to activation of dopamine D2 receptors (D2R). These mouse models lack a dystonic motor phenotype, which leaves a critical gap in comprehending the role of DA and ACh transmission in the manifestations of dystonia. To tackle this question, we used a combination of ex vivo slice physiology and in vivo monitoring of striatal ACh dynamics in the inducible, phenotypically penetrant, transgenic mouse model of paroxysmal non-kinesiogenic dyskinesia (PNKD), an animal with both dystonic and dyskinetic features. We found that, similarly to genetic models of isolated dystonia, the PNKD mouse displays D2R-induced paradoxical excitation of ChI firing in ex vivo striatal brain slices. In vivo, caffeine triggers dystonic symptoms while reversing the D2R-mediated excitation of ChIs and desynchronizing ACh release in PNKD mice. In WT littermate controls, caffeine stimulates spontaneous locomotion through a similar but reversed mechanism involving an excitatory switch of the D2R control of ChI activity, associated with enhanced synchronization of ACh release. These observations suggest that the \"paradoxical excitation\" of cholinergic interneurons described in isolated dystonia models could represent a compensatory or protective mechanism that prevents manifestation of movement abnormalities and that phenotypic dystonia is possible only when this is absent. These findings also suggest that D2Rs may play an important role in synchronizing the ChI network leading to rhythmic ACh release during heightened movement states. Dysfunction of this interaction and corresponding desynchrony of ACh release may contribute to aberrant movements."

Symptoms first emerge in middle-late adolescence with a spectrum of hypogonadal and progressive neurological features. We present a case of WSS with no reportable T<sub>2</sub>-weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient mapping and susceptibility weighted MRI findings. This differs from cases reported in the current literature. Our patient developed abnormal movements in both legs, clumsiness of the hands, dysarthria, and swallowing difficulties. Moreover, she presented with alopecia manifesting as frontal and temporal balding, severe dystonia with painful dystonic spasms primarily in the left upper limb, as well as primary amenorrhea. She was not independently ambulatory on presentation, requiring wheelchair assistance. Genetic testing, the crucial test for a definitive diagnosis, was undertaken in Qatar and confirmed WSS. Treatment provided includes botulinum toxin injections and deep brain stimulation, providing better dystonia control, with progress in walking and strength exercises, and overall remarkable improvement. Intensive neurorehabilitation regimes were also deployed from admission, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy. This case adds to the current literature on WSS manifestations, with all previously reported cases having positive MRI findings, unlike our case."

To identify the genetic cause of a dystonic tremor with autosomal dominant inheritance. Six subjects of a multi-generational French family affected by tremor and dystonia were studied. Each patient underwent a comprehensive clinical assessment and a whole-exome sequencing analysis. All six subjects presented with early-onset prominent hand dystonic tremor and multifocal/generalized dystonia, secondarily developing mild cerebellar ataxia. The younger generation showed more pronounced cognitive and behavioral impairment. The known pathogenic TMEM240 c.509C>T (p.P170L) variant was found in heterozygosis in all subjects. Dystonic tremor can represent the core clinical feature of SCA21, even in absence of overt cerebellar ataxia. Therefore, TMEM240 pathogenic variants should be considered disease-causing in subjects displaying dystonic tremor, variably associated with ataxia, parkinsonism, neurodevelopmental disorders, and cognitive impairment."

    "abstract": "Psychiatric symptoms are common in neurodevelopmental movement disorders, including some types of dystonia. However, research has mainly focused on motor manifestations and underlying circuits. Myoclonus-dystonia is a rare and homogeneous neurodevelopmental condition serving as an illustrative paradigm of childhood-onset dystonias, associated with psychiatric symptoms. Here, we assessed the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and the severity of depressive symptoms in patients with myoclonus-dystonia and healthy volunteers (HV). Using resting-state functional neuroimaging, we compared the effective connectivity within and among non-motor and motor brain networks between patients and HV. We further explored the hierarchical organization of these networks and examined the relationship between their connectivity and the depressive symptoms. Comparing 19 patients to 25 HV, we found a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders and more depressive symptoms in the patient group. Patients exhibited abnormal modulation of the cerebellum on the cerebral cortex in the sensorimotor, dorsal attention, salience, and default mode networks. Moreover, the salience network activity was directed by the cerebellum in patients and was related to depressive symptoms. Altogether, our findings highlight the role of the cerebellar drive on both motor and non-motor cortical areas in this disorder, suggesting cerebellar involvement in the complex phenotype of such neurodevelopmental movement disorders."

A critical gap exists in our understanding of its longitudinal, systemic disease burden, complicated by delayed diagnosis. To address this need, real-world data extracted from existing medical records were used to characterize the longitudinal disease burden. All subjects (n = 167) with genetically confirmed AGS enrolled in the Myelin Disorders Biorepository Project (MDBP) were included. As available in medical records, information was collected on subject demographics, age of onset, and disease complications. Information from published cases of AGS (2007-2022; n = 129) with individual-level data was also collected. Neurologic severity at the last available encounter was determined by retrospectively assigning the AGS Severity Scale [severe (0-3), moderate (4-8), and mild (9-11)]. The genotype frequency in the natural history cohort was TREX1 (n = 26, 15.6 %), RNASEH2B (n = 50, 29.9 %), RNASEH2C (n = 3, 1.8 %), RNASEH2A (n = 7, 4.2 %), SAMHD1 (n = 25, 15.0 %), ADAR (n = 34, 20.4 %), IFIH1 (n = 19, 11.4 %), and RNU7-1 (n = 3, 1.8 %). The median age of systemic onset was 0.15 years [IQR = 0.67 years; median range by genotype: 0 (TREX1) - 0.62 (ADAR) years], while the median neurological onset was 0.33 years [IQR = 0.82 years; median range by genotype: 0.08 (TREX1) - 0.90 (ADAR) year]. The most common early systemic complications were gastrointestinal, including dysphagia or feeding intolerance (n = 124) and liver abnormalities (n = 67). Among postnatal complications, thrombocytopenia appeared earliest (n = 29, median 0.06 years). Tone abnormalities (axial hypotonia: n = 145, 86.8 %; dystonia: n = 123, 73.7 %), irritability (n = 115, 68.9 %), and gross motor delay (n = 112, 7.1 %) emerged as the most prevalent neurological symptoms. Previously published case reports demonstrated similar patterns. The median AGS score for the entire cohort was 4 (IQR = 7). The most severe neurologic phenotype occurred in TREX1-related AGS (n = 19, median AGS severity score 2, IQR = 2). Time to feeding tube placement, chilblains, early gross motor delay, early cognitive delay, and motor regression were significantly associated with genotype (Fleming-Harrington log-rank: p = 0.0002, p < 0.0001, p = 0.0038, p < 0.0001, p = 0.0001, respectively). Microcephaly, feeding tube placement, and seizures were associated with lower AGS scores (All: Wilcoxon rank sum test, p < 0.0001). Among the qualifying case reports (n = 129), tone abnormalities were the most prevalent disease feature, with spastic quadriplegia reported in 37 of 96 cases (38.5 %) and dystonia in 30 of 96 cases (31.2 %). AGS is a heterogeneous disease with multi-organ system dysfunction that compounds throughout the clinical course, resulting in profound neurological and extra-neurological disease impact. Systemic symptoms precede neurologic disease features in most cases. Disease onset before the age of one year, microcephaly, feeding tube placement, and seizures were associated with worse neurological outcomes. This work will inform evidence-based clinical monitoring guidelines and clinical trial design."

There are several studies that contribute to the diagnosis, the definition of prognoses, as well as the possibility of providing genetic counseling based on accurate scientific data. Advances in genomic sequencing have promoted the reclassification of entities according to an etiological criterion. Such is the case of epileptic encephalopathies, ataxias, dystonias, among many other neurological conditions. Its implementation requires strategies aimed at achieving the best diagnostic yield. This requires a greater understanding of the molecular bases of each of these practices, as well as their scope. They allow reducing the time until a certain diagnosis is made and the possibility, in some cases, of improving the quality of life of those affected with the use of tailored treatments. The objective of this article was to describe current laboratory studies, their scope and emphasize the algorithms for the study of genetic diseases in general, focusing the attention on those specific to neuropediatrics, in order to promote good practices, avoiding confusion, errors, and unnecessary expenditures of money and shortening the so-called \"diagnostic odyssey\"."

Key inclusion criteria for registry candidates include the following: understanding of study requirements and treatment procedures, a signed written informed consent form prior to participation, and meeting all criteria established in the locally applicable Instructions for Use (IFU) for the implanted DBS system. Key clinical endpoints include (but are not limited to) the evaluation of disease state (Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale [BFMDRS], Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS), quality of life (Short Form Health Survey-36, Short Form Health Survey-10), and treatment satisfaction (Clinical Global Impression of Change [CGI-Clinician; CGI-Subject; CGI-Caregiver]) at 6-months, 12-months, 2-years, and 3-years post-lead placement. Adverse events are documented and reported using structured questionnaires. Treatment of patients with dystonia using DBS has progressed considering recent technological advances.

    "abstract": "Tremor is the most common movement disorder, with significant functional and psychosocial consequences. Oral medications have been disappointing or limited by side effects. Surgical techniques are effective but associated with risks and adverse events. Botulinum toxin (BT) represents a promising avenue but there is still no double-blind evidence of efficacy on upper limb function. A systematic review on the effects of BT in upper-limb tremor was conducted. A systematic search of the literature was conducted up to July 2023, including the keywords \"botulinum toxin\" and \"tremor\". All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and open-label studies were analyzed. Independent reviewers assessed their methodological quality. There were only eight published RCTs and seven published open-label studies, with relatively small sample sizes. This review suggests that BT is more effective when injections are patient-tailored, with analyses based on clinical judgement or kinematics. Subjective and objective measures frequently improve but transient weakness may occur after injections, especially if wrist or fingers extensors are targeted. A number of studies had methodological limitations. The authors discuss how to optimize tremor assessments and effects of BT injection. Controlled evidence is still lacking but it is suggested that distal \"asymmetric\" BT injections (targeting flexors/pronators while sparing extensors/supinators) and proximal injections, involving shoulder rotators when indicated, may avoid excessive weakness while optimizing functional benefit."

    "abstract": "Dystonia is a movement disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1.2% and is characterised by involuntary muscle contractions leading to abnormal postures and pain. Only symptomatic treatments are available with no disease-modifying or curative therapy, in large part due to the limited understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. However, the inherited monogenic forms of dystonia provide an opportunity for the development of disease models to examine these mechanisms. Myoclonus Dystonia, caused by <i>SGCE</i> mutations encoding the ε-sarcoglycan protein, represents one of now >50 monogenic forms. Previous research has implicated the involvement of the basal ganglia-cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit in dystonia pathogenesis, but further work is needed to understand the specific molecular and cellular mechanisms. Pluripotent stem cell technology enables a patient-derived disease modelling platform harbouring disease-causing mutations. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the aetiology of Myoclonus Dystonia, recent advances in producing distinct neuronal types from pluripotent stem cells, and their application in modelling Myoclonus Dystonia in vitro. Future research employing pluripotent stem cell-derived cellular models is crucial to elucidate how distinct neuronal types may contribute to dystonia and how disruption to neuronal function can give rise to dystonic disorders."

    "abstract": "Compound heterozygous variants of SHQ1, an assembly factor of H/ACA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) involved in critical biological pathways, have been identified in patients with developmental delay, dystonia, epilepsy, and microcephaly. We investigated the role of SHQ1 in brain development and movement disorders. SHQ1 expression was knocked down using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) to investigate its effects on neurons. Shq1 shRNA and cDNA of WT and mutant SHQ1 were also introduced into neural progenitors in the embryonic mouse cortex through in utero electroporation. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed to investigate the interaction between SHQ1 and DKC1, a core protein of H/ACA RNPs. We found that SHQ1 was highly expressed in the developing mouse cortex. SHQ1 knockdown impaired the migration and neurite morphology of cortical neurons during brain development. Additionally, SHQ1 knockdown impaired neurite growth and sensitivity to glutamate toxicity in vitro. There was also increased dopaminergic function upon SHQ1 knockdown, which may underlie the increased glutamate toxicity of the cells. Most SHQ1 variants attenuated their binding ability toward DKC1, implying SHQ1 variants may influence brain development by disrupting the assembly and biogenesis of H/ACA RNPs. SHQ1 plays an essential role in brain development and dopaminergic function by upregulating dopaminergic pathways and regulating the behaviors of neural progenitors and their neuronal progeny, potentially leading to dystonia and developmental delay in patients. Our study provides insights into the functions of SHQ1 in neuronal development and dopaminergic function, providing a possible pathogenic mechanism for H/ACA RNPs-related disorders."

    "abstract": "Functional motor disorders (FMD) present a prevalent, yet misunderstood spectrum of neurological conditions characterized by abnormal movements (i.e., functional limb weakness, tremor, dystonia, gait impairments), leading to substantial disability and diminished quality of life. Despite their high prevalence, FMD often face delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment, resulting in significant social and economic burdens. The old concept of psychological factors as the primary cause (conversion disorder) has been abandoned due to the need for more evidence about their causal role. According to a predictive coding account, the emerging idea is that symptoms and disability may depend on dysfunctions of a specific neural system integrating interoception, exteroception, and motor control. Consequently, symptoms are construed as perceptions of the body's state. Besides the main pathophysiological features (abnormal attentional focus, beliefs/expectations, and sense of agency), the lived experience of symptoms and their resulting disability may depend on an altered integration at the neural level of interoception, exteroception, and motor control. Our proposal aims to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of FMD through a three-stage research approach. Initially, a large cohort study will collect behavioral, neurophysiological, and MRI biomarkers from patients with FMD and healthy controls, employing eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to develop a diagnostic algorithm. Subsequently, validation will occur using patients with organic motor disorders. Finally, the algorithm's prognostic value will be explored post-rehabilitation in one subgroup of patients with FMD. Data collection for the present study started in May 2023, and by May 2025, data collection will conclude. Our approach seeks to enhance early diagnosis and prognostication, improve FMD management, and reduce associated disability and socio-economic costs by identifying disease-specific biomarkers.

We aimed to explore cerebellar gradient alterations in functional connectivity in TLE patients with and without DP. Resting-state functional MRI data were obtained in 60 TLE patients and 32 matched healthy controls. Patients were further divided into two groups: TLE with DP (TLE + DP, 31 patients) and TLE without DP (TLP-DP, 29 patients). We explored functional gradient alterations in the cerebellum based on cerebellar-cerebral functional connectivity and combined with independent component analysis to evaluate cerebellar-cerebral functional integration and reveal the contribution of the motor components to the gradient. There were no obvious differences in clinical features and postoperative seizure outcomes between TLE + DP and TLE-DP patients. Patients and controls all showed a clear unimodal-to-transmodal gradient transition in the cerebellum, while TLE patients demonstrated an extended principal gradient in functional connectivity compared to healthy controls, which was more limited in TLE + DP patients. Gradient alterations were more widespread in TLE-DP patients, involving bilateral cerebellum, while gradient alterations in TLE + DP patients were limited in the cerebellum ipsilateral to the seizure focus. In addition, more cerebellar motor components contributed to the gradient alterations in TLE + DP patients, mainly in ipsilateral cerebellum. Extended cerebellar principal gradients in functional connectivity revealed excessive functional segregation between unimodal and transmodal systems in TLE. The functional connectivity gradients were more limited in TLE + DP patients. Functional connectivity in TLE patients with dystonic posturing involved more contribution of cerebellar motor function to ipsilateral cerebellar gradient. Dystonic posturing contralateral to epileptic focus is a common symptom in temporal lobe epilepsy, and the cerebellum may be involved in its generation. In this study, we found cerebellar gradients alterations in functional connectivity in temporal lobe epilepsy patients with and without contralateral dystonic posturing. In particular, we found that TLE patients with dystonic posturing may have more limited cerebellar gradient in functional connectivity, involving more contribution of cerebellar motor function to ipsilateral cerebellar gradient. Our study suggests a close relationship between ipsilateral cerebellum and contralateral dystonic posturing."

    "abstract": "Frataxin is an evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial protein responsible for iron homeostasis and metabolism. A deficiency of frataxin (encoded by FXN) leads to Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), a progressive disorder that affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems, most commonly via a pathogenic GAA trinucleotide expansion. In contrast, pathogenic variants in ALG1 in humans cause a form of congenital disorder of glycosylation. Here, we present a 15-year-old boy with a clinical presentation that raised concern for complex hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), with motor features including progressive spastic paraparesis, cervical dystonia, cerebellar dysfunction, and diminished lower extremity reflexes. The proband was initially found to have a novel compound heterozygous variant in ALG1 on exome sequencing, along with N-glycan profiling revealing evidence of defective mannosylation and Western blot analysis demonstrating an 84% reduction in ALG1 expression. Although several of his clinical features could be explained by the ALG1 variant specifically or considered as part of the presentation of CDGs in general, there were additional phenotypes that suggested an alternative, or additional, genetic diagnosis. Subsequently, he was found to have biallelic pathogenic GAA repeat expansions in FXN on genome sequencing, leading to a diagnosis of FRDA. Given that FRDA explained all his clinical features, the ALG1 variant may have been a hypomorphic form and/or a biochemical phenotype. Our findings underscore the importance of considering FRDA as a differential diagnosis in cases of complex HSP and demonstrate the utility of unbiased genome sequencing approaches that include detection of trinucleotide repeat expansions for progressive motor disorders."

One copy number variant of VPS13A (g.79827595_79828762del/c.556-290_697-483del) was firstly described in Chinese population. As the currently largest descriptive study of MLS and ChAc patients in China, this study expands on the clinical and genetic spectrum of XK and VPS13A, contributing to the clinical diagnosis of MLS and ChAc."

    "title": "The roles of TAF1 in neuroscience and beyond.",
    "abstract": "The transcriptional machinery is essential for gene expression and regulation; dysregulation of transcription can result in a range of pathologies, including neurodegeneration, cancer, developmental disorders and cardiovascular disease. A key component of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription is the basal transcription factor IID, which is formed of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs), the largest of which is the TAF1 protein, encoded on the X chromosome (Xq13.1). <i>TAF1</i> is dysregulated in X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism and congenital mutations in the gene are causative for neurodevelopmental phenotypes; TAF1 dysfunction is also associated with cardiac anomalies and cancer. However, how TAF1 contributes to pathology is unclear. Here, we highlight the key aspects of the <i>TAF1</i> gene and protein function that may link transcriptional regulation with disorders of development, growth and adult-onset disorders of motor impairment. We highlight the need to experimentally investigate the full range of TAF1 messenger RNA variants and protein isoforms in human and mouse to aid our understanding of TAF1 biology. Furthermore, the X-linked nature of <i>TAF1</i>-related diseases adds complexity to understanding phenotypes. Overall, we shed light on the aspects of TAF1 biology that may contribute to disease and areas that could be addressed for future research and targeted therapeutics."

We then generated a video guide for three-dimensional models of the DBS target nuclei at each stage using the photogrammetry method (Video 1). Our models were evaluated via augmented reality within a real-world context, and radiological models of these nuclei generated through segmentation were analyzed. Thus, our models and videos offer a novel method for visualizing the complex anatomy of deep brain nuclei, which could help enhance the precision of DBS procedures and may improve patient outcomes. This advanced understanding of spatial anatomical relationships may be beneficial for the continued development and success of DBS therapy."

    "abstract": "Therapeutic interventions for children and young people with dystonia and dystonic/dyskinetic cerebral palsy are limited. EEG-based neurofeedback is emerging as a neurorehabilitation tool. This scoping review maps research investigating EEG-based sensorimotor neurofeedback in adults and children with neurological motor impairments, including augmentative strategies. MEDLINE, CINAHL and Web of Science databases were searched up to 2023 for relevant studies. Study selection and data extraction were conducted independently by at least two reviewers. Of 4380 identified studies, 133 were included, only three enrolling children. The most common diagnosis was adult-onset stroke (77%). Paradigms mostly involved upper limb motor imagery or motor attempt. Common neurofeedback modes included visual, haptic and/or electrical stimulation. EEG parameters varied widely and were often incompletely described. Two studies applied augmentative strategies. Outcome measures varied widely and included classification accuracy of the Brain-Computer Interface, degree of enhancement of mu rhythm modulation or other neurophysiological parameters, and clinical/motor outcome scores. Few studies investigated whether functional outcomes related specifically to the EEG-based neurofeedback. There is limited evidence exploring EEG-based sensorimotor neurofeedback in individuals with movement disorders, especially in children. Further clarity of neurophysiological parameters is required to develop optimal paradigms for evaluating sensorimotor neurofeedback. The expanding field of sensorimotor neurofeedback offers exciting potential as a non-invasive therapy. However, this needs to be balanced by robust study design and detailed methodological reporting to ensure reproducibility and validation that clinical improvements relate to induced neurophysiological changes."

Although typically involving the face, especially at onset, tics may involve any muscle under voluntary control, including axial muscles of the neck (causing head movements), shoulders and trunk (thorax and abdomen). We aimed to characterize these tics and provide a clinical frame for their associations and complications. We reviewed video recordings and clinical history of 196 patients with TS or CTD according to DSM-5. Any axial tic was identified in 75% of patients. Tic distribution were head (n = 113, 57.6%), shoulder (n = 91, 46.4%), and trunk (n = 63, 32.2%). There were no differences in sex, age at onset or at evaluation between patients with and without axial tics. The most common axial tics by anatomical distribution were head turning, bilateral synchronous shoulder elevation and trunk jerks; however, tic phenomenology was quite variable. A greater severity of tics (P = 0.018) was associated with axial tics in the multivariate regression analysis. Head/neck tics associated with simple phonic tics (P = 0.002); whereas shoulder and trunk tics associated with complex motor tics (P < 0.05) in a bivariate analysis. Neck pain, breathing interference, sleep limitation and radiculopathy, secondary to axial tics were complications observed in a proportion of these cases. Axial tics are commonly observed in patients with TS/CTD with variable phenomenology. They associate with greater tic severity, phonic tics and complex motor tics. They may result in neck pain, breathing interference, sleeping problems and cervical spine injuries."

    "abstract": "<b>Purpose:</b> A vocal fold vibration switch is a type of access technology that detects voluntary vibrations of the vocal cords. In two sequential usability studies, we evaluated successive prototypes of a novel wireless vocal fold vibration switch. <b>Methods:</b> Each usability study enroled 7 dyads consisting of individuals with complex communication needs and their caregivers. Each study entailed a 2-week period of independent home use flanked by initial and final usability tests. Each usability test comprised nine tasks including donning and configuration of the switch, connecting it to other devices, and actual activation of the switch. Perceived task difficulty was measured <i>via</i> nine 21-point scales, while caregiver impressions were captured through open-ended questions, both encapsulated within a usability questionnaire. Caregivers described their experience in an open-ended interview in the second usability study. <b>Results:</b> Perceived task difficulty was uniformly low with both prototypes. The vast majority of tasks could be completed either independently or with hints. A small number of contraindications for use were identified with the second prototype, which included episodes of dystonia and heavy breathing, and some aspects of the physical design and robustness were flagged as needing further improvement. <b>Conclusions:</b> The overall qualitative feedback was overwhelmingly positive with caregivers generally desiring to keep and eager to recommend the device to others. Additionally, caregivers expressed that the vocal fold vibration switch expanded the switch user's capabilities, and they foresaw applications beyond the study setting. Overall, our findings suggest that the wireless vocal fold vibration switch is useable in the home setting."

    "title": "Multi-center improvement in screening for dystonia in young people with cerebral palsy.",
    "abstract": "Dystonia is a common, debilitating, and often treatment refractory motor symptom of cerebral palsy (CP), affecting 70-80% of this population based on research assessments. However, routine clinical evaluation for dystonia in CP has failed to match these expected numbers. Addressing this diagnostic gap is a medical imperative because the presence of dystonia rules in or out certain treatments for motor symptoms in CP. Therefore, our objective was to optimize rates of clinical dystonia screening to improve rates of clinical dystonia diagnosis. Using the quality improvement (QI) infrastructure of the Cerebral Palsy Research Network (CPRN), we developed and implemented interventions to increase the documentation percentage of five features of dystonia in young people with CP, aged 3-21 years old. This QI initiative was implemented by seven physiatry and pediatric movement disorders physicians at four tertiary-care pediatric hospitals between 10/10/21 and 7/1/23. We collected visit data cross-sectionally across all participating sites every 2 weeks and tracked our progress using control charts. We assessed 847 unique visits, mostly for established patients (719/847, 85%) who were 9.2 years old on average (95% CI 8.8-9.5). By 4/10/22, the mean percentage of dystonia screening elements documented across all sites rose from 39% to 90% and the mean percentage of visits explicitly documenting the presence or absence of dystonia rose from 65% to 94%. By 10/23/22, the percentage of visits diagnosing dystonia rose from 57% to 74%. These increases were all sustained through the end of the study period in 7/1/23. Using a rigorous QI-driven process across four member sites of a North American learning health network (CPRN), we demonstrated that we could increase screening for dystonia and that this was associated with increased clinical dystonia diagnosis, matching expected research-based rates. We propose that similar screening should take place across all sites caring for people with CP."

    "abstract": "Myoclonus is characterized by involuntary, shock-like movements, of which cortical (CM) and non-cortical myoclonus (NCM) are most common. Electrophysiology can help differentiate between these subtypes; however, the diagnostic value of several features is largely unknown. This study aims to determine the diagnostic value of the burst duration in distinguishing CM and NCM. We manually identified the burst duration of 8 patients with CM, confirmed by electromyography-electroencephalography registration or somatosensory-evoked potentials, and 19 patients with NCM, suspected due to a myoclonus-dystonia phenotype (MYC/DYT-SGCE positive and negative). The sensitivity and specificity were calculated to assess the diagnostic value. The burst duration of CM (31.1 ms) was significantly shorter than that of NCM (56.7 ms), with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 89.5% at a threshold of 45.0 ms. A minimum of 10 randomly selected bursts were sufficient for reliable diagnostic accuracy. The burst duration seems a valuable supportive diagnostic criterion for distinguishing CM and NCM."

Several literature databases were systematically searched and screened based on predetermined eligibility criteria. Included articles underwent risk of bias assessment. The prevalence rates of SMDs were calculated using a random-effects model. Out of 711 articles screened, 27 were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of spontaneous dyskinesia was 7% (3% FEP and 17% chronic schizophrenia) across 24 studies (95% CI 3 to 11; I<sup>2</sup>=94%, p<0.01) and 15% for spontaneous parkinsonism (14% FEP and 19% chronic schizophrenia) in 21 studies (95% CI 12 to 20; I<sup>2</sup>=81%, p<0.01). A meta-regression analysis found a significant positive correlation between age (p<0.05) and duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) (p<0.05) with dyskinesia but not parkinsonism prevalence. Akathisia and dystonia appear to be both less studied and less frequent in occurrence with a pooled prevalence of 4% (95% CI: 3 to 6; I<sup>2</sup>=0%, p=0.65) for akathisia in eight studies and a mean prevalence of 6% (range 0%-16%) for dystonia in five studies. The presence of varying degrees of neurodysfunction in antipsychotic-naïve patients with schizophrenia underscores the need for individualised treatment approaches that consider each patient's unique predisposition and neuromotor profile.

Here we studied intracranial electrophysiology in a patient with primary dystonia and observed evoked resonant neural activity (ERNA) in the globus pallidus interna. These local stimulus-evoked potentials displayed refractory periods and paired-pulse facilitation at clinically relevant interstimulus intervals. Sensing from directional DBS contacts localized ERNA to an effective stimulation site in the ventral posterolateral portion of the pallidum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of ERNA in the globus pallidus interna in a patient with primary dystonia.

    "abstract": "Self-injurious behavior (SIB) can occur in the setting of many neurologic disorders that are amenable to deep brain stimulation (DBS). Although certain brain targets are believed to be particularly effective for SIB, improvements in the primary neurologic condition may also reduce co-occurring SIB. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data to characterize the effects of DBS across various neurologic disorders and brain targets on comorbid SIB. A systematic review of all available literature on DBS in treating disorders with co-occurring SIB was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Individual participant data were extracted and standardized mean differences (SMDs) in metrics of SIB severity and/or frequency were calculated for meta-analysis. Demographic variables and adverse events were also collated. Data from 59 patients, identified from 24 articles, with comorbid SIB who underwent DBS for various indications were extracted. The primary neurologic diagnoses included Tourette syndrome (n = 40), dystonia (n = 7), epilepsy (n = 5), acquired brain injury (n = 3), dyskinesia (n = 2), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 2). Overall, DBS was highly effective in treating comorbid SIB (Mean SMD = -2.4, p < 0.0001) across primary disorders and intracranial targets. Patients with dystonia and DBS targeting the posterior hypothalamus had relatively less success at mitigating comorbid SIB. In patients with comorbid SIB, DBS to treat the primary neurologic condition may also mitigate SIB. Although several targets are emerging for the treatment of severe SIB, this work suggests that DBS targeting the primary neurologic condition should be first considered in comorbid SIB."

A total of 21 functional and structural neuroimaging studies, including 31 experiments in 521 LD patients and 448 healthy controls, met the study inclusion criteria. The multimodal meta-analysis of these studies identified abnormalities in the bilateral primary motor cortices, the left inferior parietal lobule and striatum, the right insula, and the supplementary motor area in LD patients compared to healthy controls.

She presented with vigorous, regular synchronous, rhythmic, and jerky movements during the immediate postoperative period lasting around forty minutes. Her past anesthetic history suggests varying degrees of postoperative movement disorders. Our patient was on long-term hydroxyzine for her skin condition. She had uneventful anesthetics before the prescription of hydroxyzine for her skin condition. All post-anesthetic dystonic events were reported while she was on hydroxyzine. Dystonic reactions during the perioperative period are rare and mostly occur during induction and emergence, which usually be transient. Our patient had prolonged lower limb dystonia resulting in severe muscular pain and lethargy for a few days. Further, she once developed transient aphasia and prolonged dysphonia following total intravenous anesthesia. This clinical finding could be a part of spasmodic laryngeal dystonia, which has not been reported previously. We correlate this rare postoperative dystonic reaction with propofol and possibly with the concurrent use of hydroxyzine. As differential diagnosis can widely vary, the correlation of clinical findings with movement disorders is important for the diagnosis. Alterations of anesthetic techniques avoiding propofol and holding hydroxyzine are advisable in such rare clinical situations. Early diagnosis of perioperative movement disorders will prompt specific treatments, such as anticholinergic medications, for dystonia."

First-line treatment typically involves Botox injections. For cases resistant to this treatment, bilateral deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is considered. This study explores the efficacy of unilateral radiofrequency (RF) lesioning as an alternative surgical treatment for Meige syndrome. Methods We investigated six cases of medically refractory Meige syndrome treated with unilateral RF lesioning between October 2022 and August 2023. The procedures utilized the Leksell Stereotactic System (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) and the StealthStation S8 system (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland). Target coordinates were initially set at 8-9 mm lateral and 1-2 mm inferior to the mid-commissure point (MCP) for the pallidothalamic tract (PTT), and 20 mm lateral, 2 mm anterior, and 3.0-4.5 mm inferior to the MCP for GPi, with fine adjustments based on MRI findings. Results The mean age of patients was 53. 3 ±16.5 years. Five patients underwent PTT RF lesioning, while one received GPi RF lesioning (pallidotomy). No surgical complications were reported. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale scores were 32.9 ± 19.4 preoperatively and 17.7 ± 13.9 three months postoperatively, reflecting an average improvement of 42.7%. The Jankovic Rating Scale scores were 7.17 ± 0.76 preoperatively, 2.33 ± 2.34 the day after surgery (average improvement of 67%), and 3.50 ± 1.64 three months postoperatively (average improvement of 51%). Bilateral facial symptoms improved in four patients (67%). Conclusion Unilateral RF lesioning for Meige syndrome demonstrated the potential to improve bilateral symptoms and may be considered a viable treatment option for patients with refractory cases."

Side effects of interest included psychic, autonomic, and sexual symptoms, as well as metabolic side effects and movement disorders. A 9-month parallel randomized open-label clinical trial was conducted involving 136 chronic inpatients from two psychiatric hospitals in the Netherlands. Participants were randomly assigned to either a STAY or a SWITCH group. The SWITCH group underwent a 3-month tapering-off period in which either first-generation or second-generation antipsychotic medication was discontinued, followed by APM. Patients were assessed at baseline and at follow-up assessments at 3, 6, and 9 months. Psychic, neurological, autonomic, and sexual side effects were evaluated using the UKU Rating Scale, while movement disorders were measured with the St. Hans Rating Scale. Various metabolic parameters were also recorded. In the STAY group, side effects remained generally stable over time, except for a slight reduction in sexual desire. In contrast, the SWITCH group experienced significant reductions in psychic and autonomic symptoms, as well as improvements in akathisia, parkinsonism, and dyskinesia. There were no changes in dystonia, paresthesia, epilepsy, or sexual symptoms for this group. Notably, the SWITCH group also showed significant reductions in BMI and body weight. Switching APP to APM in long-term inpatients reduces the severity of various side effects, including movement disorders and metabolic side effects."

    "abstract": "Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A), derived from Clostridium botulinum , is widely used in medical and aesthetic treatments. Its clinical application extends from managing chronic conditions like cervical dystonia and migraine to reducing facial wrinkles. Despite its efficacy, a challenge associated with BoNT-A therapy is immunogenicity, where the immune system produces neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against BoNT-A, reducing its effectiveness over time. This issue is important for patients requiring repeated treatments. The authors compared BoNT-A products, examining the factors influencing NAb development using advanced machine-learning techniques. The authors analyzed data from randomized controlled trials involving 5 main BoNT-A products. Trials were selected on the basis of detailed reports of immunogenic responses to these treatments, particularly for glabellar lines. Machine-learning models, including logistic regression, random forest classifiers, and Bayesian logistic regression, were used to assess how treatment specifics and BoNT-A product types affect the development of NAbs. Analysis of 14 studies with 8190 participants revealed that dosage and treatment frequency are key factors influencing the risk of NAb development. Among BoNT-A products, incobotulinumtoxinA shows the lowest, and abobotulinumtoxinA, the highest likelihood of inducing NAbs. The machine-learning and logistic regression findings indicated that treatment planning must consider these variables to minimize immunogenicity. The study underscores the importance of understanding BoNT-A immunogenicity in clinical practice. By identifying the main predictors of NAb development and differentiating the immunogenic potential of BoNT-A products, the research provides insights for clinicians in optimizing treatment strategies. It highlights the need for careful treatment customization to reduce immunogenic risks, advocating for further research into the mechanisms of BoNT-A immunogenicity."

    "abstract": "Despite considerable heritability, previous smaller genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have not identified any robust genetic risk factors for isolated dystonia. The objective of this study was to perform a large-scale GWAS in a well-characterized, multicenter sample of >6000 individuals to identify genetic risk factors for isolated dystonia. Array-based GWASs were performed on autosomes for 4303 dystonia participants and 2362 healthy control subjects of European ancestry with subgroup analysis based on age at onset, affected body regions, and a newly developed clinical score. Another 736 individuals were used for validation. This GWAS identified no common genome-wide significant loci that could be replicated despite sufficient power to detect meaningful effects. Power analyses imply that the effects of individual variants are likely very small. Moderate single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability indicates that common variants do not contribute to isolated dystonia in this cohort. Sequence-based GWASs (eg, by whole-genome sequencing) might help to better understand the genetic basis. © 2024 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "During the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, various movement disorders associated with COVID-19 infection have been reported. However, the incidence of dystonia specifically associated with COVID-19 infection has been particularly rare. A 43-year-old male patient presented to the movement disorders clinic with complaints of facial grimacing while chewing and experiencing spasms during nasal breathing. These symptoms appeared 2 weeks after he tested positive for COVID-19. Based on normal diagnostic test results, including brain imaging and blood tests, it was concluded that task-specific facial dystonia following COVID-19 infection. Despite treatment with clonazepam, trihexyphenidyl, and carbamazepine, his condition did not improve. Subsequently, botulinum toxin injections were administered to the affected facial muscles identified through video analysis. Botulinum toxin injections led to a significant improvement in the patient's symptoms. Task-specific dystonia affecting the facial muscles, particularly induced by specific actions such as chewing and nasal breathing, is rare and may represent an atypical post-infectious manifestation of COVID-19."

    "title": "G-quadruplexes in an SVA retrotransposon cause aberrant TAF1 gene expression in X-linked dystonia parkinsonism.",
    "abstract": "G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical nucleic acid structures that form in guanine (G)-rich genomic regions. X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease in which a SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon, characterised by amplification of a G-rich repeat, is inserted into the coding sequence of TAF1, a key partner of RNA polymerase II. XDP SVA alters TAF1 expression, but the cause of this outcome in XDP remains unknown. To assess whether G4s form in XDP SVA and affect TAF1 expression, we first characterised bioinformatically predicted XDP SVA G4s in vitro. We next showed that highly stable G4s can form and stop polymerase amplification at the SVA region from patient-derived fibroblasts and neural progenitor cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitazion (ChIP) with an anti-G4 antibody coupled to sequencing or quantitative PCR, we showed that XDP SVA G4s are folded even when embedded in a chromatin context in patient-derived cells. Using the G4 ligands BRACO-19 and quarfloxin and total RNA-sequencing analysis, we showed that stabilisation of the XDP SVA G4s reduces TAF1 transcripts downstream and around the SVA, and increases upstream transcripts, while destabilisation using the G4 unfolder PhpC increases TAF1 transcripts. Our data indicate that G4 formation in the XDP SVA is a major cause of aberrant TAF1 expression, opening the way for the development of strategies to unfold G4s and potentially target the disease."

    "abstract": "Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is FDA-approved for several movement disorders; such as Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and neuropsychiatric disorders. There are various reports of Body mass index (BMI) changes following different DBS targets in various disorders. A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to investigate the impact of DBS on patients' Body Mass Index (BMI) and provide an in-depth overview of its underlying mechanisms. We conducted research according to PRISMA guidelines. Our study assessed comprehensively electronic databases, including Pubmed, Scopus, Embase, web of science, and the Cochrane Library, up to May 2024. The random-effect model analysis was performed by the Comprehensive Meta-analysis software (CMA) version 3.0. As well, Cochran's Q test was used to determine the statistical heterogeneity of included studies. This systematic review ultimately included 49 studies, 46 of which entered the meta-analysis. The total number of patients was 1478, consisting of Parkinson's disease (PD), dystonia, and the obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) patients. The most common DBS target was subthalamic nucleus, followed by globus pallidus internus (GPi). Our meta-analysis depicted the BMI of participants significantly mount after DBS electrode implantation (SMD = -0.542, 95%CI: -0.678 to -0.406, and P-value < 0.001). However, moderate to high heterogeneity was detected among the studies (I<sup>2</sup> = 67.566%). Additionally, the Daily energy intake (DEI) of patients significantly decreased after DBS (SMD: 0.457, 95%CI; 0.205 to 0.709, and P-value < 0.001). STN and GPi DBS can lead to weight gain through distinct central pathways in various movement and neuropsychiatric disorders, posing a potential risk for obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome."

    "abstract": "The Next Move in Movement Disorders (NEMO) study is an initiative aimed at advancing our understanding and the classification of hyperkinetic movement disorders, including tremor, myoclonus, dystonia, and myoclonus-dystonia. The study has two main objectives: (a) to develop a computer-aided tool for precise and consistent classification of these movement disorder phenotypes, and (b) to deepen our understanding of brain pathophysiology through advanced neuroimaging techniques. This protocol review details the neuroimaging data acquisition and preprocessing procedures employed by the NEMO team to achieve these goals. To meet the study's objectives, NEMO utilizes multiple imaging techniques, including T1-weighted structural MRI, resting-state fMRI, motor task fMRI, and 18F-FDG PET scans. We will outline our efforts over the past 4 years to enhance the quality of our collected data, and address challenges such as head movements during image acquisition, choosing acquisition parameters and constructing data preprocessing pipelines. This study is the first to employ these neuroimaging modalities in a standardized approach contributing to more uniformity in the analyses of future studies comparing these patient groups. The data collected will contribute to the development of a machine learning-based classification tool and improve our understanding of disorder-specific neurobiological factors. Ethical approval has been obtained from the relevant local ethics committee. The NEMO study is designed to pioneer the application of machine learning of movement disorders. We expect to publish articles in multiple related fields of research and patients will be informed of important results via patient associations and press releases."

    "abstract": "AADCd is an ultrarare, underdiagnosed neurometabolic disorder for which a screening test (3-OMD dosing on dried blood spot (DBS)) and targeted gene therapy (authorized in the EU and the UK) are available. Therefore, it is mandatory to raise awareness of presenting symptoms and signs among practitioners. Delivering scientifically sound information to promote screening of patients with the correct cluster of symptoms and signs would be critical. In light of the lack of sound evidence on this issue, expert opinion level of evidence was elicited with the Delphi method. Fourteen steering committee members invited a panel of 29 Italian experts to express their opinions on a series of crucial but controversial topics related to using 3-OMD DBS as a screening method in AADCd. Clusters of symptoms and signs were divided into typical or atypical, depending on age groups. Inclusion in newborn screening programs and the usefulness of a clinical score were investigated. A five-point Likert scale was used to rate the level of priority attributed to each statement. The following statements reached the highest priority: testing pediatric patients with hypotonia, developmental delay, movement disorders, and oculogyric crises; inclusion of 3-OMD dosing on DBS in neonatal screening programs; development of a clinical score to support patients' selection for 3-OMD screening; among atypical phenotypes based on clinical characteristics of Italian patients: testing patients with intellectual disability and parkinsonism-dystonia. <i>Discussion</i>. Clusters of symptoms and signs can be used to prioritize testing with 3-OMD DBS. A clinical score was rated as highly relevant for the patient's selection. The inclusion of 3-OMD dosing in newborn screening programs was advocated with high clinical priority."

    "abstract": "This study aims to comprehensively delineate the phenotypic spectrum of ACTL6B-related disorders, previously associated with both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorders. Molecularly, the role of the nucleolar protein ACTL6B in contributing to the disease has remained unclear. We identified 105 affected individuals, including 39 previously reported cases, and systematically analyzed detailed clinical and genetic data for all individuals. Additionally, we conducted knockdown experiments in neuronal cells to investigate the role of ACTL6B in ribosome biogenesis. Biallelic variants in ACTL6B are associated with severe-to-profound global developmental delay/intellectual disability, infantile intractable seizures, absent speech, autistic features, dystonia, and increased lethality. De novo monoallelic variants result in moderate-to-severe global developmental delay/intellectual disability, absent speech, and autistic features, whereas seizures and dystonia were less frequently observed. Dysmorphic facial features and brain abnormalities, including hypoplastic corpus callosum, and parenchymal volume loss/atrophy, are common findings in both groups. We reveal that in the nucleolus, ACTL6B plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in pre-rRNA processing. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of the clinical spectrum of both autosomal recessive and dominant forms of ACTL6B-associated disorders. It offers a comparative analysis of their respective phenotypes provides a plausible molecular explanation and suggests their inclusion within the expanding category of \"ribosomopathies.\""

This report describes a patient in their mid 20 s with mixed dyskinetic-spastic CP with adult-onset hydrocephalus of unknown cause initially presenting with new-onset bilateral lower extremity spasms. Multiple interventions were trialed, including ischial bursal steroid injections, botulinum toxin injections, trigger point injections, multiple oral medications, and physical and massage therapies without benefit. Given lack of treatment response, imaging of the neuraxis was obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated new diffuse moderate ventriculomegaly compared to prior MRI. Ophthalmologic evaluation demonstrated papilledema, and opening pressure on lumbar puncture was elevated to 44 mmHg H<sub>2</sub>O. The patient underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement with rapid and near-resolution of their spasms and pain. This patient represents a unique case of new-onset hydrocephalus in an adult with CP. To ensure appropriate and timely diagnosis and treatment, individuals with neurologic conditions such as CP should have ongoing surveillance and comprehensive evaluation for any neurologic or functional changes, including changes in baseline tone. Future research is needed to better understand if adults with CP are at higher risk for the development of hydrocephalus in adulthood."

    "abstract": "To study the efficacy and safety of the drug Picamilon with various therapy regimens in patients with stage II chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI). An open cohort clinical study involved 50 patients diagnosed with stage II CCI aged 51 to 69 years (average age 62.2±8.98 years). Patients received Picamilon first parenterally 200 mg (100 mg/ml, 2 ml) intravenously for 10 days, then orally in 50 mg tablets 3 times a day for 60 days. The total duration of therapy in the group was 70 days. The study included 3 visits (before treatment, after completion of the course, 1.5 months after completion of treatment). The dynamics of cognitive status according to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale, vegetative disorders according to the A.M. Vane scale, neurological disorders according to the A.I. Fedin scale, and sleep quality according to the Ya. I. Levin scale were compared. The state of cerebral blood flow and endothelium was studied before and after treatment: dopplerography of cranial vessels, assessment of the level of methylated forms of arginine (ADMA, MMA, SDMA) and their ratios. The registration of adverse events against the background of therapy and the tolerability of treatment by patients was also carried out. Against the background of Picamilon treatment, a significant positive dynamics of the MoCA scale results was observed in the general sample of patients, increasing in the delayed period (20.9, 24.6 and 25.9, <i>p</i><0.0001 and <i>p</i>=0.0006); sleep normalization was observed in 55% of patients by Visit 2 and in 81% of patients by Visit 3 (<i>p</i><0.0001 and <i>p</i>=0.0025). Improvement of neurological functions is noted in 84% of patients, the score on the Fedin A.I. scale significantly decreases after treatment from 17.4±9.34 to 8.06±6.84 (<i>p</i><0.0001) and to 5.31±5.71 in the delayed period (<i>p</i>=0.0002). Normalization of vegetative status was observed in 38% of patients with stage II CCI, and in 60% of cases there was a decrease in the severity of vegetative dystonia syndrome (<i>p</i>=0.0001). Picamilon therapy has high efficacy in assessing clinical outcomes (100%), good tolerability in 98% of patients and is characterized by a favorable safety profile (in 92% of patients). Picamilon significantly affects the parameters of cerebral hemodynamics: increases the linear velocity of blood flow, reduces the thickness of the intima-media complex and the resistance index. It affects markers of NO metabolism and endothelial function: significantly reduces elevated levels of ADMA and ADMA/MMA and (ADMA+SDMA)/MMA ratios. The use of Picamilon is effective in patients with stage II CCI in the form of step therapy contributes to a significant regression of neurological deficit, cognitive impairment, improvement of sleep quality and autonomic function; improves vascular endothelial function, reduces the risk of cardiovascular complications. Picamilon is a pathogenetic therapy agent that prevents the progression of CCI."

This study aims to compare the efficacy, safety, and psychiatric features of GPi-DBS, STN-DBS, and pallidotomy in patients with PMS. This prospective cohort study was divided into three groups: GPi-DBS, STN-DBS, and pallidotomy. Clinical assessments, including motor and non-motor domains, were evaluated at baseline and at 1 year and 3 years after neurostimulation/surgery. Ninety-eight patients were recruited: 46 patients received GPi-DBS, 34 received STN-DBS, and 18 underwent pallidotomy. In the GPi-DBS group, the movement score of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) improved from a mean (SE) of 13.8 (1.0) before surgery to 5.0 (0.7) (95% CI, -10.5 to -7.1; P < 0.001) at 3 years. Similarly, in the STN-DBS group, the mean (SE) score improved from 13.2 (0.8) to 3.5 (0.5) (95% CI, -10.3 to -8.1; P < 0.001) at 3 years, and in the pallidotomy group, it improved from 14.9 (1.3) to 6.0 (1.1) (95% CI, -11.3 to -6.5; P < 0.001) at 3 years. They were comparable therapeutic approaches for PMS that can improve motor function and quality of life without non-motor side effects. DBS and pallidotomy are safe and effective treatments for PMS, and an in-depth exploration of non-motor symptoms may be a new entry point for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology."

    "abstract": "We sought to estimate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) in childhood tuberculous meningitis. Hospital records of children (6 months to 14 years) with tuberculous meningitis were retrospectively analyzed from September 2019 through January 2022. In September 2019, the first case of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity in tuberculous meningitis was identified in our division. Since then, all admitted children with tuberculous meningitis have been screened for paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity using the Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity Assessment Measure (PSH-AM). Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity is suspected when any of the following are present: recurrence of fever after initial defervescence, episodic posturing, dystonia, or unexplained tachycardia. Outcome at 3 months was prospectively scored according to the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score. Forty-one hospital records of children with tuberculous meningitis were analyzed, and 6 of them had paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (probable paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity, 5/6; possible paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity, 1/6). Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity appeared after a mean duration of 17 weeks (range: 12-25 weeks) from the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis in 4 of 6 children and at 4 weeks in 2 of 6 children. Children with tuberculous meningitis who developed paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity were younger (median age: 5 years) compared with the nonparoxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity tuberculous meningitis cohort (median age: 10 years). A high proportion of children who developed paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity had hydrocephalus at presentation (5 of 6 [83.3%] vs 12 of 35 [34.3%], <i>P</i> = .035). Hospital stay was significantly prolonged in children with probable paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (mean: 71.2 ± 26.8 days) compared with tuberculous meningitis without paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (mean: 20.8 ± 11.6 days; <i>P</i> < .0001). Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity is a late complication of tuberculous meningitis observed in 14.6% cases and should be anticipated in children with reappearance of fever or neurologic worsening without any apparent cause."

Diagnosis is complex and necessitates an increase in clinical suspicion of the disease to obtain the necessary diagnostic tests and thus early administration of appropriate management. In this case series, we are reporting three cases of patients with L-2-HGA who presented with a variety of clinical manifestations. All patients presented with a constellation of symptoms including febrile seizures, hyperactivity and intellectual difficulties. One case had an unusual presentation of cervical dystonia in early adulthood. Another case had a homozygous variant, <i>L2HGDH</i>: NM_024884.3: c.368 A > G p. (Tyr123Cys) classified as variant of uncertain significance (VUS) at that time but recently has been reclassified as likely pathogenic variant in clin var. Furthermore, brain MRI of two patients depicted characteristic signs consistent with L-2-HGA. The findings include, symmetrical confluent high T2/FLAIR signal intensity of the white matter involving the subcortical U fibers and deep white matter with sparing of the immediate periventricular white matter, internal capsules and corpus callosum. There was also symmetric abnormal T2 signal intensity of the caudate nuclei, lentiform nucleus as well as the dentate nuclei of the cerebellum. Overall, only few cases with similar genetic mutation have been documented in the literature and were of Saudi origin.

    "abstract": "Differentiating adductor laryngeal dystonia (ADLD) and primary muscle tension dysphonia (pMTD) can be challenging. Unlike pMTD, ADLD is described as \"task-dependent\" with voiced phonemes purportedly provoking greater sign expression than voiceless phonemes. We evaluated the ability of two automated acoustic measures, the Cepstral Spectral Index of Dysphonia (CSID) and creak, to detect task dependency and to discriminate ADLD and pMTD. CSID, % creak, and listener ratings of dysphonia severity were obtained from audio recordings of patients with ADLD (<i>n</i> = 29) or pMTD (<i>n</i> = 33) reading two sentences loaded with either voiced or voiceless phonemes. Group × Sentence Type interaction effects confirmed that both \"normalized\" CSID and % creak detected task-dependent sign expression in ADLD (i.e., worse symptoms on the voiced- vs. voiceless-loaded sentence). However, a stepwise binary logistic regression analysis with group (ADLD vs. pMTD) as the dependent variable and % creak and normalized CSID variables (voiced, voiceless, and voiced vs. voiceless difference) as covariates revealed that the normalized CSID voiceless-laden sentence <i>z</i> score was the only significant predictor of group membership. Estimates of diagnostic precision from the normalized CSID voiceless sentence <i>z</i> scores were superior to % creak or listener ratings. Finally, the CSID possessed the strongest correlations with listener severity ratings regardless of group or sentence type. Although both normalized CSID and % creak detected task-dependent performance as a distinguishing feature of ADLD, a CSID profile wherein (a) the voiceless sentence <i>z</i> score was less severe than the voiced sentence and (b) the normalized voiceless sentence <i>z</i> score was within approximately 2 <i>SD</i>s (or less) of typical expectations provided the best estimates of diagnostic precision. Automated acoustic measures such as the CSID and creak provide useful information to objectively discriminate ADLD and pMTD."

A total of 70 patients who were treated with on a botulinum toxin A for dystonia treatment in our clinic between January 2023 and March 2023 were retrospectively screened, and the clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients who reported headache complaints after the last botulinum toxin treatment were examined. Headache was reported in 8 (%11.4) of the 70 patients included in the study. Of the 8 patients who reported headaches, 6 (%75) had the onset of the complaint within the first 24 hours. There was no significant correlation between headache occurrence and factors like age, gender, diagnosis, botulinum toxin dosage, application site, comorbid diseases, or hypertension. However, a statistically significant link was observed between the intensity of pain experienced during treatment and the frequency of headaches after the treatment. Botulinum toxin treatment can lead to short-term headaches in some patients, starting early after the procedure. The significant link between the frequency of these headaches and the pain experienced during injection highlights the need to examine factors like the volume and dilution rate of the toxin, the solvent used, treatment area, treatment purpose, patient characteristics, and the physician's technique. It is important to study these aspects by comparing them across a large patient group and control subjects."

    "title": "Amelioration of Focal Hand Dystonia via Low-Frequency Repetitive Somatosensory Stimulation.",
    "abstract": "Dystonia presents a growing concern based on evolving prevalence insights. Previous research found that, in cervical dystonia, high-frequency repetitive somatosensory stimulation (RSS; HF-RSS) applied on digital nerves paradoxically diminishes sensorimotor inhibitory mechanisms, whereas low-frequency RSS (LF-RSS) increases them. However, direct testing on affected body parts was not conducted. This study aims to investigate whether RSS applied directly to forearm muscles involved in focal hand dystonia can modulate cortical inhibitory mechanisms and clinical symptoms. We applied HF-RSS and LF-RSS, the latter either synchronously or asynchronously, on forearm muscles involved in dystonia. Outcome measures included paired-pulse somatosensory evoked potentials, spatial lateral inhibition measured by double-pulse somatosensory evoked potentials, short intracortical inhibition tested with transcranial magnetic stimulation, electromyographic activity from dystonic muscles, and behavioral measures of hand function. Both synchronous and asynchronous low-frequency somatosensory stimulation improved cortical inhibitory interactions, indicated by increased short intracortical inhibition and lateral spatial inhibition, as well as decreased amplitude of paired-pulse somatosensory evoked potentials. Opposite effects were observed with high-frequency stimulation. Changes in electrophysiological markers were paralleled by behavioral outcomes: although low-frequency stimulations improved hand function tests and reduced activation of dystonic muscles, high-frequency stimulation operated in an opposite direction. Our findings confirm the presence of abnormal homeostatic plasticity in response to RSS in the sensorimotor system of patients with dystonia, specifically in inhibitory circuits. Importantly, this aberrant response can be harnessed for therapeutic purposes through the application of low-frequency electrical stimulation directly over dystonic muscles. © 2024 The Author(s).

These dogs were referred to our hospital due to movement disorders. Diagnosis was facilitated by video recordings of the episodes, assessing motor activity, consciousness, episode duration, any pre- or post-episodic behaviour as well as the presence of autonomic signs. Magnetic resonance imaging conducted on two of the dogs returned unremarkable results. Treatment trials included a gluten-free diet for all four dogs, with two also receiving acetazolamide. This intervention led to a decrease in the frequency of abnormal movement in all patients. Our findings suggest that PD in dogs can be effectively diagnosed through detailed symptom description using videos and questionnaires. Furthermore, once diagnosed, a combination of nutritional and medical management can be beneficial."

    "abstract": "Myoclonus dystonia due to a pathogenic variant in SGCE (MYC/DYT-SGCE) is a rare condition involving a motor phenotype associating myoclonus and dystonia. Dysfunction within the networks relying on the cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia was presumed to underpin the clinical manifestations. However, the microarchitectural abnormalities within these structures and related pathways are unknown. Here, we investigated the microarchitectural brain abnormalities related to the motor phenotype in MYC/DYT-SGCE. We used neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging, a multicompartment tissue model of diffusion neuroimaging, to compare microarchitectural neurite organization in MYC/DYT-SGCE patients and healthy volunteers (HVs). Neurite density index (NDI), orientation dispersion index (ODI), and isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF) were derived and correlated with the severity of motor symptoms. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) derived from the diffusion tensor approach were also analyzed. In addition, we studied the pathways that correlated with motor symptom severity using tractography analysis. Eighteen MYC/DYT-SGCE patients and 24 HVs were analyzed. MYC/DYT-SGCE patients showed an increase of ODI and a decrease of FA within their motor cerebellum. More severe dystonia was associated with lower ODI and NDI and higher FA within motor cerebellar cortex, as well as with lower NDI and higher ISOVF and MD within the corticopontocerebellar and spinocerebellar pathways. No association was found between myoclonus severity and diffusion parameters. In MYC/DYT-SGCE, we found microstructural reorganization of the motor cerebellum. Structural change in the cerebellar afferent pathways that relay inputs from the spinal cord and the cerebral cortex were specifically associated with the severity of dystonia."

    "title": "Conditional Knockout of Striatal Gnal Produces Dystonia-like Motor Phenotypes.",
    "abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations in <i>GNAL</i> have been linked to an adult-onset, isolated dystonia that is largely indistinguishable from idiopathic dystonia. <i>GNAL</i> encodes Gα <sub>olf</sub> , a heterotrimeric G-protein α subunit with a defined molecular function to increase the production of the second messenger cAMP. Gα <sub>olf</sub> is abundant in the striatum, and is the only stimulatory G-protein in many cell types of the striatum. Due to the defined molecular signaling pathway and expression pattern of Gα <sub>olf</sub> , the clear genetic link to dystonia makes <i>GNAL</i> an exciting target to understand the pathological mechanisms of not only this genetic dystonia, but also the larger idiopathic disease. To better understand <i>GNAL</i> -linked dystonia, we generated a novel genetic mouse model that allows us to conditionally knock out <i>Gnal</i> in a site and time-specific manner. In the current study we used genetic or AAV based approaches to express Cre to knockout striatal <i>Gnal</i> in our novel <i>Gnal fl/fl</i> model. We then performed motor behavioral testing and <i>ex vivo</i> whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology of striatal spiny projection neurons to interrogate how loss of <i>Gnal</i> leads to dystonia. Mice with conditional striatal knockout of <i>Gnal</i> show hindlimb clasping, other dystonia-like postures, less motor coordination, slowness, and torticollis as compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, striatal spiny projection neurons show increased excitability in <i>Gnal</i> knockout animals. These exciting data are the first to report uninduced, overt dystonia in a mouse model of <i>GNAL-</i> linked dystonia, and directly correlate these with changes in spiny projection neuron electrophysiological properties. Our results show that adult loss of <i>Gnal</i> in the striatum leads to the development of dystonia, through homeostatic, paradoxical increases in spiny projection neuron excitability, and suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at decreasing this hyperexcitable phenotype may provide symptomatic relief for patients with disease. <b>One Sentence Summary:</b> When <i>Gnal</i> is knocked out in the striatum of mice we observe overt behavioral symptoms and hyperexcitability in striatal spiny projection neurons."

    "title": "Deep Brain Stimulation for Childhood Treatment-Resistant Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Mental Health Clinician Views on Candidacy Factors.",
    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is approved under a humanitarian device exemption to manage treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (TR-OCD) in adults. It is possible that DBS may be trialed or used clinically off-label in children and adolescents with TR-OCD in the future. DBS is already used to manage treatment-resistant childhood dystonia. Evidence suggests it is a safe and effective intervention for certain types of dystonia. Important questions remain unanswered about the use of DBS in children and adolescents with TR-OCD, including whether mental health clinicians would refer pediatric patients for DBS, and who would be a good candidate for DBS. To explore mental health clinicians' views on what clinical and psychosocial factors they would consider when determining which children with OCD would be good DBS candidates. In depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with <i>n</i> = 25 mental health clinicians who treat pediatric patients with OCD. The interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Three questions focused on key, clinical, and psychosocial factors for assessing candidacy were analyzed to explore respondent views on candidacy factors. Our analysis details nine overarching themes expressed by clinicians, namely the patient's previous OCD treatment, OCD severity, motivation to commit to treatment, presence of comorbid conditions, family environment, education on DBS, quality of life, accessibility to treatment, and patient age and maturity. Clinicians generally saw considering DBS treatment in youth as a last resort and only for very specific cases. DBS referral was predominantly viewed as acceptable for children with severe TR-OCD who have undertaken intensive, appropriate treatment without success, whose OCD has significantly reduced their quality of life, and who exhibit strong motivation to continue treatment given the right environment. Appropriate safeguards, eligibility criteria, and procedures should be discussed and identified before DBS for childhood TR-OCD becomes practice."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), a treatable condition that stems from spinal leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, usually presents with orthostatic headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and tinnitus. A subset of patients, especially those with sagging of brain structures (\"brain sagging syndrome\"), develop several movement abnormalities. As SIH is treatable with epidural blood patch (EBP), movement disorders neurologists should be familiar with this syndrome. The authors performed a literature search in PubMed in July 2024 using the Boolean phrase- <i>((\"Brain sagging\")OR(\"Intracranial hypotension\"))AND((((((((((\"Movement disorders\")OR(\"Involuntary movements\"))OR(\"Tremor\"))OR(\"Dystonia\"))OR(\"Chorea\"))OR(\"Ballismus\"))OR(\"Myorhythmia\"))OR (\"Tic\"))OR(\"Ataxia\"))OR(\"Parkinsonism\"))</i>. We tabulated 21 case reports/series that highlighted the presence of movement disorders. The most reported phenomenology is gait unsteadiness. While it usually emerges in the background of the classic SIH symptoms, rarely, patients may present with isolated gait dysfunction. Tremor is the second most reported phenomenology with postural and kinetic tremor being the common subtypes. Holmes tremor has also been reported in SIH. Other reported phenomenologies are parkinsonism, chorea, and dystonia. One study reported a unique phenomenology i.e. compulsive repetitive flexion and breath holding in 35.3% of the patients. In majority of the patients, EBP resulted in substantial clinical and radiological improvement. Brain sagging syndrome due to SIH may present with a wide range of movement disorders. Mechanical distortion of the posterior fossa and subcortical structures result in the emergence of such movement abnormality. SIH adds to the list of conditions that result in \"treatable movement disorders.\" Therefore, movement disorders neurologists should be versed with the diagnosis and clinical features of this condition."

We report the case of a 20-year-old male with acute severe brain damage from tuberculous meningitis, who eventually developed paroxysmal episodes of spontaneous and inducible tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, and decerebrate posturing. We diagnosed the patient as suffering from paroxysmal autonomic instability with dystonia syndrome. The unavailability of morphine and the prohibitive cost of prolonged fentanyl use led to a trial of gabapentin, clonazepam, and propranolol for the patient, resulting in symptom resolution. Brain injury causes dysfunction of autonomic centers leading to paroxysmal autonomic instability with dystonia syndrome. Management includes minimizing stimulation and pharmacotherapy with preventive and abortive medications. Alternatives like gabapentin, propranolol and clonazepam were effective in treating the paroxysmal episodes, proving that they may have a role in resource limited settings. PAIDS requires urgent recognition and treatment to prevent further complications and death."

HT typically arises from disruptions in neural pathways, including the dopaminergic system. Its causes include cerebrovascular incidents, neoplasms, demyelination, and infections. Diagnosis involves thorough clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging assessments. Our report details the clinical profile, neuroimaging and EEG results and levodopa treatment response of an HT patient after cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) surgery. <b>Case Report:</b> A female patient who underwent AVM surgery developed head tremor and dystonia. Neuroimaging revealed left thalamus involvement. Video electroencephalography (EEG) revealed high-amplitude, low-frequency tremors. The patient responded well to levodopa treatment. <b>Conclusions:</b> Involuntary rhythmic or non-rhythmic movements are a primary clinical feature of HT. A differential diagnosis of epilepsy and HT can be achieved through neurophysiological monitoring, avoiding the overuse of antiepileptic drugs. Symptoms can be alleviated with levodopa intervention."

MI has a positive impact on motor performance, motor learning and neural plasticity. We analysed the connection between motor imagination and altered movement execution in individuals with dystonia, a complex sensorimotor disorder. The aim of our study was to examine MI ability in patients with functional dystonia (FD) in comparison to organic dystonia (OD). Our case-control study involved 46 patients, 22 with FD and 24 with OD. The assessment consisted of specific questionnaire and standardized motor, cognitive and psychiatric scales. The KVIQ-20 was used to test MI in each patient. Patients with FD scored lower on both global visual and kinaesthetic scales of the KVIQ-20 exam compared to patients with OD (63.1 ± 18.5 vs. 73.7 ± 13.2, and 54.9 ± 21.9 vs. 68.8 ± 18.2, respectively). Patients with FD also exhibited visual and/or kinaesthetic MI impairment in different body segments. The internal perspective when imagining movements was preferred in both patients with FD and OD. FD patients showed global dysfunction of visual and kinaesthetic MI abilities. Techniques for MI improvements might have a potential role in dystonia rehabilitation."

    "abstract": "In the Brazilian public national healthcare system, botulinum toxin type A has traditionally been the sole treatment option for patients with dystonia. However, as of October 2022, deep brain stimulation (DBS) garnered positive recommendations for the condition. This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of DBS in treating adults with generalized and cervical dystonia within the Brazilian healthcare context, considering its recent inclusion. A systematic review identified randomized controlled trials assessing DBS efficacy in treating adults with generalized and cervical dystonia. Two cost-utility analyses compared the cost-effectiveness of DBS plus the best clinical practice (BCP) to BCP alone. Markov models, which included 3 health states (no clinical improvement, clinical improvement, and death), employed a 1-year cycle and a lifetime horizon. The study used both 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Two randomized controlled trials, one for each condition, revealed superior clinical improvement with DBS when compared to sham simulation. The incremental cost-utility ratio was $ 1121.66 for generalized dystonia and $4556.50 for cervical dystonia. Effectiveness discount rates and age at surgery were identified as influential parameters. In 1000 Monte Carlo simulations, 99.9% of the incremental cost-utility ratio values for generalized dystonia and 74.2% for cervical dystonia fell below the cost-effectiveness threshold in Brazil ($8146.64 per quality-adjusted life year). From the perspective of the Brazilian public health system, the combination of DBS and BCP appears to be cost-effective for the treatment of both generalized and cervical dystonia when compared to BCP alone."

    "abstract": "An autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease called Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and a variety of psychiatric symptoms due to the expansion of polyglutamine in the Huntingtin gene. The disease primarily affects the striatal neurons within the basal ganglia, leading to significant neuronal loss and associated symptoms such as chorea and dystonia. Current therapeutic approaches focus on symptom management without altering the disease's progression, highlighting a pressing need for novel treatment strategies. Recent studies have identified imidazoline receptors (IRs) as promising targets for neuroprotective and disease-modifying interventions in HD. IRs, particularly the I1 and I2 subtypes, are involved in critical physiological processes such as neurotransmission, neuronal excitability, and cell survival. Activation of these receptors has been shown to modulate neurotransmitter release and provide neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of neurodegeneration. This review discusses the potential of IR-targeted therapies to not only alleviate multiple symptoms of HD but also possibly slow the progression of the disease. We emphasize the necessity for ongoing research to further elucidate the role of IRs in HD and develop selective ligands that could lead to effective and safe treatments, thereby significantly improving patient outcomes and quality of life."

    "abstract": "Task-specific focal dystonia (TSFD), characterized by the loss of fine motor control and coordination, affects drummers' lower-limb movements. This study explores lower-limb dystonia's impact on drumming performance and underlying muscle activity in a professional rock drummer. The drummer executed an eight-beat pattern on a drum kit. The participant reported the occurrence of symptoms when he felt the abnormality such as the loss of control related to involuntary aspects of movement. We measured the peak amplitude of the bass drumhead vibration, synchronization errors as the time elapsed between the metronome onset and the bass drum onset, and amplitude of electromyographic (EMG) recordings centered on metronome beat. Dystonia symptoms primarily manifested in the initial beat, with fewer symptoms on syncopation of the third beat. Analysis revealed decreased bass-drum peak amplitude and earlier synchronization error during the initial beat. EMG measurements of 10 muscles in the affected right lower limb showed significant changes in the Biceps Femoris (BF), Tibialis Anterior (TA), Extensor Digitorum Longus (EDL), and Extensor Digitorum Brevis (EDB) muscles during symptom onset. We observed (1) earlier overactivation of the TA and EDL muscles during the leg lift-up motion or preparatory phase of pedaling, (2) reduced activation of the EDB muscle, and (3) increased activation of the BF muscle during the final pedaling movement when symptoms occurred. These findings suggest that lower-limb dystonia symptoms are characterized by a reduction in amplitude of the bass drumhead vibration and an increase in synchronization error, potentially due to premature overactivation of the ankle dorsiflexor muscles."

Here, we present a child with progressive neurodegeneration consisting of spasticity, dystonia, and ataxia in which postmortem pathological analysis led to the diagnosis of interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein like (IRF2BPL)-related disorder. Detailed postmortem gross and histological examination was conducted, and findings consistent with dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and included polyglutamine (polyQ) inclusions. Follow up testing for the CAG repeat expansion at ATN1 was non-diagnostic. Subsequent exome sequencing reanalysis of the research exome identified a pathogenic de novo IRF2BPL variant. The IRF2BPL c.562C>T, p.(Arg188Ter) variant, distal to the polyQ repeat tract, results in variable mRNA levels depending on the cell type examined with decreased mRNA in the brain, as well as destabilization of the protein product and corresponding downstream molecular abnormalities in patient derived cells. We provide the first detailed pathological description for IRF2BPL-related disorder, termed NEDAMSS (neurodevelopmental disorder with regression, abnormal movements, loss of speech and seizures; Mendelian Inheritance in Man, 618088) and evidence for the inclusion of this condition in the differential diagnosis of spastic-ataxic neurodegenerative conditions, reminiscent of DRPLA. Although the individuals with NEDAMSS do not carry an expansion, the polyQ repeat tract may play a role in the pathological inclusions that would represent a novel disease mechanism for polyQ repeats. © 2024 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."

Most patients first consult dentists or oral surgeons. The differential diagnoses of these involuntary movements require both neurological and dental knowledge and experience, and some of these movement disorders are likely to be diagnosed as bruxism or temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) by dental professionals. However, excepting movement disorder specialists, neurologists may find it difficult to differentially diagnose these disorders. Patients may visit numerous medical and dental specialties for several years until a diagnosis is made. Therefore, movement disorders of the oral region may represent a blind spot between dentistry and medicine.The present narrative review aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and differential diagnoses of some movement disorders, as well as the problems bridging dentistry and medicine. Movement disorders have the following characteristic clinical features: OMD - task specificity, sensory tricks and the morning benefit; FSMDs - inconsistent and incongruous symptoms, spreading to multiple sites and the lack of sensory tricks; and HMS - the paroxysmal contraction of unilateral jaw-closing muscles, the persistence of symptoms during sleep and the loss of a silent period. A careful differential diagnosis is essential for the adequate and effective treatment of each involuntary movement. Refining the latest definition of bruxism may be necessary to prevent the misdiagnosis of involuntary movements as bruxism.Both dental and medical professionals should take an interest in the movement disorders of the stomatognathic system, and these disorders should be diagnosed and treated by a multidisciplinary team."

    "title": "Phantom-Enhanced High Mechanical Accuracy for Frame-Based Deep Brain Stimulation.",
    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure that depends on high-accuracy targeting of structures to implant electrodes within the brain. The positioning of these electrodes in the brain determines the long-term efficacy of treating diseases such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, or dystonia. Misplaced electrodes in DBS can lead to poor efficacy and stimulation-induced side effects. Widespread targeting errors and variability have been published throughout the literature. As such, improvement in targeting accuracy is needed to enhance the quality of the procedures. A stereotactic phantom was utilized to test and adjust targeting before the surgical placement in the brain for 91 sequential electrodes. The tip of the microelectrode, the first rigid point in time, was measured and compared to the planned target. The technique utilized a to-target cannula with an XY stage that allowed x-axis and y-axis adjustments and correction for inaccuracies relative to the phantom. A calculation was developed to convert anatomical angles (sagittal and coronal) provided by commercial planning stations to spherical angles to calculate points along a trajectory. Error calculations included each dimensional axis, Euclidean error, and radial error. Bends in the cannula and microelectrode were observed and corrected by referencing the phantom. All 91 first-pass tracks traversed the intended target, and three electrodes required a second mapping track beyond the first penetration due to neurophysiological and intraoperative testing. The results showed overall ultra-high (0-0.5 mm) to high (>0.5-1 mm) accuracy, an average Euclidean error of 0.66±0.30 mm, and a radial error of 0.45±0.28 mm with dimensional errors of less than 0.5 mm per axis. The utilization of a stereotactic phantom is an important tool to enhance the stereotactic targeting before insertion into the brain. This phantom technique yielded ultra-high to high accuracy in error calculations. Future methods and studies should focus on error minimization to enhance these DBS mechanical accuracy and correlations with clinical outcomes."

A poor understanding of their pathophysiology, as well as the mediators of clinical outcomes following deep brain stimulation (DBS), highlights the need for biomarkers to accurately characterise and optimally treat patients. We assessed the white matter microstructure of pathways implicated in the pathophysiology and therapeutic intervention in a retrospective cohort of patients with DT (n = 17) and ET (n = 19). We aimed to identity associations between white matter microstructure, upper limb tremor severity, and tremor improvement following DBS. A fixel-based analysis pipeline was implemented to investigate white matter microstructural metrics in the whole brain, cerebello-thalamic pathways and tracts connected to stimulation volumes following DBS. Associations with preoperative and postoperative severity were analysed within each disorder group and across combined disorder groups. DBS led to significant improvements in both groups. No group differences in stimulation positions were identified. When white matter microstructural data was aligned according to the maximally affected upper limb, increased fiber density, and combined fiber density & cross-section of fixels in the left cerebellum were associated with greater tremor severity across DT and ET patients. White matter microstructure did not show associations with postoperative changes in cerebello-thalamic pathways, or tracts connected to stimulation volumes. Diffusion changes of the cerebellum are associated with the severity of upper limb tremor and appear to overlap in essential or dystonic tremor disorders."

For this retrospective, observational, single-center study, we extracted records of all administrations of droperidol from August 2019 to August 2020. Patients with a chief complaint of abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting, or any combination thereof, were included in data analysis. Between April 2019 to August 2020, 830 discrete patient visits involving droperidol administration were identified, comprising 706 patients. The average age was 39 years old with a range of 15 to 80. Seven patients (0.08%) were younger than 18, and 35 (4%) were older than 65. Five hundred sixty-five patients (68%) were female. Droperidol doses ranged from 0.625 mg to 5 mg intravenous (IV), with a median dose of 0.625 mg (interquartile range 0.625-1.25 mg), with 590 patients (71%) receiving a dose of 0.625 mg. Only 19 patients (2.3%) had a documented adverse event. Seven had akathisia or restlessness, 7 had anxiety or agitation, 3 had dystonia or stiffness, 1 had fatigue, and 1 had dizziness. For the entire cohort, there were no cardiac dysrhythmias, syncope, seizures, other major adverse events, or fatalities recorded. At one institution, droperidol is being used commonly for the chief complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, and/or vomiting. The preferred dosing is nearly universally below the 2.5 mg IV dose for which the FDA warning applies. Similar to previous studies, identification of adverse events was rare, and no major adverse outcomes such as dysrhythmia or death were identified."

    "abstract": "Adductor laryngeal dystonia (AdLD) disrupts fine motor movements of vocal folds during speech, resulting in a strained, broken, and strangled voice. Laryngeal high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) in connected speech enables the direct visualization of detailed laryngeal dynamics, hence, it can be effectively used to study AdLD. The current study utilizes HSV to investigate supraglottic laryngeal tissue maneuvers obstructing the view of the vocal folds, in AdLD and normophonic speakers during connected speech. Characterizing the laryngeal maneuvers in these groups can facilitate a deeper understanding of the normophonic voice physiology and AdLD voice pathophysiology. HSV data were obtained from six normophonic speakers and six patients with AdLD during production of connected speech. Three experienced raters visually analyzed the data to determine laryngeal tissues leading to obstructions of vocal folds in HSV images. The raters recorded the duration of each obstruction and indicated the specific tissue(s) leading to the obstruction. After the completion of their individual visual analysis, the raters came to consensus about their observations and measurements. Statistical analysis indicated that AdLD patients exhibited higher occurrences of vocal fold obstructions and longer durations of obstructions compared with the normophonic group. Similar obstruction types were found in both groups, with the epiglottis being the primary site of obstruction for both. Participants with AdLD displayed significantly elevated occurrences of sphincteric compression resulting in vocal fold obstruction. HSV can be used to study the movements of laryngeal tissues in detail during connected speech. The analysis of supraglottic laryngeal tissue dynamics in speech can help us characterize the AdLD pathophysiology. The study's findings regarding the tissues implicated in obstructions may potentially inform the development of patient-specific therapeutic strategies targeting individual control over specific laryngeal muscles during phonation and speech production."

We extracted this caregiver and clinician-entered data on people with an ICD10 diagnosis of CP seen between 3/22/23 and 12/28/23. We used this data to describe how CP manifests in this group and which medical features affected the odds of walking, oral feeding, and speech by age 5. Of 686 visits, 663 (97%) had caregiver- and clinician-entered data and 633 had a clinician-confirmed CP diagnosis (mean age 9.1, 53.4% Male, 78.5% White). It was common to have quadriplegia (288/613, 47.0%), both spasticity and dystonia (257/632, 40.7%), walk independently (368/633, 58.1%), eat all food and drink safely by mouth (288/578, 55.9%), and produce understandable speech (249/584, 42.6%). Cortical grey matter injury and duration of initial critical care unit stay affected the odds of walking, oral feeding, and speech (binary logistic regression, p<0.001).

By sharing our methodology, we aim to facilitate replication of this dataset at other sites and grow our understanding of how CP manifests in the US. Using caregiver and clinician-entered data on people seen in a tertiary-care CP center, we determined medical features affecting the odds of three functional outcomes. Detailed CP characterization can be limited if using population-based registries and retrospective chart review alone, including limited data on recently validated functional classification systems for CP. We comprehensively captured caregiver and clinician-entered data on 97% of people seen in our CP Center to describe how CP manifests and show that cortical injury and initial ICU stay duration affect the odds of walking, oral feeding, and speech. Susie Kim helped design the study, aggregated data, carried out data analyses, and critically reviewed and revised the manuscript.Kelsey Steffen helped conceptualize and design the study and critically reviewed and revised the manuscript.Lauren Gottschalk, Jennifer Miros, Katie Leger, Amy Viehoever, and Karen Taca helped design the study and critically reviewed and revised the manuscript.Bhooma Aravamuthan conceptualized and designed the study, supervised data collection and analysis, drafted the initial manuscript, and critically reviewed and revised the manuscript."

    "title": "Management of Meige syndrome with bilateral trigeminal and facial nerves combing.",
    "abstract": "Meige syndrome (MS) is an adult-onset segmental dystonia for which no satisfactory remedy currently exists. Our team developed a novel surgical approach called bilateral trigeminal/facial nerve combing (BTFC). This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of patients who underwent BFTC (Clinical Trial Registry Number: ChiCTR2000033481). We assigned 22 patients with MS to undergo BTFC. The primary outcome was assessed using the movement subscale of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS-M) at 12 months postoperatively. The second outcome was evaluated using the Medical Outcome Study (MOS) 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the dysfunction subscale of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS-D), and the sub-item scores of the BFMDRS-M. Safety outcomes included the House-Brackmann (HB) functional grading score and the visual analog scale (VAS) for facial numbness. At the final follow-up at 12 months, the BFMDRS-M showed a mean improvement of 70.7% from baseline. Mean scores of the BFMDRS-M sub-motor (including the eyes, mouth, and speech/swallowing) improved by 65.6, 81.00, and 60%, respectively. The median score of the total BFMDRS-D score was 0.70 ± 1.17 compared with 1.86 ± 2.21 at baseline. There were no serious operative complications in this population. The quality of life of the patients significantly improved (<i>P</i> < 0.05). BFTC has proven to be effective in relieving the symptoms of Meige syndrome. This novel surgical approach offers a new alternative treatment for patients who have failed to respond to medications, botulinum toxin injections, and deep brain stimulation (DBS). https://www.chictr.org.cn/bin/project/edit?pid=54567, ChiCTR2000033481."

    "abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) has been used for the treatment of medically refractory dystonia with excellent results. In this study, we compared in detail the therapeutic advantages of two DBS targets for generalized isolated dystonia. <b>Methods:</b> In this retrospective study, we recruited 29 patients with generalized isolated dystonia who had undergone DBS treatment targeting either the globus pallidus interna (GPi) or the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in the Department of Functional Neurosurgery at Tiantan Hospital, Beijing, China, between January 2016 and December 2021. The movement and disability subscales of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia rating scale (BFMDRS) were used to assess the severity of their dystonic symptoms and their activities of daily living, respectively. SF-36 was used to evaluate the patients' health-related quality of life. <b>Results:</b> The percentage improvement in the BFMDRS-M score at 6 months relative to the baseline score was clearly higher in the STN group (63.91%) than in the GPi group (38.36%). At the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups, the percentage improvement in arm symptoms was significantly higher after DBS of the STN (70.64%, 80.66%, and 76.89%, respectively) than after stimulation of the GPi (36.75%, 34.21%, and 38.47%, respectively). At 12 months after surgery, patient quality of life had improved on all SF-36 subscales in both groups. <b>Conclusions:</b> STN-DBS may have more advantages than GPi-DBS in patients with obvious arm dystonia. STN-DBS had a better clinical effect than GPi-DBS within 6 months after surgery."

    "title": "Chronic Cocaine Use and Parkinson's Disease: An Interpretative Model.",
    "abstract": "Over the years, the growing \"epidemic\" spread of cocaine use represents a crucial public health and social problem worldwide. According to the 2023 World Drug Report, 0.4% of the world's population aged 15 to 64 report using cocaine; this number corresponds to approximately 24.6 million cocaine users worldwide and approximately 1 million subjects with cocaine use disorder (CUD). While we specifically know the short-term side effects induced by cocaine, unfortunately, we currently do not have exhaustive information about the medium/long-term side effects of the substance on the body. The scientific literature progressively highlights that the chronic use of cocaine is related to an increase in cardio- and cerebrovascular risk and probably to a greater incidence of psychomotor symptoms and neurodegenerative processes. Several studies have highlighted an increased risk of antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSs) in patients with psychotic spectrum disorders comorbid with psychostimulant abuse. EPSs include movement dysfunction such as dystonia, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, and characteristic symptoms of Parkinsonism such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor. In the present paper, we propose a model of interpretation of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the hypothesized increased vulnerability in chronic cocaine abusers to neurodegenerative disorders with psychomotor symptoms. Specifically, we supposed that the chronic administration of cocaine produces significant neurobiological changes, causing a complex dysregulation of various neurotransmitter systems, mainly affecting subcortical structures and the dopaminergic pathways. We believe that a better understanding of these cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in cocaine-induced neuropsychotoxicity may have helpful clinical implications and provide targets for therapeutic intervention."

    "title": "BDNF-Regulated Modulation of Striatal Circuits and Implications for Parkinson's Disease and Dystonia.",
    "abstract": "Neurotrophins, particularly brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), act as key regulators of neuronal development, survival, and plasticity. BDNF is necessary for neuronal and functional maintenance in the striatum and the substantia nigra, both structures involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Depletion of BDNF leads to striatal degeneration and defects in the dendritic arborization of striatal neurons. Activation of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) by BDNF is necessary for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity, in the hippocampus and striatum. PD is characterized by the degeneration of nigrostriatal neurons and altered striatal plasticity has been implicated in the pathophysiology of PD motor symptoms, leading to imbalances in the basal ganglia motor pathways. Given its essential role in promoting neuronal survival and meditating synaptic plasticity in the motor system, BDNF might have an important impact on the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD. In this review, we focus on the role of BDNF in corticostriatal plasticity in movement disorders, including PD and dystonia. We discuss the mechanisms of how dopaminergic input modulates BDNF/TrkB signaling at corticostriatal synapses and the involvement of these mechanisms in neuronal function and synaptic plasticity. Evidence for alterations of BDNF and TrkB in PD patients and animal models are reviewed, and the potential of BDNF to act as a therapeutic agent is highlighted. Advancing our understanding of these mechanisms could pave the way toward innovative therapeutic strategies aiming at restoring neuroplasticity and enhancing motor function in these diseases."

    "abstract": "Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1)-antibody encephalitis (LGI1e), the major form of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) presented with memory loss and faciobrachial dystonic seizure, commonly develops in aged population. Hematologic aging is often accompanied by clonal hematopoiesis (CH), a phenomenon in which specific mutations accumulate, potentially leading to autoimmune disorders or malignancies. Our research aimed to investigate the connection between clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and LGI1e. Peripheral blood samples from consecutive LGI1e patients were collected and analyzed for 24 clonal CHIP using targeted gene sequencing. The results were compared to a control dataset from an ethnically matched health care cohort. Patient characteristics were analyzed based on their CHIP status. A total of 52 LGI1e patients were enrolled for this study. Among them, three patients (5.8%) exhibited functional mutations in the ASXL1 gene, one of the CHIP-associated genes analyzed by targeted sequencing. This frequency was significantly higher compared to that of the control cohort (1%, p = 0.015). Nevertheless, the patients showed no difference in the clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and immunotherapy outcomes. LGI1e showed high frequency of ASXL1 functional mutation in the CHIP analysis, which may contribute to the underlying pathogenesis. Further research is needed to determine its direct role in the development of autoimmunity and disease progression."

    "abstract": "To study the prevalence and clinical features of cervical dystonia in Parkinson's disease (CD-PD). PD features various forms of dystonia, including CD. Yet, the prevalence and clinical features of CD in PD patients are not well-characterized. We conducted a single site, prospective study where consecutively evaluated PD patients were examined for the presence of CD to ascertain its prevalence. For each case of CD-PD, a standardized questionnaire assessing demographic and clinical features was completed. Statistical analysis was performed to compare CD-PD characteristics to those of a previously published large idiopathic CD cohort. Of 301 consecutive PD patients evaluated, 28 (9.3 %) had CD, far surpassing estimates of CD prevalence in the general population. This CD-PD cohort was predominantly male (71 %) with a mean age of 70.9 ± 8.1 years. The mean duration of PD was 10.4 ± 6.7 years. In most cases (n = 19, 68 %), CD developed after the onset of PD. Five patients reported dystonia improvements in response to levodopa, while none reported medication-induced worsening. In contrast to CD-PD, those with ICD (n = 209) were on average younger (59.7 ± 10.1) and mostly female (74 %, p < 0.001). In addition, CD-PD was overall less severe as measured by the Global Dystonia Rating Scale (GDRS) (p = 0.002) and featured less head tremor and pain. Our findings indicate CD is overrepresented in PD compared to the general population and has clinical features distinct from those of ICD. These results justify larger, more comprehensive studies of CD-PD to better understand its frequency, pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, and associated risk factors."

    "abstract": "Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) is widely used in treating dystonia and spasticity to managing chronic migraine and cosmetic applications. However, its immunogenic potential presents challenges, such as the development of neutralizing antibodies that lead to diminished therapeutic efficacy over time, known as secondary nonresponse. This review aims to bridge the knowledge gap regarding the immunogenic mechanisms of BoNT-A and to explore effective management strategies to mitigate these immune responses. The authors conducted a systematic search in databases including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, using keywords related to BoNT-A's immunogenicity. The selection process refined 157 initial articles down to 23 relevant studies, which underwent analysis to investigate the underlying mechanisms of immunogenicity and the factors influencing it. The analysis revealed that both the neurotoxin component and the neurotoxin-associated proteins could elicit an immune response. However, only antibodies against the core toxin influence therapeutic outcomes. Various patient-specific factors such as genetic predispositions and prior immune experiences, along with treatment-related factors such as dosage and frequency, play crucial roles in shaping these responses. Understanding the specific immunogenic triggers and responses to BoNT-A is critical for optimizing treatment protocols and improving patient outcomes."

While the usage of type-B toxin is less common, there is a growing interest in using type-B toxin, especially in those who are treatment resistant. To evaluate the primary FDA-approved clinical applications of rimabotulinumtoxinB, along with established and emerging off-label clinical indications. Articles were reviewed from PubMed database and Food and Drug Adminstration guidelines. Facial rhytids tend to use a higher conversion ratio between type A and type B toxin, due to type B toxin's weaker affinity to muscles and higher affinity for sweat glands. Specially, a 1:100 to 1:50 ratio was utilized for glabellar rhytids, a 1:25 to 1:50 ratio for periocular rhytids, a 1:50 to 1:66.6 ratio for cervical dystonia, a 1:20 to 1:50 ratio for hyperhidrosis, and a 1:25 to 30 ratio for sialorrhea. Type B toxin has demonstrated its safety and efficacy in treating facial rhytids, cervical dystonia, sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis, with potential for novel applications under investigation. Regardless of injection location and clinical applications, dry mouth and dysphagia remained the most common side effects. Across all indications, type B toxin appeared to have a faster onset of action, a dose-dependent clinical duration, and a dose-dependent adverse effect profile."

    "abstract": "Our objective was to provide expert consensus on best practices for anatomy teaching and training on ultrasound-guided botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) injection for specialists involved in treating spasticity and dystonia. Nine experts (three neurologists; six physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians) participated in a three-round modified Delphi process. Over three rounds, experts reached consensus on 15 of 16 statements describing best practices for anatomy and BoNT-A injection training. They unanimously agreed that knowledge of the target audience, including their needs and current competency, is crucial when designing training programs. Experts also agreed that alignment between instructors is essential to ensure consistency of approach over time and between regions, and that training programs should be simple, adaptable, and \"hands-on\" to enhance engagement and learning. Consensus was also reached for several other key areas of training program development. The best-practice principles identified by expert consensus could aid in the development of effective, standardized programs for anatomy teaching and BoNT-A injection training for the purposes of treating spasticity and dystonia. This will enhance the exchange of knowledge, skills, and educational approaches between global experts, allowing more specialists to treat important movement disorders and ultimately improving patient outcomes."

Botulinum toxin (BoNT) injections are commonly used to treat these disorders. We sought to describe patient characteristics, BoNT utilization, and potential adverse events (AEs) among patients with cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, and hemifacial spasm using Optum's de-identified Clinformatics<sup>®</sup> Data Mart Database. Patients were required to have a diagnosis of the specific condition plus evidence of treatment with BoNT between 8/1/2010 and 5/31/2022. Cervical dystonia patients were commonly females (76%) and aged 45 and older (78%); both blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm patients were commonly females (both 69%) and aged 65 and older (61% and 56%, respectively). Anticholinergics were commonly used (65-82% across cohorts), as were peripheral muscle relaxants for cervical dystonia patients specifically (31%). The median number of injections per year was 2 with the median weeks between injections being between 13 and 15. Of the AEs evaluated, dyspnea was identified frequently across all the cohorts (14-20%). The findings were similar for different BoNT formulations. More research is needed to thoroughly describe BoNT utilization, such as the doses injected, and to optimize treatment for patients with these conditions."

In this way, the present manuscript aims to systematically review Pisa syndrome secondary to drugs. Two reviewers identified and assessed relevant reports in six databases without language restriction between January 1990 and June 2024. The prevalence of Pisa syndrome varied from 0.037 to 9.3%. We found 109 articles containing 191 cases of drug-induced Pisa syndrome reported in the literature. The mean and median ages were 59.70 (SD = 19.02) and 67 (range = 12-98 years). The most prevalent sex was female, 56.91% (107/188). The most frequent medications associated with Pisa syndrome were acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in 87 individuals. Of 112 individuals in which the onset time from the medication to the movement disorder occurrence was reported, 59 took place within a month. In this way, a return to baseline was observed in 45.50% of the cases, and partial recovery was observed in 14.28%. We proposed new diagnostic criteria for Pisa syndrome based on previous findings in the literature. Moreover, multiple mechanisms are probably involved in balance control and the development of lateral trunk flexions."

    "abstract": "The dichotomy between the hypo- versus hyperkinetic nature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia, respectively, is thought to be reflected in the underlying basal ganglia pathophysiology. In this study, we investigated differences in globus pallidus internus (GPi) neuronal activity, and short- and long-term plasticity of direct pathway projections. Using microelectrode recording data collected from the GPi during deep brain stimulation surgery, we compared neuronal spiketrain features between people with PD and those with dystonia, as well as correlated neuronal features with respective clinical scores. Additionally, we characterized and compared readouts of short- and long-term synaptic plasticity using measures of inhibitory evoked field potentials. GPi neurons were slower, bustier, and less regular in dystonia. In PD, symptom severity positively correlated with the power of low-beta frequency spiketrain oscillations. In dystonia, symptom severity negatively correlated with firing rate and positively correlated with neuronal variability and the power of theta frequency spiketrain oscillations. Dystonia was moreover associated with less long-term plasticity and slower synaptic depression. We substantiated claims of hyper- versus hypofunctional GPi output in PD versus dystonia, and provided cellular-level validation of the pathological nature of theta and low-beta oscillations in respective disorders. Such circuit changes may be underlain by disease-related differences in plasticity of striato-pallidal synapses. This project was made possible with the financial support of Health Canada through the Canada Brain Research Fund, an innovative partnership between the Government of Canada (through Health Canada) and Brain Canada, and of the Azrieli Foundation (LM), as well as a grant from the Banting Research Foundation in partnership with the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation (LM)."

    "abstract": "Cervical hemivertebrae (C3-6) causing significant osseous torticollis, head tilt and facial asymmetry are rare and complicated. Cervical hemivertebrectomy (CHVE) by a posterior-only approach was never reported because it is highly risky and its efficacy remains controversial. This study is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary clinical outcomes of posterior-only approach for CHVE and torticollis correction in young children. Four young children aged 5-9 years old with significant torticollis caused by cervical hemivertebrae underwent deformity correction consisting of cervical pedicle screw (CPS) placement with O-arm-based intraoperative navigation, CHVE using ultrasonic bone scalpel and short-segmental posterior instrumentation and fusion. Details of this novel technique were presented. The preliminary short-term clinical and radiographic outcomes were assessed. On average, the operative time was 312.5 ± 49.9 min, and the surgical blood loss was 375.0 ± 150.0 ml. The structural cervical scoliosis was corrected from 31.5 ± 7.3° to 11.0 ± 4.1°, and the average correction rate was 64.9%. Head tilt was favorably corrected from 11.0 ± 4.2° to 3.5 ± 2.6°. The shoulder balance improved from 6.3 ± 1.3° to 1.5 ± 1.9°. One case with C6 CHVE had convex side radiating nerve root pain but no sign of muscle power weakness. Full recovery was achieved one month after surgery. No other complication occurred. CHVE by a posterior-only approach was a feasible alternative option for the treatment of congenital cervical scoliosis. It could resect the CHV effectively and achieve satisfactory torticollis correction without additional anterior access surgery. Successful CPS placement in this child population was essentially important to enable reliable osteotomy closure and firm posterior instrumentation."

We identified 26 patients (22 families, 15 males) of genetically-confirmed PLAN with a median age of 22.5 years and age at onset of 13.0 years, encompassing various subtypes: infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (5/26;19.2%), atypical neuroaxonal dystrophy (3/26;11.5%), dystonia-parkinsonism (5/26;19.2%), dystonia-parkinsonism-myoclonus (n = 4, 15.38%), early-onset Parkinson's disease (2/26;7.7%), complex dystonia (2/26;7.7%), and complicated hereditary spastic paraparesis (cHSP; 5/26;19.2%). The common initial symptoms included walking difficulty (7/26;26.9%), developmental regression (6/26;23.1%), and slowness (4/26;15.4%). Dystonia (14/26;53.8%), followed by parkinsonism (11/26; 42.3%), was the most common motor symptom. Non-motor symptoms included cognitive decline (12/26;46.2%) and behavioral changes (6/26;23.1%). Neuroimaging revealed cerebellar atrophy in 23/26 (88.5%) patients and claval hypertrophy in 80% (4/5) of INAD patients. Levodopa responsiveness was noted in 12 of 14 patients with parkinsonism/dystonia who received levodopa, and dyskinesia was noted in 10/11 patients. Genetic analysis revealed a total of 19 unique variants in <i>PLA2G6</i> gene, of which 11 were novel. Twelve patients harbored the c.2222G>A variant, which is predominantly seen in Asian subpopulations. The study introduces 26 new patients of PLAN and 12 patients associated with the c.2222G>A variant, potentially forming the most extensive single center series to date.

Initially developed for movement disorders like Parkinson's disease, DBS has expanded to psychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, anorexia nervosa, dystonia, essential tremor, and Tourette's syndrome. This paper explores the clinical efficacy and ethical considerations of DBS in treating these disorders. While DBS has shown substantial promise in alleviating symptoms and improving quality of life, it raises ethical challenges, including issues of informed consent, patient selection, long-term management, and equitable access to treatment. The irreversible nature of DBS, potential adverse effects, and the high cost of the procedure necessitate a rigorous ethical framework to guide its application. The ongoing evolution of neuromodulation requires continuous ethical analysis and the development of guidelines to ensure that DBS is used responsibly and equitably across different patient populations. This paper underscores the need for a balanced approach that integrates clinical efficacy with ethical considerations to optimize patient outcomes and ensure sustainable practice."

After one month of medication, the extent of the head drop reached 90°. Examination revealed hypertrophy of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle, but no weakness of the extensor muscles in the cervical region. Surface electromyography demonstrated co-‍contraction of the sternocleidomastoid and splenius capitus muscles during head flexion and extension. DNP was withdrawn, resulting in immediate amelioration of the head drop, and complete resolution was achieved after two months. Although head drop is often seen in patients with Parkinson's disease, few previous reports have documented DNP as a causative factor. If patients with Parkinson's disease develop head drop, it is important to investigate any history of DNP medication."

This review investigated these advancements in terms of providing practical, low-cost solutions for the diagnosis and analysis of movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, ataxia, dyskinesia, and Tourette syndrome. Traditional diagnostic methods for movement disorders are typically reliant on the subjective assessment of motor symptoms, which poses inherent challenges. Furthermore, early symptoms are often overlooked, and overlapping symptoms across diseases can complicate early diagnosis. Consequently, deep learning has been used for the objective video-based analysis of movement disorders. This study systematically reviewed the latest advancements in automatic two-dimensional & three-dimensional video analysis using deep learning for movement disorders. We comprehensively analyzed the literature published until September 2023 by searching the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases. We identified 68 relevant studies and extracted information on their objectives, datasets, modalities, and methodologies. The study aimed to identify, catalogue, and present the most significant advancements, offering a consolidated knowledge base on the role of video analysis and deep learning in movement disorder analysis. First, the objectives, including specific PD symptom quantification, ataxia assessment, cerebral palsy assessment, gait disorder analysis, tremor assessment, tic detection (in the context of Tourette syndrome), dystonia assessment, and abnormal movement recognition were discussed. Thereafter, the datasets used in the study were examined. Subsequently, video modalities and deep learning methodologies related to the topic were investigated. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in terms of datasets, interpretability, evaluation methods, and home/remote monitoring were discussed."

During Round 1, a panel of 9 US movement disorder specialists rated the appropriateness of prescribing apomorphine therapy with and without antiemetic pretreatment across 192 patient scenarios and were able to review their scores in relation to other scores. During the Round 2, consensus was defined for each scenario as either strong (>75 % agreement) or moderate (66 % agreement). There was strong consensus on 118 of 192 scenario's (97 as appropriate and 21 as inappropriate), moderate consensus on 29 scenarios, some agreement on 32 scenarios, and lack of agreement on 13 scenarios. In the absence of an antiemetic, there was strong consensus that titration schedules should be flexible and based on dose response. However, the group only reached moderate consensus on the speed of titration, highlighting the need for more systematic information on this area. In the presence of an antiemetic, panelists considered usual initial dosing and flexible titration to be appropriate in most scenarios except for when the patient is already experiencing dopaminergic adverse events. Experts generally reached consensus that apomorphine can usually be prescribed without antiemetic pretreatment. Recommendations described here reflect the areas of greatest agreement among a panel of experts based on current available evidence."

    "title": "Paroxysmal movement disorders.",
    "abstract": "Paroxysmal movement disorders include two groups of intermittent neurologic disorders: paroxysmal dyskinesia, in which episodes of involuntary hyperkinetic movements (mainly chorea and/or dystonia) occur with preserved consciousness, and episodic ataxias, which are characterized by discrete attacks of cerebellar dysfunction, sometimes associated with progressive ataxia. Since episodic ataxias are individually discussed in Chapter 8 of this volume, we herein provide a deep overview of phenotypic, genetic, pathophysiologic, diagnostic, and treatment aspects of paroxysmal dyskinesia, following the trigger-based nomenclature which distinguishes paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia, and paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia. Emerging paroxysmal dyskinesia not fulfilling the criteria for the above-mentioned subtypes will also be discussed. Phenotypic and genotypic overlap among paroxysmal movement disorders, epilepsy, and migraine have progressively emerged, thus shedding light on a shared pathophysiologic framework. Advances in our understanding of the pathomechanisms underlying paroxysmal movement disorders, which involve dysfunctions of ion channels, proteins associated with the vesical synaptic cycle machinery, and proteins involved in neuronal energy metabolism, point toward a discrete number of converging pathophysiologic pathways and may lay foundations for developing target-specific therapies."

    "abstract": "This study aims to describe movement disorders secondary to cocaine use. To our knowledge, while these presentations have been previously reported in the literature, a comprehensive review has not been published yet. We searched six databases from 1986 to 2022 without language restriction. Case reports, case series, and literature reviews have been analysed to find associations between cocaine use and movement disorders. The present study encompasses epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnostic challenges of abnormal movements associated with cocaine use. This review highlights the importance of proper initial evaluation and investigation taking into account the broad spectrum of differential diagnoses and exclusion of primary movement disorders. The role of the dopaminergic system in movement disorders is reviewed. Cocaine use is associated with movement disorders such as dystonia, parkinsonism, akathisia, and tics. The complex interaction of multiple factors, including other neurological conditions, such as Tourette syndrome, and additional substances of abuse is discussed. The presentation of these manifestations is often heterogeneous and does not follow a specific pattern. In this way, future research is needed to improve our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms and develop novel drug targets for these disorders. Increased awareness among the general public and policymakers could translate into reduced stigma and improved care."

    "abstract": "Aceruloplasminemia (ACP) is a rare genetic disorder that manifests in adulthood due to mutations in the CP (ceruloplasmin) gene, causing iron accumulation and neurodegeneration. Clinically, ACP presents with a range of symptoms, including mild microcytic anemia, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, retinopathy, progressive neurological symptoms such as cerebellar ataxia, involuntary movements, parkinsonism, mood and behavior disorders, and cognitive impairment. We present the case of a 53-year-old female with a history of first-degree consanguinity and a sister with anemia. At six years old, she developed asthenia, leading to multiple hospitalizations for acute hemolytic anemia requiring transfusions and iron therapy. She exhibited later memory disturbances, slowed comprehension, social withdrawal, and school discontinuation. At the age of 51, she developed gait disturbances, unexplained falls, and cognitive decline. One year later, cranial CT revealed a chronic bilateral subdural hematoma. On admission at 53, she had anarthria, right hemiparesis, diffuse rigidity, mouth dystonia, oculomotor paralysis, and intellectual deterioration. MRI showed superficial cortical and leptomeningeal hemosiderin deposits and bilateral signal anomalies in various deep brain regions. EEG revealed paroxysmal anomalies and abdominal MRI indicated hepatic iron overload. Laboratory tests confirmed ACP. This case highlights the rare and severe neurological and systemic manifestations of ACP, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and intervention in such degenerative diseases to prevent irreversible neurological complications."

    "abstract": "Psychiatric disturbances are commonly associated with adult-onset isolated dystonia (AOID); however, the mechanisms underlying psychiatric abnormalities in AOID remain unknown. We aimed to investigate the structural and functional brain changes in AOID patients with anxiety, and identify imaging biomarkers for diagnosing anxiety. Structural and functional magnetic resonance was performed on 69 AOID patients and 35 healthy controls (HCs). The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) was used to assess anxiety symptoms in AOID patients and assign patients to AOID with and without anxiety groups. Group differences in grey matter volume, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional ALFF, and regional homogeneity (ReHo) were evaluated. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) was used as a metric to identify imaging biomarkers for diagnosing anxiety. AOID patients with anxiety exhibited an increased ALFF and ReHo in the left angular gyrus (ANG.L) compared with those without and HCs (voxel P<0.001 and cluster P<0.05, corrected using GRF). A significant positive correlation was observed between ALFF (r = 0.627, P<0.001) and ReHo (r = 0.515, P<0.001) in the ANG.L and HAMA scores in AOID patients. ALFF and ReHo in the ANG.L exhibited an ROC AUC of 0.904 and 0.851, respectively, in distinguishing AOID patients with anxiety from those without and an ROC AUC of 0.887 and 0.853, respectively, in distinguishing AOID patients with anxiety from HCs. These findings provide new insights into the pathophysiology of psychiatric disturbances and highlight potential candidate biomarkers for identifying anxiety in AOID patients."

We further describe treatment of a 3-year-old patient with the common pathogenic GNAO1 variant c607G>A, p.Gly203Arg with oral 50 mg zinc (in the form of zinc acetate) daily, as applied in Wilson's disease. During 11 months of treatment, the patient shows cessation of daily dyskinetic crises, improved Burke-Fahn Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale movement score, reduction in epileptic seizures, and an excellent safety profile. Our findings warrant a large-scale clinical trial and might set the new standard of care for GNAO1-related disorders.

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the activity and connectivity of cerebral and cerebellar cortices underlying the sensory trick (ST) effects in patients with cervical dystonia (CD), using electroencephalography (EEG). We recruited 15 CD patients who exhibited clinically effective ST and 15 healthy controls (HCs) who mimicked the ST maneuver. EEG signals and multiple-channel electromyography (EMG) were recorded simultaneously during resting and acting stages. EEG source analysis and functional connectivity were performed. To account for the effects of sensory processing, we calculated relative power changes as the difference in power spectral density between resting and the maneuver execution. ST induced a decrease in low gamma (30-50 Hz) spectral power in the primary sensory and cerebellar cortices, which remained lower than in HCs during the maintenance period. Compared with HCs, patients exhibited consistently strengthened connectivity within the sensorimotor network during the maintenance period, particularly in the primary sensory-sensorimotor cerebellum connection. The application of ST resulted in altered cortical excitability and functional connectivity regulated by gamma oscillation in CD patients, suggesting that this effect cannot be solely attributed to motor components. The cerebellum may play important roles in mediating the ST effects."

    "abstract": "Although previous studies have described phenomenological diagnoses, they lacked description of aetiological spectrum in patients visiting movement disorders (MD) service. Herein, we classify the MD phenomenology and describe aetiology wise distribution of each phenomenology in patients visiting a tertiary care movement disorders service. Collected information included demographic profile (age of onset, age at presentation, gender, duration of illness before presentation), predominant MD phenomenology [such as parkinsonism, dystonia, ataxia, tremor, chorea, ballism, myoclonus, tics, stereotypy, restless legs syndrome (RLS) and others], diagnostic evaluations and detected aetiology. This observational study included 1140 MD patients over a span of 5 years. The median (IQR) age of onset was 49 (35-60) years and age at presentation was 54 (40-65) years, with median duration of illness being 36 (18-72) months. Nearly two-third of patients were males (M:F=731:409). Parkinsonism (n=494, 43.3 %) was the most common MD phenomenology observed, followed by dystonia (n=219, 19.2 %), ataxia (n=125, 11 %), tremor (n=118, 10.4 %), myoclonus (n=73, 6.4 %), chorea (n=40, 3.5 %), spasticity (n=22, 1.9 %), tics (n=8, 0.7 %), and RLS (n=8, 0.7 %). Thirty-three (2.9 %) patients were grouped under miscellaneous MDs. Overall, neurodegenerative disorders (57.4 %) were the most common cause of MDs. Parkinson's disease, genetic dystonia, essential tremor, genetic ataxias, hemifacial spasm, and Huntington's disease were the most common aetiologies for parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, ataxia, myoclonus, and chorea, respectively. Parkinsonism was the most common phenomenology observed in MD patients, and was followed by dystonia, ataxia and tremor. Neurodegenerative disorders were the most common aetiology detected."

This study aims to investigate the function of <i>ATP1A3</i> c.823G>C (p.Ala275Pro) mutant at the cellular and zebrafish models. ATP1A3 wild-type and mutant Hela cell lines were constructed, and ATP1A3 mRNA expression, <i>ATP1A3</i> protein expression and localization, and Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity in each group of cells were detected. Additionally, we also constructed zebrafish models with <i>ATP1A3</i> wild-type overexpression (WT) and p.Ala275Pro mutant overexpression (MUT). Subsequently, we detected the mRNA expression of dopamine signaling pathway-associated genes, Parkinson's disease-associated genes, and apoptosisassociated genes in each group of zebrafish, and observed the growth, development, and movement behavior of zebrafish. Cells carrying the p.Ala275Pro mutation exhibited lower levels of <i>ATP1A3</i> mRNA, reduced <i>ATP1A3</i> protein expression, and decreased Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity compared to wild-type cells. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that <i>ATP1A3</i> was primarily localized in the cytoplasm, but there was no significant difference in <i>ATP1A3</i> protein localization before and after the mutation. In the zebrafish model, both WT and MUT groups showed lower brain and body length, dopamine neuron fluorescence intensity, escape ability, swimming distance, and average swimming speed compared to the control group. Moreover, overexpression of both wild-type and mutant <i>ATP1A3</i> led to abnormal mRNA expression of genes associated with the dopamine signaling pathway and Parkinson's disease in zebrafish, and significantly upregulated transcription levels of <i>bad</i> and <i>caspase-3</i> in the apoptosis signaling pathway, while reducing the transcriptional level of <i>bcl-2</i> and the <i>bcl-2/bax</i> ratio. This study reveals that the p.Ala275Pro mutant decreases <i>ATP1A3</i> protein expression and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. Abnormal expression of either wild-type or mutant <i>ATP1A3</i> genes impairs growth, development, and movement behavior in zebrafish."

    "abstract": "Movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia, are characterized by their predominant motor symptoms, yet diseases causing abnormal movement also encompass several other symptoms, including non-motor symptoms. Here we review recent advances from studies of brain lesions, neuroimaging, and neuromodulation that provide converging evidence on symptom-specific brain networks in movement disorders. Although movement disorders have traditionally been conceptualized as disorders of the basal ganglia, cumulative data from brain lesions causing parkinsonism, tremor and dystonia have now demonstrated that this view is incomplete. Several recent studies have shown that lesions causing a given movement disorder occur in heterogeneous brain locations, but disrupt common brain networks, which appear to be specific to each motor phenotype. In addition, findings from structural and functional neuroimaging in movement disorders have demonstrated that brain abnormalities extend far beyond the brain networks associated with the motor symptoms. In fact, neuroimaging findings in each movement disorder are strongly influenced by the constellation of patients' symptoms that also seem to map to specific networks rather than individual anatomical structures or single neurotransmitters. Finally, observations from deep brain stimulation have demonstrated that clinical changes, including both symptom improvement and side effects, are dependent on the modulation of large-scale networks instead of purely local effects of the neuromodulation. Combined, this multimodal evidence suggests that symptoms in movement disorders arise from distinct brain networks, encouraging multimodal imaging studies to better characterize the underlying symptom-specific mechanisms and individually tailor treatment approaches."

This disorder is characterized by neuroregression, ataxia and dystonia with basal ganglia abnormalities on neuroimaging. To date, 27 families have been reported with THMD5 due to variants in TPK1 . We ascertained three individuals from three unrelated families. Singleton exome sequencing was performed on all three individuals, followed by in silico mutagenesis of the mutant TPK protein. Additionally, we reviewed the genotypic and phenotypic information of 27 previously reported individuals with THMD5. Singleton exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous variant c.620A>T p.(Asp207Val) in TPK1 (NM_022445.4) in all three individuals. In silico mutagenesis of the mutant protein revealed a decrease in protein stability and altered interactions with its neighboring residues compared to the wild-type protein. Thus, based on strikingly similar clinical and radiological findings compared to the previously reported individuals and with the support of in silico mutagenesis findings, the above-mentioned variant appears to be the probable cause for the condition observed in the affected individuals in this study. We report a novel homozygous variant in TPK1 , which appears to be recurrent among the Indian population."

    "abstract": "Laryngeal dystonia (LD), previously termed spasmodic dysphonia, is an isolated focal dystonia that involves involuntary, uncontrolled contractions of the laryngeal muscles during speech. It is a severely disabling condition affecting patients' work and social lives through prevention of normal speech production. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of LD and available therapeutic options are currently limited. The aim of this short review is to provide an up-to-date summary of what is known about the central mechanisms and the pathophysiology of LD. A systematic review of the literature was performed searching Embase, CINHAL, Medline, and Cochrane with the cover period January 1990-October 2023 with a search strategy ((\"Laryngeal dystonia\" OR \"Spasmodic dysphonia\") AND (\"Central Mechanism\" OR \"Pathophysiology\")). Original studies involving LD patients that discussed central mechanisms and/or pathophysiology of LD were chosen. Two hundred twenty-six articles were identified of which 27 articles were included to formulate this systematic review following the screening inclusion and exclusion criteria. LD is a central neurological disorder involving a multiregional altered neural network. Affected neural circuits not only involve the motor control circuit, but also the feedforward, and the feedback circuits of the normal speech production neural network, involving higher-order planning, somatosensory perception and integration regions of the brain. Speech production is a complex process, and LD is a central neurological disorder involving multiregional neural network connectivity alteration reflecting this. Neuromodulation targeting the central nervous system could therefore be considered and explored as a new potential therapeutic option for LD in the future, and should assist in elucidating the underlying central mechanisms responsible for causing the condition."

We present the case of a 26-year-old woman, previously diagnosed with a functional neurological disorder-with fixed dystonia phenotype in the right upper limb-, admitted to our hospital for a severe depressive episode. After noting the absence of clinical improvement with psychopharmacological treatment, it was decided to give electroconvulsive therapy, receiving a total of 11 sessions, 9 of which were effective, with bifrontotemporal application, three times a week. The patient experienced a significant improvement, not only at an affective and behavioral level, but also in the dystonia, recovering most of the mobility in the right hand and completely relinquishing the pain. Although scientific evidence is scarce regarding the use of electroconvulsive therapy in functional neurological disorders, this clinical case supports the existing literature and raises this therapy as a possibility in resistant and comorbid conditions with severe affective disorders."

The clinical symptoms were found to be mental retardation, obesity, dystonia, movement limitation, and visual retardation. Early development was normal, but after 6 months, the child developed upright head instability, difficulty grasping, and seizures. Symptoms and Signs: The child presents with mental retardation, obesity, increased muscle tone, motor dysfunction, visual impairment, and seizures. A whole exon test was performed to detect a neurite extension and migration factor (NEXMIF) gene mutation (NM_001008537.2: c.1042C > T (p. Arg348*)), which is known to be associated with intellectual disability and neurological symptoms. In addition, the test revealed a mutation in the Kinase D interacting substrate of 220 kDa (KIDINS220) gene (NM_020738.2: c.3242_3243insC (p. Leu1082AIafs*5)) with a heterozygous mutation in the father and wild type in the mother. The patient was treated with anti-infection, aerosol inhalation, calcium supplement, and anti-epileptic drugs (levetiracetam), and the disease was controlled. Home and hospital rehabilitation is also underway. The condition of the child improved after treatment and no seizures occurred again. The patient needs continuous rehabilitation treatment and follow-up observation. For male children with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders and comorbidities such as obesity, dystonia, and seizures, mutations in related genes such as NEXMIF should be considered. Clinical practice should improve genetic testing as early as possible to provide a basis for genetic counseling."

Treatment is typically medical and conservative, with surgical interventions reserved for recurrences and late presentations. We discuss here two cases of C1-C2 subluxation. The first case involves a 10-year-old child with subluxation following a rhinopharyngitis. This presentation is the classical manifestation of Grisel's syndrome. Prompt management led to correction of the subluxation using medical treatment and a soft Philadelphia collar. The second case involves a 34-year-old adult who developed posterior headaches after sphenoidotomy surgery. Grisel's syndrome is less common in adults, leading to clinical challenges and delayed diagnosis (> 1 month).

To report on neuroradiological, neurophysiological targeting and long-term efficacy of thalamic Ventral-Oralis complex and Zona Incerta deep brain stimulation in Midline Tremor. Three patients (two males and one female) with Midline Tremor in dystonic syndromes were recruited for this open-label study. Clinical, surgical, neurophysiological intraoperative testing and long-term follow-up data are reported. Intraoperative testing and reconstruction of volume of tissue activated confirmed the position of the electrodes in the area stimulated between the thalamic Ventral-Oralis complex and Zona Incerta in all patients. All three patients showed optimal control of both tremor and dystonic features at short-term (6 months) and long-term follow-up (up to 6 years). No adverse events occurred. In the syndromes of Midline Tremor of various origins, the best target for DBS might be difficult to identify.

In total, 72 children (41 male, 31 female) with CMT who underwent endoscopic surgery at the Department of Orthopedics, Xi'an Children's Hospital, between January 2021 and January 2023 were included. Their mean age was 54 ± 36.1 (range, 12-141) months. Of these, 29 (40.3%) cases involved the left side while 43 (59.7%) involved the right side. Preoperative preparation involved precise body surface markings of the sternocleidomastoid muscle(SCM), clavicle, and important nerve and blood vessels, followed by the establishment of surgical channels through passive separation techniques. An arthroscope and a low-temperature plasma knife were utilized for accurate localization and surgical release of the clavicular and sternal heads of the SCM. The duration of surgery, blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, neck range of motion measurements, and any intraoperative or postoperative complications were analyzed using the rank sum test. Cervical and thoracic braces were applied for three months postoperatively, with follow-up assessments conducted using Cheng's scoring system. All patients successfully underwent endoscopic surgery, without the need for conversion to open surgery. No intra- or postoperative complications were observed. The average surgical duration was 56.4 ± 15.7 min, with minimal intraoperative bleeding (1-5 mL) and no need for blood transfusion. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 2.7 ± 0.8 days. Over a mean follow-up period of 22.2 ± 5.5 (range, 14-32) months, significant improvements were observed in neck rotation (from 20.2° [17.7° to 25°] to only 3.6° [2° to 6.7°]) and lateral flexion (from 19° [17° to 22.6°] to only 3° [2° to 7.8°]) restrictions (p < 0.05). According to Cheng's scoring system, 70 (97.2%) patients achieved excellent or good clinical outcomes, while 2 (2.8%) had average outcomes. The torticollis deformity was corrected during the follow-up period, and all surgical incisions healed without noticeable scarring. Endoscopic release is a safe, effective, and minimally invasive treatment option for CMT in children."

We define severe acute motor exacerbations (SAME) as acute/subacute motor symptoms that persist for hours-to-days with a severity that compromise vital signs (temperature, breath, and heart rate) and bulbar function (swallowing/dysphagia). Phenomenology includes dystonia, choreoathetosis, combined movement disorders, weakness, and hemiplegic attacks. SAME can develop in diverse diseases and can be preceded by triggers or catabolic states. Recent descriptions of SAME in complex neurodevelopmental and epileptic encephalopathies have broadened appreciation of this presentation beyond inborn errors of metabolism. A high degree of clinical suspicion is required to identify appropriately targeted investigations and management. We conducted a comprehensive literature analysis of etiologies. Reported triggers are described and classified as per pathophysiological mechanism. A video of six cases displaying multiple SAME with diverse outcomes is provided. We identified 50 different conditions that manifest SAME, some associated with developmental regression. Etiologies include disorders of metabolism: energy substrate, amino acids, complex molecules, vitamins/cofactors, minerals, and neurotransmitters/synaptic vesicle cycling. Non-metabolic neurodegenerative and genetic disorders that present with movement disorders and epilepsy can additionally manifest SAME. A limited number of triggers are grouped here, together with an approach to investigations and general management strategies. Several neurogenetic and neurometabolic disorders manifest SAME. Identifying triggers can help in certain cases narrow the differential diagnosis and guide the expeditious application of targeted therapies to minimize adverse developmental and neurological consequences. This process may inform pathogenesis and eventually improve our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the development of SAME. © 2024 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."

Canine PDs are diagnosed based on the clinical presentation, history, and phenomenology. For the latter, a video recording of the paroxysmal event is extremely useful. An etiological classification of canine PDs includes genetic (proven and suspected), reactive (drug-induced, toxic, metabolic, and dietary), structural (neoplasia, inflammatory, and other structural causes), and unknown causes. In this review, an overview of all reported canine PDs is provided with emphasis on phenotype, genotype, and, where possible, pathophysiology and treatment for each reported canine PD."

    "title": "TorsinA is essential for neuronal nuclear pore complex localization and maturation.",
    "abstract": "As lifelong interphase cells, neurons face an array of unique challenges. A key challenge is regulating nuclear pore complex (NPC) biogenesis and localization, the mechanisms of which are largely unknown. Here we identify neuronal maturation as a period of strongly upregulated NPC biogenesis. We demonstrate that the AAA+ protein torsinA, whose dysfunction causes the neurodevelopmental movement disorder DYT-TOR1A dystonia and co-ordinates NPC spatial organization without impacting total NPC density. We generated an endogenous Nup107-HaloTag mouse line to directly visualize NPC organization in developing neurons and find that torsinA is essential for proper NPC localization. In the absence of torsinA, the inner nuclear membrane buds excessively at sites of mislocalized nascent NPCs, and the formation of complete NPCs is delayed. Our work demonstrates that NPC spatial organization and number are independently determined and identifies NPC biogenesis as a process vulnerable to neurodevelopmental disease insults."

    "abstract": "Lesch-Nyhan Disease (LND) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder arising from hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 gene mutations, leading to a complete deficiency. LND presents a complex neurological profile characterized by generalized dystonia, motor dysfunctions and self-injurious behavior, which management is challenging. We conducted a systematic review of studies assessing the efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in management of neurological symptoms in LND (PROSPERO registration number:CRD42023446513). Among 34 reviewed full-text papers; 22 studies were rated as having a high risk of bias. Considerable heterogeneity was found in studies regarding the timing of treatment implementation, adjunctive treatments and outcome assessment. Single-patient studies and clinical trials often showed contradictory results, while therapeutic failures were underreported. S-Adenosylmethionine and Deep Brain Stimulation were the most studied treatment methods and require further research to address inconsistencies. The evidence from levodopa studies underlines that optimal timing of treatment implementation should be thoroughly investigated. Standardized study design and reducing publication bias are crucial to overcome current limitations of assessing intervention efficacy in LND."

    "abstract": "<i>ATP1A3</i> is a Na,K-ATPase gene expressed specifically in neurons in the brain. Human mutations are dominant and produce an unusually wide spectrum of neurological phenotypes, most notably rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism (RDP) and alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC). Here we compared heterozygotes of two mouse lines, a line with little or no expression (<i>Atp1a</i>3<sup>tm1Ling/+</sup>) and a knock-in expressing p.Asp801Tyr (D801Y, <i>Atp1a3</i> <sup>+/D801Y</sup>). Both mouse lines had normal lifespans, but <i>Atp1a3</i> <sup>+/D801Y</sup> had mild perinatal mortality contrasting with D801N mice (<i>Atp1a3</i> <sup>+/D801N</sup>), which had high mortality. The phenotypes of <i>Atp1a</i>3<sup>tm1Ling/+</sup> and <i>Atp1a3</i> <sup>+/D801Y</sup> were different, and testing of each strain was tailored to its symptom range. <i>Atp1a</i>3<sup>tm1Ling/+</sup> mice displayed little at baseline, but repeated ethanol intoxication produced hyperkinetic motor abnormalities not seen in littermate controls. <i>Atp1a3</i> <sup>+/D801Y</sup> mice displayed robust phenotypes: hyperactivity, diminished posture consistent with hypotonia, and deficiencies in beam walk and wire hang tests. Symptoms also included qualitative motor abnormalities that are not well quantified by conventional tests. Paradoxically, <i>Atp1a3</i> <sup>+/D801Y</sup> showed sustained better performance than wild type on the accelerating rotarod. <i>Atp1a3</i> <sup>+/D801Y</sup> mice were overactive in forced swimming and afterward had intense shivering, transient dystonic postures, and delayed recovery. Remarkably, <i>Atp1a3</i> <sup>+/D801Y</sup> mice were refractory to ketamine anesthesia, which elicited hyperactivity and dyskinesia even at higher dose. Neither mouse line exhibited fixed dystonia (typical of RDP patients), spontaneous paroxysmal weakness (typical of AHC patients), or seizures but had consistent, measurable neurological abnormalities. A gradient of variation supports the importance of studying multiple <i>Atp1a3</i> mutations in animal models to understand the roles of this gene in human disease."

    "abstract": "Adult-onset idiopathic focal cervical dystonia (AOIFCD) involves abnormal posturing of the cervical musculature and, in some individuals, an associated head tremor. Existing neuroimaging studies have implicated key motor networks. However, measures used to date lack specificity toward underlying pathophysiologic differences. We aim to assess white matter motor pathways for localized, microstructural differences, which may aid in understanding underlying mechanisms. Individuals diagnosed with AOIFCD and an age- and sex-matched control group were prospectively recruited through the Welsh Movement Disorders Research Network. All participants underwent in-depth clinical phenotyping and MRI (structural and diffusion sequences) using ultra-strong diffusion gradients. Tractography (whole-tract median values) and tractometry (along tract profiling) were performed for key white matter motor pathways assessing diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), and standard model parameters. Groups were compared using linear model analysis with Bonferroni multiple comparison correction. Fifty participants with AOIFCD and 30 healthy control participants were recruited, with 46 with AOIFCD and 30 healthy controls included for analysis (33 without head tremor, 13 with head tremor). Significant differences were observed in the anterior thalamic radiations (lower mid-tract fractional anisotropy [estimate = -0.046, <i>p</i> = 3.07 × 10<sup>-3</sup>], radial kurtosis [estimate = -0.165, <i>p</i> = 1.42 × 10<sup>-4</sup>], <i>f</i>-intra-axonal signal fraction [estimate = -0.044, <i>p</i> = 2.78 × 10<sup>-3</sup>], <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> orientation coherence [estimate = -0.043, <i>p</i> = 1.64 × 10<sup>-3</sup>], higher Orientation Dispersion Index [ODI, estimate = 0.023, <i>p</i> = 2.22 × 10<sup>-3</sup>]) and thalamopremotor tracts (higher mid-tract mean kurtosis [estimate = 0.064, <i>p</i> = 7.56 × 10<sup>-4</sup>], lower Neurite Density Index [estimate = 0.062, <i>p</i> = 2.1 × 10<sup>-3</sup>], higher distal tract ODI [estimate = 0.062, <i>p</i> = 3.1 × 10<sup>-3</sup>], lower <i>f</i> [estimate = -0.1, <i>p</i> = 2.3 × 10<sup>-3</sup>], and striatopremotor tracts [proximal lower <i>f</i>: estimate = -0.075, <i>p</i> = 1.06 × 10<sup>-3</sup>]). These measures correlated with clinical measures: dystonia duration (right thalamopremotor distal ODI: <i>r</i> = -0.9, <i>p</i> = 1.29 × 10<sup>-14</sup>), psychiatric symptoms (obsessive compulsive symptoms: left anterior thalamic radiation <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> <i>r</i> = 0.92, <i>p</i> = 2.797 × 10<sup>-11</sup>), sleep quality (Sleep Disorders Questionnaire Score: left anterior thalamic radiation ODI: <i>r</i> = -0.84, <i>p</i> = 4.84 × 10<sup>-11</sup>), pain (left anterior thalamic radiation ODI: <i>r</i> = -0.89, <i>p</i> = 1.4 × 10<sup>-13</sup>), and cognitive functioning (paired associated learning task <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>r</i> = 0.94, <i>p</i> = 6.68 × 10<sup>-20</sup>). Overall, localized microstructural differences were identified within tracts linking the prefrontal and premotor cortices with thalamic and basal ganglia regions, suggesting pathophysiologic processes involve microstructural aberrances of motor system modulatory pathways, particularly involving intra-axonal and fiber orientation dispersion measures."

    "abstract": "Increased 4-12 Hz oscillatory activity in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical (CBGTC) loop is reported in dystonia. Coherence analysis is a measure of linear coupling between two signals, revealing oscillatory activity drives that are common across motor units. By performing coherence analysis, activity of the CBGTC-loop can be measured with modalities like local field potentials (LFPs), electromyography (EMG), and electro-encephalography (EEG). The aim of this study is to perform a systematic review on the use of coherence analysis for clinical assessment and treatment of dystonia. A systematic review was performed on a search in Embase and PubMed on June 28th, 2023. All studies incorporating coherence analysis and an adult dystonia cohort were included. Three authors evaluated the eligibility of the articles. Quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 checklist. A total of 41 articles were included, with data of 395 adult dystonia patients. In the selected records, six different types of coherence were investigated: corticocortical, corticopallidal, corticomuscular, pallidopallidal, pallidomuscular, and intermuscular coherence. Various types of 4-12 coherence were found to be increased in all dystonia subtypes. There is increased 4-12 Hz coherence found between the cortex, basal ganglia, and affected muscles in all dystonia subtypes. However, the relationship between 4-12 Hz coherence and the dystonic clinical state has not been established. DBS treatment leads to a reduction of 4-12 Hz coherence. In combination with the results of this review, the 4-12 Hz frequency band can be used as a promising phenomenon for the development of a biomarker."

    "abstract": "X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder resulting from an inherited intronic SINE-Alu-VNTR (SVA) retrotransposon in the <i>TAF1</i> gene that causes dysregulation of <i>TAF1</i> transcription. The specific mechanism underlying this dysregulation remains unclear, but it is hypothesized to involve the formation of G-quadruplexes (G4) structures within the XDP-SVA that impede transcription. In this study, we show that ZNF91, a critical repressor of SVA retrotransposons, specifically binds to G4-forming DNA sequences. Further, we found that genetic deletion of ZNF91 exacerbates the molecular phenotype associated with the XDP-SVA insertion in patient cells, while no difference was observed when ZNF91 was deleted from isogenic control cells. Additionally, we observed a significant age-related reduction in ZNF91 expression in whole blood and brain, indicating a progressive loss of repression of the XDP-SVA in XDP. These findings indicate that ZNF91 plays a crucial role in controlling the molecular phenotype associated with XDP. Since ZNF91 binds to G4-forming DNA sequences in SVAs, this suggests that interactions between ZNF91 and G4-forming sequences in the XDP-SVA minimize the severity of the molecular phenotype. Our results showing that ZNF91 expression levels significantly decrease with age provide a potential explanation for the age-related progressive neurodegenerative character of XDP. Collectively, our study provides important insights into the protective role of ZNF91 in XDP pathogenesis and suggests that restoring ZNF91 expression, destabilization of G4s, or targeted repression of the XDP-SVA could be future therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat XDP."

    "abstract": "Biochemical testing is a common first-tier approach in the setting of genetic evaluation of patients with unexplained developmental delay. However, results can be unclear, and a plan for second-tier analysis must be determined based on the patient's biochemical results and clinical presentation - in many cases, triggering a diagnostic odyssey. A male patient from the United States presenting with unexplained developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, and feeding difficulties was referred for clinical genetic evaluation at age 8 months. Biochemical testing revealed an isolated marked elevation of glutaric acid on urine organic acid profile, without elevations of related metabolites. Further testing included <i>GCDH</i> sequencing, a neurometabolic gene panel, chromosomal microarray, Prader Willi/Angelman testing, and lysosomal disease enzyme panel, all of which were non-diagnostic. The patient had persistent developmental delay and hypotonia, dystonia, sensorineural hearing loss, and abnormal brain myelination on magnetic resonance imaging. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed and revealed a dual diagnosis of glutaric aciduria III (GA III) and <i>BCAP31-</i>related disorder, an X-linked intellectual disability syndrome, caused by a novel pathogenic variant. GA III has historically been considered clinically benign, with few reported cases. This patient's presenting symptoms were similar to those commonly seen in GA I and GA II, however the biochemical abnormalities were not consistent with these disorders, prompting additional molecular and biochemical testing. Ultimately, WES confirmed a diagnosis of <i>BCAP31</i>-related syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, which explained the patient's presenting symptoms. WES also identified a secondary diagnosis of GA III. We present a patient with two rare genetic conditions, highlighting the importance of deep phenotyping and the utility of WES in the setting of a patient with dual genetic diagnoses."

To assess the efficacy of GPi, Vim/Vop, and dual DBS in unilateral dystonia. Three patients with unilateral dystonia (two idiopathic, one acquired), implanted with two DBS electrodes targeting ipsilateral Vim/Vop and GPi, were included. Three stimulation modalities were assessed. First, one electrode was activated, then the other, and finally, both electrodes were activated simultaneously. DBS yielded substantial symptomatic reductions in all three evaluated stimulation modalities. Patients exhibited varying responses regarding quality-of-life and depressive symptoms. Treatment satisfaction didn't align with clinical improvements, potentially affected by unrealistic expectations. This study contributes critical insights into GPi, Vim/Vop and simultaneous stimulation for unilateral dystonia. The safety of the procedure underscores the promise of this approach."

Social cognition and executive functioning may be particularly affected. To explore social cognition and executive functioning performance in individuals with CD, using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), as previous research has used traditional, nondigital neuropsychological assessments. We sought to investigate the relationships between social cognition, executive functioning, mood, and disability in individuals with CD. We recruited 37 individuals with CD, including 26 women with an age range of 33 to 69 years (M = 56.64, SD = 8.31) from a dystonia clinic in a hospital neurology department. The individuals completed selected tasks from the CANTAB measuring social cognition and executive functioning. We compared the individuals' performance with CANTAB normative data. Depression, anxiety, disease severity, and disability were measured. The individuals with CD had significantly lower scores than the CANTAB normative data in both social cognition and executive functioning tasks, with the largest differences evident in problem-solving, attention, and positive emotion bias tasks. Poorer emotion recognition was associated with increased difficulties in problem-solving tasks. The individuals demonstrated a bias toward identifying happiness in facial affect, which was related to a poorer recognition of emotions. Cognitive performance was not related to CD severity or disability or to current mood symptoms. Difficulties with both social cognition and executive functioning were identified in the individuals with CD, and are likely important targets for clinical interventions."

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical procedure that has been used to treat a variety of neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia. While DBS is generally considered safe and effective, surgical site infections (SSIs) are a potential complication that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Our objective was to investigate the use of antibiotic-impregnated envelopes (AIEs) encasing implantable pulse generators (IPGs) to reduce the rate of infection at IPG sites and the costs. We conducted a retrospective analysis at a single center encompassing all procedures involving the placement of Implantable Pulse Generators (IPG), including both initial insertions and replacement surgeries. The study period spanned from January 2017 to May 2024. Starting in 2020, the routine utilization of AIE became standard practice at our institute for both primary DBS implantation and IPG replacements. Surgical techniques remained consistent, pre- and post-operative antibiotic protocols were standardized throughout the study period and all cases were undertaken by a single surgeon. 178 patients were included and the overall incidence of IPG SSIs was found to be 1.7% (1 infection in 58 patients; 20 primary IPG/38 IPG replacements) among those who received an AIE compared to 5% (6 infections in 120 patients; 36 primary IPG/84 replacement IPG) in patients where no AIE was utilized. This resulted in an odds ratio for infection that was 2.9 times higher in the absence of AIE. The decrease in infection rates was observed in both primary and replacement IPG implants. Notably, over 80% of patients with IPG infection required surgical intervention. The use of AIE further resulted in significant cost savings. To our knowledge, this is the largest series reporting the efficacy of Antibiotic impregnated envelope (AIE) in modifying infection rates associated with both initial and replacement Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Implantable Pulse Generators (IPGs). The implementation of AIEs led to a decrease in the occurrence of IPG-related infections, observed across both primary implantations and replacement surgeries, with associated economic benefits."

    "abstract": "Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by paroxysmal and transient events of unilateral or bilateral paresis, usually occurring before 18 months of age. Mutations in the ATP1A3 gene, mainly p.Asp801Asn, p.Glu815Lys, and p.Gly947Arg at the protein level, are found in around 80% of the individuals with AHC. Interestingly, these mutations reflect the degree of severity of the neurological symptoms (p.Glu815Lys > p.Asp801Asn > p.Gly947Arg). Some channels involved in this disorder are N-type voltage-gated calcium channels, ATP-sensitive potassium channels, and the sodium/calcium exchanger. In this context, the management of AHC should be divided into the treatment of attacks, prophylactic treatment, and management of comorbidities commonly found in this group of individuals, including epilepsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, aggressive behavior, cognitive impairment, movement disorders, and migraine. The importance of an integrated approach with a multidisciplinary team, such as neuropsychologists and dietitians, is worth mentioning, as well as the follow-up with a neurologist. In the present study, we propose new diagnostic criteria for AHC, dividing it into clinical, laboratory, supporting, and atypical features. Also, we review the location of the mutations in the ATP1A3 protein of individuals with AHC, rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP) variants, and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (variants with hemiplegic attack). We also include a section about the animal models for ATP1A3 disorders."

    "title": "Relevance of genetic testing in the gene-targeted trial era: the Rostock Parkinson's disease study.",
    "abstract": "Estimates of the spectrum and frequency of pathogenic variants in Parkinson's disease (PD) in different populations are currently limited and biased. Furthermore, although therapeutic modification of several genetic targets has reached the clinical trial stage, a major obstacle in conducting these trials is that PD patients are largely unaware of their genetic status and, therefore, cannot be recruited. Expanding the number of investigated PD-related genes and including genes related to disorders with overlapping clinical features in large, well-phenotyped PD patient groups is a prerequisite for capturing the full variant spectrum underlying PD and for stratifying and prioritizing patients for gene-targeted clinical trials. The Rostock Parkinson's disease (ROPAD) study is an observational clinical study aiming to determine the frequency and spectrum of genetic variants contributing to PD in a large international cohort. We investigated variants in 50 genes with either an established relevance for PD or possible phenotypic overlap in a group of 12 580 PD patients from 16 countries [62.3% male; 92.0% White; 27.0% positive family history (FH+), median age at onset (AAO) 59 years] using a next-generation sequencing panel. Altogether, in 1864 (14.8%) ROPAD participants (58.1% male; 91.0% White, 35.5% FH+, median AAO 55 years), a PD-relevant genetic test (PDGT) was positive based on GBA1 risk variants (10.4%) or pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in LRRK2 (2.9%), PRKN (0.9%), SNCA (0.2%) or PINK1 (0.1%) or a combination of two genetic findings in two genes (∼0.2%). Of note, the adjusted positive PDGT fraction, i.e. the fraction of positive PDGTs per country weighted by the fraction of the population of the world that they represent, was 14.5%. Positive PDGTs were identified in 19.9% of patients with an AAO ≤ 50 years, in 19.5% of patients with FH+ and in 26.9% with an AAO ≤ 50 years and FH+. In comparison to the idiopathic PD group (6846 patients with benign variants), the positive PDGT group had a significantly lower AAO (4 years, P = 9 × 10-34). The probability of a positive PDGT decreased by 3% with every additional AAO year (P = 1 × 10-35). Female patients were 22% more likely to have a positive PDGT (P = 3 × 10-4), and for individuals with FH+ this likelihood was 55% higher (P = 1 × 10-14). About 0.8% of the ROPAD participants had positive genetic testing findings in parkinsonism-, dystonia/dyskinesia- or dementia-related genes. In the emerging era of gene-targeted PD clinical trials, our finding that ∼15% of patients harbour potentially actionable genetic variants offers an important prospect to affected individuals and their families and underlines the need for genetic testing in PD patients. Thus, the insights from the ROPAD study allow for data-driven, differential genetic counselling across the spectrum of different AAOs and family histories and promote a possible policy change in the application of genetic testing as a routine part of patient evaluation and care in PD."

These accessory heads extended from the middle third of the clavicle and joined the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the middle third. The variations in the sternocleidomastoid muscle may be attributed to abnormal mesodermal splitting or fusion failure during the development of the post-sixth branchial arch. Anomalies of the sternocleidomastoid may be misdiagnosed as cervical dystonia, fibromatosis colli, or muscular spasm. In rare cases, an accessory head could result in torticollis in adults. These anomalies warrant particular attention during interventional procedures conducted by anesthesiologists. The internal jugular vein is accessed at the lesser supraclavicular fossa for cannulation during central venous access and temporary hemodialysis. Variations in its anatomy can pose challenges during these procedures. Moreover, the clavicular head may be utilized for muscle flaps in the upper neck and occipital regions."

This study aimed to identify PIMD in the stomatognathic system following dental or oral surgical procedures. A total of 229 patients with PIMD (144 women and 85 men; mean age: 53.4 years) triggered by oral surgical or dental interventions were evaluated retrospectively. The average latency between the procedures and onset of PIMD was 14.3 days.

This was followed by general dental treatment, including periodontal, endodontic, and restorative procedures (36.7%), prosthetic treatment (19.7%), and orthodontic treatment (3.5%). PIMD consisted of oromandibular dystonia (73.8%), functional (psychogenic) movement disorders (11.4%), orolingual dyskinesia (7.9%), and hemimasticatory spasms (5.7%). These results suggest that even minor alterations in normal anatomy or physiology after dental procedures may result in PIMD in predisposing patients. Dental professionals should be aware that although infrequently, PIMD can develop after various dental treatments. If such symptoms precipitate, the attending physician should properly explain them to the patient and provide appropriate treatment or consultation with a movement disorder specialist."

We would like to report our experience in establishing and developing our MRgFUS program and preliminary results. Adult patients with tremor-dominant PD (TDPD), ET, and XDP were considered for initial screening (neurologic evaluation, skull density ratio [SDR] determination). Eligible patients underwent secondary screening (neurosurgical and neuropsychological evaluation, psychiatric and medical clearance). During the procedure, a neuro-anesthesiologist and neurologist were also present to monitor the patient and perform neurologic evaluation, respectively. Clinical follow-up was scheduled at 2 weeks post-treatment, then at every 3 months. A total of 30 patients underwent MRgFUS treatment: 22 TDPD, 6 XDP, and 2 ET. The mean age was 55.7 years, and majority were male (86.7%). Mean disease duration was 8.6 years. Mean SDR was 0.46. The targets for TDPD and ET were the contralateral ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus; for XDP, it was the pallidothalamic tract. The mean maximum temperature was 59.8<sup>o</sup>C; number of sonocations, 7.3; and treatment time, 64.6 min. Majority of patients improved after the procedure. Transient intraprocedural adverse events (headache, dizziness) were reported in 20% of patients while post-procedural events (mild weakness, numbness) were seen in 16.7%. Only 26.7% of patients had follow-up data. Despite the unique challenges encountered, MRgFUS treatment is feasible in resource-limited settings. Additional steps would have to be made to develop and improve the program."

    "abstract": "Musicians' dystonia (MD) is a movement disorder with several established risk factors, but the exact pathophysiology remains unknown. Recent research suggests dysfunction in sensory-motor, basal ganglia, cerebellar, and limbic loops as potential causes. Adverse childhood experiences are also considered risk factors. This study aimed to investigate whether MD patients have experienced more childhood trauma, leading to increased stress reactivity and neural vulnerability to movement disorders. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and the Montreal Imaging Stress Task, 40 MD patients were compared with 39 healthy musicians (HMs). Whole-brain analysis and regions of interest analysis were performed. Parameter estimates and subjective stress levels were compared between groups and correlated with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. MD patients reported significantly higher childhood trauma scores than healthy control subjects, but they did not differ in their subjective stress experiences. Stress-related activity of limbic areas was neither found in the whole sample nor between the two groups. Instead, increased activity of visual association and temporal areas was observed, but this activation did not differ between patients and HMs. However, patients showed a tendency toward reduced precuneus activity under stress. Adverse childhood experiences were negatively correlated with precuneus, thalamus, and substantia nigra activity across all participants. Overall, MD patients and HMs had similar subjective and neurological reactions to stress but differed in childhood trauma experiences and precuneus activity under stress. Further research about the functional connectivity between precuneus, cerebellum, thalamus, and basal ganglia in musicians is needed. © 2024 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Biallelic WARS2 pathogenic variants responsible for partial defect in aminoacylation, have recently been reported in subjects presenting with late-onset phenotypes combining dopa-responsive early-onset dystonia parkinsonism with altered DaTSCAN and progressive myoclonus ataxia. Here, we present the case of a 39-year-old male with childhood-onset progressive dopa-responsive dystonia parkinsonism, prominent psychiatric features and ataxia whose genome sequencing identified a p.(Arg36Ter) nonsense variant and a hypomorphic p.(Trp13Gly) missense variant, allowing the diagnosis of WARS2-related disease. The p.(Trp13Gly) missense variant has previously been reported in individuals with less severe phenotypes than those carrying biallelic WARS2 loss-of-function variants. Among these individuals, two subjects had similar genetic backgrounds and almost identical clinical history to our patient. Our report brings additional proof that the p.(Trp13Gly) variant acts as a hypomorphic allele, offering insight on a genotype-phenotype correlation in WARS2-related disorders."

    "abstract": "The cerebellum contributes to a diverse array of motor conditions, including ataxia, dystonia, and tremor. The neural substrates that encode this diversity are unclear. Here, we tested whether the neural spike activity of cerebellar output neurons is distinct between movement disorders with different impairments, generalizable across movement disorders with similar impairments, and capable of causing distinct movement impairments. Using in vivo awake recordings as input data, we trained a supervised classifier model to differentiate the spike parameters between mouse models for ataxia, dystonia, and tremor. The classifier model correctly assigned mouse phenotypes based on single-neuron signatures. Spike signatures were shared across etiologically distinct but phenotypically similar disease models. Mimicking these pathophysiological spike signatures with optogenetics induced the predicted motor impairments in otherwise healthy mice. These data show that distinct spike signatures promote the behavioral presentation of cerebellar diseases."

    "title": "Manganese transporter SLC30A10 and iron transporters SLC40A1 and SLC11A2 impact dietary manganese absorption.",
    "abstract": "SLC30A10 deficiency is a disease of severe manganese excess attributed to loss of SLC30A10-dependent manganese excretion via the gastrointestinal tract. Patients develop dystonia, cirrhosis, and polycythemia. They are treated with chelators but also respond to oral iron, suggesting that iron can outcompete manganese for absorption in this disease. Here we explore the latter observation. Intriguingly, manganese absorption is increased in Slc30a10-deficient mice despite manganese excess. Studies of multiple mouse models indicate that increased dietary manganese absorption reflects two processes: loss of manganese export from enterocytes into the gastrointestinal tract lumen by SLC30A10, and increased absorption of dietary manganese by iron transporters SLC11A2 (DMT1) and SLC40A1 (ferroportin). Our work demonstrates that aberrant absorption contributes prominently to SLC30A10 deficiency and expands our understanding of biological interactions between iron and manganese. Based on these results, we propose a reconsideration of the role of iron transporters in manganese homeostasis is warranted."

    "abstract": "Drug-induced acute dystonia is usually associated with combination therapies of neuroleptics, but rarely with the withdrawal or rebound effect of various psychotrops. Very sparse reports have described acute dystonia as a methylphenidate withdrawal (rebound effect), particularly in combination modalities. However, there is no case report or research regarding acute dystonia related to the withdrawal of the short-acting methylphenidate-immediate release form (MPH-IR) in the case of monotherapy of MPH-IR or a combination with guanfacine. Herein, a pediatric case of recurrent acute dystonia with two separate phenomena, locating orolingual and oromandibular/lower extremities, is presented as a withdrawal adverse reaction occurring after abrupt discontinuation of MPH-IR when under a combination therapy with guanfacine. Various options such as anticholinergic agents, re-administrating MPH, or turning to monotherapy from combination modalities, can be suggested in treatment, as well as only hydration may also have the benefit of resolving the symptoms, as in the current case. Practitioners should be aware of all possible adverse effects of MPH, even the rebound effect of short-acting forms."

One did not achieve walking ability. 13 patients presented progressive lower limbs hypertonia without overt pyramidal signs. Five patients reported exaggerated startle, three developed upper body (prominently cervical) dystonia in the second decade, with or without bradykinesia (2/13).

This condition is associated with polycythemia, motor neurodegeneration with extrapyramidal features, and hepatic dysfunction, which can progress to cirrhosis in some patients. <b>Materials and Methods</b>: In this study, a consanguineous Saudi family with two affected individuals exhibiting symptoms of severe motor impairment, spastic paraparesis, postural instability, and dystonia was studied. Clinical and radiographic evaluations were conducted on the affected individuals. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed to diagnose the disease and to determine the causative variant underlying the phenotype. Moreover, Sanger sequencing was used for validation and segregation analysis of the identified variant.

Herein we describe real-world demographics, disease characteristics, and treatment response to onabotulinumtoxinA (onabotA) in AC or RC patients from an observational, multicenter, prospective registry, CD PROBE. After three onabotA treatments, outcomes (CDIP-58, PGIC, CGIC, CD severity, TWSTRS) in patients with predominant AC or RC were compared to torticollis (TC) and all CD subtypes combined. The mean dosages at each treatment ranged from 153.5 to 195.4 U (AC) to 184.0-213.4 U (RC). After treatment, AC and RC patients reported improvements in the CDIP-58. \"Much\" or \"very much improved\" on PGIC and CGIC was reported by AC patients (n = 11/23, 48%) and clinicians (n = 14/23, 61%); and by RC patients (n = 14/24, 58%) and clinicians (n = 19/24, 83%). The mean total TWSTRS decreased from 45.7 (n = 59) to 36.1 (n = 23, 21.0% improvement) for AC patients and from 40.1 (n = 55) to 31.6 (n = 23, 21.2% improvement) for RC patients; the proportion of AC and RC patients with severe CD decreased. Outcomes for AC and RC were generally consistent with those for TC and all subtypes combined. Dysphagia was reported in 4/59 (6.8%) of AC patients (one serious), 7/55 (12.7%) of RC patients (none serious), 29/494 (5.9%) of TC patients (none serious), and 64/1012 (6.3%) of all CD patients (two serious). No new safety signals were identified. In conclusion, treatment with onabotA may relieve CD symptoms in some patients with AC and RC, consistent with results for other CD subtypes and the known safety profile of onabotA for the treatment of CD."

Here, we identified the sensory-motor circuit as a major causative neural circuit using a gene trap system that enables neural circuit-selective inactivation and restoration of <i>Dst</i> by Cre-mediated recombination. Sensory neuron-selective <i>Dst</i> deletion led to motor impairment, degeneration of proprioceptive sensory neurons, and disruption of the sensory-motor circuit. Restoration of <i>Dst</i> expression in sensory neurons using Cre driver mice or a single postnatal injection of Cre-expressing adeno-associated virus ameliorated sensory degeneration and improved abnormal movements. These findings demonstrate that the sensory-motor circuit is involved in the movement disorders in <i>dt</i> mice and that the sensory circuit is a therapeutic target for HSAN-VI."

    "abstract": "OnabotulinumtoxinA (BT-A) is used in different medical fields for its beneficial effects. BT-A, a toxin originally produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, is widely known for its ability to temporarily paralyze muscles by blocking the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in muscle contraction. The literature continually reports new hypotheses regarding potential applications that do not consider blockade of acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction as a common pathway. In this opinion article, it is our aim to investigate the different pathway targets of BT-A in different medical applications. First of all, the acetylcholine effect of BT-A is used to reduce wrinkles for cosmetic purposes, in the treatment of urological problems, excessive sweating, temporomandibular joint disorders, obesity, migraine, spasticity in neurological diseases, and in various cases of muscle overactivity such as cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, and essential head tremor. In another potential pathway, glutamate A, CGRP, and substance P are targeted for pain inhibition with BT-A application in conditions such as migraine, trigeminal neuralgia, neuropathic pain, and myofascial pain syndrome. On the other hand, as a mechanism different from acetylcholine and pain mediators, BT-A is used in the treatment of hair loss by increasing oxygenation and targeting transforming growth factor-beta 1 cells. In addition, the effect of BT-A on the apoptosis of cancer cells is also known and is being developed. The benefits of BT-A applied in different doses to different regions for different medical purposes are shown in literature studies, and it is also emphasized in those studies that repeating the applications increases the benefits in the long term. The use of BT-A continues to expand as researchers discover new potential therapeutic uses for this versatile toxin."

    "abstract": "Since its first approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 1989 for strabismus, botulinum toxin indications of use have been widely expanded. Due to its anticholinergic properties, this toxin is currently approved in adult patients for the treatment of a wide range of neuromuscular, otolaryngologic, orthopedic, gastrointestinal, and urologic disorders. Approved pediatric indications of use include the treatment of blepharospasm associated with dystonia, strabismus, lower-limb spasticity, focal spasticity in patients with cerebral palsy, and neurogenic detrusor overactivity. Alongside these approved indications, botulinum toxin is extensively used off-label. Although several clinical studies have shown that botulinum toxin is effective and well-tolerated in children, uncertainties persist regarding its long-term effects on growth and appropriate dosing in this population. As such, further research is needed to better define the botulinum toxin risk-benefit profile and expand approved uses in pediatrics. This narrative review aimed to provide a broad overview of the evidence concerning the clinical effectiveness and safety of BoNT with respect to its principal authorized and non-authorized pediatric therapeutic indications, as well as to describe perspectives on its future use in children."

Dosing, treatment strategies and outcome measures lack international consensus, and they are often extrapolated from adult or spasticity guidelines. This review aims to evaluate the best available evidence on the efficacy and safety of BT therapy in pediatric dystonia (age under 21 years old), isolated or associated with other medical conditions. A comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science was conducted, including only articles in English. Although no randomized controlled trials are still present, 12 articles were included with an overall of 57 patients. All the papers demonstrate that BT can improve motor function, decrease pain and ameliorate quality of life, with minimal adverse effects in pediatric patients affected by pure or mixed dystonic motor disorders. Despite the low level of evidence, our review shows that BT could be an efficacious treatment for these pediatric patients. The frequent generalized involvement, together with the heterogeneous nature of childhood dystonic forms, sometimes intermingled with spasticity, prompts further multicenter clinical trials or prospective studies with a higher level of evidence to shed light on the efficacy and safety profile of BT in pediatric dystonia."

    "abstract": "Dystonia can present in primary and secondary forms, depending on co-occurring symptoms and syndromic associations. In contrast to primary dystonia, secondary forms of dystonia are often associated with lesions in the putamen or globus pallidus. Such disorders are commonly neurodegenerative or neurometabolic conditions which produce varied neurologic as well as systemic manifestations other than dystonia. Chemo-denervation with botulinum toxin has been successfully used for focal or segmental dystonia. However, studies evaluating the effect of BoNT therapy on patients with secondary dystonia are sparse, given the heterogeneity in etiology and presentation. We present a series of patients with secondary dystonia who were managed with botulinum toxin therapy. Patients included in this series had a confirmed neurometabolic cause of dystonia. A total of 14 patients, with ages ranging from 17 to 36 years, with disorders including Wilson's disease, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), glutaric aciduria type 1, Sanfilippo syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIb), and GM2 gangliosidosis (Sandhoff disease) are presented. Most patients experienced a mild to moderate improvement in treated dystonia with benefits ranging from 6 to 12 weeks, with the median length of the benefits lasting approximately eight weeks, without any significant adverse effects. Although the secondary causes of dystonia are complex and diverse, our presented data and the available reports of the use of botulinum toxin support the conclusion that chemo-denervation plays an important role in symptom alleviation."

The occurrence of these diseases in siblings but their absence in the parents suggests the idea that the coexistence of two separate variations in the <i>VPS16</i> and <i>MEFV</i> genes determines the phenotype. In addition, the increase in <i>MEFV</i> variation load in this family and the fact that DM occurs at an earlier age suggest that inflammation may cause an early diabetic clinical presentation."

    "abstract": "The ineffectiveness of cisplatin therapy in treating colorectal cancer (CRC) is attributed to an increase of resistance. It's necessary to investigate adjunctive agents capable of enhancing drug efficacy. Previous studies have shown that ropivacaine inhibit the growth of various cancer cells, but its impact on cisplatin resistance in tumors is not well understood. This study was to illustrate the impact and mechanism of ropivacaine enhanced cisplatin-sensitivity of CRC. Cisplatin alone treatment resulted in the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intracellular Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels, as well as a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in cisplatin-sensitive LOVO cells, while these effects were mitigated in the cisplatin-resistant LOVO/DDP cells. The co-administration of ropivacaine with cisplatin inhibited cell viability and cell migration, decreased MMP, and promoted ROS accumulation and apoptosis in both LOVO cells and LOVO/DDP cells. And they upregulated the levels of ferroptosis makers and downregulated the expression of anti-ferroptosis proteins. However, this effect was reversed by ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 or liproxstatin-1. Furthermore, we o demonstrated that the co-administration of ropivacaine and cisplatin resulted in a decrease in SIRT1 expression, and SIRT1 knockdown in LOVO/DDP cells enhanced the ferroptosis and the anti-tumor properties of ropivacaine, while also inhibiting the activation of the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway. The above results suggested that ropivacaine increased the sensitivity of CRC cells to cisplatin by promoting ferroptosis through the inhibition of SIRT1 expression, which proposes a therapeutic approach for overcoming cisplatin resistance in CRC."

    "abstract": "Critical periods are windows of heightened plasticity occurring during neurodevelopment. Alterations in neural activity during these periods can cause long-lasting changes in the structure, connectivity, and intrinsic excitability of neurons, which may contribute to the pathology of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, endogenous regulators of critical periods remain poorly defined. Here, we study this issue using a fruit fly (Drosophila) model of an early-onset movement disorder caused by BK potassium channel gain of function (BK GOF). Deploying a genetic method to place robust expression of GOF BK channels under spatiotemporal control, we show that adult-stage neuronal expression of GOF BK channels minimally disrupts fly movement. In contrast, limiting neuronal expression of GOF BK channels to a short window during late neurodevelopment profoundly impairs locomotion and limb kinematics in resulting adult flies. During this critical period, BK GOF perturbs synaptic localization of the active zone protein Bruchpilot and reduces excitatory neurotransmission. Conversely, enhancing neural activity specifically during development rescues motor defects in BK GOF flies. Collectively, our results reveal a critical developmental period for limb control in Drosophila that is influenced by BK channels and suggest that BK GOF causes movement disorders by disrupting activity-dependent aspects of synaptic development."

Shoulder, elbow and wrist angles were calculated from 2DMMA and 3DMA (as gold standard) and correlated to assess concurrent validity. Additionally, execution time and variability features such as mean point-wise standard deviation of the angular trajectories (i.e. shoulder elevation, elbow and wrist flexion/extension) and wrist trajectory deviation by mean overshoot and convex hull were calculated from key points. 2DMMA features were compared between the DCP group and TD peers to assess construct validity. Fifty-one individuals (30 DCP;21 TD; age:5-24 years) participated. An accuracy of approximately 1.5 cm was reached for key point tracking. While significant correlations were found for wrist (ρ = 0.810;p < 0.001) and elbow angles (ρ = 0.483;p < 0.001), 2DMMA shoulder angles were not correlated (ρ = 0.247;p = 0.102) to 3DMA. Wrist and elbow angles, execution time and variability features all differed between groups (Effect sizes 0.35-0.81;p < 0.05). Videos of a reaching-sideways-task processed by 2DMMA to assess upper extremity movements in DCP showed promising validity. The method is especially valuable to assess movement variability."

Blood levels of estradiol, total testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone were measured in all patients and correlated to clinical features. We found that female patients exhibited greater non-motor symptoms and a relatively higher rate of dystonia than males. In females, lower estradiol levels accounted for higher MDS-UPDRS-II and III scores and more frequent motor complications, while lower testosterone levels were associated with a major occurrence of dystonia. In male patients, no significant correlations emerged. In conclusion, this study highlighted the relevance of sex hormone levels in the sexual dimorphism and unique phenotype of EOPD."

The evidence base for motor and nonmotor efficacy and safety of the available BoNT formulations is reviewed, with attention to duration of benefit as a driver of patient satisfaction. Practical determinants of BoNT efficacy are reviewed including muscle selection, accurate muscle injection, factors related to poor or deteriorating response, and immunogenicity. BoNT represents a significant advancement in the treatment of CD. More accurate diagnosis, muscle selection and targeting, and dosing can improve outcomes with existing BoNT formulations. Further refinement of BoNT potency, duration of action, safety, and immunogenicity will help reduce unmet needs in the magnitude and duration of benefit.

    "abstract": "Sleep-related paroxysmal motor episodes (SPMEs) have been described by various names, including nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE), and sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy. The underlying pathophysiology has been debated over the years, with these episodes assumed to be a form of paroxysmal dystonia or parasomnia versus a form of epilepsy. In most studies published on SPMEs and their variants (paroxysmal arousals, nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia, and episodic nocturnal wanderings) in the early 1990s, the authors speculated on the pathophysiology but did not commit to one idea. It was not until the mid-1990s that epilepsy became the leading prospect. We performed a narrative review of the major articles that have described this syndrome in a chronological fashion. We identified three eras, 1972-1993, 1994-1998, and 1999 to the present, each era marked by a landmark study. Our critical review of these early studies shows that the neurophysiological data supporting epilepsy as the sole basis for all SPME cases is very weak. In 1994-1995, a familial pattern of this syndrome was described and the term autosomal dominant NFLE was coined, with the authors claiming that all their patients had a form of frontal lobe epilepsy. With the exception of a few reference cases, the neurophysiological evidence that all patients had frontal lobe epilepsy was very weak. Compared to articles published on surgical series of frontal lobe epilepsy, the percentage of SPME cases with positive interictal/ictal electroencephalograms remained very low, seriously questioning the epileptic basis of the syndrome. Our critical review and analysis of the published literature shows that the evidence presented in favor of SPMEs being a homogenous focal epilepsy syndrome is very weak. Neurologists must recognize that SPMEs could be a form of movement disorder, parasomnia, or epilepsy. We recommend a pragmatic semiology-based classification of these episodes using the four-dimensional classification system."

We report 2 patients with previously unreported <i>VPS16</i> truncating variants and highlight some distinctive phenomenological characteristics of DYT-<i>VPS16.</i> The 2 patients, who were unrelated, presented with early-onset orofacial dystonia with prominent tongue involvement. Case 1, a 37-year-old woman, developed disabling orofacial dystonia, with tongue protrusion (lingual dystonia), orofacial gesticulations, and hyperkinetic dysarthria, responsible for an odd \"foreign language\" quality. Case 2, a 36-year-old woman, exhibited orofacial dystonia with prominent lingual involvement and orofacial gesticulations. In both patients, orofacial dystonia led to predominant speech impairment with no or discrete swallowing difficulties. Substantial tongue dystonia may be a distinctive feature of DYT-<i>VPS16</i>. Our cases widen the phenotypic spectrum of DYT-<i>VPS16</i> and may provide physicians with a new clinical clue for this disease."

    "abstract": "Belly dancer's dyskinesia (BDD) is characterized by involuntary abdominal wall movements that are rhythmic, repetitive, and dyskinetic. The present study aims to review BDD's etiology, pathophysiology, and management. We searched six databases to locate existing reports on BDD published from 1990 to October 2023 in electronic form. A total of 47 articles containing 59 cases were found. The majority of the patients affected by BDD were female, accounting for 61.01% (36/59) of the cases. The mean and median ages were 49.8 (standard deviation: 21.85) and 52 years (range: 7-85), respectively. The BDD was unilateral in only 3.38% (2/59). The most commonly reported causes associated with BDD were 17 idiopathic, 11 drug-induced, 11 postsurgical procedures, 5 pregnancies, and 4 Vitamin B12 deficiencies. BDD is a diagnosis of exclusion, and other more common pathologies with similar presentation should be ruled out initially. Differential diagnostic reasoning should include diaphragmatic myoclonus, cardiac conditions, truncal dystonia, abdominal motor seizures, propriospinal myoclonus, and functional or psychiatric disorders."

    "title": "Functional Neurological Disorders Among Patients With Tremor.",
    "abstract": "Functional neurological disorders (FNDs) are increasingly recognized in the general population and neurology clinics, and there is evidence that patients with neurological disorders are more likely to have a FND. This study was designed to identify the clinical features of FNDs among patients with movement disorders when the two disorders coexist. The clinical histories and video recordings of 150 consecutive patients with tremors were examined: the types of tremor included essential tremor; essential tremor plus; dystonic tremor; tremor associated with dystonia; and drug-induced, myoclonic, orthostatic, task-specific, parkinsonian, Holmes, and unclassified tremor. Using criteria for \"possible\" and \"probable\" coexistent FND, clinical features that helped differentiate between functional and other neurological tremors were identified. There were 27 (18%) patients with functional manifestations, and 17 (11% of full sample) of these patients had signs suggestive of comorbid functional tremor. Patients with comorbid functional manifestations were younger at presentation, and these patients had greater severity of tremor, particularly upper limb postural tremor. Functional manifestations were not more commonly observed among patients with any particular type of tremor, except for patients with Holmes tremor, who were more likely to have comorbid functional neurological manifestations. About 18% of patients with diverse types of tremors also had comorbid functional neurological manifestations. Of the coexistent FNDs, functional tremor was the most common. Patients with co-occurring functional and other neurological tremors presented for evaluation at a younger age and had greater severity of arm tremor than those without comorbid functional neurological manifestations."

The patient is a 32 years-old female with multisystem mitochondrial disease due to variant m.10191T>C in MT-ND3, who has been experiencing episodic, spontaneous or induced abnormal movements since age 23. The abnormal movements started as right hemi-athetosis, bilateral dystonia of the legs, or unilateral dystonia of the right arm and leg. They often progressed to severe ballism, involving the trunk, and limbs. The arms were more dystonic than the legs. In conclusion, complex-I deficiency due to the variant m.10191T>C in MT-ND3 may manifest as multisystem disease including hyperkinesias. Neurologists should be aware of hyperkinesias as a manifestation of complex-I deficiency."

    "abstract": "Homozygous DNAJC12 c.79-2A>G (p. V27Wfs*14) loss-of-function mutations were first reported as a cause of young-onset Parkinson's disease. However, bi-allelic autosomal recessive pathogenic variants in DNAJC12 may lead to an alternative constellation of neurological features, including infantile dystonia, developmental delay, intellectual disability and neuropsychiatric disorders. DNAJC12 is understood to co-chaperone aromatic amino acid hydroxylases to foster the synthesis of biogenic amines. In vitro, we discover overexpressed DNAJC12 forms a complex with guanine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor paramount for biogenic amines synthesis. We also confirm DNAJC12's interaction with tyrosine (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), which are rate-limiting enzymes for synthesis of biogenic amines dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT). In-vitro knock-down of DNAJC12 with a siRNA destabilizes the DNAJC12-TH-GCH1 complex, reducing GCH1 levels, whereas reciprocal overexpression of both TH and GCH1 increases endogenous DNAJC12, alluding to the significance of modulating the DNAJC12-TH-GCH1 complex as a therapy for DNAJC12 and other biogenic amine disorders. We extend these investigations to a Cre-conditional knock-out mice (cDKO) in which loxP sites flanking Dnajc12 exon 2 enable its excision by cre-recombinase. With germline Cre expression, we have created a constitutive Dnajc12 knock-out (DKO). DKO mice exhibit reduced locomotion/ exploratory behavior at 3 months in automated open-field testing, accompanied by increased plasma phenylalanine which is a cardinal feature of patients with pathogenic DNAJC12 variants. In striatal tissue, total DA and 5-HT, their metabolites, and electrically-evoked DA release are all reduced. Biochemical alterations in synaptic proteins are also apparent, with enhanced phosphorylation of Th pSer31 and pSer40 reflecting biological compensation. Most immediately, cDKO and DKO mice present models to develop and refine therapeutic approaches for biogenic amines disorders, including dystonia and parkinsonism. They will also enable the pleiotropic functions of biogenic amines (including DA), usually synthesized in the brain or periphery, to be separated."

Although movement and psychiatric disorders are known to occur in individuals with WS, parkinsonism, dystonia, and treatment-resistant schizoaffective disorder have not been formally described. We present two unrelated cases of adults with molecularly confirmed WS and typical histories of developmental delays, intellectual/learning disabilities, and treatment-responsive anxiety/mood disorder who developed similar noteworthy neuropsychiatric expressions. We reviewed detailed neuropsychiatric histories, laboratory investigations, neuroimaging, and treatment responses and compared data for the two cases. Both individuals developed treatment-resistant schizoaffective disorder in adulthood requiring multiple trials of antipsychotic treatments. While on clozapine, both patients developed parkinsonism and generalized dystonia with truncal involvement that responded to trials of low-dose levodopa without exacerbating underlying psychotic or affective symptoms. This report illustrates the novel occurrence of levodopa-responsive movement disorders and treatment-resistant schizoaffective disorder in individuals with WS, adding to the expanding neuropsychiatric phenotypes, and highlighting potential shared underlying mechanisms. The observed treatment response suggests that levodopa, in relatively low doses, may be safe and useful in ameliorating presumed antipsychotic-associated parkinsonism and tardive dystonia in WS."

This helps in making sense of the loss of the sense of self they experience. Gender, premorbid personality, and socio-cultural discourses guide this process of understanding. Narrative formulation takes these considerations into account and, thus, can be used for formulating therapeutic plans. To present a case report which highlights the use of narrative case formulation to understand the psychological, social, and cultural factors forming the dominant discourse of a woman with ABI. Ms. VA, a 43-year-old female, presented herself with a diagnosis of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy with small chronic infarcts with gliosis in the bilateral cerebellar hemisphere, myoclonic seizures, mild cognitive impairment, depression, generalized dystonia, and bronchial asthma. Along with neuropsychological rehabilitation and cognitive retraining, 25 sessions of psychotherapy using narrative formulation were performed. Following the therapy, microgains such as a developing strong therapeutic relationship, accommodating vulnerability in her narrative, and finding moments of independence and assertion within the constraints of ABI were observed. Acceptance of her current predicament vis-à-vis her lost self and finding meaning in her new self were facilitated. There is paucity of research detailing psychotherapeutic management of ABI, especially in India. Psychotherapy, particularly using narrative formulation, can be helpful in understanding the intersections of gender role and expectations, premorbid personality and ABI, and aiding the post-ABI rehabilitation and adjustment. Future work in this area can explore the socio-cultural aspects that play an important role in the therapy process."

    "abstract": "Secondary to the risk of antipsychotic-induced acute dystonia, prophylactic use of benztropine is occasionally warranted but is recommended for no longer than 7 days after initiating an antipsychotic, correlating to the period of highest dystonia risk. Despite the associated increased anticholinergic burden, many clinicians continue to order benztropine for periods exceeding the recommended prophylactic duration. We investigated the reduction of benztropine use duration subsequent to implementation of truncated electronic entry orders to improve benztropine prescribing within an acute psychiatric facility. Data were collected for psychiatric inpatients admitted between January and June 2020 who were prescribed scheduled benztropine. In a quality improvement initiative implemented in April 2022, electronic orders for benztropine were modified from a 180-day to a 7-day duration, with subsequent postintervention data collection. The primary outcomes included a change in the duration of benztropine use for any indication in the hospital, and a change in the percentage of patients meeting predetermined \"unnecessary use\" criteria. Secondary analyses included the percentage of patients with discharge prescriptions for scheduled benztropine (either for prophylaxis or for other indications) in the pre- and postintervention periods. 73 pre- and 77 postintervention individual patients/encounters were included. Following the intervention, in-hospital duration of benztropine use for any indication decreased from a median of 14 days to a median of 7.5 days (P < 0.05), and appropriate use increased by 92.9%. The percentage of patients with prescriptions for scheduled benztropine decreased from 67.1% in the preintervention group to 29.9% in the postintervention group. Decreased benztropine use duration, by means of truncated order entry sentences, during inpatient psychiatric admissions, appears feasible regardless of dual antipsychotic or first-generation antipsychotic use, and may reduce the rates of benztropine prescriptions written for discharge."

    "abstract": "Musician's dystonia is a task-specific movement disorder that deteriorates fine motor control of skilled movements in musical performance. Although this disorder threatens professional careers, its diagnosis is challenging for clinicians who have no specialized knowledge of musical performance. To support diagnostic evaluation, the present study proposes a novel approach using a machine learning-based algorithm to identify the symptomatic movements of Musician's dystonia. We propose an algorithm that identifies the dystonic movements using the anomaly detection method with an autoencoder trained with the hand kinematics of healthy pianists. A unique feature of the algorithm is that it requires only the video image of the hand, which can be derived by a commercially available camera. We also measured the hand biomechanical functions to assess the contribution of peripheral factors and improve the identification of dystonic symptoms. The proposed algorithm successfully identified Musician's dystonia with an accuracy and specificity of 90% based only on video footages of the hands. In addition, we identified the degradation of biomechanical functions involved in controlling multiple fingers, which is not specific to musical performance. By contrast, there were no dystonia-specific malfunctions of hand biomechanics, including the strength and agility of individual digits. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the present technique in aiding in the accurate diagnosis of Musician's dystonia."

    "abstract": "Generation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived motor neurons (MNs) offers an unprecedented approach to modeling movement disorders such as dystonia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, achieving survival poses a significant challenge when culturing induced MNs, especially when aiming to reach late maturation stages. Utilizing hiPSC-derived motor neurons and primary mouse astrocytes, we assembled two types of coculture systems: direct coculturing of neurons with astrocytes and indirect coculture using culture inserts that physically separate neurons and astrocytes. Both systems significantly enhance neuron survival. Compared with these two systems, no significant differences in neurodevelopment, maturation, and survival within 3 weeks, allowing to prepare neurons at maturation stages. Using the indirect coculture system, we obtained highly pure MNs at the late mature stage from hiPSCs. Transcriptomic studies of hiPSC-derived MNs showed a typical neurodevelopmental switch in gene expression from the early immature stage to late maturation stages. Mature genes associated with neurodevelopment and synaptogenesis are highly enriched in MNs at late stages, demonstrating that these neurons achieve maturation. This study introduces a novel tool for the preparation of highly pure hiPSC-derived neurons, enabling the determination of neurological disease pathogenesis in neurons at late disease onset stages through biochemical approaches, which typically necessitate highly pure neurons. This advancement is particularly significant in modeling age-related neurodegeneration."

Additionally, neurophysiological, imaging, metabolic and exome sequencing studies were performed. Routine metabolite testing, and GLUT1 and PRRT2 mutation analysis were negative. A repeat brain MRI revealed 'Eye-of-the-tiger-sign'. Exome sequencing identified homozygous valine to glycine alteration at amino acid position 157 in the DLAT gene. Bioinformatic and family analyses indicated that the alteration was likely pathogenic. Patient's dystonia was responsive to low-dose carbamazepine. On weaning carbamazepine, patient developed hallucinations which resolved after carbamazepine was restarted. PDH E2 deficiency due to DLAT mutation has a more benign course compared to common forms of PDH E1 deficiency due to X-linked PDHA1 mutations. All known cases of PDH E2 deficiency due to DLAT mutations share the features of episodic dystonia and intellectual disability.

    "abstract": "Defects in mitochondrial dynamics are a common cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), while primary deficiencies in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) are rare and atypical for this etiology. This study aims to report <i>COX18</i> as a novel CMT-causing gene. This gene encodes an assembly factor of mitochondrial Complex IV (CIV) that translocates the C-terminal tail of MTCO2 across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Exome sequencing was performed in four affected individuals. The patients and available family members underwent thorough neurological and electrophysiological assessment. The impact of one of the identified variants on splicing, protein levels, and mitochondrial bioenergetics was investigated in patient-derived lymphoblasts. The functionality of the mutant protein was assessed using a Proteinase K protection assay and immunoblotting. Neuronal relevance of COX18 was assessed in a <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> knockdown model. Exome sequencing coupled with homozygosity mapping revealed a homozygous splice variant c.435-6A>G in <i>COX18</i> in two siblings with early-onset progressive axonal sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy. By querying external databases, we identified two additional families with rare deleterious biallelic variants in <i>COX18</i> . All affected individuals presented with axonal CMT and some patients also exhibited central nervous system symptoms, such as dystonia and spasticity. Functional characterization of the c.435-6A>G variant demonstrated that it leads to the expression of an alternative transcript that lacks exon 2, resulting in a stable but defective COX18 isoform. The mutant protein impairs CIV assembly and activity, leading to a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential. Downregulation of the <i>COX18</i> homolog in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> displayed signs of neurodegeneration, including locomotor deficit and progressive axonal degeneration of sensory neurons. Our study presents genetic and functional evidence that supports <i>COX18</i> as a newly identified gene candidate for autosomal recessive axonal CMT with or without central nervous system involvement. These findings emphasize the significance of peripheral neuropathy within the spectrum of primary mitochondrial disorders and the role of mitochondrial CIV in the development of CMT. Our research has important implications for the diagnostic workup of CMT patients."

    "abstract": "Composite lymphoma (CL) is a rare cancer characterized by the concurrent occurrence of more than one type of lymphoma within the same organ or tissue in an individual. Its occurrence at extranodal sites is exceptional, with only a few cases documented in the literature. A 62-year-old gentleman presented with dystonia, dysphagia, and irregular enlargement of the right tonsil for the last three months. Based on a clinical suspicion of tonsillar malignancy, tonsillectomy was done. The histopathologic examination revealed effacement of the architecture by large irregular lymphoid nodules with interfollicular expansion. The nodules showed sheets of small atypical lymphoid cells, while the interfollicular areas showed large atypical lymphoid cells with scattered typical binucleate Reed-Sternberg cells. Immunohistochemistry confirmed mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in the nodules and classical HL (cHL) in the interfollicular areas. Based on these features, a diagnosis of composite MCL with cHL was rendered. He was treated with bendamustine and rituximab chemotherapy and remained in complete remission for five years when he presented with significant right-sided neck swelling. Percutaneous fine needle aspiration and subsequent flow cytometry confirmed a relapse of the MCL component of the CL. The index report documents an exceptional case of CL, comprising MCL and cHL, presenting at an uncommon extranodal site. In addition, it also emphasizes the importance of adequate sampling and the simultaneous use of immunochemistry and/or flow cytometry to confirm the presence of more than a single type of lymphoma, which may be easily overlooked on microscopy alone."

    "abstract": "Spastic paraplegia type 3A (SPG3A) is the second most common form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). This autosomal-dominant-inherited motor disorder is caused by heterozygous variants in the ATL1 gene which usually presents as a pure childhood-onset spastic paraplegia. Affected individuals present muscle weakness and spasticity in the lower limbs, with symptom onset in the first decade of life. Individuals with SPG3A typically present a slow progression and remain ambulatory throughout their life. Here we report three unrelated individuals presenting with very-early-onset (before 7 months) complex, and severe HSP phenotypes (axial hypotonia, spastic quadriplegia, dystonia, seizures and intellectual disability). For 2 of the 3 patients, these phenotypes led to the initial diagnosis of cerebral palsy (CP). These individuals carried novel ATL1 pathogenic variants (a de novo ATL1 missense p.(Lys406Glu), a homozygous frameshift p.(Arg403Glufs*3) and a homozygous missense variant (p.Tyr367His)). The parents carrying the heterozygous frameshift and missense variants were asymptomatic. Through these observations, we increase the knowledge on genotype-phenotype correlations in SPG3A and offer additional proof for possible autosomal recessive forms of SPG3A, while raising awareness on these exceptional phenotypes. Their ability to mimic CP also implies that genetic testing should be considered for patients with atypical forms of CP, given the implications for genetic counseling."

    "abstract": "Neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS) is associated with an abnormal muscle tone. Traditional conservative treatments, with the historical practice of early posterior fusion, have proven ineffective. Recently, growth-sparing techniques have gained traction owing to their ability to maximize trunk height. However, these techniques have a substantial risk of complications, particularly rod breakage, with reported incidence rates ranging from 15 % to 42 %. The objective of this study was to conduct a descriptive analysis of NMS patients who experienced rod breakage following the minimally invasive fusionless surgery (MIFS) technique. This was a single-center, retrospective study that included all NMS patients who underwent surgery between January 2015 and January 2021 and subsequently presented with rod breakage after MIFS. The MIFS technique is based on proximal fixation with double hook claws made of pedicular and -sus laminar hooks and pelvic fixation with iliosacral screws. The mean follow-up was 5.2 ± 2.2 years. The mean dominant etiology of NMS was cerebral palsy (67 %). Of the 217 patients who underwent surgery, 15 (6.9 %) developed rod breakage. Rod breakage occurred 2.7 ± 1.3 years after the initial surgery. Four cases of rod fracture recurrence were reported in ambulatory patients with dystonia or hyperactivity. Compared with other fusionless techniques, the minimally invasive bipolar technique appears promising for patients with NMS, with a lower rate of rod breakage. We recommend the use of a four-rod construct for ambulatory patients or for those with dystonia or hyperactivity."

To guide physicians in answering this query, we performed a scoping review to assess the current state of the literature and to identify the gaps that need to be addressed. The authors performed a MEDLINE search inclusive of articles from January 1987 (advent of DBS literature) to June 2023 including human and modeling studies written in English. For longevity of therapy data, only studies with a mean follow-up of ≥three years were included. Using the Rayyan platform, two reviewers (JP and RM) performed a title screen. Of the 734 articles, 205 were selected by title screen and 109 from abstract review. Ultimately, a total of 122 articles were reviewed. The research questions we explored were 1) how long can the different components of the DBS system maintain functionality? and 2) how long can DBS remain efficacious in treating Parkinson's disease (PD), essential tremor (ET), dystonia, and other disorders? We showed that patients with PD, ET, and dystonia maintain a considerable long-term benefit in motor scores seven to ten years after implant, although the percentage improvement decreases over time. Stimulation off scores in PD and ET show worsening, consistent with disease progression. Battery life varies by the disease treated and the programming settings used. There remains a paucity of literature after ten years, and the impact of new device technology has not been classified to date. We reviewed existing data on DBS longevity. Overall, outcomes data after ten years of therapy are substantially limited in the current literature. We recommend that physicians who have data for patients with DBS exceeding this duration publish their results."

    "abstract": "The GCH1 gene encodes the enzyme guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a critical cofactor in the production of monoamine neurotransmitters. Autosomal dominant GTPCH (adGTPCH) deficiency is the most common cause of dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), whereas the recessive form (arGTPCH) is an ultrarare and poorly characterized disorder with earlier and more complex presentation that may disrupt neurodevelopmental processes. Here, we delineated the phenotypic spectrum of ARGTPCHD and investigated the predictive value of biochemical and genetic correlates for disease outcome. The aim was to study 4 new cases of arGTPCH deficiency and systematically review patients reported in the literature. Clinical, biochemical, and genetic data and treatment response of 45 patients are presented. Three phenotypes were outlined: (1) early-infantile encephalopathic phenotype with profound disability (24 of 45 patients), (2) dystonia-parkinsonism phenotype with infantile/early-childhood onset of developmental stagnation/regression preceding the emergence of movement disorder (7 of 45), and (3) late-onset DRD phenotype (14 of 45). All 3 phenotypes were responsive to pharmacological treatment, which for the first 2 must be initiated early to prevent disabling neurodevelopmental outcomes. A gradient of BH4 defect and genetic variant severity characterizes the 3 clinical subgroups. Hyperphenylalaninemia was not observed in the second and third groups and was associated with a higher likelihood of intellectual disability. The clinical spectrum of arGTPCH deficiency is a continuum from early-onset encephalopathies to classical DRD. Genotype and biochemical alterations may allow early diagnosis and predict clinical severity. Early treatment remains critical, especially for the most severe patients."

Mutations in human <i>Vacuolar Protein Sorting 16 (VPS16)</i> have been associated with MPS and dystonia. In this study, we generated and characterized a zebrafish <i>vps16(-/-)</i> mutant line using immunohistochemical and behavioral approaches. The loss of Vps16 function caused multiple systemic defects, hypomyelination, and increased neuronal cell death. Behavioral analysis showed a progressive loss of visuomotor response and reduced motor response and habituation to acoustic/tap stimuli in mutants. Finally, using a novel multiple-round acoustic/tap stimuli test, mutants showed intermediate memory deficits. Together, these data demonstrate that zebrafish <i>vps16(-/-)</i> mutants show systemic defects, neurological and motor system pathologies, and cognitive impairment. This is the first study to report behavior abnormalities and memory deficiencies in a zebrafish <i>vps16(-/-)</i> mutant line. Finally, we conclude that the deficits observed in <i>vps16(-/-)</i> zebrafish mutants do not mimic pathologies associated with dystonia, but more align to abnormalities associated with MPS and gLE."

    "abstract": "Variants in GABRB2, encoding the β2 subunit of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor, can result in a diverse range of conditions, ranging from febrile seizures to severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. However, the mechanisms underlying the risk of developing milder vs more severe forms of disorder remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive genotype-phenotype correlation analysis in a cohort of individuals with GABRB2 variants. Genetic and electroclinical data of 42 individuals harbouring 26 different GABRB2 variants were collected and accompanied by electrophysiological analysis of the effects of the variants on receptor function. Electrophysiological assessments of α1β2γ2 receptors revealed that 25/26 variants caused dysfunction to core receptor properties such as GABA sensitivity. Of these, 17 resulted in gain-of-function (GOF) while eight yielded loss-of-function traits (LOF). Genotype-phenotype correlation analysis revealed that individuals harbouring GOF variants suffered from severe developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID, 74%), movement disorders such as dystonia or dyskinesia (59%), microcephaly (50%) and high risk of early mortality (26%). Conversely, LOF variants were associated with milder disease manifestations. Individuals with these variants typically exhibited fever-triggered seizures (92%), milder degrees of DD/ID (85%), and maintained ambulatory function (85%). Notably, severe movement disorders or microcephaly were not reported in individuals with loss-of-function variants. The data reveals that genetic variants in GABRB2 can lead to both gain and loss-of-function, and this divergence is correlated with distinct disease manifestations. Utilising this information, we constructed a diagnostic flowchart that aids in predicting the pathogenicity of recently identified variants by considering clinical phenotypes. This work was funded by the Australian National Health & Medical Research Council, the Novo Nordisk Foundation and The Lundbeck Foundation."

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for the EQ-5D index score change from baseline to follow-up. The most common indication for DBS was Parkinson's disease across all regions. In Latin America, dystonia was the second most common indication, compared to essential tremor in other regions. There was a striking finding with respect to age-patients were an average of 10 years younger at DBS implantation in Latin America. This difference was most likely due to the greater number of patients with dystonia receiving the device implants. The intraoperative techniques were quite similar, showing the same level of quality and covering the main principles of the surgeries with some variations in the brand of frames, planning software, and microrecording systems. Rechargeable batteries were significantly more common in Latin America (72.37%) than in the US (6.44%) and Europe (9.9%). Staging of the DBS procedure differed, with only 11.84% in Latin America staging the procedure compared with 97.58% and 34.86% in the US and Europe, respectively. The EQ-5D score showed significant improvements in all regions during the first 6-12 months (p < 0.0001). However, the 24-month follow-up only showed an improvement in the scale for Latin America (p < 0.0001). DBS was performed in Latin America with similar indications, techniques, and technology as in the US and Europe. Important differences were found, with Latin America implementing more regular use of rechargeable devices, including younger patients at the time of surgery, and showing more sustained quality of life improvements at 24 months of follow-up. The authors hypothesize that these disparities stem from differences in resources among regions. However, more studies are needed to standardize DBS practice across the world to improve patients' quality of life and provide high-quality care."

The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was analyzed from January 2013 to December 2023. ADR reports regarding use of only metoclopramide or prucalopride were analyzed following exclusion of reports indicating use for treatment of non-gastrointestinal conditions. Analysis of 1,085 reports on metoclopramide revealed tardive dyskinesia (<i>n</i> = 393, 36.2%) and dystonia (<i>n</i> = 170, 15.7%) among the most reported ADRs in addition to QTc prolongation (<i>n</i> = 16, 1.5%) with progression to Torsade de pointes (<i>n</i> = 5, 0.5%) and triggering of pheochromocytoma crisis (<i>n</i> = 24, 2.2%). Analysis of 865 reports on prucalopride revealed headache (<i>n</i> = 120, 13.9%), diarrhea (<i>n</i> = 116, 13.4%), and abdominal pain (<i>n</i> = 100, 11.6%) as the most common ADRs with 22 reports (2.5%) of dystonia with the use of prucalopride. This FAERS database analysis shows post-marketing reports of ADRs from metoclopramide most frequently include tardive dyskinesia, dystonia, and tremor in addition to potentially fatal arrhythmias such as Torsade de pointes. Consumers of prucalopride may also be at risk of dystonia and other ADRs."

It conducts a comparative analysis of saccadic profiles in conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Huntington's disease, and dystonia, revealing distinct patterns and proposing mechanisms for impaired performance. The primary focus is on two inhibitory mechanisms: global, pre-emptive inhibition responsible for suppressing prepotent responses, and slower, selective response inhibition. The antisaccadic task demonstrates practicality in clinical applications, aiding in differential diagnoses, treatment monitoring and reflecting gait control. To further enhance its differential diagnostic value, future directions should address issues such as the standardization of eye-tracking protocol and the integration of eye-tracking data with other disease indicators in a comprehensive dataset."

    "abstract": "The data on specific comorbidities in children with dyskinetic cerebral palsy (DCP) is limited. We evaluated the pattern of comorbidities and health related quality of life (HRQOL) in these children and compared them between etiological and motor impairment subgroups. This cross-sectional study was conducted over 18 months in children with DCP of both sex, and age between one and 14 years. Comorbidities were assessed using standardized scales such as gross motor functioning scale (GMFCS), developmental profile-3 (DP-3), developmental behaviour checklist, sleep behaviour questionnaire (SBQ), and caregiver questionnaire. Sixty-five children with DCP were evaluated (hyperbilirubinemia n = 43, 66% and perinatal asphyxia n = 19, 29%). The majority of children were severely affected in gross motor functioning (level IV 29.2% and level V 53.8%). Epilepsy was seen in 21.5% of cases (19% in hyperbilirubinemia and 32% in asphyxia, p = 0.4). The mean age of onset of seizures was 15.4 + 20.6 months (range 2-72). Visual problems were seen in 54% of cases and included upgaze palsy, squint, refractive error, optic atrophy and cortical blindness. A significant proportion of children with hyperbilirubinemia had upgaze palsy as compared to those with perinatal asphyxia (70% vs. 32%, p 0.01). Rest of the visual problems were not significantly different between the two etiological subgroups. Drooling (87.6%), protein-energy malnutrition (66.6%), and reflux (57%) were the most common gastrointestinal problems in children with DCP. Children with DCP showed problems in social relating (33.8%), anxiety (26.2%), and self-absorbed behaviour (7.7%). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the etiological, motor impairment and age-based subgroups. Children with DCP had high scores on SBQ, suggesting sleep problems. Sleep scores were similar in the hyperbilirubinemia and perinatal asphyxia subgroups. Greater sleep problems were noted in children aged < 4y (70.6 + 10.1 vs. 56.5 + 11.3, p < 0.05 as compared to children above 4y of age) and severe motor impairments (68.2 + 11.3 vs. 57.2 + 13.1, p 0.008 as compared to mild-moderate motor impairment). Poor overall developmental scores were seen in 61.5% children and were significantly associated with GMFCS (p 0.04). The majority of children showed impairments in physical (58.5%), adaptive behaviour (58.5%), social-emotional (50.8%), cognitive (60%) and communication (52%) subscales of DP-3. Cognitive impairment was similar in the etiological (hyperbilirubinemia vs. perinatal asphyxia, p = 0.3), and motor impairment (mild-moderate vs. severe, p = 0.9) subgroups. HRQOL was significantly affected by motor impairment in positioning-transfer (p value 0.0001), and interaction-communication domains (p value 0.0001), however, there was no difference based on the etiology of hyperbilirubinemia and asphyxia. Children with DCP demonstrate several comorbidities and impaired quality of life. These are similar in hyperbilirubinemia and perinatal asphyxia cohorts, expect for significant proportion of upgaze palsy in DCP secondary to hyperbilirubinemia. Younger children have more problematic behaviour and impaired sleep quality. Severe motor disability influences the developmental outcomes, cognition, sleep and HRQOL in children with DCP."

    "abstract": "Neuroacanthocytosis (NA) syndromes are a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by the presence of abnormally shaped red blood cells (acanthocytes) and the progressive degeneration of the basal ganglia, leading to various neurological and systemic symptoms. The \"rubber man\" gait, characterized by distinctive flexions of the neck (manifesting as head drops) and the trunk, is seen in advanced chorea-acanthocytosis. A 35-year-old male patient presented with progressive abnormal movements affecting his limbs and face, along with dysphagia resulting from involuntary protrusion of the tongue and biting of the cheeks and lips over the past three years. He used to place the food on the back of his tongue and throw his head back to begin swallowing. He also kept a towel in his mouth to absorb saliva and prevent cheek and lip biting. The neurologic examination revealed generalized chorea, severe orolingual dystonia (eating dystonia), and sudden loss of tone while walking, resulting in flexion of the trunk followed by extension. We believe that these features could serve as definitive clinical indicators for chorea-acanthocytosis, providing valuable diagnostic insights, especially when accompanied by self-mutilatory mouth movements or feeding-related tongue dystonia."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD), a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease, causes the gradual deterioration of neurons in the basal ganglia, specifically in the striatum. HD displays a wide range of symptoms, from motor disturbances such as chorea, dystonia, and bradykinesia to more debilitating symptoms such as cognitive decline, behavioral abnormalities, and psychiatric disturbances. Current research suggests the potential use of dietary interventions as viable strategies for slowing the progression of HD. Most notably, the Mediterranean, vegan, carnivore, paleo, and ketogenic diets have gained attention due to their hypothesized impact on neuroprotection and symptomatic modulation in various neurodegenerative disorders. Despite substantial nutritional differences among these diets, they share a fundamental premise-that dietary factors have an influential impact in modifying pertinent biological pathways linked to neurodegeneration. Understanding the intricate interactions between these dietary regimens and HD pathogenesis could open avenues for personalized interventions tailored to the individual's specific needs and genetic background. Ultimately, elucidating the multifaceted effects of these diets on HD offers a promising framework for developing comprehensive therapeutic approaches that integrate dietary strategies with conventional treatments."

These symptoms are also associated with specific non-antipsychotic agents. This case report describes a case of a 9-year-old boy on antibiotics treatment that developed EPS. A 9-year-old boy presented to the emergency department of Imam Hossein Children›s Hospital with chief complaints of trismus, difficulty speaking, and tongue protrusion. One week before these presentations, he had been prescribed Tavanex® (levofloxacin) and clindamycin. His symptoms improved after the withdrawal of antibiotics and administering Biperiden, and he was discharged in good condition. On a follow-up visit one week after discharge, no remaining symptoms were present, and he was in good condition. Based on the questions in the Naranjo criteria, levofloxacin receives a score of 7 and is a probable cause of adverse drug reaction (ADR). Clindamycin, with a score of 6, is also a probable cause for this adverse drug reaction, but clinical judgment was in favor of levofloxacin as the culprit. Clinicians should be aware of the potential EPS of levofloxacin at standard doses. Effective management of adverse events is necessary to ensure patient safety and optimal outcomes."

    "abstract": "Encoding artificial perceptions through brain stimulation, especially that of higher cognitive functions such as speech perception, is one of the most formidable challenges in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Brain stimulation has been used for functional mapping in clinical practices for the last 70 years to treat various disorders affecting the nervous system, including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, essential tremors, and dystonia. Recently, direct electrical stimulation has been used to evoke various forms of perception in humans, ranging from sensorimotor, auditory, and visual to speech cognition. Successfully evoking and fine-tuning artificial perceptions could revolutionize communication for individuals with speech disorders and significantly enhance the capabilities of brain-computer interface technologies. However, despite the extensive literature on encoding various perceptions and the rising popularity of speech BCIs, inducing artificial speech perception is still largely unexplored, and its potential has yet to be determined. In this paper, we examine the various stimulation techniques used to evoke complex percepts and the target brain areas for the input of speech-like information. Finally, we discuss strategies to address the challenges of speech encoding and discuss the prospects of these approaches."

    "abstract": "Task-specific dystonia leads to loss of sensorimotor control for a particular motor skill. Although focal in nature, it is hugely disabling and can terminate professional careers in musicians. Biomarkers for underlying mechanism and severity are much needed. In this study, we designed a keyboard device that measured the forces generated at all fingertips during individual finger presses. By reliably quantifying overflow to other fingers in the instructed (enslaving) and contralateral hand (mirroring) we explored whether this task could differentiate between musicians with and without dystonia. 20 right-handed professional musicians (11 with dystonia) generated isometric flexion forces with the instructed finger to match 25%, 50% or 75% of maximal voluntary contraction for that finger. Enslaving was estimated as a linear slope of the forces applied across all instructed/uninstructed finger combinations. Musicians with dystonia had a small but robust loss of finger dexterity. There was increased enslaving and mirroring, primarily during use of the symptomatic hand (enslaving p = 0.003; mirroring p = 0.016), and to a lesser extent with the asymptomatic hand (enslaving p = 0.052; mirroring p = 0.062). Increased enslaving and mirroring were seen across all combinations of finger pairs. In addition, enslaving was exaggerated across symptomatic fingers when more than one finger was clinically affected. Task-specific dystonia therefore appears to express along a gradient, most severe in the affected skill with subtle and general motor control dysfunction in the background. Recognition of this provides a more nuanced understanding of the sensorimotor control deficits at play and can inform therapeutic options for this highly disabling disorder."

We aimed to identify these risk factors through clinical and electrophysiological assessments, and to establish a predictive model for dystonic spread in BSP. We prospectively followed BSP patients for 4 years, collecting data on dystonic spread, and conducting electrophysiological evaluations. The blink reflex, masseter inhibitory reflex, and trigeminal somatosensory evoked potential were assessed. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to assess clinical characteristics associated with BSP dystonic spread. A predictive model was constructed using a nomogram, and performance of the model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. A total of 136 enrolled participants (mean age 56.34 years) completed a 4-year follow-up. Among them, 62 patients (45.6%) showed spread to other body regions. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that a high Hamilton Anxiety Scale score (hazard ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.13-1.25, p < 0.001), prolonged trigeminal somatosensory evoked potential mandibular branch P1-N2 peak interval (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.21, p = 0.017), and elevated trigeminal somatosensory evoked potential mandibular branch P1-N2 peak amplitude (hazard ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.41, p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for BSP dystonic spread within 4 years. Combining these factors, the predictive models demonstrated excellent discriminative ability, with the receiver operating characteristic curve score being 0.797, 0.790, 0.847, and 0.820 at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years after enrollment, respectively. We established a predictive model with significant value for anticipating dystonic spread in BSP, offering crucial evidence. These findings contribute essential insights into the early clinical identification of the development and evolution of BSP diseases. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:747-757."

BTBGD is characterized by progressive encephalopathy, confusion, seizures, dysarthria, dystonia, and severe disabilities. Diagnosis is difficult due to the disease's rare nature and diverse clinical characteristics. The primary treatment for BTBGD at this time is thiamine and biotin supplementation, while its long-term effectiveness is still being investigated. In this study, we have generated two clones of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a 10-year-old female BTBGD patient carrying a homozygous mutation for the pathogenic variant in exon 5 of the SLC19A3 gene, c.1264A > G (p.Thr422Ala). We have confirmed the pluripotency of the generated iPS lines and successfully differentiated them to neural progenitors. Because our understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations in BTBGD is limited, the establishment of BTBGD-iPSC lines with a homozygous SLC19A3 mutation provides a valuable cellular model to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying SLC19A3-associated cellular dysfunction.

We undertook the present study to uncover the genetic basis for undiagnosed PKD patients. Whole-exome sequencing was performed for 106 PRRT2-negative PKD probands. The functional impact of the genetic variants was investigated in HEK293T cells and Drosophila. Heterozygous variants in KCNJ10 were identified in 11 individuals from 8 unrelated families, which accounted for 7.5% (8/106) of the PRRT2-negative probands. Both co-segregation of the identified variants and the significantly higher frequency of rare KCNJ10 variants in PKD cases supported impacts from the detected KCNJ10 heterozygous variants on PKD pathogenesis. Moreover, a KCNJ10 mutation-carrying father from a typical EAST/SeSAME family was identified as a PKD patient. All patients manifested dystonia attacks triggered by sudden movement with a short episodic duration. Patch-clamp recordings in HEK293T cells revealed apparent reductions in K<sup>+</sup> currents of the patient-derived variants, indicating a loss-of-function. In Drosophila, milder hyperexcitability phenotypes were observed in heterozygous Irk2 knock-in flies compared to homozygotes, supporting haploinsufficiency as the mechanism for the detected heterozygous variants. Electrophysiological recordings showed that excitatory neurons in Irk2 haploinsufficiency flies exhibited increased excitability, and glia-specific complementation with human Kir4.1 rescued the Irk2 mutant phenotypes. Our study established haploinsufficiency resulting from heterozygous variants in KCNJ10 can be understood as a previously unrecognized genetic cause for PKD and provided evidence of glial involvement in the pathophysiology of PKD.

Although genetic variants associated with BSP have been extensively studied, the contribution of single-nucleotide polymorphisms towards this condition remains poorly understood. In addition, the etiology of BSP remains to be fully elucidated. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the role of polymorphisms in the torsin 1A (TOR1A), dopamine receptor D (DRD)2 and DRD5 genes in South Korean patients with BSP. Furthermore, the role of genetic variants of these three aforementioned genes was investigated. A prospective case-control study was established, where 56 patients with BSP and 115 healthy controls were recruited at the Department of Ophthalmology of CHA Bundang Medical Center (Seongnam, South Korea) using single nucleotide polymorphisms analysis by real-time PCR. The <i>TOR1A</i> rs1182CC/<i>DRD5</i> rs6283TC genotype combination was found to be associated with decreased BSP risk [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 0.288; P=0.013]. <i>DRD5</i> rs6283 was observed to be associated with the periocular type of BSP in the co-dominant (for the TC genotype; AOR, 0.370; P=0.029) and dominant models (AOR, 0.406; P=0.029). The recessive model of <i>TOR1A</i> rs1801968 (AOR, 0.245; P=0.030), and the recessive (AOR, 0.245; P=0.029) and over-dominant models (AOR, 2.437; P=0.019) of <i>DRD2</i> rs1800497 were found to be associated with superior responses to botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT) treatment.

Recently, we demonstrated a significant increase in astrogliosis and microgliosis together with an increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in XDP post-mortem prefrontal cortex (PFC), suggesting a role for neuroinflammation in XDP pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrated a significant increase in MPO activity in XDP PFC using a novel specific MPO-activatable fluorescent agent (MAFA). Additionally, we demonstrated a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in XDP-derived fibroblasts as well as in SH-SY5Y cells treated with post-mortem XDP PFC, further supporting a role for MPO in XDP. To determine whether increases in MPO activity were linked to increases in ROS, MPO content was immuno-depleted from XDP PFC [MPO(-)], which resulted in a significant decrease in ROS in SH-SY5Y cells. Consistently, the treatment with verdiperstat, a potent and selective MPO inhibitor, significantly decreased ROS in both XDP-derived fibroblasts and XDP PFC-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Collectively, our results suggest that MPO inhibition mitigates oxidative stress and may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for XDP treatment. MPO activity is increased in XDP post-mortem prefrontal cortex.MPO activity is increased in cellular models of XDP.MPO increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro.Inhibiting MPO mitigates ROS in XDP.The MPO inhibitor, verdiperstat, dampens ROS suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for XDP."

However, there have been no prospective studies evaluating spinal movement disorders in NMOSD, MOGAD, and idiopathic transverse myelitis (ITM). Patients referred to a tertiary neuroimmunology clinic for spinal cord demyelination (excluding MS) were evaluated. All patients answered a movement disorders survey and underwent a movement disorder-focused exam. Movement disorders were compared among patients with NMOSD with and without AQP4-IgG, MOGAD, and ITM. Patients with and without involuntary movements were also compared to identify predictors of spinal movement disorders. Sixty-three patients were evaluated from 2017 to 2021 (71% females, median age 49 years, range 18-72 years, median disease duration 12 months, range 1-408). Of the total, 49% had ITM, 21% had NMOSD without AQP4-IgG, 19% had NMOSD with AQP4-IgG, and 11% had MOGAD. Movement disorders were present in 73% of the total patients and were most frequent in NMOSD with AQP4-IgG (92%) and least frequent in MOGAD (57%). The most frequent spinal movement disorders were tonic spasms (57%), focal dystonia (25%), spinal tremor (16%), spontaneous clonus (9.5%), secondary restless limb syndrome (9.5%), and spinal myoclonus (8%). Multivariate analysis showed that longitudinally extensive myelitis and AQP4-IgG are independent risk factors for the development of spinal movement disorders, while MOG-IgG and African American race were associated with a lower risk of developing these movement disorders. Spinal movement disorders are highly prevalent in non-MS demyelinating disorders of the spinal cord. Prevalence rates exceed those reported in MS and retrospective NMOSD studies."

This study aimed to better characterize the spectrum of movement disorders in CLN2-disease in a cohort of children receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). A cohort of 18 children attending a single center for treatment with cerliponase alfa ERT was systematically assessed using a standardized structured history and a double-scored, video-recorded examination using the Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale (UBDRS) and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Noncanonical movement disorders are common: while ataxia (89%) and myoclonus (83%) were near-universal, spasticity and dystonia were experienced by over half (61% each), with children having a median of 4 distinct movement disorder phenotypes. This progression was stereotyped with initial ataxia/myoclonus, then hyperkinesia/spasticity, and later hypokinesia. ERT slows progression of movement disorders, as measured by the UBDRS physical subscale, with 1.45 points-per-month progression before diagnosis and 0.44 points-per-month while on treatment (<i>p</i> = 0.019).

We retrospectively reviewed natural histories for 40 children carrying biallelic pathogenic <i>POLG</i> variants. The patients were identified by the French coordinating center for mitochondrial disorders (CARAMMEL), making this a large monocentric series on childhood-onset POLG deficiency. Three patterns of clinical course and survival were observed, distinguished by main category of symptoms: neurologic, hepatic, and gastrointestinal. A total of 24 patients needed urgent neurointensive care for tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic epilepsy, and status epilepticus, occasionally precipitated by valproate administration. Other neurologic symptoms included dystonia, cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. We report 6 POLG-deficient patients with polyradiculoneuropathy mimicking subacute Guillain-Barré syndrome and provide postgadolinium MRI evidence of diffuse cranial nerve root and <i>cauda equina</i> enhancement, suggesting these disorders have an inflammatory component. Children presenting with enteral nervous system involvement had vomiting, gastroparesis, and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. They had later ages of onset and lived much longer. Primarily, hepatic presentations had the earliest onset and shortest survivals. Secondary hepatic failure was frequently precipitated by valproate administration given before diagnosis to patients with focal impaired awareness seizures or absence of seizures. These POLG deficiencies were often fatal, with age at death ranging from 3 months to 10 years, with a significant difference in survival between the 3 clinical forms; 6 of the 40 children did survive. No genotype-phenotype correlations were found for the 3 clinical course types. The study demonstrates the prevalence of neurologic presentation and the extent of central, peripheral, and autonomous nervous system involvement in 60% of patients. Most of the patients with early onset and rapidly fatal hepatic failure did not live long enough to develop neurologic symptoms. The study revealed a new clinical form of POLG deficiency presenting with neurodigestive symptoms with longer lifespan. We also propose that POLG deficiency should be considered in children presenting with unexplained polyradiculoneuropathy, demyelinating neuropathy, and elevated CSF protein. Finally, valproate administration remains a notable cause of avoidable death in POLG-deficient patients."

    "abstract": "Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is a hereditary movement disorder due to a selective nigrostriatal dopamine deficiency. It is characterized by onset in childhood or adolescence with marked diurnal fluctuation with or without Parkinsonian features, and is caused by mutations in GCH1 gene. We report in this study the clinical and genetic features of the first DRD Moroccan patient. Using a gene panel sequencing, we identified a heterozygous nonsense variant p. Glu61Ter in GCH1. A subsequent targeted segregation analysis by Sanger sequencing validated the presence of the mutation in the patient, which was found to have occurred de novo. The objective of this study is to report the first description of DRD in Morocco, and highlights the importance of new generation sequencing technology in the reduction of medical wandering and the management of hereditary diseases."

    "abstract": "Idiopathic avascular necrosis of the scaphoid bone, Preiser's disease, was originally described as a deteriorative pathology whereby the osseous structure necroses due to loss of blood supply. It may present with multifactorial etiology, which is still largely not well understood. We describe a case of Preiser's disease in a 70-year-old female, with worsening pain and loss of range of motion in her right wrist over a two-year period. Past medical history was significant for Sjogren's disease, fibromyalgia, and dystonia. Pain began several months following traumatic right dorsal wrist injury. Diagnosis of traumatic scaphoid fracture was originally suspected. Conservative treatment was unsuccessful. Radiographs did not demonstrate evidence of primary fracture. CT scan and MRI demonstrated osteonecrosis of the proximal pole of the scaphoid, but no evidence of fracture, either residual or healing, was found. Proximal row carpectomy was performed for avascular necrosis of the scaphoid. Histology confirmed diagnosis and verified absence of fracture. Postoperatively, the patient's pain and range of motion improved. This report combines histological findings of Preiser's disease with radiographic images which may ameliorate understanding of the clinical pathophysiology. We describe an unusual manifestation of Preiser's disease whereby a single traumatic event, in the absence of fracture, led to idiopathic scaphoid avascular necrosis, which may have been associated with Sjogren's syndrome and fibromyalgia. These conditions may have negatively impacted microvasculature and decreased bone mineral density, inversely correlated with the production of fatty marrow, facilitating the onset of osteonecrosis in the scaphoid."

    "abstract": "This exploratory study evaluates rating scale usage by experts from the European Reference Network for Rare Neurological Diseases (ERN-RND) for paediatric MD, considering factors like diagnosis, intellectual disability, age, and transition to adult care. The aim is to propose a preliminary framework for consistent application. A multicentre survey among 25 ERN-RND experts from 10 European countries examined rating scale usage in paediatric MD, categorizing MD into acute, non-progressive, and neurodegenerative types. Factors influencing scale choice and the transition to adult care practices were analysed. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify the earliest age of application of these scales in paediatric patients. The study identifies various rating scales and establishes their usage frequencies for different MDs. Experts highlighted the need for standardized scales and proposed preliminary evaluation strategies based on clinical contexts. Challenges in applying scales to young, non-cooperative patients were acknowledged. The study recommends developing standardized rating scales for paediatric MDs to improve evaluations and data collection. It suggests potential scales for specific clinical scenarios to better evaluate disease progression. Comprehensive, patient-centred care remains crucial during the transition to adult care, despite the identified challenges. This exploratory approach aims to enhance patient outcomes and care."

    "abstract": "Despite the large body of work on local field potentials (LFPs), a measure of oscillatory activity in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), the longitudinal evolution of LFPs is less explored. To determine LFP fluctuations collected in clinical settings in patients with PD and STN deep brain stimulation (DBS). Twenty-two STN-DBS patients (age: 67.6 ± 8.3 years; 9 females; disease duration: 10.3 ± 4.5 years) completed bilateral LFP recordings over three visits in the OFF-stimulation setting. Peak and band power measures were calculated from each recording. After bilateral LFP recordings, at least one peak was detected in 18 (81.8%), 20 (90.9%), and 22 (100%) patients at visit 1, 2, and 3, respectively. No significant differences were seen in primary peak amplitude (F = 2.91, p = 0.060) over time. Amplitude of the second largest peak (F = 5.49, p = 0.006) and low-beta (F = 6.89, p = 0.002), high-beta (F = 13.23, p < 0.001), and gamma (F = 12.71, p < 0.001) band power demonstrated a significant effect of time. Post hoc comparisons determined low-beta power (Visit 1-Visit 2: t = 3.59, p = 0.002; Visit 1-Visit 3: t = 2.61, p = 0.031), high-beta (Visit 1-Visit 2: t = 4.64, p < 0.001; Visit 1-Visit 3: t = 4.23, p < 0.001) and gamma band power (Visit 1-Visit 2: t = 4.65, p < 0.001; Visit 1-Visit 3: t = 4.00, p < 0.001) were significantly increased from visit 1 recordings to both follow-up visits. Our results provide substantial evidence that LFP can reliably be detected across multiple real-world clinical visits in patients with STN-DBS for PD. Moreover, it provides insights on the evolution of these LFPs."

    "abstract": "The study examined how neck muscle imbalance and plagiocephaly affect the lying and rolling activities in 118 infants aged 4 to 6 months with postural torticollis. Outcome measures included age, sex, cervical movement, and plagiocephaly severity. Neck muscle function was assessed with the Muscle Function Scale (MFS), and infant motor abilities in lying and rolling were evaluated through the corresponding dimensions of the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). Multiple regression analysis showed that a better MFS score of the affected neck was significantly associated with improved lying and rolling activities in the GMFM (<i>p</i> < .01), and importantly, the interaction between the plagiocephaly and the MFS scores of the affected neck muscle in these activities was found to be significant (<i>p</i> < .05). These results highlight the need for early intervention in infants with torticollis to address muscle imbalance and plagiocephaly, crucial for early motor development (KCT0008367)."

VT is typically classified into two phenotypes: isolated vocal tremor (iVT) and essential tremor-related voice tremor (ETvt). The impact of phenotypes on upper aerodigestive tract physiology during swallowing remains unclear. Qualitative and quantitative measures were employed to characterize tremor phenotypes and investigate the effects on swallowing physiology. Eleven ETvt participants (1 Male, 10 Female; x̄ age = 74) and 8 iVT participants (1 Male, 7 Female; x̄ age = 71) swallowed 20 mL boluses in cued and uncued conditions under standardized fluoroscopic visualization. Sustained/a/productions were captured to assess the rate and extent of fundamental frequency (F0) modulation. Penetration and Aspiration Scale (PAS) scores were obtained and swallowing biomechanics were captured using Swallowtail™ software. Participants also completed the Swallowing Quality of Life (SWAL-QOL) questionnaire. Hypopharyngeal transit was faster in both VT phenotypes compared with Swallowtail™ normative reference data. Total pharyngeal transit times, however, were only faster in patients with iVT, relative to reference data. No significant differences were observed on the SWAL-QOL or PAS between tremor phenotypes. SWAL-QOL scores revealed that these patients rarely reported dysphagia symptoms. Subtle differences in swallowing patterns were observed across VT phenotypes, possibly related to adaptive mechanisms resulting in quicker pharyngeal bolus transit. Most patients did not report swallowing issues or dysphagia symptoms. This study is foundational for larger studies on this challenging population. 4 Laryngoscope, 134:4599-4603, 2024."

    "abstract": "The heterotrimeric G-protein α subunit, Gα<sub>olf</sub>, acts to transduce extracellular signals through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and stimulates adenylyl cyclase mediated production of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Numerous mutations in the GNAL gene, which encodes Gα<sub>olf</sub>, have been identified as causative for an adult-onset dystonia. These mutations disrupt GPCR signaling cascades in in vitro assays through several mechanisms, and this disrupted signaling is hypothesized to lead to dystonic motor symptoms in patients. However, the cells and circuits that mutations in GNAL corrupt are not well understood. Published patterns of Gα<sub>olf</sub> expression outside the context of the striatum are sparse, conflicting, often lack cell type specificity, and may be confounded by expression of the close GNAL homolog of GNAS. Here, we use RNAScope in-situ hybridization to quantitatively characterize Gnal mRNA expression in brain tissue from wildtype C57BL/6J adult mice. We observed widespread expression of Gnal puncta throughout the brain, suggesting Gα<sub>olf</sub> is expressed in more brain structures and neuron types than previously accounted for. We quantify transcripts at a single cell level, and use neuron type specific markers to further classify and understand patterns of GNAL expression. Our data suggests that brain regions classically associated with motor control, initiation, and regulation show the highest expression of GNAL, with Purkinje Cells of the cerebellum showing the highest expression of any neuron type examined. Subsequent conditional Gnal knockout in Purkinje cells led to markedly decreased intracellular cAMP levels and downstream cAMP-dependent enzyme activation. Our work provides a detailed characterization of Gnal expression throughout the brain and the biochemical consequences of loss of Gα<sub>olf</sub> signaling in vivo in neurons that highly express Gnal."

To evaluate the sociodemographic and clinical profile of elderly (age ≥ 60 years) patients started on clozapine. The clozapine registry in the department was screened to identify elderly patients who were started on clozapine. Treatment records of these patients were reviewed to extract sociodemographic and clinical details. Out of the available information of 1058 patients in the registry, 42 (3.96 %) were elderly (≥ 60 years) patients. About two-thirds of the patients had treatment resistance, i.e., their psychotic illness had not responded to two adequate trials of antipsychotics, and the second most common indication for starting clozapine was tardive dystonia or tardive dyskinesia (23.8 %). The mean dose of clozapine was 135.89 (SD: 109.6; Range: 37.5-500; median: 87.5) mg/day. The mean duration of clozapine use at the time of data extraction for the study sample was 3.55 (SD: 2.15; Range 0.3-9; median: 3) years. At the last follow-up, about three-fourths of patients were experiencing at least one side effect, with constipation being the most common side effect, followed by sedation, weight gain, and hypersalivation. In only four patients, clozapine was stopped during the follow-up. In terms of effectiveness, majority of the patients were rated as much improved or very much improved on Clinical Global Impression-Improvement subscale. Clozapine can be safely used in elderly patients with mental disorders. Hence, clozapine should not be withheld in elderly patients with mental disorders whenever indicated."

On assessment, the patient had mild impairment of higher mental functions, mild exotropia, and right-hand dystonia. Brain MRI revealed diffuse bilateral symmetrical subcortical white matter hyperintense signals. 2-hydroxyglutaric acid in urine was elevated and the whole genome sequencing revealed a homogeneous pathogenic variant of the L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (L2HGDH) gene. The prognosis was explained to the caregivers. Patients with mild phenotype L-2-HGA can remain undiagnosed until adulthood.

Instrumented methods to objectively measure dyskinesia have been proposed to improve assessment accuracy and reliability. Here, we investigated the technique and movement features that were most suitable to objectively measure the severity of dystonia in children with cerebral palsy. A prospective observational study was conducted with 12 participants with cerebral palsy with a predominant motor type of dyskinesia, spasticity, or mixed dyskinesia/spasticity who had upper limb involvement (mean age: 12.6 years, range: 6.7-18.2 years). Kinematic and electromyography data were collected bilaterally during three upper limb tasks. Spearman rank correlations of kinematic or electromyography features were calculated against dystonia severity, quantified by the Dyskinesia Impairment Scale. Kinematic features were more influential compared to electromyography features at grading the severity of dystonia in children with cerebral palsy. Kinematic measures quantifying jerkiness of volitional movement during an upper limb task with a reaching component performed best (|r<sub>s</sub>| = 0.78-0.9, p < 0.001). This study provides guidance on the types of data, features of movement, and activity protocols that instrumented methods should focus on when objectively measuring the severity of dystonia in children with cerebral palsy."

Diagnosing Meige syndrome is challenging due to its similarities with various movement disorders and psychiatric conditions. Functional neurological disorder (FND) refers to a condition characterized by neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with recognized neurological or medical conditions. Symptoms may include motor or sensory disturbances such as weakness, tremors, paralysis, or seizures. Importantly, these symptoms cannot be fully explained by another medical condition or by the direct effects of a substance. Instead, they are believed to stem from psychological factors. This case demonstrates the diagnostic dilemma of Meige syndrome. It was initially misdiagnosed as a functional neurological disorder in a 42-year-old female. The difficulties in differentiating between these disorders highlight the necessity of a thorough evaluation and increased clinical suspicion in cases of movement disorders.

Pediatric patients need frequent revision surgeries due to body growth as well as implant failure over the course of the years. We report a rare case of a 12-year-old patient, presenting with torticollis, 11 years after the initial placement of a VP shunt. The peripheral tube had to be surgically removed due to the severe movement limitation of the cervical spine area and the tilting of the head. This is the fourth case known to be reported with this rare complication. The calcification of the tube and the formation of a rigid scar tissue along the shunt tube, combined with the body growth, are the suspected mechanisms of this mechanical malfunction of the VP-shunt. The complication could be efficiently addressed through the surgical replacement of the peripheral tube and the transection of the scar tissue in the neck area."

In Pakistan, domestic violence as well as emotional, physical and sexual abuse in children are prevalent. Despite legal and social support for victims, stigmatisation regarding seeking psychological help complicates the challenge. Some of the research culminated that patients with neurological disorder reported high level of sexual abuse and trauma. The symptomatology of functional neurological disorder is being ignored in Asian countries due to indigenous factors like poverty, lack of information on reporting abuse, poor law-enforcement and victim blaming. Functional neurological disorder can be manifested in various ways in the human body, such as blindness, paralysis, dystonia, swallowing difficulties, difficulty walking, motor symptoms affecting limbs, voice production, problems in sensory functions, problems in cognitive function, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures and even dementia, whereas differential diagnosis is established after screening for organicity. The common risk factors of functional neurological disorder may include psychosocial stressors, family history of functional neurological disorder, and significant life changes. It is critical to understand the disorder in reference to predisposing risk factors, cultural context, comorbidities and gender specification to diagnose and treat functional neurological disorder in time so that better intervention protocols could be devised to treat it efficiently."

One known effective treatment is botulinum toxin A (BTXA), which is also approved for the treatment of strabismus, blepharospasm, muscle spasm, cervical dystonia, glabella wrinkles, and primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effect of intra-dermal injection of botulinum toxin and normal saline serum (NSS) in the treatment of large facial pores. The study included 25 people who referred to the skin clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ahvaz from June 2021 to January 2022 for the treatment of large facial skin pores. Randomly, some subjects were injected with botulinum toxin at ten points, and each point was equivalent to 2.5 units of Masport (500 units vial of Masport diluted with 10 ml of NSS). Some other people were injected with 0.05 ml of NSS by intra-dermal injection at ten points. Finally, the data were analyzed using SPSS-Ver. 22 software. Based on optical coherence tomography results, it was determined that the diameter of facial pores decreased significantly (<i>P</i> = 0.011). Dermoscopy showed a significant decrease in the average size of facial pores (<i>P</i> < 0.011), and also, the pore score decreased significantly (<i>P</i> = 0.021). In addition, the results showed that the size of skin pores and facial fat on both sides of the face did not decrease significantly from the patients' point of view (<i>P</i> = 0.71). Based on the results of the present study, it can be concluded that intra-dermal injection of botulinum toxin is an effective and safe method to control facial pores, which showed acceptable results after 3 months."

There have been relatively few trials of botulinum toxin in upper limb task-specific dystonia, and prior studies have yielded variable results, leading to skepticism regarding the utility of this approach in elite performers. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over study of incobotulinum toxin-A in 21 professional musicians with focal upper extremity task-specific dystonia affecting performance on their instrument, using a novel paradigm of initial injections followed by booster injections at two- and four-week intervals. The primary outcome measure was the change in blinded dystonia rating of the active arm by two expert raters using a Clinical Global Impression numeric scale at week 8 compared to enrollment. 19 men and 2 women with musicians' dystonia were enrolled over a six-year period. Nineteen patients completed the study. Analysis of the primary outcome measure in comparison to baseline revealed a change in dystonia severity of P = 0.04 and an improvement in overall musical performance of P = 0.027. No clinically significant weakness was observed, and neutralizing antibodies to toxin were not found. Despite its small sample size, our study demonstrated a statistically significant benefit of incobotulinum toxin-A injections as a treatment for musicians' task-specific dystonia. Tailoring the use of toxin with booster injections allowed refinement of dosing strategy and outcomes, with benefits that were meaningful to patients clearly visible on videotaped evaluations. In addition to its application to musicians' dystonia, this approach may have relevance to optimize application of botulinum toxin in other forms of focal dystonia such as blepharospasm, cervical dystonia, writer's cramp, and spasmodic dysphonia."

The study was conducted over a 12-week therapy period in children with dystonic CP aged two to 14 years. Each group enrolled 51 participants. The THP + CLZ group showed significantly better improvement in dystonia severity at 12 weeks compared with the THP group alone (-4.5 ± 2.9 vs -3.4 ± 1.7, P = 0.02). Furthermore, the THP + CLZ group exhibited superior improvement in the severity of choreoathetosis, upper limb function, pain perception by the child, and quality of life, with P values of 0.02, 0.009, 0.01, and 0.01, respectively. The number of participants experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable in both groups (P = 0.67). Importantly, none of the participants in any of the groups reported any serious adverse events. A combination of oral THP + CLZ proves to be more efficacious than using THP alone for the treatment of dystonic CP in children aged two to 14 years in terms of reducing the severity of dystonia."

    "title": "Epidemiological study on pediatric-onset dystonia in Japan: A questionnaire-based survey.",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of pediatric-onset dystonia in Japan, addressing the diagnostic challenges arising from symptom variations and etiological diversity. From 2020 to 2022, questionnaires were distributed to 1218 board certified child neurologists (BCCNs) by Japanese Society of Child Neurology. In the primary survey, participants were asked to report the number of patients with pediatric-onset dystonia under their care. Subsequently, the follow-up secondary survey sought additional information on the clinical characteristics of these patients. The primary survey obtained 550 responses (response rate: 45 %) from BCCNs for their 736 patients with dystonia. The predominant etiologies included inherited cases (with DYT10 <PxMD-PRRT2> being the most prevalent, followed by DYT5 <DYT/PARK-GCH1> and ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders), acquired cases (with perinatal abnormalities being the most common), and idiopathic cases. The secondary survey provided clinical insights into 308 cases from 82 BCCNs. Infancy-onset dystonia presented as persistent and generalized with diverse symptoms, primarily linked to ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders and other genetic disorders resembling acquired dystonia. Conversely, childhood/adolescent-onset dystonia showed paroxysmal, fluctuating courses, predominantly affecting limbs. The most common etiologies were DYT5 <DYT/PARK-GCH1> and DYT10 <PxMD-PRRT2>, leading to therapeutic diagnoses. Pediatric-onset dystonia in Japan was treated by 28 % of BCCNs. The majority of cases were inherited, with high prevalence rates of DYT5 <DYT/PARK-GCH1> and DYT10 <PxMD-PRRT2>. Infancy-onset dystonia exhibits diverse etiologies and symptoms, emphasizing the utility of various examinations, including genetic testing. These findings significantly contribute to our understanding of pediatric-onset dystonia in Japan, although this study has the limitation of questionnaire survey."

    "abstract": "Musician's focal dystonia (mFD) is a rare, neurological, task-specific disorder that mainly affects the upper extremity (especially the hands) and generally appears as a painless muscular incoordination that can mark the end of a musician's professional career. The present literature review intends to highlight the current understanding of musician's focal dystonia, its underlying neural mechanisms and the role of prevention and treatment in physiotherapy, psychotherapy and other fields as occupational therapy. The aim of the present literature review was to gain an overview of mFD in the medical, psychological and physical therapy literature and investigate what strategies for diagnosis and rehabilitation are available today. The present article is a literature review, based on the search for full-text publications with the goal of comparing the main strategies for mFD rehabilitation and prevention presented in the literature. This literature review compared many relevant papers and studies available in literature today for mFD epidemiology, neural mechanisms, treatment and prevention, to discuss what we know today and highlight the aspects that can still be enhanced in the future. According to our results, current literature gives a good understanding of mFD epidemiology, but further studies are needed to fully comprehend the neurological aspects and develop more rehabilitation strategies, especially in the psychological field. Our research also highlighted the need for a multidisciplinary approach that considers both physical and psychological aspects. Physical rehabilitation strategies are helpful but, considering the amount of psychological aspects involved in mFD, a holistic approach should be considered and developed in the future. Finally, prevention must have a primary role in mFD treatment, raising awareness around it and, possibly, avoiding its development."

    "abstract": "Bradykinesia is an essential diagnostic criterion for Parkinson's disease (PD) but is frequently observed in many non-parkinsonian movement disorders, complicating differential diagnosis, particularly in disorders featuring tremors. The presence of bradykinetic features in the subset of dystonic tremors (DT), either \"pure\" dystonic tremors or tremors associated with dystonia, remains currently unexplored. The aim of the current study was to evaluate upper limb bradykinesia in DT patients, comparing them with healthy controls (HC) and patients with PD by observing repetitive finger tapping (FT). The protocol consisted of two main parts. Initially, the kinematic recording of repetitive FT was performed using optical hand tracking system (Leap Motion Controller). The values of amplitude, amplitude decrement, frequency, frequency decrement, speed, acceleration and number of halts of FT were calculated. Subsequently, three independent movement disorder specialists from different movement disorders centres, blinded to the diagnosis, rated the presence of FT bradykinesia based on video recordings. Thirty-six subjects participated in the study (12 DT, 12 HC and 12 early-stage PD). Kinematic analysis revealed no significant difference in the selected parameters of FT bradykinesia between DT patients and HC. In comparisons between DT and PD patients, PD patients exhibited bigger amplitude decrement and slower FT performance. In the blinded clinical assessment, bradykinesia was rated, on average, as being present in 41.6% of DT patients, 27.7% of HC, and 91.7% of PD patients. While overall inter-rater agreement was moderate, weak agreement was noted within the DT group. Clinical ratings indicated signs of bradykinesia in almost half of DT patients. The objective kinematic analysis confirmed comparable parameters between DT and HC individuals, with more pronounced abnormalities in PD across various kinematic parameters. Interpretation of bradykinesia signs in tremor patients with DT should be approached cautiously and objective motion analysis might complement the diagnostic process and serve as a decision support system in the choice of clinical entities."

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the globus pallidus internus (GPi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) is employed for the treatment of dystonia. Pallidal low-frequency oscillations have been proposed as a pathophysiological marker for dystonia. However, the role of subthalamic oscillations and STN-GPi coupling in relation to dystonia remains unclear. We aimed to explore oscillatory activities within the STN-GPi circuit and their correlation with the severity of dystonia and efficacy achieved by DBS treatment. Local field potentials were recorded simultaneously from the STN and GPi from 13 dystonia patients. Spectral power analysis was conducted for selected frequency bands from both nuclei, while power correlation and the weighted phase lag index were used to evaluate power and phase couplings between these two nuclei, respectively. These features were incorporated into generalized linear models to assess their associations with dystonia severity and DBS efficacy. The results revealed that pallidal theta power, subthalamic beta power and subthalamic-pallidal theta phase coupling and beta power coupling all correlated with clinical severity. The model incorporating all selected features predicts empirical clinical scores and DBS-induced improvements, whereas the model relying solely on pallidal theta power failed to demonstrate significant correlations. Beyond pallidal theta power, subthalamic beta power, STN-GPi couplings in theta and beta bands, play a crucial role in understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of dystonia and developing optimal strategies for DBS."

    "title": "Deep Brain Stimulation with Double Targeting of the VIM and PSA for the Treatment of Rare Tremor Syndromes.",
    "abstract": "In tremor syndromes, pharmacological therapy is the primary treatment, but deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used when it is insufficient. We explore the use of DBS, focusing on the globus pallidus internus for dystonia and the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) for tremor conditions. We introduce the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) as a potential target, suggesting its efficacy in tremor reduction, particularly in rare tremor syndromes. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of double targeting the VIM and PSA in rare tremor conditions, highlighting the limited existing data on this. Between 2019 and 2023, 22 patients with rare tremor syndromes were treated with bilateral DBS of the VIM and PSA. This case series consisted of 7 isolated head tremor, 1 hepatic encephalopathic tremor due to Abernethy syndrome, 2 voice tremor, 4 dystonic tremor, and 8 Holmes tremor (2 multiple sclerosis, 2 cerebellar insult, and 4 posttraumatic) patients. Patients' preoperative and 12-month postoperative tremor scores were compared, and the optimum VIM and PSA stimulation areas were investigated. There was a significant reduction in the mean TRS score from 3.70 (±0.57) to 0.45 (±0.68) after 12 months of surgery. Specific outcomes for different indications were observed: for head tremor, 6 of 7 patients showed a reduction in TRS scores to 0 points; the vocal tremor patients demonstrated improvement; this change was not statistically significant, which is likely to be due to the low number of patients in this subgroup; the dystonic tremor patients showed either complete tremor abolition or a reduction in TRS scores; the Holmes tremor patients showed an 80% reduction in TRS scores; and the hepatic encephalopathy tremor and Abernethy syndrome patients showed a 75% improvement in TRS scores. The stimulation parameters converged on the VIM and dorsal PSA. Complications included the need for electrode repositioning, infections requiring electrode removal and re-implantation, dysarthria, and stimulation-induced ataxia, which was resolved by adjusting the stimulation parameters. The literature on DBS for rare tremors is limited. Double targeting of the VIM and PSA appears to produce promising improvements on the outcomes reported in the existing literature on VIM-only DBS. The proximity of the VIM and PSA allows for flexible electrode placement, contributing to the potential success of the dual-target approach. We also discuss the theoretical advantages of targeting the PSA based on the distribution of tremor circuits, emphasizing the need for further research and electrophysiological studies."

We aimed to report and compare the clinical and neuroimaging presentation of two patients diagnosed with CBS. While case 1 had severe non-fluent aphasia associated with mild apraxia and limb rigidity, case 2 had a more posterior cognitive impairment, with a different language pattern associated with marked visuospatial errors and hemineglect. FDG PET played a significant role in diagnosis, suggesting, in the first case, corticobasal degeneration and, in the second, Alzheimer's disease pattern. CBS has been widely studied with the advent of new <i>in vivo</i> methods such as brain FDG PET. Studies that deepen the phenotypic and biomarker heterogeneity of CBS will be of great importance for better classification, prognosis, and treatment of the condition."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that lead to abnormal movements and postures; it has a major impact on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The aim of this study was to examine the HRQoL of Romanian patients with dystonia using the EQ-5D-5L instrument. <b>Methods</b>: Responses to the EQ-5D-5L and the visual analogue scale (VAS) were collected alongside demographic and clinical characteristics. Health profiles were analyzed via the metrics of the EQ-5D-5L, severity levels, and age groups. Using Shannon's indexes, we calculated informativity both for patients' health profile as a whole and each individual dimension. Level sum scores (LSS) of the EQ-5D-5L were calculated and compared with scores from the EQ-5D-5L index and VAS. The HRQoL measures were analyzed through demographic and clinical characteristics. Descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation, and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U or Kruskall-Wallis H) were used. The level of agreement between HRQoL measures was assessed using their intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots. <b>Results</b>: A sample of 90 patients was used, around 75.6% of whom were female patients, and the mean age at the beginning of the survey was 58.7 years. The proportion of patients reporting \"no problems\" in all five dimensions was 10%. The highest frequency reported was \"no problems\" in self-care (66%), followed by \"no problems\" in mobility (41%). Shannon index and Shannon evenness index values showed higher informativity for pain/discomfort (2.07 and 0.89, respectively) and minimal informativity for self-care (1.59 and 0.68, respectively). The mean EQ-5D-5L index, LSS, and VAS scores were 0.74 (SD = 0.26), 0.70 (SD = 0.24), and 0.61 (SD = 0.21), respectively. The Spearman correlations between HRQoL measures were higher than 0.60. The agreement between the EQ-5D-5L index and LSS values was excellent (ICC = 0.970, 95% CI = 0.934-0.984); the agreement was poor-to-good between the EQ-5D-5L index and VAS scores (ICC = 683, 95% CI = 0.388-0.820), and moderate-to-good between the LSS and VAS scores (ICC = 0.789, 95% CI = 0.593-0.862). <b>Conclusions</b>: Our results support the utilization of the EQ-5D-5L instrument in assessing the HRQoL of dystonia patients, and empirical results suggest that the EQ-5D-5L index and LSS measure may be used interchangeably. The findings from this study highlight that HRQoL is complex in patients with dystonia, particularly across different age groups."

BPT belongs to a group of \"episodic syndromes that may be associated with migraine\" and is diagnosed according to diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition. BPT affects infants and young children and is often an underdiagnosed manifestation since it is not recognized in cases with a benign evolution, requiring a careful differential diagnosis. It was first described by Snyder in 1969 as a movement disorder, a cervical dystonia consequent to labyrinthic disorder. The PubMed and Web of Science databases were consulted from 1968 to 2024, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. In total, 113 articles were identified, 86 selected, and 25 considered for the purpose of this review. Clinical studies were considered in relation to evolution, cognitive, and motor development; genetic and not genetic etiology; the relationship with migraine with and without aura; vestibular migraine; hemiplegic migraine; and paroxysmal vertigo."

    "abstract": "Patients with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) living in remote and underserved areas often have limited access to specialized healthcare, while the feasibility and reliability of the video-based examination remains unclear. The aim of this narrative review is to examine which parts of remote neurological assessment are feasible and reliable in movement disorders. Clinical studies have demonstrated that most parts of the video-based neurological examination are feasible, even in the absence of a third party, including stance and gait-if an assistive device is not required-bradykinesia, tremor, dystonia, some ocular mobility parts, coordination, and gross muscle power and sensation assessment. Technical issues (video quality, internet connection, camera placement) might affect bradykinesia and tremor evaluation, especially in mild cases, possibly due to their rhythmic nature. Rigidity, postural instability and deep tendon reflexes cannot be remotely performed unless a trained healthcare professional is present. A modified version of incomplete Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-III and a related equation lacking rigidity and pull testing items can reliably predict total UPDRS-III. UPDRS-II, -IV, Timed \"Up and Go\", and non-motor and quality of life scales can be administered remotely, while the remote Movement Disorder Society (MDS)-UPDRS-III requires further investigation. In conclusion, most parts of neurological examination can be performed virtually in PD, except for rigidity and postural instability, while technical issues might affect the assessment of mild bradykinesia and tremor. The combined use of wearable devices may at least partially compensate for these challenges in the future."

Dystonia is a movement disorder that causes non-velocity-dependent hypertonia and/or abnormal, often repetitive, twisting movements, and/or postures. Dystonia occurs more frequently in patients with CP than has been recognized previously, and is treated differently than other aspects of CP. Dystonia is an important cause of chronic pain, hospitalization, and musculoskeletal complications. We describe recent advances in dystonia diagnosis in patients with cerebral palsy and highlight focus areas for ongoing research and clinical care. IMPACT: Dystonia is a movement disorder that is more common in people with cerebral palsy (CP) than previously thought. Dystonia contributes to hospitalization, chronic pain, and complications in CP patients. People with dystonic CP require different tools to diagnose and treat their condition. We summarize current state of the art in dystonia in CP and identify areas of focus for future work."

    "abstract": "The term \"catatonia\" was introduced by German psychiatrist Karl Kahlbaum in 1874. Although historically tied to schizophrenia, catatonia exhibits a diverse range of phenotypes and has been observed in various medical and neuropsychiatric conditions. Its intrinsic movement characteristics and association with hypokinetic and hyperkinetic phenomenologies place catatonia within the purview of movement disorders. Despite the presence of catatonia in psychiatry literature for over 150 years, many gaps and controversies persist regarding its etiopathogenesis, phenomenology, diagnostic criteria, and treatment. The current versions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) require clinicians to identify any three signs of 15 (ICD-11) or 12 (DSM-5) for the diagnosis of catatonia. Catalepsy and waxy flexibility are the only motor features with high specificity for the diagnosis. We highlight the gaps and controversies in catatonia as a movement disorder, emphasize the lack of a clear definition, and discuss the inconsistencies in the description of various catatonic signs. We propose the exploration of a bi-axial classification framework similar to that used for dystonia and tremor to encourage the evaluation of underlying etiologies and to guide therapeutic decisions to improve the outcome of these patients. © 2024 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."

Although widely employed in diagnosing various movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and dystonia, by detecting disease-specific abnormalities, the specific characteristics of the TCS in cerebellar ataxia remain inconclusive. We aimed to assess the potential value of TCS in patients with cerebellar ataxias for disease diagnosis and severity assessment. TCS on patients with genetic and acquired cerebellar ataxia, including 94 with spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) containing 10 asymptomatic carriers, 95 with cerebellar subtype of multiple system atrophy (MSA-C), and 100 healthy controls (HC), was conducted. Assessments included third ventricle width, substantia nigra (SN) and lentiform nucleus (LN) echogenicity, along with comprehensive clinical evaluations and genetic testing. The study revealed significant TCS abnormalities in patients with cerebellar ataxia, such as enlarged third ventricle widths and elevated rates of hyperechogenic SN and LN. TCS showed high accuracy in distinguishing patients with SCA or MSA-C from HC, with an AUC of 0.870 and 0.931, respectively. TCS abnormalities aided in identifying asymptomatic SCA carriers, effectively differentiating them from HC, with an AUC of 0.725. Furthermore, third ventricle width was significantly correlated with SARA and ICARS scores in patients with SCA3 and SCOPA-AUT scores in patients with MSA-C. The SN area and SARA or ICARS scores in patients with SCA3 were also positively correlated. Our findings illustrate remarkable TCS abnormalities in patients with cerebellar ataxia, serving as potential biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and progression assessment."

The European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) and the International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society (MDS) recommend DBS for dystonia after failure of botulinum toxin (BoNT) and other oral medications for dystonia treatment. In addition, several long-term studies have demonstrated the continuous efficacy of DBS on motor and quality of life (QoL) scores. However, there are only a few reports comparing the overall impact of surgical treatment in BoNT protocols (e.g., dosage and number of selected muscles before and after surgery). This retrospective multicenter chart-review study analyzed botulinum toxin total dosage and dosage per muscle in 23 dystonic patients before and after DBS surgery. The study's primary outcome was to analyze whether there was a reduction in BoNT dosage after DBS surgery. The mean BoNT dosages difference between baseline and post-surgery was 293.4 units for 6 months, 292.6 units for 12 months, and 295.2 units at the last visit. The median total dose of BoNT in the preoperative period was 800 units (N = 23). At the last visit, the median was 700 units (<i>p</i> = 0.05). This represents a 12.5% reduction in BoNT median dosage. In conclusion, despite the limitations of this retrospective study, there was a significant reduction in BoNT doses after DBS surgery in patients with generalized dystonia."

The former received structured stretching exercises after their BONT/A injections for 20 min, 5 days per week, for 6 months at a hospital, while the others conducted self-stretching exercises at home. The outcome measures were assessed before the intervention (T0) and after three (T1) and six months (T2). Significantly greater improvements in the MAS scores of the elbows, wrists, and fingers were found in the intervention group's patients at T1 and T2. The behavioral outcome measures, including shoulder pain, activities of daily living, and quality of life, and our electrophysiological studies also showed a significantly higher enhancement in this patient group. In conclusion, the structured stretching exercises plus BONT/A injections for six months showed a superior effect in relieving post-stroke upper-limb spasticity compared to self-stretching exercises."

BoNTs are routinely used to treat movement disorders such as cervical dystonia, spastic conditions, blepharospasm, and hyperhidrosis, as well as for cosmetic purposes. In addition to the conventional indications, the use of BoNTs to reduce pain has gained increased recognition, giving rise to an increasing number of indications in disorders associated with chronic pain. Furthermore, BoNT-derived formulations are benefiting a much wider range of patients suffering from overactive bladder, erectile dysfunction, arthropathy, neuropathic pain, and cancer. BoNTs are categorised into seven toxinotypes, two of which are in clinical use, and each toxinotype is divided into multiple subtypes. With the development of bioinformatic tools, new BoNT-like toxins have been identified in non-Clostridial organisms. In addition to the expanding indications of existing formulations, the rich variety of toxinotypes or subtypes in the wild-type BoNTs associated with new BoNT-like toxins expand the BoNT superfamily, forming the basis on which to develop new BoNT-based therapeutics as well as research tools. An overview of the diversity of the BoNT family along with their conventional therapeutic uses is presented in this review followed by the engineering and formulation opportunities opening avenues in therapy."

In most reported cases, the inheritance of BHC is autosomal dominant but both incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity are observed and can be caused by NKX2-1 mutations. The spectrum contains choreoathetosis, congenital hypothyroidism, and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. The neurological symptoms can be misdiagnosed as Huntington's disease (HD). The two Polish families were diagnosed with NKX2-1 gene mutations and a literature review concerning the NKX2-1-related disorders was conducted. All family members were examined by experienced movement disorders specialists. PubMed database was searched to obtain previously described NKX2-1 cases. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in one proband (Family A) and direct NKX2-1 sequencing in the second (Family B). Two Polish families were diagnosed with NKX2-1 gene mutations (p.Trp208Leu and p.Cys117Alafs*8). In one family, the co-occurrence of HD was reported. Forty-nine publications were included in the literature review and symptoms of 195 patients with confirmed NKX2-1 mutation were analyzed. The most common symptoms were chorea and choreiform movements, and delayed motor milestones. The NKX2-1 mutation should always be considered as a potential diagnosis in families with chorea, even with a family history of HD. Lack of chorea does not exclude the NKX2-1-related disorders."

Genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity leads to variable clinical presentation. Next-generation sequencing technologies are being currently used in the workup of patients with inherited dystonia to determine the specific cause in the individuals with autosomal dominant, recessive, X-linked or mitochondrial inheritance patterns. Calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 A (CACNA1A) gene variants are rare in dystonias. We here present a 20-year-old man with a history of delayed milestones, flexor posturing, dysarthria, dysphagia and a negative family history from consanguineous parents. Neurological examination revealed right lateral scoliosis of the neck and generalised dystonic posturing affecting both upper and lower limbs. MRI of the brain was unremarkable. Molecular genetic results revealed a heterozygous variant in the CACNA1A gene (CHR19: NM_023035.2, c. 1602G>A; p. Met534Ile). Segregation analyses in both the parents revealed wild-type CACNA1A gene suggesting de novo nature of the variant with a likely pathogenic classification. Dystonia is one of the clinical phenotypes that can be associated with CACNA1A gene mutations and we recommend that this gene either be included in the dystonia panel offered or tested when the initial primary genetic result is negative."

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a group of neurodegenerative diseases that are typically caused by a monogenetic mutation, leading to development of disordered movement symptoms such as dystonia, hyperreflexia, etc. Brain iron accumulation can be diagnosed through MRI imaging and is hypothesized to be the cause of oxidative stress, leading to the degeneration of brain tissue. There are four main types of NBIA: pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN), mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration (MKAN), and beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN). There are no causative therapies for these diseases, but iron chelators have been shown to have potential toward treating NBIA. Three chelators are investigated in this Review: deferoxamine (DFO), desferasirox (DFS), and deferiprone (DFP). DFO has been investigated to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD); however, dose-related toxicity in these studies, as well as in PKAN studies, have shown that the drug still requires more development before it can be applied toward NBIA cases. Iron chelation therapies other than the ones currently in clinical use have not yet reached clinical studies, but they may possess characteristics that would allow them to access the brain in ways that current chelators cannot. Intranasal formulations are an attractive dosage form to study for chelation therapy, as this method of delivery can bypass the blood-brain barrier and access the CNS. Gene therapy differs from iron chelation therapy as it is a causal treatment of the disease, whereas iron chelators only target the disease progression of NBIA. Because the pathophysiology of NBIA diseases is still unclear, future courses of action should be focused on causative treatment; however, iron chelation therapy is the current best course of action."

    "abstract": "Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by distinct dysmorphic facies, skeletal anomalies, and failure to thrive. CdLS type 5 (CdLS5) is caused by the HDAC8 gene mutations on chromosome Xq13.1 with X-linked dominant inheritance. We report our observation of an individual with CdLS5 with de novo missense mutation presenting with a novel phenotype of generalized dystonia. A four-month-old girl, second born to a non-consanguineous couple, presented with developmental delay, failure to thrive, and spastic quadriparesis. She had a history of intrauterine growth retardation in the third trimester of pregnancy. Facial gestalt was suggestive of CdLS. She had marked axial and appendicular dystonia. A skeletal survey and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) brain studies were normal. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous missense variation c.628G>C in the HDAC8 gene. She was treated with trihexyphenidyl and clonazepam, followed by syndopa. On follow-up assessment at 22 months of age, the dystonia gradually improved but not entirely over time with medication. It is already known that single gene disorders, including SCN1A, SCN2A, KCNQ2, PRRT2, and pyridoxine deficiency, can result in isolated dystonia; we add CdLS5 (HDAC8 variation) to this expanding spectrum."

    "title": "Duration of botulinum toxin efficacy in cervical dystonia clinical trials: A scoping review.",
    "abstract": "Botulinum toxin (BoNT) is first-line treatment for cervical dystonia (CD). Treatment of CD with BoNT usually requires injections every 3-4 months for as long as symptoms persist, which can be for the lifetime of the individual. Duration of BoNT effect can impact quality of life since it is important that efficacy is maintained throughout an injection cycle to avoid fluctuations of effect after each injection. There is currently no consensus on how to assess duration of BoNT effect in patients with CD. A scoping review was conducted to summarize the available evidence from phase 3 clinical trials of BoNT in CD and on the interpretation of the reported duration of effect. The available evidence was analyzed in the context of clinical experience and real-world treatment practices of CD. Methods for estimating duration of effect varied across publications; most were based on artificial constructs developed for clinical trials (time until a pre-specified efficacy endpoint was reached) and are not appropriate to apply in clinical practice. Clinical trial outcomes in CD were not objectively evaluated, and did not prioritize patients' needs or focus on factors that impact patients' daily living activities and quality of life. Better evidence and consistency of reporting for duration of effect for BoNT in CD is needed to help guide clinicians on when reinjection is likely to be required. The goal should be to keep patients as symptom-free as possible with flexible reinjection intervals tailored to individual needs."

    "title": "Anticholinergic drugs for parkinsonism and other movement disorders.",
    "abstract": "Anticholinergic (AC) drugs, a medication class that acts by blocking nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, were first utilized for therapeutic purposes in the mid-19th century. Initial applications were as symptomatic therapy for Parkinson disease (PD), a practice continuing to the present. Initially, the AC drugs used were naturally-occurring plant compounds. Synthetic AC drugs were developed in the late 1940s and predominated in neurological therapeutics. Until the advent of pharmaceuticals acting upon striatal dopaminergic motor pathways, AC drugs provided the only effective means for lessening tremors and other clinical problems of the PD patient. However, because dopaminergic compounds are so effective at meeting the needs of the typical PD patient, AC medications are far less utilized by clinicians today. In recent years, there has been only a few investigations of AC drugs as neurological treatments. This review will revisit the clinical landscape of AC pharmacology and application for movement disorders along with recent research in search of improving therapeutics with AC drugs."

    "abstract": "<i>GNAO1</i>-related disorders (<i>GNAO1</i>-RD) encompass a diverse spectrum of neurodevelopmental and movement disorders arising from variants in the <i>GNAO1</i> gene. Dyskinetic crises, marked by sudden and intense exacerbations of abnormal involuntary movements, present a significant challenge in <i>GNAO1</i>-RD. This study aimed to establish a standardized framework for understanding dyskinetic crises, addressing crucial aspects such as definition, triggers, diagnostic criteria, complications, and management strategies. A Delphi consensus process was conducted involving international experts in <i>GNAO1</i>-RD. The panel of thirteen experts participated in three voting rounds, discussing 90 statements generated through a literature review and clinical expertise. Consensus was achieved on 31 statements, defining dyskinetic crises as abrupt, paroxysmal episodes involving distinct abnormal movements in multiple body regions, triggered by emotional stress or infections. Dyskinetic crises may lead to functional impairment and complications, emphasizing the need for prompt recognition. While individualized pharmacological recommendations were not provided, benzodiazepines and clonidine were suggested for acute crisis management. Chronic treatment options included tetrabenazine, benzodiazepines, gabapentin, and clonidine. Deep brain stimulation should be considered early in the treatment of refractory or prolonged dyskinetic crisis. This consensus provides a foundation for understanding and managing dyskinetic crises in <i>GNAO1</i>-RD for clinicians, caregivers, and researchers. The study emphasizes the importance of targeted parental and caregiver education, which enables early recognition and intervention, thereby potentially minimizing both short- and long-term complications. Future research should concentrate on differentiating dyskinetic crises from other neurological events and investigating potential risk factors that influence their occurrence and nature. The proposed standardized framework improves clinical management, stakeholder communication, and future <i>GNAO1</i>-RD research."

    "title": "Engaging dystonia networks with subthalamic stimulation.",
    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation is a viable and efficacious treatment option for dystonia. While the internal pallidum serves as the primary target, more recently, stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been investigated. However, optimal targeting within this structure and its complex surroundings have not been studied in depth. Indeed, multiple historical targets that have been used for surgical treatment of dystonia are directly adjacent to the STN. Further, multiple types of dystonia exist, and outcomes are variable, suggesting that not all types would profit maximally from the exact same target. Therefore, a thorough investigation of the neural substrates underlying effects on dystonia symptoms is warranted. Here, we analyze a multi-center cohort of isolated dystonia patients with subthalamic implantations (<i>N</i> = 58) and relate their stimulation sites to improvement of appendicular and cervical symptoms as well as blepharospasm. Stimulation of the ventral oral posterior nucleus of thalamus and surrounding regions was associated with improvement in cervical dystonia, while stimulation of the dorsolateral STN was associated with improvement in limb dystonia and blepharospasm. This dissociation was also evident for structural connectivity, where the cerebellothalamic, corticospinal and pallidosubthalamic tracts were associated with improvement of cervical dystonia, while hyperdirect and subthalamopallidal pathways were associated with alleviation of limb dystonia and blepharospasm. Importantly, a single well-placed electrode may reach the three optimal target sites. On the level of functional networks, improvement of limb dystonia was correlated with connectivity to the corresponding somatotopic regions in primary motor cortex, while alleviation of cervical dystonia was correlated with connectivity to the recently described 'action-mode' network that involves supplementary motor and premotor cortex. Our findings suggest that different types of dystonia symptoms are modulated via distinct networks. Namely, appendicular dystonia and blepharospasm are improved with modulation of the basal ganglia, and, in particular, the subthalamic circuitry, including projections from the primary motor cortex. In contrast, cervical dystonia was more responsive when engaging the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit, including direct stimulation of ventral thalamic nuclei. These findings may inform DBS targeting and image-based programming strategies for patient-specific treatment of dystonia."

    "abstract": "To develop an objective method based on texture analysis on MRI for diagnosis of congenital muscular torticollis (CMT). The T1- and T2-weighted imaging, Q-dixon, and T1-mapping MRI data of 38 children with CMT were retrospectively analyzed. The region of interest (ROI) was manually drawn at the level of the largest cross-sectional area of the SCM on the affected side. MaZda software was used to obtain the texture features of the T2WI sequences of the ROI in healthy and affected SCM. A radiomics diagnostic model based on muscle texture features was constructed using logistic regression analysis. Fatty infiltration grade was calculated by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and fibrosis ratio by Masson staining. Correlation between the MRI parameters and pathological indicators was analyzed. There was positive correlation between fatty infiltration grade and mean value, standard deviation, and maximum value of the Q-dixon sequence of the affected SCM (correlation coefficients, 0.65, 0.59, and 0.58, respectively, P < 0.05).Three muscle texture features-S(2,2)SumAverg, S(3,3)SumVarnc, and T2WI extreme difference-were selected to construct the diagnostic model. The model showed significant diagnostic value for CMT (P < 0.05). The area under the curve of the multivariate conditional logistic regression model was 0.828 (95% confidence interval 0.735-0.922); the sensitivity was 0.684 and the specificity 0.868. The radiomics diagnostic model constructed using T2WI muscle texture features and MRI signal values appears to have good diagnostic efficiency. Q-dixon sequence can reflect the fatty infiltration grade of CMT."

    "abstract": "The integrated stress response (ISR) is a highly conserved biochemical pathway that regulates protein synthesis. The ISR is activated in response to diverse stressors to restore cellular homeostasis. As such, the ISR is implicated in a wide range of diseases, including brain disorders. However, in the brain, the ISR also has potent influence on processes beyond proteostasis, namely synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Thus, in the setting of brain diseases, ISR activity may have dual effects on proteostasis and synaptic function. In this review, we consider the ISR's contribution to brain disorders through the lens of its potential effects on synaptic plasticity. From these examples, we illustrate that at times ISR activity may be a \"double-edged sword\". We also highlight its potential as a therapeutic target to improve circuit function in brain diseases independent of its role in disease pathogenesis."

The aim was to provide insights into the clinical and genetic characteristics of ZBTB11-related disorders (ZBTB11-RD), with a particular emphasis on progressive complex movement abnormalities. Thirteen new and 16 previously reported affected individuals, ranging in age from 2 to 50 years, with biallelic ZBTB11 variants underwent clinical and genetic characterization. All patients exhibited a range of neurodevelopmental phenotypes with varying severity, encompassing ocular and neurological features. Eleven new patients presented with complex abnormal movements, including ataxia, dystonia, myoclonus, stereotypies, and tremor, and 7 new patients exhibited cataracts. Deep brain stimulation was successful in treating 1 patient with generalized progressive dystonia. Our analysis revealed 13 novel variants. This study provides additional insights into the clinical features and spectrum of ZBTB11-RD, highlighting the progressive nature of movement abnormalities in the background of neurodevelopmental phenotype."

The role of TrPs in patients with cervical dystonia (CD) has not been investigated. To identify the presence of TrPs in patients with isolated idiopathic CD and their association with pain. Thirty-one patients (74.2% women; age: 61.2 years, SD: 10.1 years) participated. TrPs were explored in the sternocleidomastoid, upper trapezius, splenius capitis, levator scapulae, anterior scalene, suboccipital, and infraspinatus muscles. Clinical features of CD were documented as well as the presence of pain. The severity of dystonia and its consequences were assessed using the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS). The mean number of TrPs for each patient was 12 (SD:3), with no differences between patients with pain (n = 20) and those without pain (n = 11). Active TrPs were only found in patients with pain (mean: 7.5, SD:4). Latent TrPs were found in both groups but were more prevalent (P < 0.001) in patients without pain (mean: 11, SD:3.5) than in those with pain (mean: 5, SD:3.5). The number of active TrPs or latent TrPs was positively associated with the TWSTRS disability subscale and the TWSTRS total score. The number of active, but not latent, TrPs was associated with worse scores on the TWSTRS pain subscale. Active TrPs were present in patients with CD reporting pain, while latent TrPs were present in all CD patients, irrespective of their pain status. The numbers of active/latent TrPs were associated with disability. TrPs could act as pain generators in CD and also contribute to the involuntary muscle contractions characteristic of dystonia."

    "abstract": "Mutations in <i>Prkra</i> gene, which encodes PACT/RAX cause early onset primary dystonia DYT-PRKRA, a movement disorder that disrupts coordinated muscle movements. PACT/RAX activates protein kinase R (PKR, aka EIF2AK2) by a direct interaction in response to cellular stressors to mediate phosphorylation of the α subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). Mice homozygous for a naturally arisen, recessively inherited frameshift mutation, <i>Prkra</i> <sup><i>lear-5J</i></sup> exhibit progressive dystonia. In the present study, we investigate the biochemical and developmental consequences of the <i>Prkra</i> <sup><i>lear-5J</i></sup> mutation. Our results indicate that the truncated PACT/RAX protein retains its ability to interact with PKR, however, it inhibits PKR activation. Furthermore, mice homozygous for the mutation have abnormalities in the cerebellar development as well as a severe lack of dendritic arborization of Purkinje neurons. Additionally, reduced eIF2α phosphorylation is noted in the cerebellums and Purkinje neurons of the homozygous <i>Prkra</i> <sup><i>lear-5J</i></sup> mice. These results indicate that PACT/RAX mediated regulation of PKR activity and eIF2α phosphorylation plays a role in cerebellar development and contributes to the dystonia phenotype resulting from this mutation."

    "abstract": "Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterised by abnormal involuntary movements and postures, particularly affecting the head and neck. However, current clinical assessment methods for dystonia rely on simplified rating scales which lack the ability to capture the intricate spatiotemporal features of dystonic phenomena, hindering clinical management and limiting understanding of the underlying neurobiology. To address this, we developed a visual perceptive deep learning framework that utilizes standard clinical videos to comprehensively evaluate and quantify disease states and the impact of therapeutic interventions, specifically deep brain stimulation. This framework overcomes the limitations of traditional rating scales and offers an efficient and accurate method that is rater-independent for evaluating and monitoring dystonia patients. To evaluate the framework, we leveraged semi-standardized clinical video data collected in three retrospective, longitudinal cohort studies across seven academic centres. We extracted static head angle excursions for clinical validation and derived kinematic variables reflecting naturalistic head dynamics to predict dystonia severity, subtype, and neuromodulation effects. The framework was also applied to a fully independent cohort of generalised dystonia patients for comparison between dystonia sub-types. Computer vision-derived measurements of head angle excursions showed a strong correlation with clinically assigned scores. Across comparisons, we identified consistent kinematic features from full video assessments encoding information critical to disease severity, subtype, and effects of neural circuit interventions, independent of static head angle deviations used in scoring. Our visual perceptive machine learning framework reveals kinematic pathosignatures of dystonia, potentially augmenting clinical management, facilitating scientific translation, and informing personalized precision neurology approaches."

    "abstract": "Defects in GNAO1, the gene encoding the major neuronal G-protein Gαo, are related to neurodevelopmental disorders, epilepsy, and movement disorders. Nevertheless, there is a poor understanding of how molecular mechanisms explain the different phenotypes. We aimed to analyze the clinical phenotype and the molecular characterization of GNAO1-related disorders. Patients were recruited in collaboration with the Spanish GNAO1 Association. For patient phenotyping, direct clinical evaluation, analysis of homemade-videos, and an online questionnaire completed by families were analyzed. We studied Gαo cellular expression, the interactions of the partner proteins, and binding to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Eighteen patients with GNAO1 genetic defects had a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, central hypotonia, and movement disorders. Eleven patients showed neurological deterioration, recurrent hyperkinetic crisis with partial recovery, and secondary complications leading to death in three cases. Deep brain stimulation improved hyperkinetic crisis, but had inconsistent benefits in dystonia. The molecular defects caused by pathogenic Gαo were aberrant GTP binding and hydrolysis activities, an inability to interact with cellular binding partners, and reduced coupling to GPCRs. Decreased localization of Gαo in the plasma membrane was correlated with the phenotype of \"developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 17.\" We observed a genotype-phenotype correlation, pathogenic variants in position 203 were related to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, whereas those in position 209 were related to neurodevelopmental disorder with involuntary movements. Milder phenotypes were associated with other molecular defects such as del.16q12.2q21 and I344del. We highlight the complexity of the motor phenotype, which is characterized by fluctuations throughout the day, and hyperkinetic crisis with a distinct post-hyperkinetic crisis state. We confirm a molecular-based genotype-phenotype correlation for specific variants. © 2024 The Author(s).

Parkin is a multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a variety of roles in the cell including the degradation of proteins and the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis, integrity, and biogenesis. In 2001, the R275W mutation in the PRKN gene was identified in two unrelated families with a multigenerational history of postural tremor, dystonia and parkinsonism. Drosophila models of Parkin R275W showed selective and progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neuronal clusters, mitochondrial abnormalities, and prominent climbing defects. In the Prkn mouse orthologue, the amino acid R274 corresponds to human R275. Here we described an age-related motor impairment and a muscle phenotype in R274W +/+ mice. In vitro, Parkin R274W mutation correlates with abnormal myoblast differentiation, mitochondrial defects, and alteration in mitochondrial mRNA and protein levels. Our data suggest that the Parkin R274W mutation may impact mitochondrial physiology and eventually myoblast proliferation and differentiation."

To carry out the translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the CDQ24 questionnaire in its Spanish version in patients diagnosed with BEB who have been treated with BtA in an ophthalmologic center in Bogotá - Colombia. Pilot test of validation study and adaptation of a scale assembled in a prospective cohort of the CDQ24 instrument to Spanish in adult patients with primary blepharospasm treated with botulinum toxin in Bogota, Colombia.

We compared demographics, clinical characteristics, and grey and white matter volume loss with SPM12 between groups and assessed pathology and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) pathological lesion counts in patients who had died and undergone autopsy. Median age at CBS diagnosis was 66.4 years in classic-onset CBS and 73.6 years in SL-onset CBS. Classic-onset CBS had higher frequencies of dystonia, myoclonus, and alien limb phenomenon, while SL-onset CBS had a higher frequency of vertical supranuclear gaze palsy. Both groups showed smaller frontoparietal volumes than controls, with SL-onset CBS having greater volume loss in the left supplementary motor area than classic-onset CBS. All three classic-onset CBS cases with autopsy (100 %) had CBD pathology while 8/21 of SL-onset CBS cases (38 %) had CBD. Pathological lesion burden (including astrocytic plaques) did not differ between classic-onset and SL-onset CBS. Classic-onset and SL-onset CBS appear to be different syndromes, with the former being a more profuse motor syndrome. The more widespread volume loss in SL-onset CBS likely reflects longer disease course."

The most common therapeutic option for patients with LD involves Botulinum neurotoxin injections. Provide empirical evidence that non-invasive vibro-tactile stimulation (VTS) of the skin over the voice box can provide symptom relief to those affected by LD. Single-group 11-week randomized controlled trial with a crossover between two dosages (20 min of VTS once or 3 times per week) self-administered in-home in two 4-week blocks. Acute effects of VTS on voice and speech were assessed in-lab at weeks 1, 6 and 11. Participants were randomized to receive either 40 Hz or 100 Hz VTS. Primary: <i>smoothed cepstral peak prominence</i> (CPPS) of the voice signal to quantify voice and speech abnormalities, and <i>perceived speech effort</i> (PSE) ranked by participants as a measure of voice effort (scale 1-10). Secondary: <i>number of voice breaks</i> during continuous speech, the <i>Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice</i> (CAPE-V) inventory as a measure of overall disease severity and the <i>Voice Handicap Index</i> 30-item self report. Thirty-nine people with a confirmed diagnosis of adductor-type LD (mean [SD] age, 60.3 [11.3] years; 18 women and 21 men) completed the study. A single application of VTS improved voice quality (median CPPS increase: 0.41 dB, 95% CI [0.20, 0.61]) and/or reduced voice effort (PSE) by at least 30% in up to 57% of participants across the three study visits. Effects lasted from less than 30 min to several days. There was no effect of dosage and no evidence that the acute therapeutic effects of VTS increased or decreased longitudinally over the 11-week study period. Both 100 and 40 Hz VTS induced measurable improvements in voice quality and speech effort. VTS induced an additional benefit to those receiving Botulinum toxin. Participants, not receiving Botulinum treatment also responded to VTS. This study provides the first systematic empirical evidence that the prolonged use of laryngeal VTS can induce repeatable acute improvements in voice quality and reductions of voice effort in LD.

This case demonstrated that in autoimmune encephalitis, it is important to monitor serum GAD65 antibodies levels and consider immunotherapy, despite mildly elevated serum levels. The patient's history of left arm dystonic movements without impaired awareness may have been due to limb dystonia, a presenting symptom of stiff person syndrome (SPS), despite SPS more commonly affecting axial muscles.

It belongs to the category of medications with a limited therapeutic window and requires therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). PTH has been observed to induce a variety of Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) including ataxia, dystonia, nystagmus, dyskinesia, etc. Phenytoin-induced ataxia is an uncommonly observed ADR of Phenytoin whose reports are extremely limited. <b>Case:</b> Herein, we present a case report of a 16-year-old Asian patient with a past history of epilepsy that was admitted to a tertiary care hospital due to the development of ataxia, giddiness, and vomiting when taking Phenytoin in addition to Oxcarbazepine, Clobazam, and Levetiracetam to treat seizures. On admission, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings revealed bilateral variable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lesions in the parieto-occipital region of the periventricular area (periventricular leukomalacia). Additionally, serum Phenytoin levels were observed to be in the toxic range (40 μg/mL) due to which physicians confirmed the ADR to be due to Phenytoin toxicity. Thus, the Phenytoin drug was discontinued in the patient gradually and he was continued on clobazam, oxcarbazepine, and brivaracetam which led to reversal of the ADR in the patient. <b>Conclusion:</b> In this case, ataxia resulted from Phenytoin overdose, as confirmed by MRI and serum tests suggesting that TDM of Phenytoin is essential to prevent ADRs. Given the scarcity of ataxia cases caused by Phenytoin, awareness is lacking within the scientific community. Our aim is to provide insights to promote better monitoring and patient-centered treatment outcomes for epileptic patients."

Although overall considered an effective treatment for Parkinson disease and epilepsy, a number of specific factors determine the treatment success for DBS including careful patient selection, effective postoperative programming of DBS devices and accurate electrode placement. Furthermore, invasiveness of the procedure is a rate limiter for patient adoption. It is desired to explore a less invasive way to deliver DBS therapy. Here, we report for the first time the direct comparison of endovascular and parenchymal DBS in a triplicate ovine model using the anterior nucleus of the thalamus as the parenchymal target for refractory epilepsy. Triplicate ovine studies show comparable sensing resolution and stimulation performance of endovascular DBS with parenchymal DBS. The results from this feasibility study opens up a new frontier for minimally invasive DBS therapy."
