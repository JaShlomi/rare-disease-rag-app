    "title": "Mitral Annular Calcification, a Not So Marginal and Relatively Benign Finding as Many of Us Think: A Review.",
    "abstract": "Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is usually considered an incidental, benign, age-related finding without serious complications in patients evaluated for cardiovascular or pulmonary disease with imaging studies that may result in mitral regurgitation or stenosis when severe. Therefore, it is usually not considered a significant alteration. However, there is accumulating evidence that it is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events, such as atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, aortic artery disease, carotid artery disease, peripheral artery disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular and/or intraventricular conduction disturbance, systemic embolization, infective endocarditis, heart failure and mortality. The presence of MAC also significantly influences the outcome of mitral valve transcatheter and surgical interventions. Several conditions may predispose to MAC. MAC is strongly related to cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking and cardiovascular atherosclerosis, and inflammation may also play a role in the pathogenesis of MAC. Also, conditions that increase mitral valve stress, such as hypertension, aortic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, predispose to accelerated degenerative calcification of the mitral annulus area. Congenital disorders, e.g., Marfan syndrome and Hurler syndrome, are also associated with MAC, due to an intrinsic abnormality of the connective tissue composing the annulus."

    "title": "In-vivo biomechanical characteristics analysis of ascending aortic aneurysm using multidimensional dynamic CTA.",
    "abstract": "This study utilized multidimensional dynamic computed tomography angiography (MD-CTA) to analyze the biomechanical characteristics of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms (ATAA) in 30 subjects: 20 ATAA patients (12 with Marfan syndrome and 8 without) and 10 healthy individuals without ascending aortic disease. Aortic models were reconstructed from CTA images, and multi-phase displacement data were obtained via image registration. The inverse finite element method (iFEM) was applied to calculate wall tension, and displacement data was used to calculate wall strain, from which strain-tension curves were fitted. Based on these curves, we calculated the previously proposed mechanical parameters SSI and dSSI to assess wall mechanics. Given the considerable deformation of the ascending aorta, two additional parameters-potential energy reserve index (PERI) and strain resistance (Rs)-were used to evaluate energy storage. Mann-Whitney U tests revealed that both SSI and dSSI were significantly higher in the non-Marfan ATAA group compared to the Marfan and control groups, but showed no significant difference between the latter two groups. PERI and Rs were higher in the non-Marfan group compared to two other groups, reaching significance only between the non-Marfan and control groups, while the Marfan and control groups showed no significance. With further validation, these in vivo biomechanical markers may be used as complementary metrics for assessing patient-specific risk of aneurysm rupture."

    "title": "Different physiologic biomechanical metrics correlate with aortic diameter increases in normal maturation compared to aneurysm progression in mice.",
    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is the major cardiovascular manifestation of Marfan Syndrome (MFS), a connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in fibrillin-1. Aneurysmal dilation usually occurs in the ascending aorta (ASC) in MFS, but structural and mechanical changes are detectable throughout the arterial tree that may lead to dissection and rupture. Clinical management includes measuring ASC diameter and/or growth rate but does not typically include other regions of the thoracic aorta and dissection in the descending aorta (DSC) can occur after surgical replacement of the ASC. In severe forms of MFS, dilation forms concomitantly with aortic maturation, so it can be difficult to separate normal and pathologic changes in diameter. We used Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> (MU) (a model of severe MFS) and wildtype (WT) mice and quantified biaxial physiologic biomechanical metrics of ASC and DSC at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months of age, which includes a period of normal growth and aortic maturation in WT mice and aneurysm formation in MU mice. The results showed age- and location-specific dilation and alterations in biomechanical metrics with different patterns in WT and MU aorta. A multivariable mixed model showed that stored strain energy and circumferential stress were the primary contributors to aortic diameter predictions in WT ASC and DSC, while circumferential and axial incremental moduli (i.e. material stiffness) were the primary contributors to aortic diameter predictions in MU ASC and DSC. The results highlight different biomechanical metrics associated with aortic diameter increases in normal maturation compared to TAA progression in mice."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is often characterized by severe chest or back pain, but it can present atypically, leading to diagnostic challenges. This case report highlights an unusual presentation of Stanford type B aortic dissection in a patient with gastrointestinal symptoms. A 68-year-old male patient with no prior abdominal surgical history presented with a seven-day history of constipation and abdominal bloating. Initial assessments suggested bowel obstruction, supported by physical examination and abdominal X-ray findings. However, a contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an intimal flap at the T10-L1 level with an associated intramural hematoma, confirming a diagnosis of Stanford type B aortic dissection. This case underscores that aortic dissection can present with symptoms consistent with paralytic ileus.Physicians should include aortic dissection in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with ileus, particularly those with no prior surgical history or who have never been diagnosed with conditions such as difficult-to-control hypertension, giant cell arteritis, bicuspid aortic valve, intracranial aneurysms, simple renal cysts, a family history of aortic disease, or Marfan syndrome."

    "abstract": "Congenital ectopia lentis (CEL) is a rare ophthalmic disorder characterized by partial or complete dislocation of the lens, leading to significant visual impairment. The etiology is complex, often involving genetic factors and systemic diseases. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications and preserve the patient's vision. This report presents a case of a 7-year-and-6-month-old Chinese male patient with congenital ectopia lentis. The patient had a history of high myopia from an early age and poor corrected vision. Diagnostic evaluations included slit-lamp biomicroscopy, biometry, retinal OCT, corneal thickness measurement, corneal topography, and ultrasound examinations. Additionally, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify gene mutations potentially linked to the clinical manifestations. Imaging studies revealed bilateral lens dislocation accompanied by corneal astigmatism and vitreous opacities. Genetic testing detected a known pathogenic missense mutation (c.3209G > A) in the FBN1 gene, associated with Marfan syndrome. A variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in the COL2A1 gene, potentially related to Stickler syndrome, was also identified. The diagnosis of congenital ectopia lentis can be confirmed through a combination of imaging studies and genetic testing, particularly when associated with systemic diseases. Imaging techniques help determine the extent of lens dislocation and related complications, while genetic testing provides critical insights into the underlying genetic causes. Early diagnosis and intervention are essential to reduce the risk of complications and improve patients' quality of life."

Imaging revealed severe stenoses in the Cabrol-left main artery anastomosis and right coronary artery ostium. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed for the right coronary artery with a drug-eluting stent, followed by PCI for the Cabrol graft using a 7- × 26-mm covered stent via brachial access. The procedure was successful, with no complications. At 2-year follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic, with preserved function and no restenosis. PCI with a peripheral covered stent is a feasible, less-invasive alternative to surgery for Cabrol graft stenosis, offering favorable outcomes in high-risk patients."

    "abstract": "Myopia of Marfan syndrome (MFS) may be ascribed to crystalline lens subluxation, abnormal corneal curvature, and increased globe axial length. Few studies have reported these measures in MFS children who did or did not have ectopia lentis (EL). To measure eye findings longitudinally in MFS children with and without EL. A prospective, comparative case study was conducted on 24 MFS children (48 eyes). EL necessitated lensectomy and intraocular lens implantation surgery in 16/24 children (mean age 5.6 ± 2.8 years). The remaining 8/24 MFS children (mean age 11.2 ± 4.2 years) had no EL and were phakic. Follow-up was a mean of 3.1 ± 0.5 years. At follow-up visits, visual acuity, tonometry, refractive error, central corneal thickness (CCT), biomicroscopic examination, axial length, anterior chamber depth, endothelial cell density (ECD), and corneal curvature were monitored. At the initial visit, before EL surgery, MFS children with EL had greater myopia (<i>P</i> < 0.01), corneal cylinder (<i>P</i> = 0.04), and CCT (<i>P</i> = 0.01) compared to children with no EL. Over the follow-up interval, EL children had a progressive increase in CCT (<i>P</i> = 0.02) and a reduction in ECD (<i>P</i> = 0.02). EL children also showed: progressive flattening of corneal curvature (<i>P</i> = 0.01); reduction of corneal cylinder (<i>P</i> = 0.02); and increase in axial length (<i>P</i> < 0.01). MFS children with no EL exhibited a smaller increase in CCT (<i>P</i> < 0.01) and a milder flattening of corneal curvature (<i>P</i> < 0.01). The no EL children showed no change in ECD (<i>P</i> = 0.09), corneal cylinder (<i>P</i> = 0.80), or axial length (<i>P</i> = 0.27). MFS children who have EL exhibit differences in corneal structure and axial length when compared to MFS children with no EL. Children with EL have thicker CCT, more corneal cylinder, lower ECD, and longer axial lengths compared to children with no EL. The differences imply that the fibrillin defect of MFS is more severe in children with EL. The ocular defect is manifested chiefly as zonular hyperextension but has effects also on corneal and scleral integrity."

    "title": "Aortopathy in pregnancy: Unanswered questions.",
    "abstract": "Aortic dissection in pregnancy has a high mortality rate for mother and fetus. Women at risk are largely those with hereditary thoracic aortic disease, that is typically undiagnosed. Existing literature has focussed on characterising the phenotype of these women, but many questions remain about the causes of dissection in pregnancy and how to best manage women antenatally and postnatally. The widespread uptake of genetic testing has allowed us to refine the genotype and we need to use this to better individualise risk. We do not know how often to screen women during pregnancy and postpartum, nor do we know whether beta-blockers affect event rates. We have very little data on the outcomes of women who have undergone aortic surgery who embark on a pregnancy, including those who have residual dissection. Passive vaginal delivery is advised for delivery, but we do not know if this is safer than elective caesarean section and there is a paucity of evidence on the effectiveness of neuraxial anaesthesia in these women. Dissection postpartum can occur days or weeks after delivery. There is little evidence on the postnatal care or blood pressure control of women who have dissected postpartum and no guidelines on best postpartum care. Lastly, we know little of the birth experience of these women and whether birth plans were successful. This paper aims to discuss some of these unanswered questions in the hope that with further research and discussion of best practice we can collectively reduce this devastating event in young women."

    "title": "Differences in Arterial Events in Vascular Ehlers-Danlos, Loeys-Dietz, and Marfan Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Heritable thoracic aortic disease is due to altered genes that confer a highly penetrant risk for thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection, and a subset of these genes also cause aneurysms and dissections of peripheral arteries beyond the aorta. Arterial aneurysms, dissections, and ruptures are associated with pathogenic variants (PVs) in COL3A1, which is responsible for vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but arterial events are rare in Marfan syndrome due to PVs in FBN1, and poorly characterized in Loeys-Dietz syndrome due to PVs in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β pathway genes. This study sought to define the relative risk of arterial and aortic events in individuals with PVs in FBN1, COL3A1, and TGF-β pathway genes. The Montalcino Aortic Consortium provided a retrospective cohort of 1,780 individuals with PVs in COL3A1 (n = 125), FBN1 (n = 1028), and the TGF-β pathway genes (TGFBR1, n = 137; TGFBR2, n = 168; SMAD3, n = 196; TGFB2, n = 126). Arterial events were defined as dissections, ruptures, or aneurysms in arteries beyond the aorta requiring open or endovascular repair, and aortic events were defined by aortic dissections or repair of an aortic aneurysm. Arterial events were identified in 83 individuals, with the highest prevalence in COL3A1 (20.8%), followed by TGFBR2 (7.7%), TGFBR1 (7.3%), TGFB2 (6.4%), SMAD3 (5.6%), and FBN1 (1.5%). Kaplan-Meier curves identified significant gene differences, with COL3A1 having the most and earliest arterial events when compared with TGF-β genes and FBN1. For TGF-β genes and FBN1, aortic events were significantly earlier and more penetrant than arterial events, whereas this difference was not present with COL3A1. Sex impacts arterial events; males with COL3A1 had earlier and more arterial events compared with males with TGF-β genes, and these differences were not observed in females. Arterial events in FBN1 cases occur primarily in men. There are significant gene- and sex-specific differences in the prevalence and age of onset of arterial events associated with these heritable thoracic aortic disease genes, highlighting the importance of tailored counseling and surveillance based on the causative gene. Furthermore, smoking cessation and hypertension control should be emphasized in these patients to reduce the risk of arterial events."

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is associated with severe aortic disease, but very few data on SRCs exist in this population. The objectives were to evaluate: 1) the prevalence of SRCs in patients with MFS, compared to matched controls; and 2) the association between SRCs and aortic events in patients with MFS. Consecutive patients with MFS ascertained by a pathogenic variant in the fibrillin-1 gene who underwent complete computed tomography scans at our institution were included and matched 1:1 for age and sex with controls. Between 2010 and 2016, 131 patients with MFS and 131 controls were included. The mean age was 40 ± 14 years, with 42% women. SRC prevalence was higher in patients with MFS: 41% vs 21% in controls (P < 0.0001). SRC prevalence increased with aortic disease severity: 59% in patients with dissection, 43% in patients with aortic aneurysm surgery, and 19% in patients with MFS but without aortic events, similar to 21% in controls (P < 0.009). In multivariable analysis, SRC presence in patients with MFS was independently associated with aortic dissection (adjusted OR: 2.30 [95% CI: 1.00-5.32]; P = 0.049). The prevalence of SRCs was significantly higher in patients with MFS compared to matched controls. SRCs were independently associated with aortic dissection in MFS. Prospective studies are needed to further evaluate whether SRCs could represent a marker of aortic disease severity in patients with MFS."

The most common causes of short stature are constitutional delay of growth and puberty, familial short stature, and idiopathic short stature. Pathologic etiologies are less common and include nutritional deficiencies, systemic disease, growth hormone deficiencies, and genetic abnormalities. Common causes of tall stature include constitutional advancement of growth, familial tall stature, and obesity. Uncommon etiologies of tall stature include precocious puberty, Marfan syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome. Referral to pediatric endocrinology is indicated in patients with idiopathic short stature for management of select genetic and metabolic conditions and for interventions to correct growth."

    "abstract": "Myxomatous valve disease (MVD) is the most common form of cardiac valve disease in the developed world. A small fraction of MVD is syndromic and arises in association with matrix protein defects such as those in Marfan syndrome, but most MVD is acquired later in life through an undefined pathogenesis. The KLF2/4 transcription factors mediate endothelial fluid shear responses, including those required to create cardiac valves during embryonic development. Here we test the role of hemodynamic shear forces and downstream endothelial KLF2/4 in mature cardiac valves. We find that loss of hemodynamic forces in heterotopically transplanted hearts or genetic deletion of KLF2/4 in cardiac valve endothelium confers valve cell proliferation and matrix deposition associated with valve thickening, findings also observed in mice expressing the mutant fibrillin-1 protein known to cause human MVD. Transcriptomic and histologic analysis reveals increased monocyte recruitment and TGF-β signaling in both fibrillin-1-mutant valves and valves lacking hemodynamic forces or endothelial KLF2/4 function, but only loss of TGF-β/SMAD signaling rescued myxomatous changes. We observed reduced KLF2/4 expression and augmented SMAD signaling in human MVD. These studies identify hemodynamic activation of endothelial KLF2/4 as an environmental homeostatic regulator of cardiac valves and suggest that non-syndromic MVD may arise in association with disturbed blood flow across the aging valve."

This retrospective cohort study included patients under 21 years of age with Marfan syndrome who RD following lensectomy for ectopia lentis between January 2011 and January 2024. All patients underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic assessment at baseline, defined as the visit at which RD was diagnosed, as well as at follow-up visits. Data were collected on clinical features of RD, anatomical success rates, complications, and changes in visual outcomes after surgery. A total of 33 eyes from 25 patients (18 males, 72%) with a mean age at presentation of 12.6 ± 4.7 years were included. The mean axial length was 27.8 ± 2.8 mm, and the mean postoperative follow-up duration was 6.1 ± 5.8 years. The most common RD mechanisms were horseshoe tears (33%), retinal holes (33%), and giant retinal tears (15%). Fifteen eyes underwent scleral buckle (SB) surgery as the initial procedure (45.5%), 10 underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) alone (30.3%), and 8 underwent combined PPV and SB surgery (24.2%). Complete anatomical success was achieved in 73.0% (24 eyes) of cases: after one surgery in 16 eyes (67%), two surgeries in 6 eyes (25%), and three surgeries in 2 eyes (8%). An additional 12% (4 eyes) remained attached under silicone oil tamponade at final follow-up. Only the presence of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) was associated with a lower success rate (p = 0.001). Visual acuity significantly improved after surgery (1.7 ± 1.3 LogMAR vs. 0.8 ± 1.1; p < 0.001). Postoperative complications included ocular hypertension (27.3%), corneal edema (18.2%), and cystoid macular edema (9.1%). Surgical management of RD following lensectomy in pediatric patients with Marfan syndrome remains challenging but is indicated, as it can provide meaningful visual improvement and anatomical stabilization in a subset of cases. The presence of PVR affects both surgical outcomes and the number of surgeries required."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysms are life-threatening vascular conditions linked to inherited disorders such as Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. While traditionally associated with the extracellular matrix and contractile defects in vascular smooth muscle cells, emerging evidence suggests the key role of mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we show that the overexpression of <i>ACTA2<sup>R179H</sup></i> and <i>TGFBR2<sup>G357W</sup></i> in murine aortic VSMCs reduces Mitochondrial Transcription Factor A (Tfam) expression, decreases mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, and impairs oxidative phosphorylation, shifting metabolism toward glycolysis. Notably, nicotinamide riboside, a NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor, restores mitochondrial respiration, increases Tfam and mtDNA levels, and promotes a contractile phenotype by enhancing actin polymerization and reducing matrix metalloproteinase activity. These findings identify mitochondrial dysfunction as a shared feature in hereditary thoracic aortic aneurysm, not only in Marfan syndrome, but also in other genetic forms, and highlight mitochondrial boosters as a potential therapeutic strategy."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome is caused by a mutation in the <i>FBN1</i> gene encoding fibrillin-1. This extracellular matrix glycoprotein, which assembles into microfibrils, is best known for its scaffolding role in the production of elastic fibers responsible for connective tissue elasticity and tensile strength. Research into Marfan syndrome mainly focuses on the pathophysiology involved in the degeneration of elastin-rich elastic fibers, which are essential components of the aortic wall. However, fibrillin-1 also exists in elastin-poor (elaunin) or elastin-free (oxytalan) microfibril bundles that were first described in the periodontal ligament (PDL). This dynamic, densely cellular, and highly vascularized tissue anchors teeth in their bone sockets and acts as a protective shock absorber during chewing. Current knowledge suggests that fibrillin microfibrils mechanically support blood vessels in the PDL and ensure their proper functioning. However, many more insights on the roles of fibrillin, especially independently of elastin, can be extracted from this tissue. Here, we review the phenotypic and functional characteristics of the PDL in connection with fibrillin-1, focusing on those related to microvessels. This review aims to shed light on this often-overlooked fibrillin-rich resource as a model for future studies investigating fibrillin functions in health and Marfan disease."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the <i>FBN1</i> gene. It primarily affects the cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal systems. Despite improved survival outcomes, organ donation from these patients remains rare due to concerns of vascular fragility. A 44-year-old male with Marfan syndrome was considered for organ donation following brain stem death due to a massive intracerebral hemorrhage caused by a ruptured arteriovenous malformation. He had a history of mitral valve replacement and kyphoscoliosis. His liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. Consent for donation was subsequently obtained. Intra-operative findings revealed a grossly deformed liver and thin, friable vasculature, prompting the retrieval team to abandon the procedure. Biopsies from the liver and iliac artery were obtained for histopathological evaluation. Liver histology showed mild fibrosis without significant steatosis or inflammation. Iliac artery biopsy revealed cystic medionecrosis (with risk of aneurysmal formation), typically seen in Marfan syndrome. Although limited literature exists on organ donation in Marfan syndrome, rare successful liver transplants have been reported. However, vascular fragility and risk of aneurysmal changes remain a concern. Our intra-operative findings and supporting histology reinforce the challenges in safely retrieving organs from donors with Marfan syndrome. While expanding donor criteria is crucial in meeting growing transplant demands, this case highlights the importance of careful intra-operative assessment and maintenance of a low threshold for abandonment in the presence of concerning vascular or organ abnormalities in donors with Marfan syndrome."

Pathogenic variants lead to the development of <i>FBN1</i>-associated syndromes which comprise a broad host of phenotypes, and more commonly, Marfan syndrome (MFS). MFS is typically diagnosed in patients presenting with ectopia lentis, thoracic or aortic disease, and skeletal features, which may prompt genetic testing. <b>Case Presentation:</b> In this case report, we describe the reclassification of a newly identified heterozygous <i>FBN1</i> variant, c.2686T > A, p.(Cys896Ser), to likely pathogenic in a Caucasian 21-year-old female patient presenting with abnormal anterior eye segment with superior bilateral ectopia lentis; joint pain affecting wrists, knees, and upper back; and mild thoracolumbar scoliosis. Identification of this variant led to cascade testing in the patient's 49-year-old mother which revealed the same <i>FBN1</i> variant and an incidental finding of aortic dilatation, prompting standard management. Notably, the identification and reclassification of the variant led to early diagnosis and preventive management in the patient's mother, including cardiovascular monitoring and treatment. The segregation of the phenotype in both patient and mother, the family member testing, the variant's absence in control populations, and all in silico tools predicting pathogenicity led to the reclassification of this <i>FBN1</i> variant to likely pathogenic. <b>Conclusion:</b> We highlight the reclassification of a variant of unknown significance through careful clinical correlation and family-based evaluation. This reclassification led to a timely diagnosis and preventive management through cascade testing, demonstrating the real-world utility of genetic testing and cascade screening in connective tissue disorders."

Patients with Marfan syndrome and ectopia lentis who underwent ILLA with glued SFIOL from August 2021 to September 2022 were retrospectively enrolled in the study. Intraoperative surgical details were recorded and patients were prospectively followed up. Primary outcome measure was post-operative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures were postoperative complications and residual refractive error at 12 months. Forty-four eyes of 25 patients were enrolled. Mean age of patients was 12.52±6.6 years (14 males, 11 females). CDVA improved from 1.08±0.53 LogMAR pre-operatively to 0.68±0.49 LogMAR on POD-1 (p=0.012), 0.3±0.2 at 3 months (p=0.004) and 0.14±0.18 at 12 months (p=0.001). Moderate negative correlation was observed between age of presentation and post-operative CDVA at 12 months (r=-0.36, p=0.017). Group 2 (Age >10 years) had better CDVA at 3 (p=0.016) and 12 months (p=0.033) than Group 1 (Age ≤10 years). Post-operative complications included vitreous hemorrhage (11.36%), hypotony (4.34%), pupillary capture of IOL (6.5%), haptic extrusion through sclera (2.27%) and posterior dislocation of IOL (2.27%). No eye had clinically apparent pseudophakodonesis. ILLA with glued-SFIOL is a promising surgical technique for managing ectopia lentis with Marfan's syndrome. Younger age of presentation is associated with poorer postoperative visual outcomes."

    "abstract": "To quantify the impact of non-canonical FBN1 splice site variants in undiagnosed Marfan syndrome (MFS), a connective tissue disorder associated with skeletal abnormalities and Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm Disease (FTAAD). A systematic analysis of ultra-rare FBN1 variants was performed using genome sequencing data from the 100,000 Genomes Project. Variants were annotated with SpliceAI and the significance of enrichment among individuals with FTAAD was assessed using Fisher's exact test. Experimental validation utilised RNAseq, RT-PCR, minigene constructs and replication analysis was with data from UK Biobank. Using aggregate data for 78,195 individuals, we identified 13,864 singleton SNVs in FBN1 of which 21 were predicted to impact splicing (SpliceAI >0.5). Incidence of candidate splice variants in individuals recruited with FTAAD (9/703) was significantly elevated compared with that seen in non-FTAAD participants (12/77,492; OR=84, p=9.7x10<sup>-14</sup>). Additional analysis uncovered a further 14 families harbouring 11 different FBN1 splice variants. A total of 20 candidate splice variants in 23 families were identified, of which 70% lay beyond the ±8 splice regions. RNA testing confirmed the predicted splice aberration in 16/20 and for 9/20, pseudoexonization was the likely splicing-anomaly. Our findings indicate that non-canonical splice variants may account for ∼3% of families with undiagnosed FTAAD, highlighting the importance of incorporating analysis of introns and confirmatory RNA testing into genetic testing for MFS."

A total of 29 patients took part in the study. Of these, 20 were female and nine male and the median age was 54 years (interquartile range (IQR): 15). The median OHIP-G5 score was three (IQR: 5) (range: 0-15). The median PhOX score was 79 (IQR: 14.5). A statistically significant correlation between the OHIP-G5 and the PhOX could not be determined (r=-0.34, p = 0.074). The study showed that OHRQoL in particular was reduced. The measured oral health was slightly reduced compared to the general population. Nevertheless, Marfan patients should pay great attention to oral hygiene which should be checked by dental professionals at regular intervals. Not applicable."

    "abstract": "To introduce the Aortic and Arterial Vulnerability Spectrum (AAVS), a biologically grounded conceptual framework designed to improve risk stratification and surgical decision-making in aortopathy and arteriopathy by incorporating substrate-level insights. The framework was developed using a structured, hypothesis-driven process that integrates high-reliability systems theory, extracellular matrix biology, and clinical outcome patterns. A novel application of skin biopsy is introduced as a tissue-level surrogate for aortic wall integrity. Histological and transmission electron microscopy analyses were used to identify gradable ultrastructural features of collagen and elastin organization. The AAVS framework defines three biological risk domains, substrate vulnerability, clinical fragility, and mechanisms of failure, each linked to a proposed scoring system under development. Clinical case illustrations demonstrate conceptual utility. The three domains of biological risk are (1) substrate vulnerability, assessed through the AAVS Score of histological; and ultrastructural analysis of skin biopsy as a surrogate for aortic tissue integrity; (2) clinical fragility, captured by the Vascular Fragility Score, which quantifies phenotypic indicators of vascular fragility from clinical history, physical findings, and imaging; and (3) mechanisms of failure, modeled by substrate vulnerability progression, a longitudinal, dynamic modeling system that tracks substrate vulnerability progression over time toward aortic failure and includes vascular health modifiers that alter mismatch progression over time. AAVS introduces a structured clinical reasoning framework and skin biopsy-based scoring approach for risk stratification in aortopathy and arteriopathy. It reframes failure as a progressive biological process shaped by substrate integrity, not just anatomy or procedural success. Although the scoring systems remain under development, the cognitive framework offers immediate utility for case interpretation, biologically matched surgical planning, and future longitudinal modeling. Ongoing work aims to validate the scoring systems and refine biological risk assessment across diverse clinical cohorts."

    "abstract": "Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is an autosomal dominant, inherited connective tissue disorder caused by a pathogenic variant in TGF-β signaling-related genes. LDS is associated with a high risk of low bone mineral density (BMD) and fractures. We present a case report of a 43-year-old premenopausal woman with skeletal fragility who was diagnosed with LDS type 4 due to a large heterozygous deletion in the <i>TGFB2</i> gene. Upon initial referral, she was evaluated for secondary osteoporosis. Although mild abnormalities in calcium metabolism, menstrual irregularities, and lack of exercise were observed, they were not associated with this condition. However, a thorough family history and physical examination raised the suspicion of Marfan syndrome and related disorders, which were subsequently confirmed using genetic testing. Treatment with romosozumab for 1 year increased the lumbar spine BMD from 0.750 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (<i>Z</i>-score -2.1) to 0.881 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (<i>Z</i>-score -1.0) and the femoral neck BMD from 0.407 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (Z-score - 3.0) to 0.428 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (Z-score - 2.6), with a slight increase in total hip BMD from 0.525 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (<i>Z</i>-score -2.6) to 0.527 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (<i>Z</i>-score -2.4). Subsequent therapy with denosumab for 1 year further improved the lumbar spine BMD to 0.939 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (Z-score, -0.5), femoral neck BMD to 0.496 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (Z-score, -2.0), and total hip BMD to 0.552 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (Z-score, -2.2). To our knowledge, this is the first case report of an improvement in BMD with romosozumab, followed by denosumab, for skeletal fragility due to LDS.

    "abstract": "A 24-year-old male with Marfan syndrome was admitted following an episode of ventricular fibrillation (VF) during exercise. He had previously undergone multiple aortic surgical procedures for symptomatic aortic regurgitation and an ascending aortic false aneurysm. Ultimately, Bentall procedure and total arch replacement were performed, with a saphenous vein graft (SVG) anastomosed to the right coronary artery. Severe stenosis at the SVG ostium was identified, and ischemia in the inferior wall was suspected to be contributing to VF. Revascularization of the SVG stenosis by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was deemed necessary despite its challenges. After confirming that a 4 Fr Judkins right (JR)-4 guiding catheter via the right femoral artery was suitable, a 6 Fr JR-4 guiding catheter was successfully engaged with the SVG. The SVG stenosis was crossed using a 0.014-in. guidewire, and drug-eluting stent implantation was successfully performed without complications. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction improved, and no further ventricular arrhythmic events occurred after PCI. Marfan syndrome inherently carries a risk of fatal arrhythmia, and we emphasize that therapeutic management of myocardial ischemia is crucial, even in challenging PCI cases."

Approximately 46 % of individuals with Marfan Syndrome report hip-related pain yet the underlying alterations that occur in hip joint moments during gait in the Marfan population is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to assess the hip total joint moment during walking in individuals with Marfan Syndrome compared to healthy controls. Overground 3D gait analysis at a fixed walking speed was conducted for eighteen individuals with Marfan Syndrome and eighteen sex and BMI matched, asymptomatic controls. The total joint moment was calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared planar internal sagittal, frontal, and transverse plane hip moments across the stance phase. Between group differences in peak hip total joint moment and the planar contributions to the peak hip total joint moments during the first and second halves of stance were assessed using an analysis of covariance. Compared to the control group, the Marfan group walked with greater first peak total hip joint moments (p = 0.01), greater sagittal plane percent contribution (p = 0.03), and greater frontal plane moments (p = 0.02), and frontal plane contributions (p = 0.02) to the hip total joint moment in the first and second half of stance. Higher internal abduction moments at the first and second peak total joint moment may serve as a biomechanical target for gait interventions to reduce hip joint loading that may be associated with hip-related pain in the Marfan population."

It is a multisystemic condition mainly characterized by a propensity for arterial aneurysms and dissections, skeletal manifestations, hypertelorism, bifid uvula, craniosynostosis, and cutaneous features. While LDS has significant clinical overlap with other heritable connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome, the ocular manifestations of LDS have not yet been well characterized. We describe an individual with a variant in SMAD3 with a predominantly ocular phenotype and only mild arterial manifestations. The proband presented with early-onset high myopia (-25 diopters, bilaterally) and bilateral posterior subcapsular cataracts. Ocular phenotype also included esotropia, retinal hemorrhage, glaucoma, bilateral posterior staphylomas, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Extensive vascular imaging identified a right internal carotid artery dissection and mild tortuosity of numerous arteries. A molecular gene panel for heritable connective tissue disorders identified a heterozygous SMAD3 c.221G > T; p.(Arg74Leu) variant, initially reported as a variant of uncertain significance and subsequently re-interpreted as likely pathogenic. Other missense variants at this residue have been reported as pathogenic for LDS. High-grade myopia, premature cataracts, and premature glaucoma are part of the phenotypic spectrum in LDS caused by SMAD3 variants. Inclusion of SMAD3 in molecular gene panels for early-onset high-grade myopia should be considered."

The clinical data of 11 patients with aortic root aneurysm who underwent modified aortic root remodeling procedure with external sub-valvular ring from July 2021 to May 2024 at Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Fuwai Hospital were analyzed. The age of the patients was (42.3±14.4) years (range:23 to 61 years), including 9 males and 2 females. The aortic valve of all patients was tri-leaflet configuration. Marfan syndrome was diagnosed in 3 cases. The diameter of the prosthesis graft was determined according to the Lansac group's criteria based on the diameter of the aortic annulus, and a graft ring of the same diameter was used as the external sub-valvular ring. The free margin of the leaflet was treated with central plication according to the standard of 'target length of free margin of the leaflet=the diameter of the selected graft+(3 to 5 mm)'. The surgical results and postoperative aortic valve closure function were observed. <b>Results:</b> All 11 patients successfully completed the operation without in-hospital death or complications. The graft with a diameter of 28 mm were used in 7 cases, 26 mm in 3 cases, and 30 mm in 1 case. 4 patients required central plication of the free margin of 3 leaflets, 2 patients required treatment of 2 leaflets, 3 patients required treatment of 1 leaflet, and 2 patients did not need treatment of the free margin of the leaflets. The functional status of aortic valve closure was significantly improved in all patients after surgery, and the degree of residual aortic regurgitation was not more than mild. After reconstruction of the aortic root, the measured effective height was (8.8±1.3) mm (range:7 to 11 mm) and the measured coaptation length was (5.2±0.9) mm (range:4 to 7 mm). All patients were re-examined 3 months after surgery. Echocardiography showed that the degree of aortic regurgitation was mild or lower, and the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was (49.4±6.1) mm (range: 36 to 56 mm), which was smaller than that before the operation ((58.5±7.0) mm (range: 47 to 72 mm)). Eight patients were followed up for more than 6 months, and 5 patients were followed up for more than 1 year. The degree of aortic regurgitation in these patients was mild or below. <b>Conclusions:</b> The method based on the diameter of the selected prosthesis graft to deal with the length of the free margin of the leaflet can be effectively used in the modified aortic root remodeling procedure with external sub-valvular ring. The early postoperative results are satisfactory<b>.</b>"

    "title": "The Curated Treatment of a Young Woman With Marfan Syndrome: Elective Open Ascending Repair to Emergent Thoracoabdominal Endovascular Repair.",
    "abstract": "Hereditary aortopathies traditionally require open repair when significant pathologies arise. Open provides the most durable outcome for nominally a younger patient population that can tolerate larger procedures well. In certain situations, literature has described proceeding with endovascular repair in patients with known hereditary aortopathies. This case report describes the treatment of a 29-year-old female with a history of type A dissection previously treated with a valve sparing aortic root repair and a type B dissection with a thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) 2 years prior. Genetic testing then confirmed Marfan's syndrome, and she was followed by vascular medicine specialists and optimized medically. Several other family members also tested positive and imaging revealed aortic abnormalities. She arrived at our institution endorsing severe nausea, vomiting, back, flank, and abdominal pain. She was found on imaging to have a rapidly degenerating type II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) with dissection. A multidisciplinary team evaluated the patient and working with cardiothoracic (CT) surgery, our initial plan was an open repair. Following admission to the ICU, her symptoms improved with tight blood pressure control; however, she rapidly clinically decompensated with worsening pain and hypotension the day prior to her planned open repair. A massive transfusion protocol was initiated and CT scan revealed more than a 1 cm growth and evolution of her dissection. At the time, the CT surgery group were in cases and could not free an attending, and therefore recommended that we temporize the situation with balloon control and a fenestrated repair. We emergently proceeded to the operating room and obtained balloon control prior to induction of anesthesia while the 4-vessel fenestrated/branched endograft (F/BEVAR) was constructed. Repair was carried out with a bifurcated graft into the bilateral iliac arteries. However, following the endovascular repair, the patient did not want to proceed with a large open surgery and was managed definitively with endovascular means and ultimately required reintervention for a type 3 endoleak (EL) (bridging TEVAR) and type 1B EL requiring hypogastric preservation to minimize spinal cord ischemia. CT scan prior to discharge revealed only a type 2 EL, and she was discharged home with full motor and sensory function. Approximately 1 year later, a CT scan revealed regression of the aneurysm near her visceral segment, but growth near the aortic bifurcation and a type 2 EL. This was treated with a trans-caval approach and embolization of several segmental branches and the aneurysm sac with thrombin and gelfoam. Subsequent CT scans over the next 2 years have shown continued sac regression. This case serves as an example that an endovascular repair may play a role in the emergent treatment of complex anatomies in patients with Marfan syndrome especially when refusing open surgery. This repair has to date shown mid-term success with near-complete aneurysm sac regression and no endoleak, but to achieve this the patient has required strict surveillance and 2 reinterventions in the first year following the index case. Ultimately, this represents one of the first ruptured TAAA in a Marfan patient treated with a F/BEVAR.Clinical ImpactPatients with genetic aortopathies are at risk for aneurysmal degeneration and disease progression. It is important to manage patients with genetic aortopathies expeditiously and in emergency settings a total endovascular approach can be used. Each case requires a multidisciplinary approach and thoughtful planning."

    "abstract": "Early cardiovascular intervention, such as valve repairs, can extend the life expectancy of patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) by improving blood flow, preventing regurgitation, and optimizing preload and afterload. These improvements enhance ventricular function, ultimately reducing both cardiac and respiratory symptoms. More commonly, patients with MFS can develop aortic root dilation and mitral valve prolapse as a result of a diseased valve. The combination of cardiac repairs and proper medication adherence can decrease the mortality risk linked with MFS. More specifically, aortic and mitral valve repairs can restore the functions of the aorta, left ventricle, and left atrium, respectively, and reduce further complications leading to aortic dissection and heart failure."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the gene that encodes fibrillin-1, a glycoprotein necessary for elastic fiber assembly and stability in the large elastic arteries. MFS is associated with aortic aneurysms that typically occur in the proximal ascending aorta and have worse outcomes in males. Mechanisms for the sex- and region-specific differences in aneurysm development and outcomes are unknown. We quantified aortic geometry, microstructural remodeling, and passive biomechanics of the thoracic ascending, thoracic descending, abdominal suprarenal, and abdominal infrarenal aorta in 4 months old male and female Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> (a model of severe MFS) and littermate wild-type mice to determine correlations between aortic geometry, microstructural remodeling, biomechanics, and aneurysmal dilation. We showed that aneurysmal dilation was strongly correlated with unloaded thickness, microstructural remodeling including loss of elastic fibers, deposition of collagen fibers, and decrease in cell nuclei number, and mechanical metrics including physiologic and ex vivo circumferential material stiffness. A multivariable mixed model showed that unloaded thickness, elastic fiber degradation, and ex vivo material stiffness predicted aneurysmal dilation with an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.8818. Our results highlight the potential of geometric, microstructural remodeling, and biomechanical metrics to serve as physical biomarkers for personalized aortic aneurysm diagnosis and management in MFS. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disease associated with aortic aneurysms that have distinct sex- and region-specific outcomes. The mechanisms driving these variations are unclear. We used a severe MFS mouse model (Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup>) to explore differences in microstructural remodeling and passive wall mechanics along the aortic length in males and females. We correlated these changes with aneurysm severity, as quantified by aortic dilation. We found that sex- and region-specific alterations in unloaded thickness, microstructural remodeling, and passive mechanical properties of the aortic wall play a critical role in aortic dilation. Our findings showed that mechanical metrics, particularly ex vivo material stiffness, may serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of aortic aneurysms."

    "abstract": "A plethora of medical conditions, ranging from torn ligaments to aneurysmic blood vessels, are caused by failure of mechanically stressed biological tissues until rupture. Clearly prediction of the potential loci of tissue failure prior to rupture is highly desirable for prophylactic measures, preferentially in sufficiently early stages of the disease. Mechanical heterogeneities are identified from local mechanical strains obtained from image sequences recorded during uniaxial tensile testing of reconstituted collagen (both, in experiments and finite element model (FEM) calculations) and horse aorta explants, respectively, as well as of the pulsating aorta using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Within this work we present a comprehensive study on the biomechanical concept that percolated local mechanical strain heterogeneities can serve as valid indicators to predict the loci of tissue rupture already from straining behavior within the elastic regime. While we first experimentally validate the predictive capabilities of our strain percolation analysis for reconstituted rat tail collagen fibers and horse aorta explants, we unveil the structural origins of mechanical heterogeneities on the network level using FEM calculations based on digitized confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) measurements. To demonstrate the diagnostic capabilities, we successfully predict potential occurrence and location of an aortic aneurysm in a patient with documented Marfan syndrome from MRI video sequences recorded of the pulsating aorta six years prior to surgery. Detection of local mechanical heterogeneities and their percolation behavior bears predictive capabilities for tissue failure before it actually has occurred and thus promises large potential for diagnostics and therapy."

An association of mitral valve prolapse with Marfan syndrome resulting from pathogenic FBN1 variants supports the use of hypomorphic fibrillin-1 mgR mice to investigate mechanisms and therapy for mitral valve disease. mgR mice developed severe myxomatous mitral valve degeneration with mitral regurgitation by 12 weeks of age. Persistent activation of TGF-β and mTOR signaling along with macrophage recruitment preceded histological changes at 4 weeks of age. Short-term mTOR inhibition with rapamycin from 4 to 5 weeks of age prevented TGF-β overactivity and leukocytic infiltrates, while long-term inhibition of mTOR or TGF-β signaling from 4 to 12 weeks of age rescued mitral valve leaflet degeneration. Transcriptomic analysis identified integrins as key receptors in signaling interactions and serologic neutralization of integrin signaling or a chimeric integrin receptor altering signaling prevented mTOR activation. We confirmed increased mTOR signaling and a conserved transcriptome signature in human specimens of sporadic mitral valve prolapse. Thus, mTOR activation from abnormal integrin-dependent cell-matrix interactions drives TGF-β overactivity and myxomatous mitral valve degeneration, and mTOR inhibition may prevent disease progression of mitral valve prolapse."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disorder primarily affecting the connective tissue, with cardiovascular complications as the leading cause of mortality. While mutations in the FBN1 gene are the primary cause, the severity and progression of the disease can vary significantly among individuals. DNA methylation, a key epigenetic regulatory mechanism, has garnered attention in MFS research, particularly regarding methylation changes in the FBN1 locus and their effects on fibrillin-1 expression. Differential methylation and expression of genes related to inflammation (e.g., interleukin (IL)-10, IL-17) and oxidative stress (e.g., PON2, TP53INP1) have been linked to MFS aortic pathology. These alterations likely contribute to disease progression by influencing inflammatory responses, smooth muscle cell apoptosis, and biomechanical properties of the aorta. The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway plays a central role in MFS pathology, with aberrant methylation of related genes potentially elevating active TGF-β levels and exacerbating aortic lesions. Notably, tissue-specific methylation patterns, especially in smooth muscle cells of the aorta, remain poorly understood. A deeper understanding of DNA methylation's role in MFS could pave the way for early interventions and epigenetic-targeted therapies."

All patients <18 years of age with a diagnosis of MFS who underwent aortic (Ao) and/or mitral valve (MV) surgery were included.ResultsA total of 343 patients were identified, with 115 (34%) females, 190 (55%) White non-Hispanic, and a median age of 13.0 [interquartile range (IQR): 9.0-16.0] years at surgery. Among the cohort, 241/343 (70%) underwent an aortic procedure, 40/343 (12%) aortic + MV procedure, and 62/343 (18%) MV procedure. Median hospital length of stay was 6.0 [IQR: 5.0-9.5] days, 9/343 (3%) patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and 4/343 (1%) died in-hospital. Freedom from any reintervention at 15 years was 48.8% (95% CI: 34.0-70.0). Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that older age at the time of surgery was associated with a reduced risk of reintervention (hazard ratio: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.89-0.99, <i>p</i> = 0.023). The overall survival rate at 15 years was 94.2% (95% CI: 90.5-98.0), and no factors were associated with increased mortality.ConclusionsOperations for cardiovascular complications of MFS can be performed safely in appropriately selected children with low morbidity and mortality and with good short-term and long-term outcomes.

However, molecular triggers instigating AD, its temporospatial progression, and how vascular cells in each vessel layer interact and participate in the pathological process remain incompletely understood. To unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms of AD, we generated a spontaneous AD mouse model. We incorporated a novel missense variant (p.G234D) in <i>FBN1</i>, the gene for fibrillin-1, identified in a patient with nonsyndromic familial AD into mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) system.

Single-cell RNA sequencing, validated by immunostaining, revealed a cluster of monocyte/macrophage predominantly in the intima at 3 weeks of age before the dissection, and the second cluster of macrophages increased during the progression of intimomedial tears, exhibiting strong CCR2+ (C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 positive) and both M1- and M2-like features. Consistently, upregulation of MMP2/9 (matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9) was observed. Biochemically, FBN1<sup>G234D</sup> lost the ability to bind to LTBP-1, -2, and -4, resulting in the downregulation of TGFβ signaling in the aortic wall. We show that interactions involving endothelial cells and macrophages/monocytes in the intima, where the extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment contains reduced TGFβ signaling, contribute to the initiation of AD. Our novel AD mouse model provides a unique opportunity to identify target molecules involved in the intimomedial tears that can be utilized for the development of therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is highly prevalent in Marfan syndrome (MFS), but its associations with significant valvular regurgitation, the need for mitral valve (MV) surgery or elective aortic root replacement, and the occurrence of aortic dissection in MFS are not fully elucidated. Imaging, anthropometric, cardiovascular disease, and surgical data were compared in patients with and without MVP in a large, single-center MFS registry. Of 352 patients with MFS, MVP was present in 237 (67.3%) and was more common in women (73.3% versus 59.9%, <i>P</i>=0.007). Patients with MVP had distinct skeletal features, including a lower body mass index, and higher prevalences of scoliosis surgery, arachnodactyly, and skin striae. Although rates of MV surgery were similar in men (14.7%) and women (16.9%), women underwent surgery at a younger age (35.4±14.5 versus 43.0±14.6 years; <i>P</i>=0.04). Patients who underwent MV surgery were more likely to undergo aortic root replacement (73.2% versus 42.6%, <i>P</i><0.001) and to have a type B aortic dissection (25.0% versus 11.8%, <i>P</i>=0.01). MVP is highly prevalent in MFS and more likely to necessitate MV surgery compared with the general population, particularly among women. The associations of MV surgery with aortic root replacement and type B dissection indicate that MVP associated with the need for mitral surgery tracks with a more severe aortic phenotype in MFS."

    "abstract": "Extended aortic arch repair (EAR) is increasingly adopted for treating acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). However, existing prediction models may not be suitable for assessing the in-hospital death risk in ATAAD patients undergoing EAR. This study aims to develop a comprehensive risk prediction model for in-hospital death following EAR based on patient's preoperative status and surgical data, which may contribute to identification of high-risk individuals and improve outcomes following EAR. We reviewed clinical records of consecutive adult ATAAD patients undergoing EAR at our institute between January 2015 and December 2022. Utilizing data from 925 ATAAD patients undergoing EAR, we employed multivariable logistic regression and machine learning techniques, respectively, to develop nomograms for in-hospital mortality. Employed machine learning techniques included simple decision tree, random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machine (SVM). The nomogram based on SVM outperformed others, achieving a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.842 on training dataset and a mean AUC of 0.782 on testing dataset, accompanied by a Brier score of 0.058. Key risk factors included cerebral malperfusion, mesenteric malperfusion, preoperative critical station, Marfan syndrome, platelet count, D-dimer, coronary artery bypass grafting, and cardiopulmonary bypass time. A web-based application was developed for clinical use. We develop a novel nomogram risk prediction model based on SVM algorithm for in-hospital death following extended aortic arch repair for ATAAD with good discrimination and accuracy.

    "abstract": "Fibrillin 1 gene (Fbn1) mutations cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), triggering life-threatening aortic complications and multi-organ effects. MFS is increasingly linked to neurovascular complications, amplified by aortic surgery risks. However, the impact of MFS on the brain remains unclear, including the roles of sex, aging, and their contribution to cerebral injury. This study examines brain alterations and their role in cerebral ischemic injury in an MFS mouse model. RNA-seq analysis of young (3-month-old) and aged (13-month-old) male and female wild-type and MFS (Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup>) mice revealed disruptions in TGF-β and extracellular matrix (ECM) pathways in MFS brains, most pronounced in young males and aged females with reduced estrogen levels. Inflammatory pathways were upregulated across all MFS mice. Consequently, changes in TGF-β signaling, ECM turnover, redox stress and inflammatory pathways were assessed through RT-qPCR, immunostaining, Western blot, lucigenin chemiluminescence, spectrophotometry, HPLC, and synchrotron radiation-based microspectroscopy, while cerebrovascular properties were assessed by pressure myography and confocal microscopy in the basilar artery. Aged MFS mice showed decreased brain TGF-β1 levels, while dysregulated collagen turnover was only observed in female MFS mice. Despite increased NADPH oxidase activity and redox damage in the corpus callosum of male MFS mice, brain redox stress levels remain largely unchanged. Young female MFS mice exhibited hypertrophic remodeling of the basilar artery. Remarkably, neuroinflammation driven by reactive gliosis increased in MFS mice, regardless of sex and age. To determine the impact on ischemic vulnerability, young mice underwent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (5 min)/reperfusion (3 days). MFS mice showed greater post-ischemic brain damage, evidenced by worsened behavioral impairments, hippocampal neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. This study identifies sex- and age-dependent disruptions in TGF-β1, ECM, and cerebrovascular integrity in MFS mice. Persistent neuroinflammation and increased vulnerability to post-ischemic brain injury suggests that MFS patients, alongside well-documented aortic complications, have an intrinsic predisposition to cerebral damage."

Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of mortality in MFS. Mutations in the <i>FBN1</i> gene, which encodes fibrillin-1, a critical extracellular matrix protein, are the predominant cause of the disorder. On March 11, 2024, we diagnosed a 30-year-old female proband with MFS based on the revised Ghent criteria, presenting with aortic root aneurysm, aortic dissection, multiple skeletal abnormalities, and a family history of MFS. Whole-exome sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing confirmation identified a novel inherited insertion mutation (c.4991dupA) in exon 40 of the <i>FBN1</i> gene. We performed valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David Procedure) and total aortic arch replacement using a tetrafurcated graft, along with the implantation of a specially designed frozen elephant trunk in the descending aorta (Sun's Procedure). Postoperatively, the patient underwent biweekly clinical follow-ups for three months. No treatment-related adverse events were reported during the monitoring period. The diagnosis of MFS requires an integrated approach, combining clinical manifestations, imaging studies, and genetic analysis. This novel mutation is associated with severe skeletal manifestations and life-threatening cardiovascular abnormalities, underscoring its clinical relevance. Its association with aggressive phenotypes enhances genotype-phenotype correlations. Importantly, these findings highlight the imperative need for early intervention in high-risk individuals by bridging genetic discovery to clinical practice."

Individuals with MFS exhibit quadriceps weakness, hip joint pain, and an increased incidence of hip osteoarthritis (OA) compared to the general population, yet the underlying biomechanical factors associated with these poor hip-related outcomes are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of MFS on gait mechanics and to determine the relationship of gait mechanics with hip-related outcomes within the MFS group. Eighteen people with MFS and 18 healthy, asymptomatic controls underwent 3D gait analysis. All study participants completed the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Survey (HOOS) to obtain patient reported outcomes. (PROs). Between group differences in demographics, HOOS scores, and gait mechanics were analyzed via independent t-tests, a Kruskal-Wallis test, and a multi variate analysis of covariance while adjusting for age, respectively. A Spearman's rank-order correlation was used to assess the relationship between HOOS sub-scores and kinetic and kinematic parameters. The MFS cohort was significantly older than the control cohort and ambulated with altered sagittal plane pelvis, knee and ankle kinematics as well as ankle kinetics. The MFS cohort ambulated with a higher hip transverse plane range of motion, hip extensor moment impulse (HEMI), peak hip abduction moments and hip abduction moment impulse. The MFS group also exhibited a higher hip internal rotation moment (HIRM) compared to the control group. The MFS cohort also self-reported worse hip-related PRO. Higher HIRM and HEMI were associated with worse hip-related pain and QOL within the MFS group. These results suggest that people with MFS walk with altered pelvic and lower extremity joint mechanics which may be associated with the higher incidence rates of hip OA and poor hip-related PRO observed in the MFS population."

Spinal fusion surgery is often required for patients with progressive adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), and the genetic risk factors for severe disease (defined here as curve >35 degrees) are largely unknown. To explore the role of rare variants in severe AIS, exome sequence data from 1221 individuals with AIS were compared with both 1397 in-house European ancestry controls and 56885 gnomAD non-Finish European controls. Segregation analysis of variants in prioritised genes was performed in additional family members. A replication study was performed using the Geisinger MyCode cohort. <i>FNDC1</i> function was investigated in <i>fndc1</i> null mutant zebrafish. Rare variants were enriched in 84 genes, including <i>RAF1</i> (Noonan syndrome), <i>FBN1</i> (Marfan syndrome) and <i>FNDC1,</i> in individuals with severe AIS. <i>FNDC1</i>, which had previously been associated with joint hypermobility, harboured missense variants in 4.0% of individuals with AIS compared with 2.3% of controls (p=0.00764, OR=1.78). <i>FNDC1</i> variants segregated with AIS in five multiplex families with incomplete penetrance. In addition, <i>FNDC1</i> rare variants were also associated with scoliosis in the Geisinger MyCode cohort (p=0.0002, OR=3.6). Disruption of the <i>fndc1</i> locus in zebrafish resulted in increased bone mineral density. We broadened the phenotype associated with <i>RAF1</i> and <i>FBN1</i> variants and identified <i>FNDC1</i> as a novel gene associated with severe AIS.

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome is a genetic condition that causes connective tissue abnormalities that can ultimately lead to cardiovascular complications such as aneurysms. When a bicuspid aortic valve is also present, which is a congenital heart defect characterized by the aortic valve having two cusps instead of three, a combined effect of serious cardiovascular complications can result. There is an additive and increased risk of aortic complications due to the combined impact on aortic integrity that can lead to aneurysm formation and/or dissections. A severe case of aortic stenosis with a thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) was discovered in a patient found to have Marfan syndrome. An elderly female patient, without any relevant medical history, was evaluated for progressive dyspnea following the death of her spouse. Upon examination, the patient exhibited characteristics of Marfan syndrome. Subsequent imaging revealed a bicuspid aortic valve and TAA. A multidisciplinary approach was necessary, involving various specialties to guide treatment. Given the patient's age and high-risk profile, she was not a candidate for TAA repair. However, the patient underwent a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with medical management and routine follow-ups. Awareness of the heightened risks associated with a bicuspid aortic valve and Marfan syndrome is crucial, as early intervention can mitigate complications and improve the quality of life."

    "abstract": "Marfan Syndrome (MFS) often leads to thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), for which angiotensin (II) receptor blockers (ARBs) are prescribed to reduce aneurysm growth. Although recent pooled analyses demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in aortic growth with ARBs under a frequentist framework, the clinical relevance of this effect remains uncertain. Moreover, ARB therapy is notably burdensome for patients due to significant side-effects. Therefore, this study re-analyses randomised ARB versus comparator trials in MFS patients, under a Bayesian statistical framework. The trials included by the Marfan Treatment Trialists' Collaboration were re-analysed using fixed- and random-effects Bayesian models comparing ARBs to controls. The primary outcome was the mean difference in the annual rate of change of aortic root dimension, adjusted for body surface area (z-score). The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was applied to assess the clinical relevance of the pooled posterior effect, based on previous consensus and available literature (at 0.12 adjusted z-scores/year). Four randomised trials, comprising 626 patients, were included. Under the fixed-effects model, the pooled mean difference was -0.07 z-score/year [95 % CrI, -0.12; -0.01] in favour of ARBs, though with a posterior probability of a clinically relevant treatment effect of only 7.3 %. Using a Bayesian random-effects model, the pooled mean difference was -0.06 z-score/year [95 % CrI, -0.22 to 0.11] in favour of ARBs, with a similarly low probability of achieving the MCID (18.1 %). The findings of this Bayesian analysis suggest that ARBs are unlikely to achieve clinically meaningful reductions in aortic growth for MFS patients."

In contrast to Marfan syndrome patients, who rarely develop aneurysms or dissections beyond the aortic root, LDS patients frequently exhibit vessel aneurysms in locations other than the aortic root. Here, we report the case of a 61-year-old patient who initially presented with marfanoid characteristics and an aortic root aneurysm and was presumed to have Marfan syndrome two decades ago. Later, the patient developed an abdominal aorta aneurysm, necessitating endovascular repair and stent placement. That fact raised doubts regarding the initial diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and we decided to investigate the genetic cause of the disorder. Genetic testing was performed using WES analysis and Sanger sequencing. The genetic analysis detected a de novo heterozygous pathogenic variant c.896G>A in exon 5 of the <i>TGFB2</i> gene, resulting in the amino acid substitution p. Arg299Gln that has devastating destabilizing structural effects on 3D folding of the protein, as demonstrated by the molecular modeling study we performed. This variant is pathogenic for LDS type 4, partially consistent with the patient's clinical presentation. Our case emphasizes the significance of precise clinical assessment and genetic verification in patients exhibiting marfanoid characteristics. Furthermore, our findings contribute to the understanding of the diverse clinical spectrum associated with this specific pathogenic variant of <i>TGFB2</i>, underscoring the importance of detailed clinical assessment in expanding knowledge of genotype-phenotype correlations.

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) pose a significant health burden due to their asymptomatic progression, often culminating in life-threatening aortic rupture, and due to the lack of effective pharmacological treatments. Risk factors include elevated hemodynamic stress on the ascending aorta, frequently associated with hypertension and hereditary genetic mutations. Among the hereditary causes, Marfan syndrome is the most prevalent, characterized as a connective tissue disorder driven by <i>FBN1</i> mutations that lead to life-threatening thoracic aortic ruptures. Similarly, mutations affecting the TGF-β pathway underlie Loeys-Dietz syndrome, while mutations in genes encoding extracellular or contractile apparatus proteins, such as ACTA2, are linked to non-syndromic familial TAA. Despite differences in genetic origin, these hereditary conditions share central pathophysiological features, including aortic medial degeneration, smooth muscle cell dysfunction, and extracellular remodeling, which collectively weaken the aortic wall. Recent evidence highlights mitochondrial dysfunction as a crucial contributor to aneurysm formation in Marfan syndrome. Disruption of the extracellular matrix-mitochondrial homeostasis axis exacerbates aortic wall remodeling, further promoting aneurysm development. Beyond its structural role in maintaining vascular integrity, the ECM plays a pivotal role in supporting mitochondrial function. This intricate relationship between extracellular matrix integrity and mitochondrial homeostasis reveals a novel dimension of TAA pathophysiology, extending beyond established paradigms of extracellular matrix remodeling and smooth muscle cell dysfunction. This review summarizes mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential unifying mechanism in hereditary TAA and explores how understanding mitochondrial dysfunction, in conjunction with established mechanisms of TAA pathogenesis, opens new avenues for developing targeted treatments to address these life-threatening conditions. Mitochondrial boosters could represent a new clinical opportunity for patients with hereditary TAA."

We investigated whether the pedicles and laminae of patients with Marfan syndrome (1) would differ from those with idiopathic scoliosis (IS) and (2) would be affected by the position in the curve and by dural ectasia. Using MRI and CT scans, the morphologies of 134 vertebrae from T1 to L5 were measured in 16 Marfan patients with spine deformity. The morphologies of 140 vertebrae in 20 patients with IS were measured in the same fashion. They were then compared with each other. Marfan pedicle channels were significantly thinner than those with idiopathic scoliosis (P<0.001). This difference increased significantly from cranial to caudal. Type D pedicles (<2 mm wide) were found in 34% of Marfan and 9% of IS patients (P<0.001). Marfan type D pedicles were found in 36% of atypical locations (outside the concave apex). Pedicle width significantly correlated with both vertebral level and distance from the apex. Pedicles became progressively thinner than IS pedicles at descending levels of the spine. Pedicle width and laminar thickness measurements on CT and MRI did not differ significantly. The average thickness of the Marfan lamina was significantly thinner (by a mean of 1 mm) than that of the IS lamina (P<0.001). Marfan patients with dural ectasia had significantly thinner laminae in the lumbar spine than those without (P=0.023). Marfan spines were associated with thinning of fixation sites, most pronounced at the curve apex. Laminar thinning was more common on the concavity and with dural ectasia. Radiographs often overestimate the width. Therefore, preoperative MRI or CT is helpful when operating on Marfan spine with pedicle screws and laminar hooks. Level III-retrospective cohort study."

Aortic root dilatation, an aortopathy that may have lifethreatening consequences, is among the clinical findings in various connective tissue disorders, including Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Aortic root dilatation, aneurysm, and aortic dissection should be carefully investigated by cardiologists. In this study, we describe three siblings with short stature and dental anomalies. A homozygous, novel, c.2726-1G > A pathogenic variant in <i>LTBP3</i> was identified through exome sequencing. After the detection of the <i>LTBP3</i> variant, the patients were evaluated for possible cardiac findings, which revealed mitral valve prolapse and aortic root dilatation despite the absence of clinical symptoms. In this study, we aimed to shed light on the diagnosis of dental anomalies and short tature syndrome in three siblings with a novel <i>LTBP3</i> pathogenic variant revealed through exome sequencing. Additionally, we emphasise the importance of searching for cardiac findings, even in the absence of clinical symptoms. We highly suggest that cardiologists take note of cardiac findings in patients with dental anomalies and short stature syndrome."

    "title": "NOTCH3-Related Lateral Meningocele Syndrome Presenting as Radiological Copenhagen Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Lateral meningocele syndrome is a rare skeletal syndrome caused by truncating variants in the final exon of the NOTCH3 gene. It is characterized by multiple lateral meningoceles that may result in neurological sequelae. A wider systemic phenotype has been demonstrated, including musculoskeletal abnormalities, feeding difficulties, structural cardiac and renal anomalies, and facial dysmorphism. We describe the clinical details of a child who was initially diagnosed with Copenhagen syndrome (progressive non-infectious anterior vertebral body fusion), based on radiological findings, in the context of kyphosis and back pain. Later, a novel de novo c.6723_6736del p.(Glu2241AspfsTer8) NOTCH3 variant was identified from the 100,000 Genomes Project, in keeping with a genetic diagnosis of lateral meningocele syndrome. Without the context of additional features that may point toward an underlying syndrome, radiological findings-when reviewed in isolation-may be suggestive of alternate diagnoses. In this case, the radiological finding of anterior vertebral fusion suggested Copenhagen syndrome, whereas the identification of dural ectasia prompted further investigation into Ehlers-Danlos syndrome subtypes. Recognition of dysmorphology prompted wider investigation by Whole Genome Sequencing. Features of lateral meningocele syndrome significantly overlap with those of connective tissue disorders including EDS, Marfan syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. We describe the clinical features of the here-reported proband with a novel NOTCH3 variant, and compare the phenotypes of these differential diagnoses."

    "title": "Modified citrus pectin protects aortic dissection development involving macrophage pyroptosis.",
    "abstract": "Uncontrolled aortic aneurysms can progress to aortic dissection (AD), a severe vascular disorder characterized by hematoma formation in the aortic wall, with inflammation playing a crucial role. Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a 26-kDa lectin, regulates many aspects of inflammatory cell behavior. Inhibition of Gal-3 ameliorates diabetic neuroinflammation and cardiomyopathy. Modified citrus pectin (MCP) is a PH-modified dietetic supplement produced from citrus pectin. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of MCP, which has a known affinity for Gal-3, in AD. A murine model of AD was induced by β-aminopropionitrile fumarate (BAPN)/angiotensin II (Ang-II) and treated orally with either 100 mg/kg MCP or vehicle. In vitro, H2O2 treatment was applied to RAW264.7 cells to detect macrophage death and pyroptosis. MCP administration significantly reduced AD incidence and mortality, with decreased inflammatory cell infiltration in the aorta. MCP downregulated genes associated with inflammation and pyroptosis. In vitro, MCP mitigated macrophage death and pyroptosis induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. The study suggests that MCP's protective effects are due to its interference with the Gal-3 and TLR4 interaction, inhibiting pyroptotic macrophage-induced inflammation. MCP could improve patient outcomes and reduce progression to severe forms of AD. Clinically, MCP could serve as supportive therapy to prevent and delay aortic dissection, particularly during the acute stage of uncomplicated type B AD in patients with Marfan syndrome or abdominal aortic aneurysm."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an inherited connective tissue disorder, with aortic root aneurysm and/or dissection being the most severe and life-threatening complication. These conditions have been linked to pathogenic variants in the <i>FBN1</i> gene and dysregulated <i>TGFβ</i> signaling. Our objective was to evaluate the mRNA expression of <i>FBN1</i>, <i>TGFBR1</i>, <i>TGFBR2</i>, and <i>TGFB2</i> in aortic tissue from MFS patients undergoing surgery for aortic dilation. This prospective study (2014-2023) included 20 MFS patients diagnosed according to the 2010 Ghent criteria, who underwent surgery for aneurysm or dissection based on Heart Team recommendations, along with 20 non-MFS controls. RNA was extracted, and mRNA levels were quantified using RT-qPCR. Patients with dissection showed significantly higher <i>FBN1</i> mRNA levels [79 (48.1-110.1)] compared to controls [37.2 (25.1-79)] (<i>p</i> = 0.03). Conversely, <i>TGFB2</i> expression was significantly lower in MFS patients [12.17 (6.54-24.70)] than in controls [44.29 (25.85-85.36)] (<i>p</i> = 0.029). A positive correlation was observed between higher <i>FBN1</i> expression and a larger sinotubular junction diameter (r = 0.42, <i>p</i> = 0.07), while increased <i>FBN1</i> expression was particularly evident in MFS patients with dissection. Additionally, <i>TGFB2</i> expression showed an inverse correlation with ascending aortic diameter (r = 0.53, <i>p</i> = 0.01). In aortic tissue, we found decreased <i>TGFB2</i> and receptor levels alongside increased <i>FBN1</i> mRNA levels. These molecular alterations may reflect compensatory mechanisms in response to tissue damage caused by mechanical stress, leading to dysregulation of physiological signaling pathways and ultimately contributing to aortic dilation in MFS."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection during pregnancy is a relatively rare but often life-threatening conditio. A previous study showed that the overall incidence of the disease was about 4 in 1 million women aged 15-45 years. Hormonal and Hemodynamics changes during pregnancy are a major cause of aortic dissection, and these changes may begin in the first and second trimesters, but are most pronounced in the third trimesters(about 50% and 33%, respectively).In addition, some genetic disorder such as Marfan syndrome may be associated with AD during pregnancy. A 29-year-old pregnant woman at 21 weeks of gestation presented with acute, non-radiating retrosternal tearing pain lasting 15 h, unrelieved and accompanied by three episodes of vomiting. Ultrasonography identified aortic root dilatation with aortic regurgitation, and contrast-enhanced aortic computed tomography (CT) confirmed type A aortic dissection (AD). Emergency surgery was performed, including ascending aortic replacement, total arch replacement with prosthetic graft placement, stented elephant trunk implantation (Sun's procedure), and aortic valvuloplasty under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The patient was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 9, and the fetus remained viable. At 26 weeks of gestation, the family expressed concerns regarding maternal safety, prompting an early request for cesarean delivery due to cervical insufficiency and preeclampsia, resulting in the delivery of a healthy infant with no adverse events. Although AD during pregnancy is uncommon, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for pregnant women presenting with severe chest pain. CTA is essential for diagnosing the condition and determining surgical options. After 28 weeks of pregnancy, cesarean section should be prioritized [17-18]. In the early second trimester, ensuring fetal safety involves appropriately increasing mean arterial pressure, minimizing circulatory arrest time, and closely monitoring the fetus post-surgery."

    "title": "Endothelial Cell Senescence in Marfan Syndrome: Pathogenesis and Therapeutic Potential of TGF-β Pathway Inhibition.",
    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a heritable connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the Fibrillin-1 gene, which encodes the extracellular matrix protein fibrillin-1. Patients with MFS are predisposed to aortic aneurysms and dissections, significantly contributing to mortality. Emerging evidence suggests that endothelial cell (EC) senescence plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms in MFS. This study aims to elucidate the role of EC senescence in the development of aortic aneurysms in MFS using a vascular model derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. We generated human induced pluripotent stem cells lines from 2 patients with MFS carrying specific Fibrillin-1 mutations and differentiated these into ECs. These MFS-hiPSC-derived ECs were characterized using immunofluorescence, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting. Functional assays including cell proliferation, scratch wound, tube formation, NO content detection, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining were conducted. RNA sequencing was performed to elucidate underlying signaling pathways, and pharmacological inhibition of the transforming growth factor-beta pathway was assessed for its therapeutic potential. MFS-hiPSC-derived ECs recapitulated the pathological features observed in Marfan aortas, particularly pronounced cellular senescence, decreased cell proliferation, and abnormal transforming growth factor-beta and NF-κB signaling. These senescent ECs exhibited diminished proliferative and migratory capacities, reduced NO signaling, increased production of inflammatory cytokines, and attenuated responses to inflammatory stimuli. Importantly, senescence and dysfunction in MFS-hiPSCderived ECs were ameliorated by transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway inhibitor, SB-431542, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy. This study highlights the pivotal role of endothelial cell senescence in the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms in MFS. Our human induced pluripotent stem cells-based disease model provides new insights into the disease mechanisms and underscores the potential of targeting the transforming growth factor-beta pathway to mitigate endothelial dysfunction and senescence, offering a promising therapeutic avenue for MFS."

    "abstract": "Many primary and secondary disorders in childhood may cause tall stature (height of +2 standard deviations above the mean height for age and sex). Growth-monitoring programs are aimed at early detection of such disorders to avoid permanent health consequences and support children's wellbeing. However, age- and sex-specific data on the incidence of disorders associated with tall stature are scarce. This retrospective population-based cohort study aims to specify the epidemiological data that are needed to develop better diagnostic practices. The study population included 1 144 503 children (51% boys) born in Finland between 1998 and 2017 with 16.5 million register notifications including medical diagnoses. The first occurrences of several primary or secondary disorders associated with tall stature were identified from multiple registers. The age- and sex-specific cumulative incidences (CMIs) from birth until 18 years of age and the median age at diagnosis were determined. A total of 1641 children (0.14% of the whole birth cohort, 44% boys) had a primary or secondary disorder associated with tall stature. Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY karyotype) was the most common primary disorder (median age at diagnosis: 8.4 years, CMI at 18 years: 1/2146 boys). Marfan syndrome (5.9 years, 1/4307 girls; 7.1 years, 1/5202 boys) and congenital overgrowth syndromes (1.7 years, 1/4717 girls; 1.8 years; 1/4925 boys) did not have a predilection for either sex. Secondary conditions such as central precocious puberty (1/894 girls at 8 years, and 1/4856 boys at 9 years) and hyperthyroidism (15.1 years, 1/936 girls; 14.4 years, 1/5675 boys) were more common among girls. Disorders associated with tall stature are rare and are frequently underdiagnosed in childhood. We suggest that during early childhood, the focus of growth screening should be particularly on Marfan syndrome and congenital overgrowth syndromes, with the addition of Klinefelter syndrome and central precocious puberty thereafter."

However, follow-up rates are frequently suboptimal, indicating an urgent need for effective interventions to improve adherence. To assess the effect of WeChat (Tencent Holdings Ltd), a social media smartphone communication application, in delivering phone reminders and health education to improve postoperative follow-up adherence among families of children with CEL. This randomized clinical trial was conducted from December 2022 to October 2024. The study was conducted at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, a tertiary ophthalmic hospital in Guangzhou, China. Families with children scheduled for lens surgery due to CEL were enrolled and randomized into the social media intervention group and the standard-care group. Parents in the social media intervention group received phone reminders and health education via the smartphone application before scheduled appointments at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery. The primary outcome was follow-up attendance at 3 months after surgery. A total of 110 children were included in this study, 55 in the social media group (mean [SD] age, 6.9 [2.8] years; 32 male [58.2%]) and 55 in the standard-care group (mean [SD] age, 7.3 [3.4] years; 32 male [58.2%]). The intervention group exhibited higher attendance rates than the standard-care group across all 3 postoperative follow-ups (3 months: 83.6% [46 of 55] vs 41.8% [23 of 55]; 1 month: 81.8% [45 of 55] vs 58.2% [32 of 55]; 1 week: 92.7% [51 of 55] vs 87.3% [48 of 55]). Follow-up adherence at 3 months was significantly higher in the intervention group compared with the standard-care group (relative risk [RR], 2.05; 95% CI, 1.53-2.75; P < .001). In addition, the intervention group showed greater improvements in parental CEL knowledge accuracy (10.6%, 95% CI, 7.8%-13.5%) and higher rates of amblyopia treatments (RR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.26-4.56). Results of this randomized clinical trial reveal that social media smartphone application-based interventions significantly improved follow-up adherence and increased parental knowledge among families of children with CEL. These findings suggest that integrating mobile health technologies into standard care can enhance the management of progressive pediatric conditions with systemic risks, ultimately improving clinical outcomes.

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome is a congenital connective tissue disorder frequently complicated by pneumothorax. However, the long-term efficacy of surgical intervention in these cases remains underreported. This study aimed to assess the surgical outcomes of pneumothorax associated with Marfan syndrome. A retrospective review was conducted at a single center, including patients diagnosed with secondary pneumothorax associated with Marfan syndrome who underwent surgery between 2004 and 2019. Postoperative pneumothorax recurrence rates and potential predictors of postoperative recurrence were assessed. The incidence of ipsilateral pneumothorax after surgery was analyzed and compared with that before surgery. Overall, 20 patients (60% male, 40% female) with a median age of 18.5 years (range 13-40 years) were included in the analysis. Seventeen patients underwent bullectomy, while the remainder received pulmorrhaphy. The cumulative incidence of postoperative pneumothorax at 5 and 10 years was 25% and 44%, respectively. Notably, patients with pectus excavatum had a 5-year cumulative recurrence rate of 25%, and those with a flat chest had a rate of 60%, compared with 9.1% for patients without chest deformities (P = 0.017). Chest deformity emerged as a significant predictor of postoperative pneumothorax recurrence (hazard ratio 7.63; 95% confidence interval 1.29-45.1; P = 0.025). The frequency of ipsilateral pneumothorax significantly decreased postoperatively, from 1.09 ± 0.66 episodes/year (mean ± SD) pre-surgery to 0.04 ± 0.10 episodes/year post-surgery (P < 0.001). Surgical intervention is an effective treatment for pneumothorax in patients with Marfan syndrome. Chest deformity may serve as a predictor of postoperative pneumothorax recurrence in this patient population."

Recently, the ClinGen guidance for PP1/BS4 co-segregation and PP4 phenotype specificity criteria (new PP1/PP4 criteria) were released. Here, we performed reassessment of FBN1 VUSs using these new PP1/PP4 criteria. FBN1 VUSs collected from December 2015 to April 2024 were reassessed according to the ClinGen FBN1-specific guideline and new PP1/PP4 criteria. Medical records and previous studies were reviewed to evaluate the phenotype-specificity of evidence based on the revised Ghent criteria. Collectively, 927 patients with suspected MFS underwent FBN1 sequencing and 72 VUSs were detected. When applying the FBN1-specific guideline only, of 72 VUSs, 29 (40.3%) were reclassified as pathogenic variants (PVs) or likely PVs (LPVs). When additionally applying the new PP1/PP4 criteria, 16 (37.2%) of the remaining 43 VUSs were reclassified as LPVs. After reassessing FBN1 VUSs according to the new PP1/PP4 criteria, the rate of reclassification from VUS to PV/LPV significantly increased from 40.3% to 62.5%. The new PP1/PP4 criteria provide sufficient evidence for evaluating the pathogenicity of FBN1 variants detected in MFS patients fulfilling the revised Ghent criteria and will be helpful in clinical analysis."

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the current evidence on growth rate (GR) and predictive factors among patients with syndromic and nonsyndromic heritable thoracic aortic disease, bicuspid aortic valve, and sporadic TAA. Online databases were searched for studies that reported aortic growth on adult patients with asymptomatic TAA.

The median cardiopulmonary bypass, cross-clamp, and SACP durations were 120.5, 93, and 23 min, respectively. The postoperative mortality rate was 3.06%, stroke rate was 2.04%, delirium rate was 9.18%, and ARF rate was 3.06%. All cases of delirium resolved spontaneously within 2-3 days. The mortality rate among Marfan syndrome (MFS) patients was 4.35%, with no reported stroke cases in this group. <b>Conclusions</b>: IA graft cannulation is a safe and effective method for providing SACP in aortic surgery, particularly in high-risk patient groups such as those with TAAAD and MFS. This technique ensures optimal cerebral perfusion, minimizes neurological and systemic complications, and enhances surgical efficiency by reducing operative duration. However, large-scale, multicenter, and prospective studies are needed to evaluate its long-term efficacy and safety."

    "title": "Acute Aortic Dissection in the Third Trimester of Pregnancy as an Initial Presentation of Marfan Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is rare and more common in men. In women, it is more frequent during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester. We present the case of a 30-year-old pregnant woman diagnosed with type B aortic dissection at 29 weeks of gestation. Following the diagnosis, fetal maturation was initiated, and the patient was transferred to a tertiary care center. Due to uncontrolled hypertension and persistent pain, and after evaluating the maternal and fetal risk-benefit, a cesarean section was performed at 29 weeks and six days. During the postoperative period, a multi-drug regimen was required for blood pressure control, but the patient recovered and was discharged. Genetic testing, prompted by a family history of sudden death (brother) and aortic dissection (father), identified a mutation in the FBN1 gene, confirming Marfan syndrome. This case highlights the importance of comprehensive patient history, the challenges of aortic dissection during pregnancy, and the need for a multidisciplinary approach in these cases."

    "abstract": "Fibrillin-1, an extracellular matrix protein encoded by the <i>FBN1</i> gene, is crucial for maintaining connective tissue integrity. Mutations in <i>FBN1</i> result in haploinsufficiency, leading to Marfan syndrome, in which the expression of functional <i>FBN1</i> is correlated with disease onset and severity. Recent studies suggest that <i>FBN1</i> expression is modulated by DNA methylation, particularly within the CpG island shores of its promoter region. In porcine models, <i>FBN1</i> mRNA levels have been found to correlate with the proportion of hypomethylated alleles in the CpG island shore region. In this study, we employed epigenome editing using the dCas9-TET1 system to induce targeted DNA demethylation within the <i>FBN1</i> CpG island shore, which became hypermethylated after a prolonged culture of porcine fetal fibroblast cells. This approach effectively reduced methylation in the targeted region, and cells expressing the dCas9-TET1 system maintained hypomethylation across multiple passages. Critically, DNA demethylation of the <i>FBN1</i> CpG island shore restored <i>FBN1</i> expression in heterozygous <i>FBN1</i> knockout fibroblasts, which developed stochastic hypermethylation after extended culture. These findings highlight the potential of DNA methylation manipulation to restore <i>FBN1</i> expression in cells with a haploinsufficient genetic background."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an inherited autosomal dominant disorder that affects connective tissue with an incidence of about 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 people. 90% of MFS is caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene. We recruited a family with MFS phenotype in South China and identified a novel variant. This study investigated whether this genetic variant is pathogenic and the potential pathway related to lipid metabolism in MFS. A three-generation consanguineous family was recruited for this study. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was utilized on family members. The 3D structure of the protein was predicted using AlphaFold. CRISPR/Cas9 was applied to generate a similar fbn1 nonsense mutation (fbn1<sup>+/-</sup>) in zebrafish. RNA-seq analysis on zebrafish was performed to identify potential pathways related to MFS pathogenesis. Our study identified a novel variant [NM_000138.5; c.7764 C > G: p.(Y2588*)] in FBN1 gene from the family and identified the same site mutation among the proband along with her son and daughter. Structural modeling showed the p.Y2588* mutation resulted from a truncated protein. Compared to wild-type zebrafish, the F2 generation fbn1<sup>+/-</sup> zebrafish exhibited MFS phenotype. RNA-seq analysis indicated that many genes related to leptin are up-regulating, which could affect bone development and adipose homeostasis. A novel variant was identified in FBN1 gene. In a zebrafish model, we found functional evidence supporting the pathogenicity of the detected nonsense mutation. Our research proposes a possible mechanism underlying the relationship between lipid metabolism and MFS. These findings can help improve the clinical diagnosis and treatment of MFS."

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to summarize the clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of pediatric patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) treated by thoracoscopic surgery at a single center. Additionally, we aimed to identify risk factors for postoperative recurrence. We retrospectively collected data from patients who underwent thoracoscopic surgery for PSP at the Department of Thoracic Surgery at Beijing Children's Hospital from March 2018 to March 2024. All patients underwent thoracoscopic wedge resection and pleurodesis. Based on Vanderschueren classification, we recorded intraoperative findings in the lung apices. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess postoperative recurrence trends over time. The log-rank test was used for univariate analysis, and the statistically significant factors in the univariate analysis were selected for further analysis in the multifactorial Cox regression model to explore the risk factors affecting postoperative recurrence in patients with PSP. A total of 90 cases of PSP were recorded during the study period and 63 cases of PSP were included in the study. The median age was 15.0 years, and male to female ratio was about 3:1. A total of 30 (30/63) patients had history of contralateral pneumothorax, 15 (15/63) had history of minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum, and 6 (6/63) had Marfan's syndrome. All patients were treated with thoracoscopic pulmonary wedge resection and pleurodesis and were followed regularly after surgery. The K-Meier curve showed a declining trend in the first 2 years after surgery. Univariate analysis showed that gender, age, history of minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum, history of contralateral pneumothorax, Marfan syndrome and Vanderschueren classification were significant risk factors for postoperative recurrence. Cox analysis demonstrated that male sex (HR = 5.25, p = 0.02, 95% CI (1.37-20.09)) and history of minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (HR = 3.767, p = 0.04, 95% CI (1.04-13.69)) were risk factors for recurrence. Thoracoscopic treatment for PSP in children has a high rate of recurrence after surgery, particularly within the first 2 years after VATS. Female patients and patients with a history of MIPRE are possible high-risk groups for PSP after VATS. Recurrence needs to be monitored for 2 years after surgery, and reoperation may be required in cases of recurrence."

Anomalies in the gene lead to a wide variety of clinical manifestations, including disorders of the cardiac, ocular and musculoskeletal system. We present a case of a child belonging to a Sardinian family of four generations, with a novel variant found in the <i>FBN1</i> gene. To include this novel missense <i>FBN1</i> variant into genetic counselling for Marfan Syndrome and to discuss its genotypic-phenotypic correlation. Firstly, the proband was diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome using 2020 Revised Ghent Criteria, and she then underwent genetic testing using Next Generation sequencing. The NGS revealed a novel heterozygous missense variant (c.2348A>G) in the <i>FBN1</i> gene, in exon 20. This genetic variant caused a missense substitution of a serine residue with an arginine residue in the position 783 of Fibrillin-1 protein. The variant was then evaluated in the other family members, and was eventually only found in symptomatic individuals, regardless of the severity of their phenotype, demonstrating the segregation with MS; furthermore, it showed complete penetrance with the disease. Our results suggest that this variant is responsible for MS and it therefore should be included in genetic diagnoses and counselling discussion."

    "abstract": "Individuals with heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD) face a high risk of deadly aortic dissections, but genetic testing identifies causative variants in only a minority of cases. We explored the contribution of non-canonical splice variants (NCVAS) to thoracic aortic disease (TAD) using SpliceAI and sequencing data from diverse cohorts, including 551 early-onset sporadic dissection cases and 437 HTAD probands with exome sequencing, 57 HTAD pedigrees with whole genome sequencing, and select sporadic cases with clinical panel testing. NCVAS were identified in syndromic HTAD genes such as FBN1, SMAD3, and COL3A1, including intronic variants in FBN1 in two Marfan syndrome (MFS) families. Validation in the Penn Medicine BioBank and UK Biobank showed enrichment of NCVAS in HTAD-associated genes among dissections. These findings suggest NCVAS are an underrecognized contributor to TAD, particularly in sporadic dissection and unsolved MFS cases, highlighting the potential of advanced splice prediction tools in genetic diagnostics."

    "abstract": "Inherited aortopathies, including Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, are genetic disorders characterized by structural abnormalities of the aorta that predispose individuals to life-threatening complications like aneurysms and dissections. These conditions result from mutations in genes essential for maintaining aortic wall integrity, such as FBN1, TGFBR1, and COL3A1, affecting extracellular matrix components and the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) pathway. Marfan syndrome has a prevalence of approximately 1 in 5000, while Loeys-Dietz syndrome and vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are rarer, with estimated prevalences of 1 in 100 000 and 1 in 20 000, respectively. Familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (FTAAD), linked to mutations in genes like ACTA2 and MYH11, highlight the genetic heterogeneity of aortopathies. Management strategies focus on early diagnosis, risk stratification, regular imaging, lifestyle modifications, and timely surgical intervention. Advances in genetic testing and targeted therapies offer promise for personalized care. However, challenges such as genetic heterogeneity, incomplete penetrance, and variability in disease progression limit effective management. Limitations in current research include heterogeneity among studies, which complicates meta-analyses and consensus building. Future directions include exploring novel genetic interventions, optimizing treatment timing, and addressing psychosocial impacts to enhance patient outcomes. By addressing gaps in knowledge and integrating patient-reported outcomes, this study underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to managing inherited aortopathies and improving the quality of life for affected individuals."

    "abstract": "Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), caused by mutations in the TGF-β (transforming growth factor-β) signaling cascade, leads to aggressive thoracic aneurysms. While vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype modulation has been implicated in thoracic aneurysm formation, we sought to characterize the role of cell state transitions in LDS aneurysm pathogenesis. We performed single-cell transcriptomic characterization of aortic root/ascending aorta from a murine LDS model (<i>Tgfbr2</i><sup><i>G357W/+</i></sup> versus littermate WT [wild-type] control) at 8 weeks, 24 weeks, and aortic root/ascending aortic samples from human LDS surgical specimens (n=5 LDS [<i>TGFBR1/2</i>] and n=2 donor control) to understand cell state transitions and transcriptomic alterations in LDS. Select cell markers were spatially localized with RNA in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. Single-cell RNA sequencing of murine and human LDS samples (>30 000 cells) revealed unique SMC, fibroblast, and macrophage transcriptomic profiles in LDS. Instead of SMC phenotypic modulation seen in Marfan syndrome, transcriptomic alterations observed in LDS are most prominent in the adventitial fibroblast in the <i>Tgfbr2</i><sup><i>G357W/+</i></sup> mouse model. While a distinct modulated SMC cluster does not appear in <i>Tgfbr2</i><sup><i>G357W/+</i></sup>, SMCs transcriptomically differ from WT counterparts. Adventitial fibroblasts were activated into a proinflammatory state associated with increased macrophage recruitment (<i>Ccl2</i>, <i>Il6</i>, <i>Ccl7</i>, and <i>Cxcl2</i>) and fibrotic response genes (<i>Col1a1</i>, <i>Col1a2</i>, and <i>Col3a1</i>), with a 6-fold increase in aortic wall macrophage content in <i>Tgfbr2</i><sup><i>G357W/+</i></sup> compared with WT. Similar findings were also observed in human LDS aortic samples with increased proinflammatory adventitial fibroblast transcriptomic program in parallel with heightened macrophage recruitment. Despite phenotypic similarities in aneurysm formation, the dominant cellular and molecular mechanism of Marfan syndrome and LDS aneurysms are distinct. LDS mouse and human adventitial fibroblasts transcriptomically modulate into a proinflammatory state. Adventitial fibroblasts, in addition to SMCs, are another important pathological cell population during LDS aneurysm formation to consider for targeted therapy to potentially impede LDS aneurysm formation."

    "abstract": "Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) is an essential component of the extracellular matrix, forming microfibril bundles that are important for the proper development of elastic tissues found in the aorta and lung, as well as nonelastic tissue found in the eyes and skeleton. Many missense mutations in the FBN1 gene are associated with Marfan syndrome (MFS), a common developmental disorder. FBN1 contains 47 epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats, which are protein domains characterized by six cysteines (C) and three disulfide bonds. Over half of these EGF repeats are modified with an O-glucose monosaccharide added by protein O-glucosyltransferase 2 and/or 3 (POGLUT2/3). Previous studies showed that O-glucose modifies the serine within the putative consensus sequence between C three and four: C<sup>3</sup>-x-N-T-x-G-S-F/Y-x-C<sup>4</sup>. These residues are common among modified EGFs, but it is unknown if they are required for O-glucosylation. To address this, we used a glycoproteomic approach by analyzing O-glucosylation levels of individual EGF repeats from overexpressed N-terminal FBN1 variants in HEK293T cells. Surprisingly, only the serine (S) was required for O-glucosylation, leading to the revised consensus sequence, C<sup>3</sup>-x-x-x-x-x-S-x-x-C<sup>4</sup>. Using this open consensus in database searches, the possible number of POGLUT2/3 substrates in humans has doubled. While some variants displayed reduced O-glucose monosaccharide modification, other variants, including MFS variants, displayed elongation of the O-glucose monosaccharide by additional glycosyltransferases. MFS variants reduction or elongation of O-glucose warrants further investigation on their influence on FBN1 function, which could play a role in the molecular mechanism of the disease."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominantly (AD)-inherited disease that results from pathogenic variants in the Fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene, and is characterised by tall stature, elongated limbs and digits, lens abnormalities and aortic root dilatation, aneurysms and dissection, but milder forms also occur. Radiological imaging suggests that Marfan syndrome affects between one in 3000 and 5000 of the population. The aim of this study was to determine the population frequency of Marfan syndrome from the number of predicted pathogenic FBN1 changes found in a normal database. FBN1 variants were downloaded from gnomAD v2.1.1 and annotated with ANNOVAR. The population frequency was determined from the number of pathogenic null and structural variants, and the number of predicted pathogenic missense changes classified by rarity and computational scores. This population frequency was then compared with the frequencies in the control subset, and from gnomAD variants assessed as Pathogenic or Likely pathogenic in the ClinVar or LOVD databases. Our strategy identified predicted pathogenic FBN1 variants in one in 416 individuals, which was confirmed in the control subset (one in 356, p NS). Predicted pathogenic variants were most common in East Asian people (one in 243, p < 0.0001) and least common in Ashkenazim (one in 5185, p = 0.0082). The population frequencies based on pathogenic variants in the ClinVar or LOVD databases were one in 718 and one in 1014 respectively. Null variants which are associated with aortic aneurysms affected only one in 8624. Thus, Marfan syndrome is more common than previously recognised. Emergency departments and cardiac clinics in particular should be aware of undiagnosed Marfan syndrome and its cardiac risks, but many of those affected still have a milder phenotype."

The correlations between FAD and FaMM scores and patient-related factors were examined. Linear regression was used to determine the relationship between FAD, FaMM, patient-related factors, and PedsQL. 25% of families by self-report and 9% of families by parent-report had impaired functioning (FAD score > 2). FAD and FaMM were inversely correlated (R=-0.41, p < 0.001). Higher (worse) FAD scores were correlated with more patient-reported symptoms (R = 0.17, p = 0.003) and with lower QOL (R=-0.28, p < 0.001), independent of other factors typically related to QOL. In patients with MFS, family dysfunction and more symptoms were independently associated with worse QOL. This suggests that interventions addressing family dysfunction and symptoms may positively impact QOL for patients and families living with MFS."

At follow-up, MFS was diagnosed in 46 participants, and other hereditary connective tissue disorders in 12 participants. As in the baseline study, matched hospital controls were collected for comparison. CT images were obtained of the hips. PA was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. Measurements were performed according to the circle-wall distance method. The data was analysed with paired t test, and McNemar's test. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed for the circle-wall distance. There was no increase in the number of hips diagnosed with PA or in the circle-wall distance. PA was diagnosed in 58 of 87 hips in patients with MFS and in 71 of 111 hips in all patients with hereditary connective tissue disorders. Significantly more patients with MFS than controls had PA. The prevalence and degree of PA remained unchanged after 10 years. The circle-wall distance seems to have a good ability to discriminate between individuals with MFS and individuals without any known connective tissue disorder. Suggested cutoff level for the circle-wall distance: 2 mm. PA might be suggestive of a hereditary connective tissue disorder but does not develop or increase in adulthood. CT seems to have high sensitivity for PA and might be useful in a diagnostic process."

More individuals alive past the age of 16 months versus those who were deceased before that age had undergone cardiovascular surgery at an older age (13 months, range 3-72, vs. 2 months, range 2-2, p = 0.03). Survival was better in those with single amino acid substitutions/small in-frame deletions than in those with large in-frame deletions (p = 0.007), but variants involving a cysteine substitution in an EGF-like domain versus those involving other amino acids did not significantly influence survival. EoMFS ranges from a (pre-)neonatal life-threatening disorder to a disorder with enhanced survival, creating a window for cardiovascular surgery. Individuals with single amino acid substitutions/small in-frame deletions had better survival compared to those with variants significantly impacting exon 24-32 length."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the gene (FBN1) of fibrillin-1, a major determinant of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Functional impairment in the cardiac left ventricle (LV) of these patients is usually a consequence of aortic valve disease. However, LV passive stiffness may also be affected by chronic changes in mechanical load and ECM dysfunction. Passive stiffness is determined by the giant sarcomeric protein titin that has two main cardiac splice isoforms: the shorter and stiffer N2B and the longer and more compliant N2BA. Their ratio is thought to reflect myocardial response to pathologies. Whether this ratio and titin's sarcomeric layout is altered in MFS is currently unknown. Here, we studied LV samples from MFS patients carrying FBN1 mutation, collected during aortic root replacement surgery. We found that the N2BA:N2B titin ratio was elevated, indicating a shift toward the more compliant isoform. However, there were no alterations in the total titin content compared with healthy humans based on literature data. Additionally, while the gross sarcomeric structure was unaltered, the M-band was more extended in the MFS sarcomere. We propose that the elevated N2BA:N2B titin ratio reflects a general adaptation mechanism to the increased volume overload resulting from the valvular disease and the direct ECM disturbances so as to reduce myocardial passive stiffness and maintain diastolic function in MFS."

Patients with MFS with EL underwent panel-based next-generation sequencing in this retrospective cohort study. The FBN1 genotypes were categorized into the dominant-negative (DN) group and the haploinsufficiency (HI) group. The DN variants were further subclassified based on the affected residues and their locations. Corneal biomechanical parameters were measured using dynamic Scheimpflug-based biomechanical analysis (CorVis ST). The correlations between corneal biomechanical properties and FBN1 genotype or nongenetic factors were analyzed. The differences between patients with MFS and normal control were also evaluated after matching confounding factors. One hundred one consecutive MFS probands participated in this study, with a median age of 6 years. Patients with HI and DN variants affecting critical residues, namely the DN (-Cys + CaB) variants, exhibited significantly higher deformation amplitude ratios (P = 0.029) and lower stress-strain index values (P = 0.007) compared with those in the DN (others) group, indicating lower corneal stiffness in the former group. DN variants in the FUN-EGF3 region were associated with lower deformation amplitude ratios (P = 0.011) and higher stress-strain index values (P = 0.002), whereas those in the DN-CD region exhibited the opposite pattern. Compromised corneal stiffness was significantly associated with HI and DN (-Cys + CaB) variants (b = -0.184; P = 0.01) and variants located outside the FUN-EGF3 region (b = 0.256; P = 0.001), after adjusting for confounding factors. Compared with matched controls, patients with MFS demonstrated significantly higher deformation amplitude ratios (P = 0.023), further confirming decreased corneal stiffness in this population. The FBN1 genotype impacts the corneal biomechanical properties of patients with MFS and EL. Corneal biomechanics provide a novel platform to study the genotype-phenotype correlation of MFS."

The most common cause for vision worse than 20/40 was amblyopia. Major postoperative complications included retinal detachment in 3 (1.4%) eyes and glaucoma in 3 (1.4%) eyes. Lens subluxation requires precise refraction measurements and some patients may benefit from aphakic correction. Pseudophakic eyes often demonstrate low residual refractive error and BCVA comparable to phakic eyes without lens subluxation."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disorder affecting connective tissue, with variable incidence rates. A significant portion of cases stems from novel genetic variants, while others inherit it from affected parents. This study focuses on identifying the genetic cause of MFS in a specific family, using whole-exome sequencing (WES). A 15-year-old male with confirmed MFS was examined, showing symptoms of palpitations and severe mitral valve regurgitation. WES was performed, followed by confirmation with Sanger sequencing. Variants were assessed for pathogenicity using bioinformatics tools and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. One potentially novel pathogenic variant was found in exon 14 of the FBN1 gene: c.1676delCinsAAT, p.Ala559GlufsTer21. In silico analysis suggested a deleterious impact on protein structure and function, supporting their pathogenic classification. The identification of this novel variant highlights the importance of the FBN1 gene in MFS, especially its cardiovascular manifestations. Early intervention can improve patient outcomes, while ongoing research holds promise for further advancements in treatment for Marfan syndrome."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effects of hormonal treatment with sex steroids on the final height of patients with tall stature, including those diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome (MS), over 15 years in an outpatient setting. This retrospective cohort study reviewed the medical records of patients referred for tall stature. Descriptive statistics characterized the samples, while independent and paired t-tests assessed changes in final height (FH) and height at the start of treatment (HTS). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) evaluated the impact of chronological age at the initiation of therapy, bone age at the start of treatment, and pubertal stage on FH and HTS. A total of 55 individuals with tall stature (51 % male) were included, among whom 35 (64 %) had clinically confirmed MS. Of these, 34 (62 %) received low-dose steroid treatment. Patients treated during pre-puberty exhibited an average height increase of 25.56 cm (95 %CI 20.40-30.73; p < 0.001; d = 2.86), while those treated during puberty showed an average gain of 11.93 cm (95 %CI 8.69-15.18; p < 0.001; d = 1.72). Early treatment before the age of 10 resulted in height gains of 13.92 cm (95 %CI 4.90-22.93; p = 0.006; d = 1.82) with estrogen and 6.8 cm (95 %CI 1.71-11.88; p = 0.010; d = 0.73) with testosterone. Early intervention with low doses of steroids significantly reduced final height in individuals with tall stature, including those with MS, while also minimizing dose-dependent adverse effects."

A 27-year-old female with confirmed MFS presented with a relevant progression of a known aneurysm of an ARSA in MRI. The patient had undergone valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David procedure) 4 months prior. After interdisciplinary discussion, she underwent endovascular exclusion of the aneurysm using a combination of established vascular plugs and novel shape memory polymer embolization plugs to fill the large ARSA aneurysm volume. The shape memory polymer embolization plugs expand in the vessel to a porous scaffold, designed to support thrombus formation throughout its structure. The polymer is also radiolucent, which minimizes artefact and facilitates follow-up imaging. Development of a strategy for the treatment of ARSA aneurysms is challenging and different surgical, endovascular, and combined approaches have been published. Interdisciplinary discussion is crucial to minimize the overall risk and trauma. In our case of a young female and new mother, an endovascular approach was successfully and safely performed. The future need for surgery due to concomitant MFS is expected."

    "abstract": "Single-cell omics technology is a powerful tool in biomedical research. However, single cell proteomics has lagged due to an inability to amplify peptides in a similar fashion to nucleotide strings. Single cell proteomics is important because proteins are the main functional unit in cells, and they often poorly correlate with mRNA quantities. In this paper we describe the first single cell proteomic analysis of complex tissue, comparing aneurysmal and normal mouse aorta from males and females. We also compare and integrate our single cell proteomic profiles with a matching single cell transcriptomics dataset. We compared single cell proteomes between male and female, wild-type and <i>Fbn1 <sup>C1041G/+</sup></i> Marfan mice (N=3 per group). Individual cells from mouse aortic root single cell suspensions were deposited in 384 well plates and subjected to ultra-sensitive nanoflow liquid chromatography-ion mobility-time of flight-mass spectrometry. The data were analyzed with leiden clustering to identify cell types. Statistical analyses were performed to detect differential proteins within cell types and multi-omics analysis integrated single cell proteomics with published single cell RNA-seq. We identified all major aortic cell types including 7 distinct smooth muscle cell subtypes. The proportion of these cells varied based on sex and the <i>Fbn1 <sup>C1041G/+</sup></i> genotype. Differentially expressed proteins between male and female in addition to wild-type and Marfan samples uncovered enhanced endothelial to mesenchymal transition patterns in endothelial cells from male Marfan mice. Comparisons between single cell RNA and single cell proteomic profiles showed similarities in major subtypes but not smooth muscle cell subtypes. Multi-omics analysis of these two single cell platforms demonstrated a potential novel role for smooth muscle cell derived angiotensin signaling in the Marfan phenotype. Single cell proteomics identified new subpopulations of vascular smooth muscles cells and novel cell type specific protein signatures related to sex differences and aneurysm formation.

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome is a hereditary connective tissue disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) and altered TGF-β signalling. Life-threatening complications involve thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) and dissections due to the disruption of microfibrillar assembly in the aortic wall. We previously demonstrated that Rapamycin, a typical mTOR pathway inhibitor, limits the ascending aorta elastolysis and expansion, significantly increasing lifespan in an established murine model of Marfan syndrome (Zaradzki et al., Biochem Pharmacol 2022). This study aimed to investigate how mTOR inhibition stabilises the aorta in fibrillin-1 hypomorphic mgR/mgR mice and previously observed increased life expectancy. We used antibody microarrays to detect protein expression in the proximal thoracic aorta of sham or rapamycin-treated male and female mgR/mgR mice immediately after the two-week treatment. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to visualize and quantify protein expression in the ascending thoracic aorta and arch four weeks after the short-term rapamycin treatment was completed. We showed that rapamycin significantly increased the abundance of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins like cytokeratin-18 and betaglycan, also known as the TGF-β type 3 receptor (TGFBR3). In addition, it raises the abundance of aggrecanase-2 (ADAMTS5) and xylosyltransferase-1 proteins, enzymes involved in ECM remodelling and homeostasis. In conclusion, rapamycin affects the composition and organization of key ECM components, which determine the structure-function relationships in the aorta, thereby maintaining the balance critical for the increase in life expectancy. Using mTOR modulators for targeted therapy may help to prevent aortic complications of MFS and improve clinical outcomes."

Vascular deformation mapping is an image analysis technique for mapping 3-dimensional aortic growth on routine computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans. We aimed to use vascular deformation mapping to examine the value of aortic growth rate in the descending thoracic aorta, among other imaging biomarkers, to identify the factors associated with risk of TBAD in MFS. Computed tomography angiography scans spanning 2004 to 2023 from adult patients with MFS with native descending thoracic aorta were analyzed by vascular deformation mapping. Other measurements included multilevel thoracoabdominal aortic diameters and the length of the descending thoracic aorta by centerline analysis. Among the 105 patients with MFS analyzed, 63.8% were men, with median age of 40 (range, 18-73) years and a median surveillance interval of 5.3 (range, 2.0-18.3) years. During surveillance, 12 (11.4%) patients developed TBAD. Patients with TBAD had a higher radial growth rate (0.63 versus 0.23 mm/year; <i>P</i><0.001) and elongation rate (2.4 versus 0.5 mm/year; <i>P</i><0.001), on univariate and multivariable analysis, but predissection descending aortic diameter was not significantly different. Predictors of growth rate included younger age, higher baseline maximal diameter of the descending thoracic aorta, smoking history, and warfarin use. Radial growth and elongation rates of the descending thoracic aorta were independent predictors of TBAD occurrence in MFS. TBAD often occurred at nonaneurysmal diameters (<4.0 cm). These findings emphasize the role of growth over absolute diameter in risk stratification for TBAD in MFS."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue in several systems, with ocular, cardiovascular, and skeletal system manifestations. Its ocular manifestations include ectopia lentis (EL), myopia, astigmatism, and corneal abnormalities. This review examines refractive alterations related to MFS such as EL, microspherophakia, lens coloboma, altered corneal biomechanics (flattening, thinning, and astigmatism), and myopia and their impact on visual acuity. The pathogenesis of these manifestations stems from mutations in the FBN1 gene (encoding fibrillin-1). Moreover, the current medical and surgical management strategies for MFS-related refractive errors, including optical correction (eyeglasses, contact lenses, etc.), and surgical interventions like lensectomy, intraocular lens (IOL) implantation (anterior chamber, posterior chamber, scleral-fixated, iris-fixated), and the use of capsular tension rings/segments are further discussed. Considering the likelihood of underdiagnosing and underestimating ocular involvement in MFS, this updated review highlights the critical need to identify and address these refractive issues to enhance the visual outcomes for those affected."

    "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, caused by a mutation in the FBN-1 gene, affecting the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, ocular, and central nervous systems. Cardiovascular abnormalities associated with MFS lead to different pathological conditions, such as cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, and aortic dilatation. The latter are the primary causes of mortality in MFS patients. To date, the role of altered oral microbiota (OM) in MFS is unknown, and so the aim of our study was to determine whether there are differences in the oral microbiota of MFS patients with aortic dilatation and non-dilatation. <b>Methods:</b> We enrolled 36 MFS patients, who were divided into groups with aortic non-dilatation (n = 12) and with aortic dilatation (n = 24). Dental plaque samples were used for OM analysis, and serum was used for cytokine evaluation. <b>Results:</b> The main genera were compared between patients with aortic dilatation and non-dilatation, revealing three genera with significant differences: <i>Actinomyces</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.007) and <i>Rothia</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.002) were more abundant in those with aortic dilatation, while <i>Fusobacterium</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.044) was more abundant in non-dilatation patients. However, no significant differences in cytokine levels were observed between the presence and absence of aortic dilatation, except that the IL-1β levels were higher in non-dilatation patients (165.09 pg/mL) than in those with dilatation (117.15 pg/mL), with a significance of <i>p</i> = 0.057. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study represents the initial, tentative pilot study to understand the relationship between oral health and systemic conditions in patients with Marfan syndrome."

This report presents the case of a 32-year-old female with Marfan syndrome who presented with progressive dyspnea and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-III symptoms 10 years post-mitral valve replacement for severe mitral regurgitation. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography identified an 8 × 9 mm paravalvular defect with compliant borders, deemed suitable for percutaneous closure. Surgical re-intervention was considered high risk by the Heart Team, leading to the decision to proceed with a minimally invasive approach. Under general anesthesia, the defect was crossed using a steerable guide catheter and stabilized with a super-stiff wire. A stepwise closure strategy employing three Amplatzer Vascular Plug III devices (two 14 × 5 mm and one 10 × 5 mm) successfully reduced the regurgitation to trace levels. The patient experienced significant symptomatic improvement, achieving NYHA functional class I at six months post-procedure, with echocardiography confirming the durable closure of the defect. This case highlights the technical nuances and innovative use of multiple devices for mitral PVL closure, particularly in the context of connective tissue disorders.

Our investigation delves into the pivotal role of hemodynamic disturbance in the pathogenesis of TAA, with a particular emphasis on the mechanistic contributions of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade. We uncovered that activation of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) within smooth muscle cells, instigated by the oscillatory wall shear stress (OSS) that stems from disturbed flow (DF), is a catalyst for TAA progression. This revelation was corroborated through both an MFS mouse model (<i>Fbn1</i> <sup>+/C1039G</sup>) and clinical MFS specimens. Crucially, our research demonstrates a direct linkage between the activation of the mTORC1 pathway and the intensity in OSS. Therapeutic administration of rapamycin suppresses mTORC1 activity, leading to the attenuation of aberrant SMC behavior, reduced inflammatory infiltration, and restoration of extracellular matrix integrity-collectively decelerating TAA advancement in our mouse model. These insights posit the mTORC1 axis as a strategic target for intervention, offering a novel approach to manage TAAs in MFS and potentially pave insights for current treatment paradigms."

    "abstract": "Myxomatous mitral valve degeneration (MMVD) is one of the most important age-dependent degenerative heart valve disorders in both humans and dogs. It is characterized by the aberrant remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM), regulated by senescent myofibroblasts (aVICs) transitioning from quiescent valve interstitial cells (qVICs), primarily under TGFB1/TGF-β1 control. In the present study, we found senescent aVICs exhibited impaired macroautophagy/autophagy as evidenced by compromised autophagy flux and immature autophagosomes. MTOR-dependent autophagy induced by rapamycin and torin-1 attenuated cell senescence and decreased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) CDKN2A/p16<sup>INK4A</sup> and CDKN1A/p21<sup>CIP1</sup>. Furthermore, induction of autophagy in aVICs by <i>ATG</i> (autophagy related) gene overexpression restored autophagy flux, with a concomitant reduction in CDKN1A and CDKN2A expression and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Conversely, autophagy deficiency induced CDKN1A and CDKN2A accumulation and SASP, whereas ATG re-expression alleviated senescent phenotypic transformation. Notably, CDKN1A and CDKN2A localized to autophagosomes and lysosomes following MTOR antagonism or MG132 treatment. SQSTM1/p62 was identified as the autophagy receptor to selectively sequester CDKN1A and CDKN2A cargoes for autophagic degradation. Our findings are the first demonstration that CDKN1A and CDKN2A are degraded through SQSTM1-mediated selective autophagy, independent of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These data will inform development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of canine and human MMVD, and for the treatment of Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease and other age-related degenerative disorders.<b>Abbreviations</b>: ACTA2/α-SMA: actin alpha 2, smooth muscle; AKT: AKT serine/threonine kinase; aVICs: activated valve interstitial cells; ATG: autophagy related; baf-A1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; BSA: bovine serum albumin; CDKIs, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors; CDKN1A/p21: cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A; CDKN2A/p16: cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A; co-IP: co-immunoprecipitation; DMSO: dimethylsulfoxide; ECM, extracellular matrix; EIF4EBP1: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1; eGFP: green fluorescent protein; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HEK-293T, human embryonic kidney 293T; HRP: horseradish peroxidase; KO: knockout; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; LIR: MAP1LC3/LC3-interacting region; MFS: Marfan syndrome; MKI67/Ki-67: marker of proliferation Ki-67; MMVD: myxomatous mitral valve degeneration; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTORC: MTOR complex; OE: overexpression; PBST, phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20; PCNA: proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PIK3CA/PI3K: phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha; PLA: proximity ligation assays; PSMA1: proteasome 20S subunit alpha 1; PSMB5: proteasome 20S subunit beta 5; qVICs: quiescent valve interstitial cells; qRT-PCR: quantitative real-time PCR; SA-GLB1/β-gal: SA-senescence-associated GLB1/β-galactosidase; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SASP: senescence-associated secretory phenotype; RPS6KB1/p70 S6K: ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1; SMAD: SMAD family member; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; STEM: scanning transmission electron microscopy; TGFB: transforming growth factor beta; TGFBR: transforming growth factor beta receptor; TP53/p53: tumor protein p53; UPS: ubiquitin-proteasome system; WT, wild-type."

This study aimed to investigate the long-term durability of this technique with the use of parallel stent-grafts and evaluate strategies to prevent abdominal aortic dilation. One Marfan syndrome patient who underwent hybrid aortic repair with parallel stent-grafts for arch dissection after the Bentall procedure was admitted. Five patient-specific three-dimensional models were reconstructed based on preoperative and follow-up computed tomography angiography scans. Three hypothetical models addressing the closure of an endoleak or reentry tears were created. Hemodynamic parameters were assessed using computational fluid dynamics. Postoperatively, increased blood flow into the descending aorta and rising abdominal aortic pressure were observed. During the 5-year follow-up, no new thoracic aorta-related adverse events occurred. One early type III endoleak persisted, and three reentry tears were identified in the descending aorta. The abdominal aorta dilated from 31 to 49 mm. Simultaneously addressing both the endoleak and reentry tears was more effective in reducing false lumen pressure and flow velocity in the abdominal aorta and expanding the high-value relative residence time region. Longitudinal follow-up imaging demonstrated the long-term durability of hybrid aortic arch repair with parallel stent-grafts in a Marfan syndrome patient after ascending aorta replacement. The increased pressure resulting from blood flow redistribution was associated with downstream aortic dilation. Furthermore, computational fluid dynamics simulations can offer predictive analyses for optimizing intervention strategies in the treatment of distal aneurysmal degeneration."

The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024537877). PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies on SNPs related to foot arch morphology published up to December 2023. Nineteen eligible studies (2006-2020) identified 137 SNPs across conditions affecting connective tissue (12 studies, e.g., Marfan Syndrome), nerves (six studies, e.g., Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease), and muscles (one study, e.g., Distal Arthrogryposis Syndromes). While no studies directly linked SNPs to foot arch morphology, three explored SNPs in genetic diseases associated with foot arch variations. Pes planus was linked to connective tissue disorders, and pes cavus to neuropathies and myopathies. Only two replicated SNPs were found. This review found no direct studies of SNPs influencing foot arch morphology, highlighting a significant research gap. Future research should examine SNPs in larger cohorts to differentiate natural variations from pathology-driven deformities.

In a well-established mouse model of MFS (<i>Fbn1</i> <sup><i>C1041G/+</i></sup> ), pre-mature aging of the aortic wall and the progression of aortic root aneurysm are observed by 6-month-of-age. TGF-β signaling has been implicated in cerebrovascular dysfunction, loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and age-related neuroinflammation. We have reported that pre-mature vascular aging in MFS mice could extend to cerebrovasculature, where peak blood flow velocity in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) of 6-month-old (6M) MFS mice was reduced, similarly to 12-month-old (12M) control mice. Case studies of MFS patients have documented neurovascular manifestations, including intracranial aneurysms, stroke, arterial tortuosity, as well as headaches and migraines, with reported incidences of pain and chronic fatigue. Despite these significant clinical observations, investigation into cerebrovascular dysfunction and neuropathology in MFS remains limited. Using 6M-control (<i>C57BL/6</i>) and 6M-MFS (<i>Fbn1</i> <sup><i>C1041G/+</i></sup> ) and healthy 12M-control male and female mice, we test the hypothesis that abnormal Fbn1 protein expression is associated with altered cerebral microvascular density, BBB permeability, and neuroinflammation in the PCA-perfused hippocampus, all indicative of a pre-mature aging brain phenotype. Glut1 immunostaining was used to quantify microvascular density, IgG staining to assess BBB permeability, and microglial counts to evaluate neuroinflammation. Using Glut1 staining, 6M-MFS mice and 12M-CTRL similarly present decreased microvascular density in the dentate gyrus (DG), cornu ammonis 1 (CA1), and cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) regions of the hippocampus. 6M-MFS mice exhibit increased BBB permeability in the DG and CA3 as evident by Immunoglobulin G (IgG) staining. No differences were detected between 6M and 12M-CTRL mice. 6M-MFS mice show a higher number of microglia in the hippocampus compared to age-matched control mice, a pattern resembling that of 12M-CTRL mice. This study represents the first known investigation into neuropathology in a mouse model of MFS and indicates that the pathophysiology underlying MFS leads to a systemic pre-mature aging phenotype. This study is crucial for identifying and understanding MFS-associated neurovascular and neurological abnormalities, underscoring the need for research aimed at improving the quality of life and managing pre-mature aging symptoms in MFS and related connective tissue disorders."

    "title": "Regulation of Joint Tissues and Joint Function: Is There Potential for Lessons to Be Learned Regarding Regulatory Control from Joint Hypermobility Syndromes?",
    "abstract": "Normal development of joints starts in utero with the establishment of a cellular and extracellular matrix template. Following birth, individual joint tissues grow and mature in response to biochemical and mechanical signals, leading to a coordinated pattern of further maturation resulting in a joint that functions as an organ system. Each joint develops and matures as an organ system defined by the biomechanical environment in which it will function. For those with joint hypermobility syndromes, either defined by specific genetic mutations or not (i.e., Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Loey-Dietz syndrome, hypermobility-type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), this process is partially compromised, but many aspects of joint tissue maturation and resulting joint function is retained such that the organs form and retain partial function, but it is compromised. Comparing the characteristics of what is known regarding development, growth, maturation, and response to stressors such as puberty, pregnancy, and aging in joints of those without and with joint hypermobility leads to the conclusion that in those that have hypermobility syndromes, the joint systems may be compromised via a failure to undergo mechanical maturation, possibly via defective mechanotransduction. Given the breadth of the mutations involved in such hypermobility syndromes, further characterization of this concept may reveal commonalities in their impact on tissue maturation, which will further inform regulatory aspects of normal tissue and functional integrity. This review/perspective piece will attempt to detail such comparisons and summarize how further study will aid in further understanding."

    "title": "Novel FBN1 intron variant causes isolated ectopia lentis via in-frame exon skipping.",
    "abstract": "Mutations in fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause various clinical conditions, such as Marfan syndrome (MFS). However, the genotype-phenotype relationships underlying MFS and other conditions relevant to FBN1 mutations have not been fully elucidated. We performed whole-exome sequencing on three participants, including an affected mother-daughter pair, in a three-generation Japanese family with isolated ectopia lentis (IEL). The sequencing identified a novel single-nucleotide variant (c.1327+3A>C) in intron 11 of FBN1 that was shared between the two patients. We confirmed the co-segregation of the variant with IEL in two additional affected relatives in the family. The Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion score of the variant was 26.1, which was indicated by SpliceAI to influence splicing, with a score of 0.93. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of mRNAs isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed aberrant bands in all four affected individuals. Subsequent sequencing revealed that these bands originated from FBN1 transcripts lacking exon 11. The causality of the variant in the skipping of exon 11, which results in an in-frame deletion of 60 amino acids corresponding to the \"hinge\" region of FBN1 protein, was confirmed in a minigene experiment. Interestingly, the same result was observed for a minigene for c.1327+1G>A, a variant previously identified in two unrelated EL families without MFS manifestations. These results suggest that the c.1327+3A>C mutation in FBN1 likely leads to IEL. The findings expand our knowledge of FBN1 and provide insights into FBN1-related diseases."

    "abstract": "Although the relationship between cervical carotid tortuosity and cardiovascular risk in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome has been studied, it is unclear whether cervical carotid tortuosity influences the risk of neurovascular events. This is a single-institution retrospective cohort study. Cervical carotid tortuosity and morphology were assessed in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome who underwent baseline computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical and cerebral arteries from 2010 to 2022. The primary end point was a composite of adverse neurovascular events (multiple vessel cervical artery dissection, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and any neurovascular intervention) at 5- and 10-year follow-ups. Independent risk factors were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Single-variable predictors of 5- and 10-year outcomes were analyzed via receiver operating curve analyses. Cutoff values were determined per the Youden J index. Stratification analyses were performed for ages <60 and ≥60 years. Of 105 eligible participants, 63 were included (mean age, 40±17 years; 52% female). During a mean follow-up of 8.7±4.1 years, 23 (37%) developed an adverse neurovascular event. Five-year follow-up was achieved in 86% and 10-year follow-up in 48%. Carotid total absolute curvature (TAC; <i>P</i>=0.008), coiling morphology (<i>P</i>=0.012), and <i>TGFBR1/2</i> genetic variant (<i>P</i>=0.037) were independently associated with 5-year events. Stratification analyses revealed that the age group <60 years was more vulnerable to high TAC (unadjusted odds ratio, 7.2 [95% CI, 2.0-25.4]; <i>P</i>=0.002). Baseline TAC was the only independent predictor of adverse events at 5 years (area under the curve, 0.84; <i>P</i><0.001) and 10 years (area under the curve, 0.75; <i>P</i>=0.007) in this age group. An optimal threshold for predicting neurovascular events was TAC ≥16.5. None were predictive in the age group ≥60 years. Cervical carotid tortuosity is associated with a long-term increased risk of neurovascular events in Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Angiographic findings of high-risk features such as increased TAC and coiling morphology may help to identify neurovascular vulnerability noninvasively at an early stage."

    "abstract": "The number of patients with various genetic syndromes who are or seek to become pregnant is increasing due to advances in medical care and assisted reproductive technologies. Management of these patients requires multidisciplinary care teams and knowledge of the risks of increased morbidity and mortality. In addition, many of these inheritance patterns are autosomal dominant, with a 50% risk of an offspring inheriting the disorder with each pregnancy. In this first of a 2-part series, common syndromes with connective tissue, muscle, vascular, or skeletal involvement will be discussed regarding surveillance and management of mother and fetus. A literature search was performed for important updates in the literature regarding management of patients with genetic connective tissue disorders, aortopathies, muscular dystrophies, vascular disorders, and skeletal dysplasias. Updates have been incorporated since the last publication in 2011, including updated diagnostic criteria for several conditions (such as Marfan syndrome), international guidelines in management of aortopathies and achondroplasia, an expanded section on hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and a new section on familial cerebral cavernous malformation. Since the last publication, many guidelines have been published or updated regarding management of pregnancies in patients with genetic disorders and are reviewed in this article. Clinicians who care for pregnant patients with genetic disorders should be aware of updated guidelines and recommendations in order to optimize their care during pregnancy."

This study aims to evaluate long-term visual outcomes and complications following retropupillary implantation of the Artisan IOL at a Canadian centre. Retrospective chart review. Patients who underwent implantation of an Artisan IOL at a tertiary Canadian center between January 2013 and December 2021. Retrospective chart review was performed, and clinical outcomes at postoperative follow-up visits were summarized. Outcomes included postoperative best corrected and uncorrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA and UCDVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), as well as intraoperative and postoperative complications. Seventy-three eyes of 67 patients were evaluated. Mean follow-up duration was 11 months (range: 1-63 months). Common indications for Artisan implantation were IOL dislocation (n = 50; 68.5%) and aphakia (n = 23; 31.5%). Causes for IOL dislocation included idiopathic zonular weakness (n = 25; 34.2%), pseudo-exfoliation (n = 14; 19.2%), surgical complications (n = 6; 8.2%), trauma (n = 3; 4.1%), and Marfan syndrome (n = 2; 2.7%). Causes for aphakia included complicated cataract surgery (n = 20; 27.4%), ocular trauma (n = 2; 2.7%), and post-vitrectomy and lensectomy (n = 1; 1.4%). Average BCDVA (logMAR) was 0.62 ± 0.56 at preop, 0.46 ± 0.55 at 3 months postop, and 0.43 ± 0.55 at 9-12 months (p < 0.0001). Average UCDVA (logMAR) was 1.19 ± 0.68 at preop, 0.65 ± 0.60 at 3 months postop, and 0.42 ± 0.46 at 9-12 months (p < 0.0001). IOP did not differ significantly in follow-up. Pupil ovalization (n = 11, 15.1%) was the most common complication. Outcomes demonstrated favourable efficacy and safety of retropupillary Artisan IOL as an option for providing adequate visual rehabilitation for patients without sufficient capsular support."

Several cardiovascular drugs are used for treatment, including celiprolol, but no controlled trial in this condition has been conducted to date. We hypothesized the benefit of the addition of an angiotensin II receptor blocker. A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of the angiotensin II receptor blocker irbesartan in adults with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome on stable background celiprolol therapy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive irbesartan (150 mg/day titrated to 300 mg/day) or placebo for 2 years. The composite primary outcome was defined as any vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-related fatal or nonfatal arterial event or any new or worsening arterial lesions detected by systematic head-to-pelvis computed tomography angiography or peripheral arterial duplex ultrasound at different time points, using a time-to-first-event analysis. Twenty-nine participants (62% female; 40.3±11.3 years of age) were randomized to irbesartan, and 28 (64% female; 40.7±11.0 years of age) were randomized to placebo. The composite primary outcome occurred in 8 of 29 patients (27.6%) receiving irbesartan versus 15 of 28 patients (53.6%) receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.17, 0.99]; <i>P</i><0.05). The risk of recurrent symptomatic or nonsymptomatic arterial events was lower with irbesartan than with placebo (risk ratio, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.19, 0.68]; <i>P</i>=0.002). A reduction of progression of arterial lesions was observed at all sites. Irbesartan significantly reduced systolic blood pressure compared with placebo (baseline-adjusted difference of 5.4 mm Hg [<i>P</i><0.001]), but no relation was observed with the reduction of the primary composite outcome. Eleven episodes of irbesartan-related hypotension were recorded, leading to a downtitration in 4 patients. Compared with placebo, irbesartan reduced the risk of severe symptomatic and asymptomatic arterial events in patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome on background celiprolol therapy.

A 35-year-old Caucasian female with a history of crystalline lens dislocation secondary to Marfan Syndrome was referred for management of chronically exposed Gore-Tex suture knots following AKREOS 4-point fixation six years prior. The initial surgery was reportedly complicated by hypotony leading to multiple attempted wound revisions. Ultimately, the patient remained with chronically exposed suture knots. Upon referral to our practice, the knots of the left eye were rotated into the eye, leading to endophthalmitis refractory to two rounds of intravitreal antibiotics. Infection was controlled only after removal of all preexisting hardware, suggesting colonization of the suture material. In the other eye, the decision was made to remove all preexisting sutures and re-fixate the initial lens using new suture. The patient achieved 20/20 vision in both eyes with implantation of a new secondary IOL in one eye and with removal of all preexisting sutures in the other eye. This report highlights a case of endophthalmitis following delayed rotation of exposed suture. Based on the outcome of this case, the importance of avoiding suture exposure is highlighted, and options to manage chronically exposed suture are discussed."

    "abstract": "<b>Background and Objective:</b> Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) represents a critical and life-threatening condition requiring urgent surgical intervention, which is often life-saving. However, postoperative acute lung injury (ALI) has emerged as a prominent complication that significantly impacts patient outcomes and prognosis. This study aims to systematically analyze the risk factors associated with the development of severe ALI following ATAAD surgery, providing insights to improve postoperative management strategies. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis was conducted using a comprehensive database comprising 483 patients diagnosed with ATAAD. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the severity of postoperative ALI: severe ALI group (n = 182) and non-severe ALI group (n = 301). Clinical data were systematically collected and compared between the two cohorts. Binary logistic regression analysis was employed to identify independent predictors of severe ALI following ATAAD surgery. The diagnostic accuracy of these risk factors was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, with the area under the curve (AUC) serving as the metric for prognostic performance. <b>Results:</b> The severe ALI group exhibited a higher prevalence of preoperative oxygenation index (OI) ≤ 200 mmHg, smoking history, and coronary artery disease compared to the non-severe ALI group (P < 0.001, P = 0.032, and P = 0.039, respectively), while the prevalence of Marfan syndrome was lower (P = 0.033). Moreover, significant differences were observed in several clinical and intraoperative parameters, including body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, white blood cell count (WBC), aortic cross-clamp time, moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (MHCA) time, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) duration, and ICU length of stay (all P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression identified preoperative OI [P = 0.008, OR (95% CI): 0.002 (0.000-0.183)], BMI [P = 0.037, OR (95% CI): 1.569 (1.027-2.397)], CRP [P = 0.022, OR (95% CI): 1.292 (1.037-1.609)], D-dimer [P < 0.001, OR (95% CI): 3.841 (1.820-8.108)], MHCA time [P = 0.001, OR (95% CI): 3.306 (1.670-6.544)], and CPB duration [P = 0.017, OR (95% CI): 1.117 (1.020-1.223)] as independent predictors of severe ALI. ROC curve analysis revealed the diagnostic performance of preoperative OI, BMI, CRP, D-dimer, MHCA time, and CPB duration, with AUC values of 0.715, 0.844, 0.871, 0.955, 0.944, and 0.833, respectively (all P < 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> Preoperative oxygenation index, BMI, CRP, D-dimer levels, MHCA time, and CPB duration are independent risk factors for the development of severe ALI following ATAAD surgery. These findings underscore the importance of preoperative risk assessment and perioperative optimization to mitigate the risk of severe ALI and improve patient outcomes."

After preoperative workup, he was taken for aortic valve replacement surgery. Intraoperative findings confirmed the rupture of right and non-coronary cusps from their annular attachment and the myxomatous nature of the aortic valve. Histopathological examination confirmed the myxomatous changes in the valve. The patient underwent aortic valve replacement with a 23 mm TTK Chitra valve and on follow-up, he is doing well. Although aortic valve regurgitation is a common disease, myxomatous degeneration of isolated aortic valve leading to aortic regurgitation is rare. This patient did not have any signs of connective tissue disorders like Marfan's syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos, etc., but presented with myxomatous aortic valve throwing an insight into further research into this rare disease."

Multivariable analysis is identifying advanced age, high Body Mass Index (BMI), Marfan syndrome, severe aortic regurgitation, bicuspid aortic valve, increased aortic root diameter, and reduced aortic cross-clamp time (ACC) as significant factors associated with ARR. After Propensity Score Matching (PSM), VSRR is showing significantly higher 5-year survival rates than ARR (80.2% vs. 64.1%, P = 0.001), validated by Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) analysis. Reintervention rates are being found comparable, with endocarditis more prevalent in ARR and aortic regurgitation in VSRR. Subgroup analysis indicated that patients aged less than 60 years and those with a BMI greater than 24 in the VSRR group exhibited significantly improved survival probabilities compared to the ARR group. These findings support the wider utilization of valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) in appropriately selected patients, highlighting its potential advantages for suitable candidates."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the <i>FBN1</i> gene encoding fibrillin-1, a matrix component of extracellular microfibrils. The main cause of morbidity and mortality in MFS is thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection, but the underlying mechanisms remain undetermined. To elucidate the role of endothelial XOR (xanthine oxidoreductase)-derived reactive oxygen species in aortic aneurysm progression, we inhibited in vivo function of XOR either by endothelial cell (EC)-specific disruption of the <i>Xdh</i> gene or by systemic administration of an XOR inhibitor febuxostat in MFS mice harboring the <i>Fbn1</i> missense mutation p.(Cys1041Gly). We assessed the aberrant activation of mechanosensitive signaling in the ascending aorta of <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice. Further analysis of human aortic ECs investigated the mechanisms by which mechanical stress upregulates XOR expression. We found a significant increase in reactive oxygen species generation in the ascending aorta of patients with MFS and <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice, which was associated with a significant increase in protein expression and enzymatic activity of XOR protein in aortic ECs. Genetic disruption of <i>Xdh</i> in ECs or treatment with febuxostat significantly suppressed aortic aneurysm progression and improved perivascular infiltration of macrophages. Mechanistically, mechanosensitive signaling involving FAK (focal adhesion kinase)-p38 MAPK (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase) and Egr-1 (early growth response-1) was aberrantly activated in the ascending aorta of <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice, and mechanical stress on human aortic ECs upregulated XOR expression through Egr-1 upregulation. Consistently, EC-specific knockout of XOR or systemic administration of febuxostat in <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice suppressed reactive oxygen species generation, FAK-p38 MAPK activation, and Egr-1 upregulation. Aberrant activation of mechanosensitive signaling in vascular ECs triggered endothelial XOR activation and reactive oxygen species generation, which contributes to the progression of aortic aneurysms in MFS. These findings highlight a drug repositioning approach using a uric acid-lowering drug febuxostat as a potential therapy for MFS."

Nineteen new EQ-5D-5L bolt-ons were developed based on literature review, expert input, and qualitative interviews and focus groups with patients, caregivers, and representatives of patient associations. A nationwide, cross-sectional, web-based survey in China included patients or caregivers of patients with 31 RDs in China (n = 9190). In each RDs, participants completed the EQ-5D-5L and 3 of 20 (1 existing and 19 newly developed) bolt-ons. Ceiling, explanatory power, convergent, divergent, and known-group validity were examined. Among the bolt-ons, itching had the lowest ceiling (6.5%), whereas social relationships had the highest (42.2%). The absolute reduction in the ceiling of the EQ-5D-5L with the addition of any bolt-ons was limited, ranging from 0 (respiratory problems) to 8.3% points (isolation). Dignity and vitality resulted in the largest increase in explained variance in EQ VAS. The isolation, fertility, and visual acuity bolt-ons showed good divergent validity from the EQ-5D-5L items. There was strong convergent validity between SF-12 and conceptually related bolt-ons (eg, physical health composite and muscle problems bolt-on). Various bolt-ons improved the known-groups validity in specific patient groups, eg, Huntington's disease (oral expressions), scleroderma (dexterity), myasthenia gravis (muscle problems), neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis (fatigue), Marfan syndrome (self-image), and Pompe disease (safety). The EQ-5D-5L shows sufficient validity in most RDs, but incorporating relevant, specific bolt-ons could enhance its ability to more comprehensively assess health-related quality of life in these patients."

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that hyperactivation of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling plays a causal role in the development of thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection. Modulation of PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A) activity has been shown to be of significant therapeutic value. In light of the effects that PP2A can exert on the mTOR pathway, we hypothesized that PP2A activation by small-molecule activators of PP2A could mitigate AA progression in Marfan syndrome (MFS). Two distinct mouse models of MFS underwent daily oral administration of small-molecule activators of the PP2A compound DT-061 to assess its therapeutic potential. Echocardiography was performed to monitor the growth of the aortic root and ascending aorta. Histological evaluation was performed to assess alterations in the vascular wall. RNA-sequencing, Western blot, and immunostaining were performed to decipher the underlying mechanisms by which DT-061 suppresses AA progression. PP2A activity decreased, while mTOR activity increased in both human and mouse aortas with MFS. Concordantly, oral administration of DT-061 increased PP2A activation, reducing aortic expansion in Marfan mice. DT-061 treatment also mitigated medial hypertrophy, elastin breakdown, and extracellular matrix deterioration in the ascending aorta, along with decreased metalloproteinase activities. Mechanistic studies suggest that DT-061 suppresses mTOR signaling and smooth muscle cell dedifferentiation, contributing to its effects on thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection progression. These studies demonstrate a pathological role of PP2A activity loss in the cause of MFS and implicate that activation of PP2A may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to limit MFS progression, including aortic aneurysm formation."

    "abstract": "Stereotyped mutations in NOTCH3 drive CADASIL, the leading inherited cause of stroke and vascular dementia. The vast majority of these mutations result in alterations in the number of cysteines in the gene product. However, non-cysteine-altering pathogenic mutations have also been identified, making it challenging to discriminate pathogenic from benign NOTCH3 sequence variants. Here, we present a method for quantitative assessment of NOTCH3 mutants, the light chain split luciferase (LSL) assay. In LSL, NOTCH3 mutant fragments, cloned between a split luciferase open reading frame, are transfected into cells, producing secreted luciferase activity that is dependent on the normal structure of NOTCH3. Insertion of point mutants that cause CADASIL results in significantly lower activity. Using a panel of 47 sequences, we determined the sensitivity and specificity of LSL for pathogenic NOTCH3 mutation discrimination to be 100% and 93%. LSL was also modestly successful in differentiating pathogenic proteins responsible for Marfan's disease and Stiff Skin Syndrome. Two additional parameters from the LSL analysis (TCEP rescue of activity and secretion index) were also shown to be useful in characterizing NOTCH3 mutants. We show that the spacing and primary sequence of the light chain module is an important component of the LSL assay, as a single light chain cysteine is critical for pathogenic sequence discrimination. Furthermore, we show that the activity of CADASIL mutant reporters is amplified by the application of cysteine-reactive iodoacetamide, suggesting that LSL may be deployed to screen for novel compounds that suppress pathogenic conformations of NOTCH3."

Questions focused on the composition of the team, imaging, clinical suspicion, genetic testing, medical management, indications for surgical repair, surgical technique, surveillance, exercise, and quality of life. The level of agreement for each question was graded using a Likert type scale and classified into four categories: A (very strong), B (strong), C (fair), and D (no agreement). A total of 35 experts from 18 different hospitals and 10 different countries participated in the study: 19 vascular surgeons, 11 cardiologists, four geneticists, and one cardiac surgeon. Of the 97 statements of the final questionnaire, 16 were graded A (16%), 23 B (24%), five C (5%), 44 D (45%) and nine (9%) were invalid. The experts highlighted the need to develop personalised therapies for each pathology, as well as international multicentre databases to collect data on the natural course of AAA patients with HAD. This Delphi process led to consensus on several aspects of care for patients with AAA and underlying HAD, providing guidance to manage them in a more standardised fashion. The agreements reached focus on multidisciplinary aortic teams, imaging and genetic diagnosis, treatment, and follow up. Furthermore, several topics for future research were identified."

    "title": "Advances in Cardiovascular Multimodality Imaging in Patients with Marfan Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disorder affecting connective tissue, often leading to cardiovascular complications such as aortic aneurysms and mitral valve prolapse. Cardiovascular multimodality imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of MFS patients. This review explores the advancements in echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), cardiac computed tomography (CCT), and nuclear medicine techniques in MFS. Echocardiography remains the first-line tool, essential for assessing aortic root, mitral valve abnormalities, and cardiac function. CMR provides detailed anatomical and functional assessments without radiation exposure, making it ideal for long-term follow-up. CT offers high-resolution imaging of the aorta, crucial for surgical planning, despite its ionizing radiation. Emerging nuclear medicine techniques, though less common, show promise in evaluating myocardial involvement and inflammatory conditions. This review underscores the importance of a comprehensive imaging approach to improve outcomes and guide interventions in MFS patients. It also introduces novel aspects of multimodality approaches, emphasizing their impact on early detection and management of cardiovascular complications in MFS."

    "abstract": "Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) is a nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory vascular disorder predominantly affecting women aged 18 to 65 years. This case report highlights a 74-year-old female diagnosed with FMD incidentally during evaluation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Imaging revealed significant vascular anomalies, including a giant intracranial carotid aneurysm and a hypoplastic iliac vein with extensive collateral formation. Early detection and tailored management are crucial to prevent complications such as arterial dissections, aneurysms, and stroke. The patient showed favorable evolution without anticoagulation therapy, and interventional embolization was planned to mitigate rupture risks. Differential diagnosis includes atherosclerotic aneurysms, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, and polyarteritis nodosa, which must be distinguished through comprehensive imaging and clinical evaluation. The prognosis of FMD varies widely and depends on the extent and location of arterial involvement. This case underscores the importance of advanced imaging in accurately diagnosing and guiding long-term follow-up for FMD management."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an inherited disorder that affects the connective tissues and mainly presents in the bones, eyes, and cardiovascular system, etc. Aortic pathology is the leading cause of death in patients with Marfan syndrome. The fibrillin-1 gene (<i>FBN1</i>) is a major gene involved in the pathogenesis of MFS. It has been shown that the aortic pathogenesis of MFS is associated with the imbalances of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway. However, the exact molecular mechanism of MFS is unclear. Animal models may partially mimic MFS and are vital to the study of MFS. Several species of animals have been used for MFS studies, including chicks, cattle, mice, pigs, zebrafishes, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, and rabbits. These models were developed spontaneously or in combination with genetic engineering techniques. This review is to describe the TGF-β signaling pathway in MFS and the potential application of animal models to provide new therapeutic strategies for patients with MFS."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) requires emergency surgery, but the choice of primary surgery remains controversial. It is believed that simple ascending aorta replacement may lead to higher postoperative survival rate, while the Sun procedure [frozen elephant trunk (FET) + total arch replacement (TAR)] performed in the first stage may obtain better long-term results. The study aimed to compare the outcome of ATAAD patients who underwent the Sun procedure with those without TAR + FET. Data of 452 patients with ATAAD admitted to Beijing Anzhen Hospital for surgical treatment from August 1, 2020, to August 16, 2022, were collected and analyzed. Patients with the Sun procedure (n=344) were compared to those without the Sun procedure (n=108). The two groups of patients were matched using propensity score matching (PSM), and the risk factors of poor prognosis were analyzed. The average postoperative follow-up period was 976±414 days, and the loss of follow-up rate was 0. The postoperative 30-day mortality rates were 12.56% and 5.38% in the Sun procedure group and the non-Sun procedure group after PSM matching, respectively (P=0.06). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that postoperative cardiogenic shock, postoperative cerebral malperfusion syndrome (MPS), postoperative spinal MPS, and need for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were independent risk factors for postoperative 30-day death. The 3-year survival rates were 85.02% and 91.40% in the Sun procedure group and the non-Sun procedure group after PSM matching, respectively (P=0.12). According to multivariate cox regression analysis, the independent risk factors associated with postoperative midterm death were consistent with those associated with 30-day postoperative death that pointed out by logistic regression. The incidence of spinal MPS after the Sun procedure was higher than that in the non-Sun procedure group (P=0.003). At 3-year follow-up, the probability of no distal aortic events (DAEs) was 97.17% and 91.59%, in the Sun procedure group and non-Sun procedure group, respectively, representing a significant difference (P=0.02). Multivariate Cox regression showed that Marfan syndrome and non-Sun procedure were risk factors for DAEs. Fine-Gray analysis also produced results similar to multifactor cox regression analysis, that Marfan syndrome and non-Sun procedure were risk factors for DAEs. There was no significant difference in postoperative mortality between the Sun procedure group and the non-Sun procedure group. The incidence of spinal MPS in the Sun procedure group was higher than that in the non-Sun procedure group, while the incidence of DAEs in the Sun procedure group was lower than that in non-Sun procedure group."

This promising avenue has also been applied to model Marfan syndrome, a disease affecting multiple organ systems, including the skeletal and cardiovascular system. Marfan syndrome is caused by pathogenic variants in <i>FBN1</i>, the gene encoding for the extracellular matrix protein fibrillin-1 which ensembles into microfibrils. There is a poor genotype-phenotype correlation displayed by the diverse clinical manifestations of this disease in patients. Up to now, 52 different human pluripotent stem cells lines have been established and reported for Marfan syndrome. These stem cells have been employed to model aortopathy, skeletal abnormalities and cardiomyopathy <i>in vitro</i>. These models were able to recapitulate key features of the disease that are also observed in patients. The use of pluripotent stem cells will help to uncover disease mechanisms and to identify new therapeutic strategies in Marfan syndrome."

We characterized vasomotor function and its relationship to the activity of the NO-generating enzymes in mice with early onset progressively severe MFS. Wire myography, immunoblotting, measurements of aortic NO, and superoxide levels were used to compare vasomotor function, contractile protein levels, and the activity of endothelial and inducible NO synthase (eNOS and iNOS, respectively) in ascending thoracic aortas of Fbn1mgR/mgR mice relative to wild-type littermates. Isometric force measurements of aortic rings from 16-day-old male Fbn1mgR/mgR mice revealed a significant reduction in acetylcholine-induced relaxation and increased phenylephrine (PE)-promoted contractility, associated with abnormally low eNOSSer1177 phosphorylation, decreased NO production, and augmented superoxide levels. Greater aortic contractility was associated with α1-adrenoceptor upregulation and normal levels of contractile proteins. While iNOS inhibition had no effect on vasomotor functions, mutant aortic rings preincubated with a nonspecific NOS inhibitor yielded a greater PE response, implying a significant contribution of endothelial dysfunction to aortic hypercontractility.

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) in Marfan syndrome (MFS) is generally attributed to vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) pathologies. However, the role of immune cell-mediated inflammation remains elusive. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified a subset of CX3CR1+ macrophages mainly located in the intima in the aortic roots and ascending aortas of Fbn1C1041G/+ mice, further validated in MFS patients. Specific elimination of CX3CR1+ cells by diphtheria toxin in Cx3cr1-CreERT2iDTRF/+Fbn1C1041G/+ mice efficiently ameliorated TAA progression. Administering the monoclonal antibodies to respectively neutralize TNF-α and IGF1 produced by CX3CR1+ cells from MFS patients greatly suppressed the cocultured MFS patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived VSMC inflammation. BM transplantation and parabiosis revealed that CX3CR1+ macrophages are mainly originated from BM-derived monocytes. Targeting TNF-α and IGF1 in CX3CR1+ macrophages via shRNA lentivirus transduction in BM cells efficiently suppressed TAA development in BM-transplanted Fbn1C1041G/+ mice. Application of the CCR2 antagonist RS504393 to inhibit monocyte infiltration markedly reduced the accumulation of CX3CR1+ macrophages and subsequently alleviated TAA progression in Fbn1C1041G/+ mice. In summary, CX3CR1+ macrophages mainly located in aortic intima mediate TAA formation by paracrinally causing VSMC inflammation, and targeting them offers a potential antiinflammatory therapeutic strategy for MFS-related TAA."

    "abstract": "Aortic wall stiffening in ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (aTAA) is common. However, the spatial and temporal relationships between stiffness, aortic size, and growth in aTAA remain unclear. In this single-centre retrospective study, we utilized vascular deformation mapping to extract multi-directional aortic motion, aortic distensibility, and aortic growth in a multi-planar fashion from multi-phasic ECG-gated computed tomography angiograms. Aortic displacement and stiffness metrics were compared between patients with sporadic ascending aortic dilation (Dilated), individuals without thoracic aortic dilation, and patients with Marfan syndrome. A total of 96 patients were included. Total and axial aortic root motion was significantly decreased in the Dilated group (<i>n</i> = 49) compared with the Non-dilated group (<i>n</i> = 38) and Marfan group (<i>n</i> = 16). Aortic distensibility was significantly lower in the Dilated group compared with the Non-dilated group and exhibited a more diffuse pattern of stiffening compared with the Marfan group in which stiffening was localized to the root. In Dilated group, aortic distensibility was moderately and positively associated with aortic growth rate (<i>R</i> = 0.34, <i>P</i> = 0.02). The moderate-to-strong association between age and aortic stiffness in non-dilated segments was either significantly blunted or absent in dilated segments. Vascular deformation mapping provides multi-level stiffness assessments of the ascending aorta using multi-phasic computed tomography angiography. Ascending aortic stiffening is a spatially heterogeneous process with stiffening tending to increase with degree of regional dilation and age, whereas lower stiffness was associated with faster growth of the mid-ascending aorta in those with sporadic aTAA."

    "abstract": "Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) are rare but serious conditions characterized by dilation of the aorta characterized by remodeling of the vessel wall, with changes in the elastin and collagen content. Individuals with Marfan syndrome have a genetic predisposition for elastic fiber fragmentation and elastin degradation and are prone to early aneurysm formation and progression. Our objective was to analyze the medial collagen characteristics through histological, polarized light microscopy, and electron microscopy methods across the thoracic and abdominal aorta in twenty-five patients undergoing open surgical repair, including nine with Marfan syndrome. While age at surgery differed significantly between the groups, maximum aortic diameter and aneurysm extent did not. Collagen content increased from thoracic to infrarenal segments in both cohorts, with non-Marfan patients exhibiting higher collagen percentages, notably in the infrarenal aorta (729.3 nm vs. 1068.3 nm, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Both groups predominantly displayed mature collagen fibers, with the suprarenal segment containing the highest proportion of less mature fibers. Electron microscopy revealed comparable collagen fibril diameters across segments irrespective of Marfan status. Our findings underscore non-uniform histological patterns in TAAAs and suggest that ECM remodeling involves mature collagen deposition, albeit with lower collagen content observed in the infrarenal aorta of Marfan patients."

Further to discuss clinical implications and direction for research. A qualitative focus group interview study was conducted of 47 adults (Marfan syndrome (MFS) = 14, Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) = 11, vascular Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS) = 11, relatives = 11). The interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Significant themes were identified, extracted, and organised undergoing content analyses. The two main themes and 10 subthemes identified; I. Psychosocial well-being; (i) Social engagement and activity, (ii) Self-sufficient in daily living, (iii) Participation in education and work life, (iv) Coping with fear related to the disease, (v) Being able to control and accept fatigue and pain, (vi) Maintaining active engagement with family and friends (vii) Finding health-promoting physical activities. II. Monitoring and meetings with the health service: (viii) Feeling safe and receiving coordinated care, (ix) Being recognized, seen, and accepted, (x) Receiving factual and sober information and advice. The sub-themes seemed mutually interrelated in terms of barriers, strategies, and facilitators for improving quality of life. There was high degree of consensus regarding the factors emphasized as important for QoL among the various diagnostic groups and the relatives. Based on our findings, to improve QoL in patients with sHTAD we should more effectively integrate the patient`s perspectives and voice on the elements crucial to QoL. In addition, it is vital for developing and customizing validated questionnaires to accurately reflect the factors deemed significant by this specific patient cohort. The research is limited on patients' perspectives on QoL, and more research is warranted. This might also be crucial for identifying relevant validated QoL instruments that reflect the patients` perceptions of what is vital for QoL."

All individuals aged 18 years and older with more than 6 months of cannabis use at the time of surgical repair for cardiovascular disease (aortic aneurysms or aortic dissection) between 2007 and 2023 were eligible. Patients were stratified into 2 groups based on their preoperative history of cannabis use: cannabis users and noncannabis users. The primary end point was complications or death within 30 days of intervention. Secondary outcomes included late complications and reinterventions. Data were combined from our institution and inpatient hospital records. We identified 134 patients who met the inclusion criteria out of 1543 treated patients (9%). Compared with the nonusing cannabis group, individuals in the cannabis group were significantly younger (cannabis: 48.3 ± 11.8 years vs noncannabis: 58.5 ± 14.9 years; <i>P</i> < .001). The cannabis group included significantly higher patients with Marfan syndrome (cannabis: 11.2% vs noncannabis: 4.4%; <i>P</i> < .001). Furthermore, the cannabis group showed significantly higher history of recreational drug use, including cocaine (25.4% vs 1.6%; <i>P</i> < .001), amphetamines (3.7% vs 0.6%; <i>P</i> < .001), opioids (8.2% vs 0.5%; <i>P</i> < .001), and intravenous drugs (6.7% vs 0.6%; <i>P</i> < .001). Emergency surgeries were significantly more frequent in the cannabis group (cannabis: 56.7% vs noncannabis: 36.2%; <i>P</i> < .001). Surgical mortality was comparable between both groups (cannabis: 9.7% vs noncannabis: 8.6%; <i>P</i> = .662). Postoperative stroke was significantly higher in the cannabis group (cannabis: 14.9% vs noncannabis: 8.2%; <i>P</i> = .009), and the rate of postoperative respiratory complications was also significantly higher in the cannabis group (cannabis: 32.1% vs noncannabis: 19.0%; <i>P</i> < .001). The increased rates of postoperative cerebrovascular accidents and respiratory complications suggest that cannabis use is a significant risk factor in aortic surgery. Our study showed that young, healthy patients with prolonged cannabis use might be at a higher risk of requiring more emergency surgeries due to their background."

Six MFS pedigrees presented at the Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group) between 2017 and 2022 were selected as the study subjects. Clinical data of pedigrees were retrospectively analyzed. Peripheral blood samples were collected from the probands and their family members for the extraction of genomic DNA. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was carried out. Candidate variants of the FBN1 gene were verified by Sanger sequencing. Based on the guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), pathogenicity of the candidate variants was assessed. AlphaFold3 and PyMOL software were used for homology modeling of the FBN1 protein and analysis of its three-dimensional structure and amino acid sequence conservation. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group) (Ethics No. 20231002). Cardiovascular system abnormalities were noted in all pedigrees, ocular abnormalities were present in pedigrees 2 and 5, skeletal system abnormalities were presented in pedigrees 1, and 4 to 6. FBN1 gene mutations were identified in all pedigrees, including c.1957_1958dupGT (p.Asp654fs), c.5014T>A (p.Cys1672Ser), c.8135delC (p.Pro2712fs), c.2302G>T (p.Glu768*), c.3473A>G (p.Glu1158Gly) and c.6169C>T (p.Arg2057*), with each involving a different exon. Four variants were rated as pathogenic, one as likely pathogenic, and one as variant of uncertain significance. Among these, c.5014T>A (p.Cys1672Ser), c.1957_1958dupGT (p.Asp654fs), c.8135delC (p.Pro2712fs), and c.2302G>T (p.Glu768*) were unreported previously. Bioinformatic analysis with SIFT and PolyPhen-2 predicted that the c.5014T>A (p.Cys1672Ser) and c.3473A>G (p.Glu1158Gly) variants were deleterious. Protein homologous sequence alignment analysis revealed that the four novel mutation sites are highly conserved across various species. Homology modeling of the FBN1 protein three-dimensional structure indicated that the six variant sites in the amino acid sequence are all close to hydrogen bonds and may alter the secondary and tertiary structures to varying degrees, thereby confirmed the relationship between the variants and MFS. Four novel variants of the FBN1 gene have been discovered in this study, which has enriched the mutational and phenotypic spectrum of MFS and provided a basis for disease diagnosis and genetic counseling."

Methods We retrospectively investigated the diagnosis, direction of lens and IOL dislocation, and IOP before and after surgery (preoperatively and one day, one week, and one month postoperatively) in 236 eyes from 228 patients who underwent IOL intrascleral fixation at Chiba University Hospital between February 2015 and September 2020. Results IOL intrascleral fixation was performed in 48 (20.3%) patients with long eye axis, 44 (18.6%) with pseudoexfoliation (PEX), 42 (17.8%) with intraoperative problems such as ciliary zonule rupture or posterior capsule rupture, 40 (16.9%) with a history of trauma, 34 (14.4%) with a history of vitrectomy, 21 (8.9%) with atopic dermatitis, six (2.5%) with genetic diseases such as Marfan syndrome, four (1.7%) with retinitis pigmentosa, and 58 (24.6%) with unknown causes. Downward IOL dislocation was the most common (52 cases), while IOL falling into the vitreous cavity was seen in 46 cases, aphakic eye in 31 cases, and anterior lens dislocation in 16 cases. In general, IOP was significantly lower at one month postoperatively than preoperatively. Specifically, in the trauma, PEX, and unknown causes groups, as well as the groups with anterior lens deviation, IOL fell into the vitreous cavity, and with IOL downward deviation, IOP was significantly lower. Conclusion IOP was significantly lower one month postoperatively than preoperatively after IOL intrascleral fixation. Patients who underwent IOL intrascleral fixation surgery were most commonly found to have long eye axis, PEX, and intraoperative problems. Downward deviation of the IOL or IOL falling into the vitreous cavity was most common. IOP was significantly lower one month postoperatively than preoperatively after IOL intrascleral fixation."

This is a retrospective cohort study using the PearlDiver Mariner Database. Records were queried between 2010 and 2021 with a diagnosis of JHS, including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and Marfan syndrome. Propensity matching was performed with a randomly generated control cohort without a diagnosis of JHS to account for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, diabetes, and obesity. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare rates of patellar dislocation over a 1- and 2-year period between the 2 cohorts while controlling for previous knee injury or surgery. Patients who sustained a patellar dislocation over the 2-year period were followed to calculate rates of surgical intervention and subsequent revision. In a population of 91,747, those with JHS experienced patellofemoral instability at a significantly increased rate at both a 1-year (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 11.40; 95% confidence interval 9.23-14.25, <i>P</i> < .001) and 2-year (aOR 8.73; 7.36-10.44, <i>P</i> < .001) periods.

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome is an inherited connective tissue disorder that affects the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and ocular systems. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the fibrillin-1 gene (<i>FBN1</i>). Fibrillin is a primary component of microfibrils, which are found throughout the extracellular matrix (ECM) and provide elasticity and resilience to connective tissue. Microfibrils also play a role in signaling by sequestering growth factors and interacting with cell surface receptors. In many tissues, microfibrils are interwoven with elastin, collagens, and other elements of the ECM. However, uniquely in the ciliary zonule of the eye, microfibrils exist in cell-free bundles largely devoid of other components. This structure offers a rare opportunity to study a pure population of fibrillin microfibrils in a relatively native state. Here, we briefly review the organization of the zonule and describe recent experiments in which we measure zonular biomechanics, providing insights into microfibril dynamics that would be challenging to obtain in other contexts."

Zonulopathies refer to conditions in which there is a lack or disruption of zonular support to the lens and may clinically be manifested as ectopia lens (EL)-defined as subluxation of the lens outside of the pupillary plane or frank displacement (dislocation) into the vitreous or anterior segment. Genes implicated in EL include those intimately involved in the formation and function of these glycoproteins as well as other genes involved in the extracellular matrix (ECM). As such, genetic pathogenic variants causing EL are primarily disorders of the ECM, causing zonular weakness by (1) directly affecting the protein components of the zonule, (2) affecting proteins involved in the regulation of zonular formation and (3) causing the dysregulation of ECM components leading to progressive zonular weakness. Herein, we discuss the clinical manifestations of zonulopathy and the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the prevalence and underlying factors of fatigue in individuals with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (hEDS), highlighting the necessity for focused research on this symptom within these patient populations. Cross-sectional, multicentre study. Data were collected from participants diagnosed with MFS or hEDS across multiple healthcare centres. The study enrolled 282 participants (127 with MFS and 155 with hEDS). Fatigue was measured using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Additional assessments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) for sleep disturbances. Participants with hEDS exhibited significantly higher median fatigue scores (FSS median=5.9, IQR=5.00-6.44) compared with the MFS group (FSS median=4.0, IQR=2.88-5.00). Significant predictors of fatigue included being female, having hEDS, participating in psychotherapy, and elevated scores on depression and insomnia scales. In the overall sample, hEDS significantly predicted fatigue (B=0.430, p=0.022), with depression and insomnia as strong influencers (PHQ-9: B=0.12, p<0.001; ISI: B=0.092, p<0.001). Notably, 80% of the hEDS group reported clinically relevant fatigue levels, compared with 31.5% in the MFS group. Daily persistence of fatigue was especially pronounced in hEDS, with 72.2% reporting everyday fatigue versus 25.2% in MFS. Temporal fatigue patterns also differed, with a more evenly distributed pattern throughout the day in hEDS, correlating with higher insomnia scores. The results underscore the severe impact of fatigue on individuals with hEDS compared with those with MFS, suggesting the need for targeted, multidisciplinary management strategies to enhance quality of life.

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting the connective tissue, often leading to aortic root dilation, aneurysm, and dissection. We report on a 35-year-old Bangladeshi female patient with MFS who presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and a significant aortic root aneurysm, along with a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 20%-25%. Imaging confirmed significant aortic dilation, and due to the high risk of mortality, an urgent Bentall procedure was performed. Postoperatively, the patient had an EF of 25% and was doing well at discharge. Timely Bentall procedure in MFS with severe aortic root dilation and reduced EF is critical for improving outcomes and reducing morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "In 2015, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) developed standardized variant curation guidelines for Mendelian disorders. Although these guidelines have been widely adopted, they are not gene- or disease-specific. To mitigate classification discrepancies, the Clinical Genome Resource FBN1 variant curation expert panel (VCEP) was established in 2018 to develop adaptations to the ACMG/AMP criteria for FBN1 in association with Marfan syndrome. The specific recommendations were developed through literature review, surveys, online expert panel discussions, and pilot testing of a set of 60 different variants. Consensus among experts was considered reached if at least 75% of the members agreed with a given rule specification. The final set of rules received approval from the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation Working Group. The developed specifications introduce modifications to 14 of the 28 ACMG/AMP evidence criteria and deem 6 criteria non-applicable. Some of these specifications include refining the minor allele frequency thresholds, creating a FBN1-specific flowchart for PVS1, defining functional domains of the protein, developing a point-based system of counting probands and instances of de novo occurrences, recommending a points-based method of accounting for family segregation data, and clarifying the applicable functional assays that should be considered. To date, this VCEP has curated 120 variants which have been deposited to ClinVar with the 3-star review status. Establishing specific adaptations for FBN1 has provided a framework to foster greater classification concordance among clinical laboratories, ultimately improving clinical care for patients with Marfan syndrome."

    "abstract": "Introduction and objectives The Bentall procedure is a surgical technique designed to address aortic root abnormalities, including issues with the aortic valve, aortic root, and ascending aortic disease. This study aimed to assess the short-term outcomes of 39 patients who underwent the Bentall and concomitant procedures: aortic root enlargement, personalized external aortic root support (PEARS), and Mini-Bentall procedures at a single center. Methodology We conducted a retrospective study involving 39 patients who underwent surgery for aortic root pathologies such as dissection, Marfan syndrome (MFS), bicuspid aortic valve, degenerative disease, and atherosclerosis at our hospital between January 2019 and September 2024. Data were collected from clinical records and were utilized for statistical analysis. Results In this study of 39 patients (average age 43.97 ± 17.45 years; 71.8% male), hypertension was the most common risk factor (46.2%). The early mortality rate was 2.6%, with one death from bleeding. Dissection and MFS were the leading causes of aortic root pathologies (35.9% each). Coexisting heart diseases were found in 20.5% of patients. Emergency and urgent surgeries accounted for 38.5% and 53.8%, respectively. Bentall surgery was performed in 64.4% of cases, with average cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cross-clamp times of 196.10 ± 25.23 and 169.05 ± 23.9 minutes, respectively. Conclusion Overall, the hospital mortality rate for the Bentall procedure at our institution was 2.6%, consistent with the reported literature. Our results show that, although complex, the classic Bentall technique can be performed safely with acceptable short-term morbidity and mortality. Addressing complications like hospital mortality and postoperative bleeding is crucial, as these issues may be preventable."

We sought to determine whether individuals with an underlying vascular connective tissue disorder including Marfan syndrome (MFS), Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), or vascular Ehlers Danlos syndrome (vEDS) are at increased risk for cardiac events after COVID-19 infection or vaccination. 325 respondents self-reported data through a cross-sectional, web-based survey available from 22 November 2021, through 15 March 2022 regarding COVID-19 illness and vaccinations, the occurrence of any CVE, and adverse events following vaccination. The data were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model with time varying indicators for COVID-19 illness/vaccination in the preceding 30 days. COVID-19 illness was significantly associated with an increased rate of a new abnormal heart rhythm 30 days following infection. No other CVEs were reported in the 90 days after COVID-19 illness. We did not find evidence of an increased rate of any CVE in the 30 days following any COVID-19 vaccination dose. In respondents with MFS, LDS, or vEDS, we uncovered no evidence of an increase in CVEs in the 30 days following COVID-19 illness, with the possible exception of dysrhythmia. In light of the absence of a substantial increase in self-reported CVEs in the 30 days following COVID-19 vaccination, these data are in keeping with the recommendation from the Marfan Foundation Professional Advisory Board that all eligible persons be vaccinated for COVID-19."

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of cardiac and neural crest origin contribute to the developing proximal aorta and are linked to disease propensity in adults. We analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of aortic SMCs from adult mice to determine basal states and changes after disrupting TGFβ (transforming growth factor-β) signaling necessary for aortic homeostasis. A minority of Myh11 lineage-marked SMCs differentially expressed genes suggestive of embryological origin. Additional analyses in Nkx2-5 and Wnt1 lineage-marked SMCs derived from cardiac and neural crest progenitors, respectively, showed both lineages contributed to a major common cluster and each lineage to a minor distinct cluster. Common cluster SMCs extended from root to arch, cardiac subset cluster SMCs from root to ascending, and neural crest subset cluster SMCs were restricted to the arch. The neural crest subset cluster had greater expression of a subgroup of TGFβ-dependent genes. Nonetheless, conditional deletion of TGFβ receptors resulted in similar transcriptional changes among all SMC clusters. Several disease-associated transcriptional responses were comparable among SMC clusters in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome aortopathy, while many embryological markers of murine aortic SMCs were not detected in adult human aortas. There are multiple subtypes of cardiac-derived and neural crest-derived SMCs with shared or distinctive transcriptional profiles; neural crest subset cluster SMCs with increased expression of certain TGFβ-inducible genes are not spatially linked to the aortic root predisposed to aneurysms from aberrant TGFβ signaling; and loss of TGFβ responses after receptor deletion is uniform among SMC clusters."

Although MFS is the most common type of HTAD caused by mutations in <i>FBN1</i>, differentiation from other conditions such as LDS is crucial due to the varying clinical courses. We report the case of a family history of early-onset ascending aortic dissection initially diagnosed as MFS based on a pathogenic variant of <i>FBN1</i>. However, comprehensive genetic testing using next-generation sequencing and array-comparative genomic hybridization revealed a copy number variation (a large deletion) in <i>SMAD3</i>, resulting in a diagnosis of the coexistence of MFS and LDS. These results significantly altered the screening and follow-up strategies. This case highlights the importance of comprehensive genetic testing, not only for assessing single nucleotide polymorphisms but also for evaluating copy number variations to ensure accurate differentiation and management of HTAD."

    "abstract": "Ovarian hemorrhage during antithrombotic therapy is sometimes difficult to manage. A 38-year-old woman, diagnosed with Marfan syndrome and implanted with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and taking aspirin and warfarin potassium, had a history of right adnexal oophorectomy via open surgery for a right ovarian hemorrhage at the age of 35 years. Thereafer, she had been treated with dienogest to suppress ovulation as much as possible. The patient was admitted to a local hospital with lower abdominal pain, and computed tomography showed a 10 cm left adnexal mass with suspected ovarian hemorrhage. Two days after the initiation of careful conservative treatment, with the cessation of antithrombotic therapy and monitoring of hemostasis, the patient was referred to a tertiary hospital. As the left ovarian hemorrhage continued 3 days after the transfer, emergency laparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed due to the difficulty in conserving the left normal ovary. Although coagulopathy caused continuous oozing of blood from the pelvis after the removal of the left ovarian mass, hemostasis was successfully achieved laparoscopically. No postoperative bleeding was noted, and anticoagulant therapy was resumed on postoperative day 1 to prevent life-threatening thrombotic events associated with the LVAD. Postoperative pathological examination of the left ovary revealed an endometriotic cyst. To manage surgical menopause, complementary therapy using Japanese traditional herbal medicine was administered, as hormone replacement therapy was not recommended, to avoid the risk of fatal LVAD-associated thrombosis. Less invasive laparoscopic surgery for ovarian hemorrhage during anticoagulant therapy can be considered for reducing bleeding during and after surgery."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a systemic connective tissue disorder stemming from mutations in the gene encoding Fibrillin-1 (Fbn1), a key extracellular matrix glycoprotein. This condition manifests with various clinical features, the most critical of which is the formation of aortic root aneurysms. Reduced nitric oxide (NO) production due to diminished endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity has been linked to MFS aortic aneurysm pathology. Caveolin-1 (Cav1), a structural protein of plasma membrane caveolae, is known to inhibit eNOS activity, suggesting its involvement in MFS aneurysm progression by modulating NO levels. In this study, we examined the role of Cav1 in aortic smooth muscle and endothelial function, aortic wall elasticity, and wall strength in male and female MFS mice (<i>FBN1<sup>+/Cys1041Gly</sup></i>) by generating developing Cav1-deficient MFS mice (MFS/<i>Cav1</i>KO). Our findings reveal that <i>Cav1</i> ablation leads to a pronounced reduction in aortic smooth muscle contraction in response to phenylephrine, attributable to an increase in NO production in the aortic wall. Furthermore, we observed enhanced aortic relaxation responses to acetylcholine in MFS/<i>Cav1</i>KO mice, further underscoring Cav1's inhibitory impact on NO synthesis within the aorta. Notably, van Gieson staining and chamber myography analyses showed improved elastin fiber structure and wall strength in male MFS/<i>Cav1KO</i> mice, whereas these effects were absent in female counterparts.

Intervention is often recommended, but conservative management has been advocated in selected cases. We performed a systematic review of the literature through MedLine and Cochrane databases over the last 24 years to identify reported cases of RTAD managed conservatively. Primary endpoint was the overall and aortic-related mortality, the morbidity, and the need for intervention during follow-up. The underlining causes and indications for conservative management were also investigated. (Protocol on Prospero Centre for Reviews and Dissemination RD42024542966). A total of 2,305 papers were identified, and 10 articles were included (20 cases). The reasons for conservative treatment were age (n = 8.40%) and/or haemodynamic stability(n = 16,80%) and/or unfitness for surgery(n = 12,60%). The causes of RTAD were fragile aortic wall in acute type B aortic dissection (TBAD) (n = 10, 50%), Marfan syndrome (n = 2, 10%), use of stents with proximal barbs or bare springs (n = 5, 25%), diameter of the ascending aorta>40 mm (n = 2, 10%), and intraoperative type IA endoleak (n = 2, 10%). Three patients (15%) were lost to follow-up immediately after discharge; one (5%) died in hospital from aortic rupture. At a mean follow-up of 33.5 months (range 9-60), the overall survival was 88.2% (n = 15/17) and aortic-related mortality was 10% (n = 2/20). No complications or interventions during the follow-up period were reported. The mortality rate following RTAD is high, and surgery allows improvement in survival. Conservative management might represent a viable option for selected patients. However, the current evidence is poor and needs to be validated by further and more robust data before such a strategy could be suggested more widely."

This was a prospective analysis of 13 pectus excavatum patients undergoing repair by modified Ravitch using a permanent titanium plate fixed with a screw from September 2021 to August 2023. Patients were included to relieve pressure on the heart and lungs if complaining of exercise intolerance, cosmetic impairment, shortness of breathing, chest pain, or psychological disturbance with an age range from 10 years to 30 years old. While patients who had received conservative or surgical treatment previously or patients with scoliosis, Marfan syndrome or bronchial asthma were excluded. At the 6-month postoperative visit, a postoperative satisfaction survey was conducted. The means of the age of patients (16.4 ± 2.36 years); operative duration (120 minutes); blood loss (200± 15.47 mL) and Haller index was (3.8± 0.35) preoperatively compared with less than 3.0 (2.7± 0.08 postoperatively; hospital stay (7 days).

No recorded infection of the sternal plate or required operative re-exploration for infection. All patients were subjectively satisfied with the excellent surgical results. Exercise intolerance despite increased exercise performance was observed following surgery, including less sensation of dyspnea. Modified Ravitch-type repair is a secure and reliable method for treating pectus excavatum with better relief of preoperative symptoms."

Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. Retrospective cohort study. The formula-specific ELP was obtained from the SRK/T, T2, Holladay 1, and HofferQ formulas. The back-calculated ELP was obtained based on the vergence formula using preoperative biometry, postoperative refraction, and IOL power. The generalized linear models (GLMs) or gradient boosting machines were used to predict ELP or ELP error. 255 patients (255 eyes) were assigned randomly into a training set and a validation set (7:3 ratio). Linear correlation identified axial length (AL), corneal height, and white-to-white distance as predictors of ELP and ELP error for patients with shorter AL (AL ≤24 mm). For those with longer AL (AL >24 mm), AL and the central corneal radius were identified as the primary predictors. Incorporating these predictors into the modified ELP formula significantly improved the accuracy in the validation set, including SRK/T, T2, Haigis, Holladay 1, and HofferQ formulas. The improvement was more pronounced in patients with shorter AL. In addition, the GLM-modified formulas outperformed both the Barrett Universal II and Kane formulas. The accuracy across different ocular dimensions was comparable among the modified formulas, based on which an online calculator was developed. Using the more accurately predicted ELP can significantly improve the accuracy of existing formulas in patients with MFS."

Many patients remain undiagnosed years after initial symptoms and an accurate diagnosis is difficult despite all efforts. Currently, Germany lacks a patient registry and a specialized EDS centre. In early 2020, a dermatological-orthopaedic EDS outpatient service was established at the University Hospital of Cologne.

    "abstract": "Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome is a rare systemic connective tissue disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the Sloan-Kettering Institute (SKI) gene. The clinical presentation is reminiscent of Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes, making differential diagnosis challenging. Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome's distinctive features are craniosynostosis and learning disabilities. The pathophysiology of these three conditions is similar as they all result in the deregulation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway and thus an altered expression of TGF-β responsive genes. We report a family of two patients: one with initial suspicion of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and the second with suspicion of Marfan syndrome, as the Marfan systemic score was positive and no craniosynostosis or learning disabilities were described. They were diagnosed with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome after a heterozygous probably pathogenic variant in the second mutational hotspot of SKI Dachshund homology domain was identified. We reviewed the genotype-phenotype correlation among the three mutational hotspots in SKI: the amino acids 20 to 35 of the receptor-regulated small mothers against decapentaplegic domain (group 1, n = 32), amino acids 94 to 117 of Dachshund homology domain (group 2, n = 12), and threonine 180 of Dachshund homology domain (group 3, n = 11 including our patients). As the main differential diagnoses of Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome are Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes, we completed the comparison already made by Loeys and Dietz. (2008) of Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome clinical features among the different mutational hotspots with Marfan syndrome and the different types of Loeys-Dietz syndrome. In addition to the already described absence of learning disabilities in Shprintzen-Goldberg patients with a pathogenic variant in the threonine 180 of Dachshund homology domain, facial features also appeared to be less severe. The clinical overlap with Marfan and Loeys-Dietz patients requires genetic testing in order to establish an accurate molecular diagnosis at the variant level, and to adapt genetic counseling and clinical management."

The cardiovascular manifestations of ADPKD include hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and valvular heart disease, predominantly mitral valve abnormalities. We present the case of a 30-year-old male with a past medical history of ADPKD who was admitted to the emergency department due to sudden chest pain and signs of congestive heart failure for weeks. Echocardiography in the emergency department showed lateral wall hypokinesis and severe mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography revealed a small collateral branch occlusion unsuitable for revascularization. On the first day of hospitalization, the patient developed an acute ischemia of the left lower limb, for which he underwent revascularization surgery. After the thrombectomy, the patient presented with fever, for which prophylactic antibiotics were started while awaiting investigation into surgical and cystic complications, such as infection, which were ruled out. Once stabilized, a second transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed the severe mitral regurgitation and prolapse due to posterior mitral valve flail, suggesting long-term primary mitral valve disease as the underlying mechanism for regurgitation. The patient underwent surgical mitral valve repair, which was complicated by suture dehiscence. The severe mitral valve regurgitation was attributed to ADPKD, given the patient's family history, age, and typical cardiovascular findings and multiple renal and hepatic cysts observed. Further investigation into primary mitral valve disorders, such as soft connective tissue diseases like Marfan syndrome, was not deemed necessary."

    "abstract": "Open surgery is the gold standard for patients a connective tissue disorder (CTD). Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is used in emergencies and patient-specific situations. Limited data on durability of TEVAR in patients with CTD exist. The purpose of this study was to investigate the durability, complications, and outcomes of TEVAR in patients with CTD. This single-center retrospective study included 40 patients with CTD who underwent TEVAR for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection from February 2014 to April 2021. CTDs included Marfan syndrome, Loey-Dietz syndrome, and nonspecific CTD-related diagnoses. Primary outcomes included aortic-related morbidities, time to and type of postoperative reinterventions, and time to open/hybrid conversion. Time to conversion and reintervention was calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimation. Predictors of reintervention and open/hybrid conversion were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. The median age was 53 years with 52.5% of the patients being female. Marfan syndrome was diagnosed in 57.5%, Loey-Dietz syndrome in 2.5%, and 40% had a diagnosed nonspecific or other CTD. Thirty-two (80%) had prior aortic interventions. Thoracic aneurysm existed in 52.5% and dissection in 82.5%. The average maximum thoracic aortic diameter was 55.2 mm. There were two mortalities within the first month. Of the remaining 38 patients, 71.1% had aneurysm-related morbidities, including 81.5% with aneurysmal degeneration and 33.3% with endoleak. Overall, 62.5% required reintervention. Of those, median time to reintervention was 9.1 months, including redo-TEVAR/extension in 32%, ascending/arch repair in 24%, open thoracoabdominal aortic repair in 56%, and false lumen embolization in 16%. Open conversions and reintervention were most likely to occur within the first year, with freedom of open conversion of 67.2% at 1 year, and 59.7% at 2 and 3 years, and freedom of reintervention of 49.8%, 36.0%, and 30.0% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. This study suggests that TEVAR for patients with CTD can be performed safely; however, patients are at high risk for aortic-related morbidities and reintervention. Reinterventions and open conversion are common and more likely to occur within 1 year. TEVAR should remain limited in this population until more durable outcomes are possible."

    "title": "Contribution of Sex Steroids in Management of Tall Stature: Is It Effective or Not?",
    "abstract": "Reduction in adult height by high-dose sex steroids was introduced decades ago. Here, we present the impact of lower doses of sex steroids on the predicted adult height (PAH) in children with tall stature. This single-center retrospective observational study included 22 tall children treated with low-dose sex steroids. Patients with familial tall stature, constitutional advance of growth, or Marfan syndrome were included. Anthropometric measurements at the commencement of treatment, six-monthly intervals on treatment, cessation of treatment, and at final assessment, were evaluated. Bone age (BA) determination, and PAH were made using both the tables of Bayley-Pinneau (BP) and Tanner-Whitehouse (TW) mark II methods. The final height was significantly lower than the predicted height in girls whereas it was not significantly lower than predicted height in boys. In patients with Marfan syndrome, the final height was only lower than the prediction of TW rather than BP. Non-Marfan cases had significantly lower final height than both the predicted heights. Conversely, although there was a decrease in height SDS over time, this difference was not statistically significant in the study cohort. Starting treatment at early BA (<10 years) did not affect the last height SDS or the difference between predicted height and final height. Sex difference, sex steroid dosage, differences in treatment duration and differences in BA measurement method, PAH method, BA and chronological age at the start of treatment may all influence the therapy response. Shortcomings about these influences can be overcome in future prospective studies with a larger sample size."

    "title": "Fibrillin-1 G234D mutation in the hybrid1 domain causes tight skin associated with dysregulated elastogenesis and increased collagen cross-linking in mice.",
    "abstract": "Fibrillin-1, an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein encoded by the FBN1 gene, serves as a microfibril scaffold crucial for elastic fiber formation and homeostasis in pliable tissue such as the skin. Aside from causing Marfan syndrome, some mutations in FBN1 result in scleroderma, marked by hardened and thicker skin which limits joint mobility. Here, we describe a tight skin phenotype in the Fbn1<sup>G234D/G234D</sup> mice carrying a corresponding variant of FBN1 in the hybrid1 domain that was identified in a patient with familial aortic dissection. Unlike scleroderma, skin thickness and collagen fiber abundance do not change in the Fbn1<sup>G234D/G234D</sup> mutant skin. Instead, increased collagen cross-links were observed. In addition, short elastic fibers were sparsely located underneath the panniculus muscle layer, and an abundance of thin, aberrant elastic fibers was increased within the subcutaneous fascia, which may have tightened skin attachment to the underlying skeletal muscle. Structurally, Fbn1<sup>G234D/G234D</sup> microfibrils have a disrupted shoulder region that shares similarities with hybrid1 deletion mutant microfibrils. We then demonstrate the consequence of fibrillin-1 G234D mutation on dermal fibroblast functions. Mutant primary fibroblasts produce fewer elastic fibers, exhibit slower migration and increased cell stiffness. Moreover, secretome from mutant fibroblasts are marked by enhanced secretion of ECM, ECM-modifying enzymes, proteoglycans and cytokines, which are pro-tissue repair/fibrogenic. The transcriptome of mutant fibroblasts displays an increased expression of myogenic developmental and immune-related genes. Our study proposes that imbalanced ECM homeostasis due to a fibrillin-1 G234D mutation impacts fibroblast properties with potential ramifications on skin function."

Symptoms include dysmorphic features, skeletal and cardiovascular comorbidities, and cognitive and developmental impairments. We delineated the neurodevelopmental and behavioral features of SGS, as they are not well-documented. We collected physician-reported data of people with molecularly confirmed SGS through an international collaboration. We identified and deep-phenotyped the neurodevelopmental and behavioral features in four patients. Within our cohort, all exhibited developmental delays in motor skills and/or speech, with the average age of first words at 2 years and 6 months and independent walking at 3 years and 5 months. All four had learning disabilities and difficulties regulating emotions and behavior. Intellectual disability, ranging from borderline to moderate, was present in all four participants. Moreover, we reviewed the literature and identified 52 additional people with SGS, and summarized the features across both datasets. Mean age was 23 years (9-48 years). When combining our cohort and reported cases, we found that 80% (45/56) had developmental and/or cognitive impairment, with the remainder having normal intelligence. Our study elucidates the developmental, cognitive, and behavioral features in participants with SGS and contributes to a better understanding of this rare condition."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective-tissue disorder affecting multiple systems, such as skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular systems. MFS is predominantly caused by mutations in the <i>FBN1</i> gene, which encodes the fibrillin-1 protein, crucial for connective-tissue integrity. <i>FBN1</i> mutations lead to defective fibrillin, resulting in structurally compromised connective tissues. Additionally, these mutations cause aberrant TGF-β expression, contributing to vascular issues and increased susceptibility to radiation-induced fibrosis. Studies about the potential radiosensitivity of MFS are rare and generally limited to case reports. Here, we aimed to investigate the radiation-induced ATM nucleo-shuttling (RIANS) model to explore the molecular and cellular radiation response in fibroblasts from MFS patients. The results showed that the MFS fibroblast cell lines tested are associated with moderate but significant radiosensitivity, high yield of micronuclei, and impaired recognition of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) caused by a diminished RIANS. The diminished RIANS is supported by the sequestration of ATM protein in the cytoplasm not only by mutated FBN1 protein but also by overexpressed TGF-β. This report is the first molecular and cellular characterization of the radiation response of MFS fibroblasts and highlights the importance of the FBN1-TGF-β complex after irradiation."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a rare and frequently misdiagnosed disorder characterized by a low volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) caused by the leakage of CSF through the spinal dural membrane. Patients with Marfan Syndrome (MS) and other connective tissue disorders are at an increased risk for dural ectasia, which may predispose them to spontaneous CSF leaks due to the structural weakness of their dural membranes. The management of SIH in MS patients is debated. Conservative measures, an epidural blood patch (EBP), and surgical treatments are the options generally provided. Herein, we report on the case of a 52-year-old female affected by MS, genetically confirmed, with a two-month history of sudden-onset, \"thunderclap\" headache, worsened in an upright position and horizontal diplopia. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed a bilateral chronic subdural hematoma, slit ventricles, and a caudal descent of the brainstem without overt tonsillar herniation. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the whole spine revealed dural ectasia in the lumbosacral area and presacral perineural cyst without extradural CSF collection. The case was successfully managed with bed rest and high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Then, we discuss the pertinent literature, consisting of 25 papers dealing with the treatment of SIH in patients affected by MS. The literature review yielded 25 papers dealing with SIH management in patients with MS, including 28 patients overall; 21 patients underwent EBP, of whom 7 patients had multiple procedures. Overall, in 23 cases (82%), the symptoms improved. In three cases, the patients were managed conservatively with bed rest. In three of these cases, there was an improvement. In one case, the surgical fenestration of two lumbar intradural spinal meningeal cysts was performed and the patient improved after the procedure. Our patient underwent 15 days of steroid therapy (dexamethasone iv 12 mg/day for 7 days, then reduced to 4 mg/day) and intravenous hydration (Ringer lactate 1500 mL/day). In ten days, the symptoms disappeared. At the 6-month follow-up, the patient was in good clinical condition, and a CT scan showed an almost complete regression of the bilateral subdural hematoma. The management of SIH in MS patients is still challenging. Patients with connective tissue disorders such as MS are at an increased risk for SIH. Few studies have assessed the management of these patients and different strategies. Our case and the available literature provide further data for this type of case."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a hereditary disorder primarily caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene. Its critical cardiovascular manifestation is thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), which poses life-threatening risks. Owing to the lack of effective pharmacological therapies, surgical intervention continues to be the current definitive treatment. In this study, the role of Piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 (Piezo1) in MFS was investigated and the activation of PIEZO1 was identified as a potential treatment for MFS. PIEZO1 expression was detected in MFS mice (Fbn1C1041G/+) and patients. Piezo1 conditional knockout mice in vascular smooth muscle cells of MFS mice (MFS × CKO) was generated, and bioinformatics analysis and experiments in vitro and in vivo were performed to investigate the role of Piezo1 in MFS. PIEZO1 expression decreased in the aortas of MFS mice; MFS × CKO mice showed aggravated TAA, inflammation, extracellular matrix remodelling, and TGF-β pathway activation compared to MFS mice. Mechanistically, PIEZO1 knockout exacerbated the activation of the TGF-β signalling pathway by inhibiting the endocytosis and autophagy of TGF-β receptor 2 mediated by Rab GTPase 3C. Additionally, the pharmacological activation PIEZO1 through Yoda1 prevented TGF-β signalling pathway activation and reversed TAA in MFS mice. Piezo1 deficiency aggravates MFS aneurysms by promoting TGF-β signalling pathway activation via TGF-β receptor 2 endocytosis and a decrease in autophagy. These data suggest that PIEZO1 may be a potential therapeutic target for MFS treatment."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a well-characterized rare genetic connective tissue disorder. The features of MFS are primarily skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular and are mainly caused by single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the FBN1 gene (MIM#134797) located on chromosome 15q21.1. We describe two patients, a 26-year-old male and a 10-year-old female from unrelated distinct families, with clinically diagnosed sporadic MFS. After years of unsuccessful molecular diagnosis for genetic counseling purposes, genome sequencing was performed and revealed a balanced translocation in both patients: de novo t(9;15)(p13.3;q21.1) translocation in the male patient, and de novo t(15;16)(q21.1;p13.13) translocation in the female patient, respectively, disrupting intron 40 and 45 of FBN1. The other breakpoints were not clinically relevant. These translocations were confirmed by specific fluorescence in situ hybridization probes and conventional karyotyping. In the literature, only one family has been described, leading to four cases of MFS caused by balanced translocations. Genetic counseling for balanced translocations differs from SNVs and even interstitial deletions since it is not restricted to MFS recurrence, but also involves the risk of unbalanced gametes, leading to miscarriage or unbalanced progeny. In case of clinical certainty, MFS patients should be screened for balanced translocations to ensure appropriate genetic counseling."

    "abstract": "Larsen's syndrome is an exceedingly rare and debilitating skeletal disorder characterized by multiple bony deformities and joint contractures. A 47-year-old female grappled with its severe manifestations, including functional quadriplegia, limb atrophy, and various orthopedic surgeries. This is the only reported case of the concurrent presence of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLA) and Larsen's syndrome. While Larsen's syndrome's genetic underpinnings are known to involve filamin B (FLNB) gene mutations, this patient's distinct presentation and complex clinical history added layers of intrigue. Intriguingly, APLA predisposes individuals to thrombotic events, but the patient's manifestation with rectal bleeding with normal coagulation parameters introduced an unexpected twist. Despite the absence of clear causative links, this case highlights the rarity of encountering Larsen's syndrome and APLA concurrently. Their potential interactions and mutual influence remain largely unexplored, underscoring the need for more research in this domain. Intricacies also emerged in the management of APLA within a surgical context. The decision to transition between anticoagulants underscores the necessity of individualized and comprehensive care for patients grappling with multiple comorbidities. It raises questions about the potential overlap between Larsen's syndrome and connective tissue diseases, like Marfan's syndrome, that warrant further exploration. The case also emphasizes the significance of increased patient mobilization to prevent thrombotic events in those who are bedridden or wheelchair-bound. This extremely unique presentation, featuring a genetic skeletal disorder, an autoimmune condition, recurrent diaphragmatic hernias, and a colon polyp-induced hemorrhage, beckons further research and analysis to unravel any potential associations between these conditions."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic yield of a specialized clinic for children with suspicion of a hereditary thoracic aortic disease (HTAD), including Marfan Syndrome (MFS), and to investigate the diagnostic value of presenting symptoms and findings during evaluation. This retrospective observational study included all patients younger than 18 years old at initial referral between 1998 and 2018. Clinical data, medical treatment, surgical interventions, and clinical events during surveillance were collected until December 2023. A case-control comparison between patients with and without an eventual diagnosis of HTAD was performed using logistic regression analysis to investigate the diagnostic value of collected variables. A total of 355 children were referred and evaluated at the clinic, resulting in 89 new diagnoses, with a diagnostic yield of 21% HTAD, including 59 cases of MFS. Younger age at referral, ectopia lentis, aortic dilatation, and facial features were among the strongest predictors of MFS and other HTAD, while pectus excavatum and arm span-height ratio had no predictive value at childhood age. Of patients with MFS, 65% received antihypertensive medication, and 8% of patients with HTAD underwent prophylactic aortic surgery, in some cases even during childhood. Conclusion: Evaluation of children for HTAD in our specialized Marfan clinic resulted in a high diagnostic yield and subsequent therapeutic implications. Indeed, early recognition of symptoms and signs and referral to such a specialized clinic may lead to early diagnosis, surveillance, and timely treatment, thereby possibly limiting acute aortic events and even mortality."

Studies assessing myocardial fibrosis in relation to these manifestations are scarce. This cross-sectional, single-center study assessed ventricular volumes, ventricular function, and myocardial fibrosis by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in patients with MFS harboring a (likely) pathogenic FBN1 variant. The presence and extent of fibrosis were assessed by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and extracellular volume measurement (ECV). Data on 24-h Holter monitoring and clinical data were extracted from electronic patient records. The study included 32 unselected patients with MFS (median age 38 years [range 10-69], 41% women). No focal myocardial fibrosis was detected. Six patients (21%) had diffuse fibrosis (ECV > 29%). No association was found between the presence of diffuse fibrosis and clinically relevant myocardial dysfunction. Five patients (16%) had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 55%). While all of these exhibited mitral annular disjunction (MAD), only two had ECV > 29%. Patients with MAD had increased indexed LV volumes (median end-diastolic volume, 92 mL/m<sup>2</sup> [IQR, 78-100] vs. 78 mL/m<sup>2</sup> [IQR, 71-87]; median end-systolic volume, 31 mL/m<sup>2</sup> [IQR, 23-46] vs. 22 mL/m<sup>2</sup> [IQR, 21-28]), also after adjusting for the presence of mitral and aortic valve regurgitation. No differences in ECV were seen between patients with and without MAD. In this cohort of patients with MFS, focal myocardial fibrosis was not detected using CMR. Although diffuse fibrosis was observed in 21% of patients, no evident connection to clinically relevant myocardial dysfunction was found. Further studies should evaluate the impact of diffuse fibrosis on clinical outcome prediction."

    "abstract": "An elevated risk of acute type B aortic dissection exists in patients with Marfan syndrome after the David procedure. This study explores hemodynamic changes in the descending aorta postsurgery. A single-center retrospective review identified 5 patients with Marfan syndrome who experienced acute type B aortic dissection within 6 years after the David procedure, alongside 5 matched patients with Marfan syndrome without dissection more than 6 years postsurgery. Baseline and postoperative computed tomography and magnetic resonance scans were analyzed for aortic geometry reconstruction. Computational fluid dynamic simulations evaluated preoperative and postoperative hemodynamics. Patients with acute type B aortic dissection showed lower blood flow velocities, increased vortices, and altered velocity profiles in the proximal descending aorta compared with controls. Preoperatively, median time-averaged wall shear stress in the descending aorta was lower in patients with acute type B aortic dissection (control: 1.76 [1.50-2.83] Pa, dissection: 1.16 [1.06-1.30] Pa, <i>P</i> = .047). Postsurgery, neither group had significant time-averaged wall shear stress changes (dissection: <i>P</i> = .69, control: <i>P</i> = .53). Localized analysis revealed surgery-induced time-averaged wall shear stress increases near the subclavian artery in the dissection group (range, +0.30 to +1.05 Pa, each comparison, <i>P</i> < .05). No such changes were observed in controls. Oscillatory shear index and relative residence time were higher in patients with acute type B aortic dissection before and after surgery versus controls. Hemodynamics likely play a role in post-David procedure acute type B aortic dissection. Further investigation into aortic geometry, hemodynamics, and postoperative acute type B aortic dissection is vital for enhancing outcomes and refining surgical strategies in patients with Marfan syndrome."

    "abstract": "Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) type 4 is a rare connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the transforming growth factor β 2 gene. It is well-documented that LDS4 shares clinical features of Marfan syndrome (MFS), and vascular involvement is less significant compared to other types of LDS. However, information on the valvular characteristics is scarce due to the small number of reported cases. This case series presents five cases with LDS4, highlighting their cardiovascular manifestations. Multiple valve anomalies without aortic dilatation were manifested in three, whereas there was aortic arch dilatation without any valve involvement in two cases. We found missense mutations in the former two families and a frameshift mutation in transforming growth factor β 2 in the latter family. In LDS4, echocardiographic findings of the unique valve redundancy in multiple valves can be a key to diagnosing LDS4 if any Marfanoid features are suspected clinically, even without aortic dilatation found. Our cases suggest there may be a genotype-phenotype correlation in LDS4. Clinical features of Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) type 4 are generally milder than other types of LDS and known to manifest less vascular involvement and relatively more valvular diseases. If Marfanoid features are suspected, genetic testing should be offered for arrangements of the surgical timing and screening of family members. Echocardiographic assessment of cardiac valves in those patients can be a key to a successful diagnosis. Our cases suggest these types of variants may be related to phenotypes."

    "abstract": "Syndromic heritable thoracic aortic diseases (sHTAD), such as Marfan (MFS) or Loeys-Dietz (LDS) syndromes, involve high risk of life threatening aortic events. Diagnosis of syndromic features alone is difficult, and negative genetic tests do not necessarily exclude a genetic or hereditary condition. Periodic 3D imaging of the aorta is recommended in patients with aortic disease. Thus, an imaging-based approach aimed at identifying unique features of aortic geometry can be highly effective for diagnosing sHTAD and assessing risk. In this study, we present a method that can help identify the manifestations of sHTAD by focusing on the entire geometry of the thoracic aorta, rather than only using measurements of dilation of the aortic root. We analyze the geometric phenotype of 97 patients with genetically confirmed sHTAD (79 MF and 18 LDS) and of 45 healthy volunteers, using 3D aorta meshes obtained from phase contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiograms computed from 4D flow cardiac magnetic resonance. We build a geometric encoding of the aorta, based on a vessel coordinate system, and use several mathematical models to discriminate between controls and patients with sHTAD: a baseline scenario, based on aortic root dimensions only, a descriptor typically used in sHTAD patients; a low dimensional scenario, with a reduce encoding using principal component analysis; and a high-dimensional scenario, which included the full coefficient representation for geometry encoding, aiming to capture finer geometric details. The results indicate that considering the anatomy of the whole thoracic aorta can improve predictive ability. We achieve precision and sensitivity values over 0.8, with a specificity of over 70% in all the models used, while a single value classifiers (based only on aortic root diameter) demonstrated a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Using the mathematical properties of the vessel coordinate system representation, feature importance is mapped onto a set of anatomical traits that are used by the models to do the classification, thus providing interpretability of the results. This analysis indicates that in addition to the diameter of the aortic root, aortic elongation and a narrowing of the descending thoracic aorta may be markers of positive sHTAD."

However, these reports included conditions such as Down syndrome and Marfan syndrome, which involve both cardiac disease and scoliosis. The relationships between these factors and open chest surgery remain unclear. This study aimed to identify factors contributing to severe scoliosis in CHD patients who have undergone open chest surgery. Seventy-four post-CHD surgery patients with severe scoliosis (Scoliosis group) and 30 post-CHD surgery patients without scoliosis (NS group), excluding those with any syndrome or intellectual disability, were retrospectively analyzed. Patient background characteristics and radiographic parameters were compared between the NS and Scoliosis groups. Furthermore, the patients in the Scoliosis group were classified into three categories, namely, mild scoliosis, moderate scoliosis, and severe scoliosis, and the results were compared among the four groups. Eighteen patients in the NS group and 63 in the Scoliosis group met the inclusion criteria. Compared with the NS group, the Scoliosis group included significantly more girls and patients who had younger ages at first CHD surgery and multiple open chest surgeries. Severe scoliosis progression was observed in patients who underwent multiple surgeries for severe CHD with cardiomegaly. Progression to severe scoliosis was noted in patients with younger ages at first CHD surgery and those who underwent multiple surgeries for severe CHD. Assessing spinal deformities should be a key aspect of postoperative care for CHD, particularly in patients with severe CHD who are undergoing multiple chest surgeries. III."

    "abstract": "Percutaneous closure devices for arterial sheaths of sufficient caliber to deliver aortic endografts have a published success rate of 90% to 95%. Despite this, they are frequently avoided in patients with genetic aortopathy due to concern for high failure rates and increased complications in the setting of compromised tissue integrity. This study aims to compare rates of access site complications after large bore percutaneous access among patients with and without confirmed genetic aortopathy. All patients undergoing endovascular aortic procedures requiring large bore (≥9F) femoral sheath access between 2019 and 2023 were identified. The specific mutation, demographics, comorbidities, and operative details including maximum sheath size were recorded. Outcomes including unplanned femoral cutdown, access site complications, and reinterventions were evaluated. These factors were then compared between patients with and without a laboratory-confirmed mutation associated with genetic aortopathy. A supplemental analysis was then performed on all patients with genetic aortopathy from 2014 to 2023. Among the 404 patients identified, 33 (8%) had confirmed genetic aortopathy. Among these, 7 patients (21%) had Marfan syndrome, 7 (21%) had Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and 3 (9%) had vascular Ehlers-Danlos. Also represented were ACTA2, PRKG1, FOXE3, and LOX mutations. The genetic aortopathy group was significantly younger (median genetic aortopathy: median 52 years; nongenetic aortopathy: 71 years; P < .001). Thoracic endovascular aortic repair was most frequent in the genetic aortopathy group (52%), followed by zone II arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk (21%); the most frequent operation among the nongenetic aortopathy group was fenestrated/branched endovascular aortic repair (43%), followed by thoracic endovascular aortic repair (25%). Both groups had a median sheath size of 20F; the patients with genetic aortopathy had higher rates of both prior open (genetic aortopathy: 27%; nongenetic aortopathy: 12%; P = .015) and prior percutaneous ipsilateral access (genetic aortopathy: 58%; nongenetic aortopathy: 39%; P = .041). Rates of unplanned cutdowns (genetic aortopathy: 0%; nongenetic aortopathy: 6%) and access site complications (genetic aortopathy: 0%; nongenetic aortopathy: 8%) did not significantly differ between groups (P = .160 and P = .096, respectively). In supplementary analysis, there was one patient with genetic aortopathy who required unplanned cutdown, yielding an overall technical success rate of 97% for percutaneous closure over a 10-year period. Percutaneous access is safe and effective in patients with confirmed genetic aortopathy with similar rates of unplanned cutdown as those in patients without genetic aortopathy. Given the high rates of staged, repeat aortic procedures in this patient population, percutaneous closure should be attempted to avoid an obligate femoral incision, thereby reducing the potential for wound complications and increasing the ease of future procedures."

    "abstract": "<i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> is a gram-negative bacillus that is typically found in freshwater environments and the feces of reptiles. A 48-year-old woman with Marfan's syndrome presented to our hospital with fever, nausea, and general fatigue. She had previously undergone a mechanical Bentall procedure and total aortic arch replacement for acute type A aortic dissection. <i>E tarda</i> was identified from the blood culture. Computed tomography scanning revealed a mycotic aneurysm of the dissecting descending aorta. Despite appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy, the aneurysm dilated rapidly. Thus, an emergency surgery was performed to replace the descending aorta with a graft that was surrounded by a latissimus dorsi muscle flap. Her postoperative course was uneventful."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic diseases (or aortopathies) result from complex interactions between genetic and hemodynamic factors. Often clinically silent, these diseases can lead to lethal complications such as aortic dissection or rupture. This study focused on a Brazilian cohort of 79 individuals with thoracic aortic diseases and explored genetic factors through targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) of 15 priority genes and FBN1 direct sequencing. The majority of individuals had nonsyndromic aortopathy, with eight diagnosed with Marfan syndrome (MFS). Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (PV/LPV) were found in five genes, namely, FBN1, ACTA2, TGFBR2, MYLK, and SMAD3. Notably, novel variants in FBN1 were identified that contributed to Marfan-like phenotypes. The diagnostic yield for isolated aortopathies was 7.1%, which increased to 55.5% for syndromic cases. Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were identified, emphasizing the need for further research and familial investigations to refine variant classifications. This study provides valuable insights into the genetic landscape of aortopathies in Brazil, aiding early diagnosis and personalized management."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of the Yamane technique (flanged intrascleral haptic fixation with double-needle technique /FIHFT) for three-piece intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in Egyptian patients diagnosed with Marfan syndrome (MFS) presented with subluxated lenses (ectopia lentis, EL). This was a retrospective evaluation of thirty-three patients who were diagnosed with MFS and had subluxated lenses in a total of forty eyes. Seven of these patients had bilateral subluxation. Lensectomy or phacoemulsification was performed with limited anterior vitrectomy, followed by IOL implantation using the FIHFT method. Data was collected from medical records, including preoperative and postoperative corrected distant visual acuity (CDVA) using logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (log MAR), preoperative and postoperative refractions, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and follow-up periods. The mean age of patients in the study was 30.79 years, with a mean follow-up of 23.9 months. Post-surgery, the refractive sphere decreased significantly from -9.1 ± 1.4 diopter (D) to -1.4 ± 0.7 D, and cylinder measurements dropped from -4.5 ± 0.8 D to -1.4 ± 0.6 D. The spherical equivalent (SEQ) also declined from -11.4 ± 1.5 D to -2.1 ± 0.8 D. The CDVA improved from 0.80 ± 0.32 to 0.18 ± 0.10 log MAR (P < 0.001). No intraoperative complications were identified. Postoperative complications included IOL decentration (12.5%), vitreous hemorrhage (7.5%), IOL slippage (5%), IOL tilt (5%), and retinal detachment (RD) (5%). Further surgical procedures were necessary for only four cases (10%), all of which had positive outcomes. IOL tilting and slippage occurring at average ages of 18 and 19 years, respectively. No other complications, such as hypotony, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), corneal edema, iritis, IOL dislocation, cystoid macular edema (CME) or endophthalmitis, were reported. The Yamane technique has proven effective and safe for treating subluxated lenses in Egyptian patients with Marfan Syndrome, resulting in improved visual acuity with minimal complications, mostly minor and manageable. Comprehensive fundus examinations before and after surgery are essential for promptly identifying retinal breaks and reducing the risk of retinal detachment. IOL tilting and slippage are more common in younger patients."

    "abstract": "For relatives of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients, guidelines recommend abdominal imaging aimed at early detection and management of AAA, and do not include screening for thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA). We aimed to investigate if TAA occur in undiagnosed relatives of patients with AAA without a known genetic susceptibility for aneurysms, similar to families with identified genetic susceptibilities for aneurysms like in Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, where both AAAs and TAAs occur. Relatives of patients with AAA were invited for noncontrast whole aorta computed tomography (CT) screening. Systematic measurements of the CT scans were used to detect aneurysms and dilatations. Classification into familial and nonfamilial was based on reported family histories. In addition, aneurysm gene panel testing of AAA index cases was used for the classification of high vs unknown genetic risk (high genetic risk: familial aneurysm or a pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) in an aneurysm gene; unknown genetic risk: no family history or P/LP). Whole aorta imaging of 301 relatives of 115 index patients with AAA with noncontrast CT scans showed a 28-fold increase in TAAs in relatives (1.7% [P < .001] vs the age-adjusted population) and a high frequency of thoracic dilatations in 18% of the relatives. Thoracic aneurysms and dilatations in relatives occurred even when index patients were unaware of familial aneurysms. AAA was increased in the relatives compared with the age-adjusted population (8%; P < .001). An increased risk for thoracic aneurysms and dilatations was detected by whole aorta imaging of relatives of index patients with AAA, even when index patients were unaware of familial aneurysms. These results indicate still unknown shared genetic susceptibilities for thoracic and abdominal aneurysms. Therefore, imaging of the whole aorta of relatives of all abdominal aneurysm patients, will improve early detection of aortic aneurysms in relatives of all patients with AAA."

    "abstract": "Mitral annular disjunction (MAD) has increasingly been recognized as a marker for adverse cardiovascular events in Marfan syndrome (MFS). As recent adult data links MFS with left ventricular (LV) dilation and reduced ejection fraction (LVEF), we hypothesized that MAD may be associated with LV dilation in pediatric MFS patients. A retrospective analysis was performed among MFS patients < 19 years old at initial cardiac MRI (CMR). MAD and mitral valve prolapse (MVP) were assessed by CMR or most proximate echo. CMR-derived left ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDV) and end-systolic (LVESV) volumes were measured. Indexed volumes, absolute and indexed z-scores, and LVEF were calculated. The combined volume load from mitral and aortic regurgitation was indexed to LV stroke volume, allowing exclusion of patients with greater than mild volume load or prior MV intervention. MAD association with LV volumes and z-scores was then assessed. Forty-two patients were analyzed (median age 13.5 years old, IQR [10.9, 15.3]). MAD was present in 28 patients (66.7%), and MVP was present in 13 patients (31.0%). Absolute LVEDV z-score was > 2 in 35.7% of patients, LVESV z-score was > 2 in 42.9%, and LVEF was < 55% in 45.2%. In multivariable analysis including MVP, MAD remained independently associated with elevated absolute LVESV z-score > 2 (RR 3.88, 95% CI 1.02-14.69, p = 0.046). MAD was associated with CMR-derived volume-load-independent LV dilation among pediatric MFS patients. Prospective studies are needed to further understand this association and its relationship with LV dilation over time."

Individuals with MFS display symptoms in different organs, particularly in the vasculature, but the mechanisms of this multi-system dysfunction are still under investigation. There is still a gap in our understanding of the impact of monogenic connective tissue aberrations on the brain. This study aims to determine the impact of MFS on neurodegeneration, in cortical brain tissue of male and female MFS mice. Brain tissue of 6-month-old female and male mice with the <i>FBN1</i> <sup><i>C1041G/+</i></sup> mutation and wildtype litter mates was collected and stained for active caspase-3 (ac3), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neuronal nuclei (NeuN) or with TUNEL and DAPI. Data revealed increased levels of ac3 in neurons within the sensory and motor cortical areas of female MFS mice compared to sex- and age-matched controls. We confirm increased levels of apoptosis in MFS mice using TUNEL staining within the same brain areas. We also report increased levels of neuronal BDNF levels in cortical brain tissue of male and female MFS mice. These results indicate a heightened susceptibility for neurodegeneration in the mouse model of MFS."

The study had the following main objectives: the correlation between disc displacement, DD (a major sign for temporomandibular joint dysfunction, TMDs) on magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, and aortic Z score (a major sign for aortic root dilation) on echocardiography; the predictive value of DD towards aortic Z score. DD had 2 types of severity: DD with reduction (the mild type, DDwR), and DD without reduction (the severe type, DDwoR). <i>Materials and Methods:</i> The type of fibrillinopathy was precised by clinical exam (systemic score), ophthalmic exam (for ectopia lentis), and echocardiography (aortic Z score, MVP). Medical treatment consisted of betablockers, BB (for patients with tachycardia), or angiotensin II receptor blockers, ARB. Surgical treatment was addressed to aortic root aneurysm, and severe mitral regurgitation, MR. DD benefited from dental conservatory treatment or surgical restoration. <i>Results:</i> DD-Z score had a powerful correlation in MASS (Rho = 0.787, <i>p</i> < 0.01), and in MS patients (Rho = 0.819, <i>p</i> < 0.01). For the entire sample, both DDwR-Z score and DDwoR-Z score had a moderate correlation (Rho = 0.469, and respectively 0.669). Furthermore, DD was an important predictor for Z score. DDwoR had a double power of prediction for the Z score compared with DDwR (B coefficient = 1.661 for DDwR and 3.281 for DDwoR). <i>Conclusions:</i> TMDs had a powerful correlation with aortic root dilation in MASS and MS patients from the sample. Likewise, TMDs was a major predictor for aortic root dilation, in the entire sample. In clinical practice, we can utilize an extracardiac finding, TMDs, obtained by a non-invasive technique, MRI, for cardiac severity stratification of fibrillinopathies."

    "abstract": "Hereditary thoracic aorta diseases (HTADs) are a heterogeneous group of rare disorders whose major manifestation is represented by aneurysm and/or dissection frequently located at the level of the ascending thoracic aorta. The diseases have an insidious evolution and can be encountered as an isolated manifestation or can also be associated with systemic, extra-aortic manifestations (syndromic HTADs). Along with the development of molecular testing technologies, important progress has been made in deciphering the heterogeneous etiology of HTADs. The aim of this study is to identify the genetic variants associated with a group of patients who presented clinical signs suggestive of a syndromic form of HTAD. Genetic testing based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was performed using a gene panel (Illumina TruSight Cardio Sequencing Panel) or whole exome sequencing (WES). In the majority of cases (8/10), de novo mutations in the <i>FBN1</i> gene were detected and correlated with the Marfan syndrome phenotype. In another case, a known mutation in the <i>TGFBR2</i> gene associated with Loeys-Dietz syndrome was detected. Two other pathogenic heterozygous variants (one de novo and the other a known mutation) in the <i>SLC2A10</i> gene (compound heterozygous genotype) were identified in a patient diagnosed with arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATORS). We presented the genotype-phenotype correlations, especially related to the clinical evolution, highlighting the particularities of each patient in a family context. We also emphasized the importance of genetic testing and patient monitoring to avoid acute aortic events."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome is named after Antoine Marfan, who described a 5-year-old child with congenital elongation of the digits and other skeletal abnormalities in 1896. While Marfan syndrome is a systemic connective tissue disorder predominantly involving the skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular systems, the cardiovascular system presents the most life-threatening complications. Most cardiovascular pathologies surround the left ventricular outflow tract and aorta, with aortic dissection requiring emergent surgical management to the progression of mitral regurgitation requiring elective surgery. Intensive care management, along with a tailored approach to the surgical management of a patient with Marfan syndrome, is critical to their survival. Current surgical operations for patients include aortic root surgery, valve-sparing root replacements, aortic root replacements with conduits, and mitral valve repairs. Further research is necessary to determine the molecular, endovascular, pharmaceutical, and surgical management of Marfan syndrome. This review attempts to concisely discuss the diagnosis, complications, and medical and intensive care management of Marfan syndrome while further divulging on the surgical management of those with this disease process."

Vascular deformation mapping (VDM) is an image analysis technique for mapping 3D aortic growth on rouine computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans. We aimed to use VDM to examine the value of aortic growth rate in the descending thoracic aorta (DescAo), among other imaging biomarkers, to identify the factors associated with risk of TBAD in MFS. CTA scans spanning 2004-2023 from adult MFS patients with native DescAo were analyzed by VDM. Other measurements included multi-level thoracoabdominal aortic diameters and the length of the DescAo by centerline analysis.Among the 105 MFS patients analyzed, 63.8% were male, with median age of 40 years (range 18-73) and a median surveillance interval of 5.3 years (range 2.0-18.3). During surveillance, 12 (11.4%) patients developed TBAD. Patients with TBAD had higher radial growth rate (0.63 vs. 0.23 mm/year; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and elongation rate (2.4 vs. 0.5 mm/year; <i>p</i> < 0.001), on univariate and multivariable analysis, but pre-dissection descending aortic diameter was not significantly different. Predictors of growth rate included younger age, higher baseline maximal diameter of the DescAo, smoking history and warfarin use. Radial growth and elongation rates of the DescAo were independent predictors of TBAD occurrence in MFS. TBAD often occurred in at non-aneurysmal diameters (<4.0 cm). These findings emphasize the role of growth over absolute diameter in risk stratification for TBAD in MFS."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a complex connective tissue disorder characterized by considerable clinical variability. The diagnosis of MFS is based on the Ghent criteria, which require the presence of both clinical and genetic features. MFS is primarily caused by pathogenic alterations in FBN1, which encodes the fibrillin-1 protein. Fibrillin-1 comprises multiple domains rich in cysteine residues, with disulfide bonds formed between these residues. It has long been recognized that variants that alter or introduce cysteine residues damage protein function, leading to the development of MFS. In this study, we report a cysteine-introducing variant: FBN1 variant, c.6724C>T (p.[Arg2242Cys]). We have observed this variant in several individuals without MFS, challenging our previous understanding of the underlying mechanism of MFS. This finding emphasizes the importance of revisiting and reevaluating our current knowledge in light of new and unexpected observations. Moreover, our study highlights the significance of incorporating local and national data on allele frequencies, as well as employing multidisciplinary phenotyping approaches, in the classification of genetic variants. By considering a wide range of information, we can enhance the accuracy and reliability of variant classification, ultimately improving the diagnosis and management of individuals with genetic disorders like MFS."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is associated with cardiovascular complications, particularly valvulopathies; however, its association with primary cardiomyopathy remains unclear. This retrospective cohort study examined the cardiomyopathy characteristics (CMCs) in pediatric patients with MFS. CMCs were defined as meeting at least one of the following echocardiography or clinical parameters: (1) cardiac index (CI) too low for patient's age, (2) ejection fraction (EF) <50%, and (3) diastolic dysfunction. The predictive factors for CMCs were determined using a multivariable logistic regression model. Among 83 patients with MFS (age, median [range], 12.5 [0.4-22.3] years), 39.8% exhibited CMCs. Only 4 patients (5%) showed heart failure symptoms (NYHA > 1). Independent predictors for CMCs included a systemic score of ≥7 (revised Ghent criteria) and likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants in FBN1, including variants that introduce a premature stop codon, splice site variants, and missense variants involving cysteine. A multivariable score was constructed with an AUC of 0.733. This study offers valuable insights into the prevalence and predictors of CMC in pediatric patients with MFS and presents potential strategies for risk assessment of cardiomyopathy. The objective of this study was to elucidate the contentious issue of intrinsic cardiomyopathy in Marfan syndrome and demonstrate its notable occurrence even in pediatric patients who do not exhibit heart failure symptoms or valvular complications. We highlighted the importance of specific FBN1 variants and higher systemic scores in identifying the potential for intrinsic cardiomyopathy in pediatric patients with Marfan syndrome."

Patients were examined by at least one of the authors (NJI). Fibrillin-1 (<i>FBN1</i>) full gene sequencing was done to all patients (Laboratory for Molecular Medicine, Center for Genetics and Genomics, Cambridge, MA). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Universidad Central del Caribe (approval number: 2024-07). Results: Six patients aged 28-79 years were examined. There were seven female and three male patients. The average visual acuity was 0.49 and 0.52 in the right eye (OD) and left eye (OS), respectively. The average refraction (spherical equivalent) was -1.28 sph OD and -1.07 sph OS. The average intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg in both eyes (OU). A patient had a dislocated lens OD; a patient had lens dislocation OU; and a patient had prosthesis OD and aphakia OS. Upon optical coherence tomography (OCT), the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) average was 75.86 µm OD and 81.85 ​​µm OS; the average cup-to-disc (C/D) ratio was 0.41 and 0.35 in the right and left eye, respectively.

Fifteen patients underwent primary fusion, whereas six underwent growth-friendly surgery (GFS). The mean preoperative and final T1-T12 heights were 204.0 mm and 248.0 mm, respectively. Final pulmonary function tests were available for 16 patients, and the mean final %VC was 54.0% with 10 patients exhibiting a final %VC < 60%. A significant moderate association was observed between the final T1-T12 height and final %VC. The predicted final T1-T12 height required for a final %VC of 60% was approximately 260 mm. Although most older patients with Marfan syndrome and EOS acquired a considerably large final T1-T12 height, a larger thoracic height was required for satisfactory respiratory function in many cases; hence, GFS may be indicated even in this population."

We report three new cases with biallelic or monoallelic EFEMP1 variants and severe hernia phenotypes. Two male siblings of 10 and 13 years old presented with marfanoid habitus, recurrent inguinal and umbilical hernias, generalized joint hypermobility, and scoliosis. Parents and halfsiblings reported joint hypermobility and umbilical hernias. The eldest boy died at age 16 from incarcerated gastrointestinal herniation complicated by gastric and bowel necrosis with perforation. Autopsy revealed widespread intestinal diverticula. Immunohistochemistry of skin and fascia tissue did not reveal any abnormalities, including normal staining of elastic fibers. Both siblings harbored compound heterozygous likely pathogenic EFEMP1 variants (c.1320 + 2T > A, p.? and c.698G > A, p.Gly233Asp). An unrelated 58-year-old male had marfanoid features, high myopia, recurrent diaphragmatic and inguinal hernias, and chronic gastrointestinal dilatation with severe malabsorption. Both his dizygotic twin-brother and mother had recurrent hernias and high myopia. This man died at 59 years of age, and autopsy showed extensive diaphragmatic herniation, bowel diverticula, and pulmonary emphysema. A heterozygous EFEMP1 splice-variant (c.81 + 1G > A, p.?) was identified, causing exon skipping leading to a start-loss. Targeted genome reanalysis nor RNA-sequencing revealed a second variant at the other allele. The reported individuals expand the clinical and pathological phenotypes of EFEMP1-related disease, a distinct entity within the spectrum of HCTD. The severe and recurrent hernias, gastrointestinal dilatation, and diverticulosis result in an increased risk for life-threatening complications, demanding early recognition and close monitoring."

The Florida sleeve technique (FST) is a new technique for aortic root remodeling with the preservation of the aortic valve without aortic root wall resection and coronary artery reconstruction. We successfully treated with the FST for a Marfan syndrome patient with an aortic root aneurysm and aortic valve insufficiency. We believe that this technique is very suitable for cases with moderately enlarged aortic roots. It could reduce surgical risks and prevent dilatation of the aortic root through coverage with a graft for a long time."

Using the registry for adult CHD, Sahlgrenska University Hospital/Östra Hospital, between 1 April 2009 and 31 January 2023, we identified 1916 patients. Of these, we included 33 patients aged ≥18 years who were diagnosed with Marfan syndrome and had completed the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey. The median age was 32 years (interquartile range 25.5-47.0) and 22 (66.7%) were men. Patients with Marfan syndrome had significantly lower values than reference values for all scales in the Short-Form Health Survey except bodily pain, role-emotional, and the physical component summary score. For both men and women with Marfan syndrome, vitality was the subscale with the greatest percentage difference in comparison with healthy reference values (82% in women and 73% in men). Furthermore, men reported significantly higher vitality levels than women (62.5 points, interquartile range 43.8-75.0 vs. 35 points, interquartile range 10.0-65.0, <i>p</i> = 0.026). Adults with Marfan syndrome in Sweden showed lower health-related quality of life levels in comparison with reference values for most Short-Form Health Survey scales, and there were differences between patients with Marfan syndrome in terms of sex and age."

    "abstract": "Dural ectasia is a common manifestation of neurofibromatosis type 1. Although there have been reports of unsuccessful spinal anesthesia due to dual ectasia in Marfan syndrome, reports describing similar unsuccessful spinal anesthesia in neurofibromatosis type 1 are lacking. A parturient with neurofibromatosis type 1 was scheduled for a repeat cesarean section. During a previous cesarean section, she had experienced a failed spinal anesthesia, which resulted in a conversion to general anesthesia. Preoperative lumbar magnetic resonance imaging revealed dural ectasia, which was speculated to be the cause of the previous spinal anesthesia failure. Therefore, combined spinal-epidural anesthesia was implemented. Because the block level of spinal anesthesia was insufficient as predicted, supplemental administration of epidural anesthesia successfully provided adequate analgesia for the surgery. Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia can be useful for the management of cesarean sections in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1-associated dural ectasia."

This cross-sectional study used questionnaires to assess lifetime exercise exposure and utilized the PedsQL QOL Inventory. We developed an exercise exposure score (EES) to quantify lifetime exercise exposure. Questionnaires were completed via telephone with complimentary medical record review. Forty patients were enrolled. Mean age was 26 yr. The diagnosis was Marfan syndrome in 83%. Despite 88% of patients being restricted by their provider, 65% reported competitive sports participation and 93% reported recreational exercise. Participants with an EES greater than the median had significantly better total QOL scores compared with those below the median (78 vs 65, P = 0.03). There were significant positive correlations between current frequency of exercise and psychosocial QOL (slope = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.2-6.6, P = 0.005), physical QOL (slope = 8.1, 95% CI = 4.1-12, P < 0.001), and total QOL score (slope = 6.0, 95% CI = 3.1-9.0, P < 0.001). We found no difference in aortic size or need for surgical intervention between those above and below the median EES, or between those who did and did not participate in competitive sports. Despite exercise restrictions, young HTAD patients are physically active. Increased lifetime exercise and current physical activity levels were associated with improved QOL in HTAD patients."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder with increased risk of aortic dissection. Currently, type A aortic dissection risk is mitigated by aortic root replacement with Dacron. It is unclear if root replacement increases the risk of distal aortic disease given the noncompliant nature of Dacron. All adult patients with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome at a single academic center, excluding those with history of dissection or concomitant arch repair, were studied (n = 322). Student t test or Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test was used for continuous variables; chi-square or Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables. Propensity matching used age, sex, hypertension, race, body mass index, family history of Marfan syndrome, and genetic mutational class. Differences in freedom from type B aortic dissection were determined using the log-rank test. A total of 124 patients underwent root replacement compared with 198 patients with no prior aortic surgery. Median follow-up time was 9.90 years. Male sex, weight, and hypertension prevalence were higher in the root replacement group (P < .05). Distribution of fibrillin-1 mutations was homogenous (P > .9). Type B aortic dissection frequency in the root replacement group was higher (21% [n = 20] vs 4.2% [n = 4], P < .001). Aortic-related mortality was higher in the root replacement group (11% [n = 14] vs 3.5% [n = 7], P < .01). Distal aortic intervention frequency was higher in the root replacement group (P = .009). Patients with Marfan syndrome who undergo elective aortic root replacement appear to have a higher incidence of subsequent type B aortic dissection, independent of other risk factors. Careful consideration must be made to the management of the distal aorta in patients with Marfan syndrome who undergo root replacement."

    "abstract": "Resveratrol, a dietary supplement that intervenes in cellular metabolism, has been shown to reduce aortic growth rate in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome (MFS), a condition associated in humans with life-threatening aortic complications, often preceded by aortic dilatation. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol on aortic growth rate in patients with MFS . In this investigator-initiated, single-arm open-label multicentre trial, we analysed resveratrol treatment in adults aged 18-50 years with MFS. The primary endpoint was the change in estimated annual aortic growth at five predefined levels in the thoracic aorta after 1 year of resveratrol treatment, evaluated using a linear mixed model. Aortic diameters were measured by cardiac MRI at three time points to analyse the annual aortic expansion rate before and after initiation of treatment. Additionally, annual aortic growth was compared with growth in a previously conducted losartan randomised clinical trial. 898 patients were screened of which 19% (168/898) patients met the inclusion criteria.36% (61/168) patients signed informed consent and 93% (57/61) aged 37±9 years, of which 28 males (49%) were included in the final analysis of the study. 46% (26/57) had undergone aortic root replacement prior to the study. Aortic root diameters remained stable after 1.2±0.3 years of resveratrol administration. A trend towards a decrease in estimated growth rate (mm/year) was observed in the aortic root (from 0.39±0.06 to -0.13±0.23, p=0.072), ascending aorta (from 0.40±0.05 to -0.01±0.18, p=0.072) and distal descending aorta (from 0.32±0.04 to 0.01±0.14, p=0.072). Resveratrol treatment for 1 year may stabilise the aortic growth rate in adult patients with MFS. However, a subsequent randomised clinical trial with a longer follow-up duration and a larger study cohort is needed to establish an actual long-term beneficial effect of this dietary supplement in patients with MFS.

We herein report a case of unexpected tracheal stenosis that was diagnosed just before an operation for a recurrent right pneumothorax with Marfan syndrome. A 16-year-old boy with bilateral repeated pneumothoraces associated with Marfan syndrome came to our emergency room complaining of dyspnea. A chest radiograph showed recurrent right pneumothorax. An operation was planned due to prolonged air leakage even after chest tube drainage. On induction of general anesthesia for repairing pneumothorax, a sudden difficulty occurred during manual ventilation, and the blood oxygen saturation temporarily decreased to 50%. Therefore, emergent intubation with a single-lumen tube was applied, which led back to full saturation. Bronchoscopy revealed a tortuous and flattened trachea. An endobronchial blocker tube was applied due to difficulty in double-lumen tube insertion, and bullectomy was accomplished without any other unexpected events. Patients with Marfan syndrome may have asymptomatic tracheal stenosis due to structural abnormalities and latent tracheomalacia, and general anesthesia could be a trigger to develop the symptoms. Surgeons should bear this in mind, cooperate with anesthesiologists well, and prepare for emergent intubation when managing patients with Marfan syndrome in the perioperative settings."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) guidelines recommend optimal pharmacologic therapy (OPT) and replacement of the ascending aorta (RAA) at 5.0 cm in diameter to prevent acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) and death. The effect of early MFS diagnosis and initiation of therapy on outcomes is not known. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the effect of age at MFS diagnosis and therapy initiation on delayed RAA and death. This retrospective observational cohort study with long-term follow-up included consecutive patients with MFS, pathogenic FBN1 variant, and regular visits to a European Reference Network Center. We considered MFS diagnosis at age ≥21 years late and OPT initiation at age <21 years early. Outcomes were delayed RAA with aneurysm diameter >5.0 cm or ATAAD and death from all causes. We used landmark design starting at age 21 years to determine associations with outcomes. The study group consisted of 288 patients (45.1% male), including 169 patients with late diagnosis of MFS (58.7%) and 63 with early OPT (21.9%). During mean follow-up of 25 ± 14.7 years, 78 patients had delayed RAA, with 42 operations for ATAAD and 36 for aneurysms ≥5.0 cm. There were 33 deaths, including 11 deaths late after ATAAD. All deaths were cardiovascular. Late diagnosis, but not early OPT, showed univariate association with delayed RAA (P < .001) and death (P = .025). Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed late diagnosis as predictor of delayed RAA (hazard ratio, 8.01; 95% confidence interval, 2.52-25.45; P < .001) and death (hazard ratio, 4.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-18.80; P = .029).

To investigate the prevalence of penile fracture (PF) in patients with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and Marfan syndrome (MFS) in comparison with disease-free controls between 18 and 45 years of age. A multicenter, international, electronic health record network (TriNetX) was queried to identify adult male patients (between 18 and 45 years) with or without EDS and MFS between 1993 and 2023 using ICD-10 codes. The prevalence of PF was compared between patients with and without the diseases of interest. Prevalence ratios (PR) were generated with 95% confidence intervals. Prevalence of PF in patients with EDS and MFS when compared to disease-free controls. The number of patients with EDS, MFS, and control groups was 8060, 8642, and 20 184 547, respectively, with a mean age of 27.8 ± 7.58, 28.6 ± 7.4, and 31.6 ± 8.04 years. Men with EDS had a higher prevalence of PF (PR 30.18, 95% CI [17.08-53.19]; P < 0.0001). Similarly, men with MFS had a higher prevalence of PF (PR 23.4, 95% CI [12.6-43.7]; P < 0.0001). This study demonstrates an association between CTD and men's sexual health disorders. It may be important to counsel such men about the risks of PF. This is the largest study to date to demonstrate an association between CTD and men's sexual health disorders. While the large sample sizes in this study contribute to the robustness of the findings, the study is limited by the use of a claims-based dataset, which does not provide further details about disease course and complications, and the use of a univariate analysis only. Patients with EDS and MFS are possibly at an elevated risk for PF. Due to the limitations of the TriNetX database, the analysis was limited to a univariate one, thus limiting the ability to control for confounders and limiting the generalizability of these findings. Further prospective research is needed to corroborate these findings."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection, a serious medical condition characterized by a tear in the aorta's inner layer leading to the establishment of a false channel within the vessel wall, in this report, we present a very rare case of asymptomatic substantial aortic dissection spanning from the ascending aorta to the abdominal aorta. A 36-year-old male with fever and cough was found to have clinical features suggestive of Marfan syndrome. Examination revealed bilateral fine crackles and a diastolic heart murmur. Imaging showed bilateral infiltrates, hyperinflation, and aortic dissection. Echocardiography confirmed severe aortic valve regurgitation and Stanford type A dissection. Despite recommended surgery, the patient opted for medical therapy due to financial constraints, showing stable cardiac anomalies after 6 months. Aortic dissection, a critical cardiovascular emergency, affects mainly the elderly, exacerbated by hypertension, atherosclerosis, and connective tissue disorders. Early detection via CT and biomarkers is crucial. Type A dissections typically require surgical repair, while endovascular repair is used for complex Type B cases, reducing long-term mortality. The TEM system aids in categorization, guiding treatment. Conditions like Marfan syndrome significantly contribute to aortic wall degeneration, requiring close monitoring and intervention. The coalescence of aortic dissections with Marfan syndrome underscores the need for tailored monitoring in high-risk populations and highlights the silent complexities of cardiovascular pathologies, urging refined diagnostics and therapeutic approaches."

Prompt recognition of typical signs of neonatal presentation, such as characteristic facial anomalies with senile appearance, arthrogryposis, and campto-arachnodactyly, is fundamental for performing an early cardiological examination. This usually reveals rapidly progressive cardiovascular disease due to severe atrioventricular valve dysfunction. Herein, we report the case of an early-onset cardiac failure in a neonate with Marfan syndrome, with a brief review of the literature of cases with cardiac involvement in neonatal age. Clinical exome sequencing identified the novel heterozygous de novo missense variant c.3152T > G in FBN1 gene (NM_000138.4), causing the aminoacidic change p.Phe1051Cys. Phenotype-genotype correlation led to a multidisciplinary diagnostic and management workflow. The prompt recognition of a typical phenotype such as that of Marfan syndrome should lead to a detailed evaluation and close follow-up of cardiac morphology and function. Indeed, multi-disciplinary evaluation based on genotype-phenotype correlations of nMFS cases is essential to finding out the best medical and surgical approach, predicting the relevant impact on patient prognosis, and adequately counseling their families."

They were randomized into a training group (MFS-T) and a control group (MFS-C). The training consisted of 2 supervised online sessions weekly for 3 months. The primary outcome was QoL, assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 questionnaire. Baseline QoL in all dimensions was lower in patients with MFS. Their peak oxygen uptake was 25% lower, and muscle elasticity was diminished compared with healthy subjects. Postintervention, significant improvements were observed in the MFS-T group relative to the MFS-C group: QoL (+20.2±14.3 versus +0.7±0.5), peak oxygen uptake (+34% versus +14%), muscle elasticity index (11.5±8.2 versus +1.2±1.7), reduced blood pressures during isometric squats (systolic -19±30 versus 0±6; diastolic -27±39 versus +2±15), and reduced pulse wave velocity at rest (-1.20±1.89 versus -0.40±1.61) and postexercise (-0.42±0.45 versus +0.08±0.48).

Our aim was to identify distinct Marfan patient subgroups based on aortic 4D flow MRI and Z-score for stratification of distinct hemodynamic profiles and clinical features by means of hierarchical cluster analysis. One hundred Marfan patients underwent baseline aortic 4D flow MRI at 3 T. Z-scores, degree of helical and vortical flow, wall shear stress, flow displacement, and peak velocity were determined in the ascending aorta. Sex, age, BMI, antihypertensive medication, and dural ectasia were recorded. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using 4D flow MRI variables and Z-scores as input. Cluster analysis resulted in three distinct clusters characterized by different Z-scores (mean ± SD); cluster 1: 0.4 ± 1.1 vs. cluster 2: 3.1 ± 1.1 vs. cluster 3: 3.6 ± 1.9. The three clusters delivered differences in helical and vortical flow patterns (global p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively), wall shear stress (0.49 ± 0.11 vs. 0.44 ± 0.12 vs. 0.37 ± 0.09 N/m<sup>2</sup>, global p < 0.001), flow displacement (0.11 ± 0.05 vs. 0.16 ± 0.08 vs. 0.15 ± 0.07, global p = 0.006), and peak velocity (76.3 ± 9.0 vs. 60.1 ± 7.3 vs. 56.0 ± 7.8 cm/s, global p < 0.001).

Hierarchical cluster analysis based on aortic 4D flow MRI and Z-score revealed three distinct subgroups of Marfan patients, each characterized by specific hemodynamic profiles and clinical features. Follow-up of our patients is warranted to assess if 4D flow MRI- and Z-score-based stratification can predict future aortic diameter growth and ultimately improve outcomes. A combination of Z-score and 4D flow MRI-derived parameters may help identify subgroups of Marfan patients representing different stages or phenotypes of aortic disease, which require specific management strategies. Four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI-derived variables of Marfan patients are highly heterogeneous across varying Z-scores. Cluster analysis based on 4D flow MRI and Z-score revealed three distinct subgroups of Marfan patients.

Despite the high potential of mast cells (MCs) to remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM), their pathogenetic significance in MFS has not been considered yet. The group of patients with Marfan syndrome included two mothers and five children (three girls aged 4, 11, and 11 and two boys aged 12 and 13). Normal skin was examined in two children aged 11 and 12. Histochemical, monoplex, and multiplex immunohistochemical techniques; combined protocols of simultaneous histochemical and immunohistochemical staining (the results of staining were assessed using light, epifluorescence, and confocal microscopy); and bioinformatics algorithms for the quantitative analysis of detected targets were used to evaluate mast cells and their relationship with other cells from extracellular structures in the skin dermis. Analysis of the skin MC population in children with Marfan syndrome revealed a considerably increased number of intra-organic populations with the preservation of the specific Tryptase<sup>+</sup>Chymase<sup>+</sup>CPA3<sup>+</sup> protease profile typical of the skin. The features of the MC histotopography phenotype in MFS consisted of closer colocalization with elastic fibers, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. MCs formed many intradermal clusters that synchronized the activity of cell functions in the stromal landscape of the tissue microenvironment with the help of spatial architectonics, including the formation of cell chains and the creation of fibrous niches. In MCs, the expression of specific proteases, TGF-β, and heparin increased, with targeted secretion of biologically active substances relative to the dermal elastic fibers, which had specific structural features in MFS, including abnormal variability in thickness along their entire length, alternating thickened and thinned areas, and uneven surface topography. This paper discusses the potential role of MCs in strain analysis (tensometry) of the tissue microenvironment in MFS. Thus, the quantitative and qualitative rearrangements of the skin MC population in MFS are aimed at altering the stromal landscape of the connective tissue. The results obtained should be taken into account when managing clinical signs of MFS manifested in other pathogenetically critical structures of internal organs, including the aorta, tendons, cartilage, and parenchymal organs."

    "abstract": "A 53-year-old woman was diagnosed with a Crawford II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm involving the right-sided descending aorta. The patient underwent aortic replacement via a thoracoabdominal approach. The right-sided descending thoracic aortic aneurysm was excluded. The patient had a favorable postoperative course. The excluded thoracic aneurysm had completely thrombosed without intercostal inflow. The right-sided descending aorta is a rare malformation. The exclusion technique was appropriate because there was no retrograde flow from the intercostal arteries and the Adamkiewicz artery originated from the lumbar region."

    "abstract": "Selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (sACP) is a crucial cerebral protection technique employed during aortic dissection surgeries involving cardiopulmonary bypass. However, postoperative neurological complications, particularly those related to cannulation issues and perfusion problems, remain a significant concern. This case report details an unusual instance where a 38-year-old male patient with Marfan syndrome experienced cerebral hypoperfusion during emergency surgery for Stanford Type A aortic dissection. Despite following standard protocols, a significant drop in regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO<sub>2</sub>) and abnormal blood pressure fluctuations were observed shortly after initiating sACP via the innominate artery. After initial attempts to optimize perfusion flow proved ineffective, the cannulation position was adjusted, leading to improvements. Nevertheless, the patient subsequently exhibited signs of cerebral hypoperfusion and was found to have suffered a new cerebral infarction. This case report underscores the importance of precise cannula placement during sACP procedures and the dire consequences that can arise from improper positioning. It emphasizes the need for continuous monitoring and prompt intervention in cases of abnormal cerebral oxygenation and blood pressure, as well as the value of considering cannulation-related issues as potential causes of postoperative neurological complications."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a hereditary connective tissue disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1:5000-1:10 000 individuals. It is a pleiotropic disease characterized by specific ocular, cardiovascular, and skeletal features. The most common cardiovascular complication is aortic root dilatation which untreated can lead to life-threatening aortic root dissection, mainly occurring in adult patients. Prompt diagnosis, appropriate follow-up, and timely treatment can prevent aortic events. Currently there are no specific recommendations for treatment of children with MFS, and management is greatly based on adult guidelines. Furthermore, due to the scarcity of studies including children, there is a lack of uniform treatment across different centres. This consensus document aims at bridging these gaps of knowledge. This work is a joint collaboration between the paediatric subgroup of the European Network of Vascular Diseases (VASCERN, Heritable Thoracic Aortic Disease Working Group) and the Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology (AEPC). A group of experts from 12 different centres and 8 different countries participated in this effort. This document reviews four main subjects, namely, (i) imaging of the aorta at diagnosis and follow-up, (ii) recommendations on medical treatment, (iii) recommendations on surgical treatment, and (iv) recommendations on sport participation."

    "abstract": "Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is a disease that impacts human quality of life and contributes to the progression of other neuronal problems. Various stressors induce an increase in free radicals, destroy mitochondria to further contribute to cellular malfunction, and compromise cell viability, ultimately leading to functional decline. Cisd2, a master gene for Marfan syndrome, plays an essential role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and functions. As shown by our data, specific deletion of Cisd2 in the cochlea exacerbated the hearing impairment of ARHL in C57BL/6 mice. Increased defects in mitochondrial function, potassium homeostasis and synapse activity were observed in the Cisd2-deleted mouse models. These mechanistic phenotypes combined with oxidative stress contribute to cell death in the whole cochlea. Human patients with obviously deteriorated ARHL had low Cisd2 expression; therefore, Cisd2 may be a potential target for designing therapeutic methods to attenuate the disease progression of ARHL."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate a novel <i>FBN1</i> gene mutation in a pediatric patient with Marfan syndrome (MFS) to provide a theoretical basis for genetic counseling. The subject was a 5-month-old male infant. With informed consent from the proband and his family, 2 mL of peripheral venous blood was collected from the patient, his father, mother, and sister. DNA was extracted using a DNA extraction kit with EDTA-K as an anticoagulant. The extracted DNA was subjected to minigene transcription and bioinformatics analysis. For minigene construction, wild-type and mutant minigenes were inserted into pcMINI and pcMINI-C vectors, respectively. Four recombinant vectors were transfected into the HeLa and 293T cell lines. After transfection for 48 hours, RNA was extracted from eight samples. DNA was also extracted from the family members' samples to construct a library. Target regions were captured using the SureSelect Human All Exon V6 (Agilent) kit and were sequenced with Illumina NovaSeq (sequencing read length 2×150 bp). Bioinformatic analysis identified the c.8226+5del mutation as a variant of uncertain clinical significance (VOUS). Literature and database reviews confirmed that this mutation had not been previously reported, identifying it as a novel mutation. The study identified a novel <i>FBN1</i> mutation, c.8226+5del, that may be associated with clinical features such as low-set ears and distinctive facial characteristics in the proband. This mutation likely affects normal mRNA splicing, altering the structure and function of Exon 64 and potentially contributing to the development of autosomal dominant MFS."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a complex genetic systemic connective tissue disorder. It is well known that genetic factors play a critical role in the progression of MFS, with nearly all cases attributed to variants in the FBN1 gene. We investigated a Chinese family with MFS spanning two generations. Whole exome sequencing, in silico analysis, minigene constructs, transfection, RT-PCR, and protein secondary structure analysis were used to analyze the genotype of the proband and his father. The main clinical manifestations of the proband and his father were subluxation of the left lens and high myopia with pectus deformity. Whole exome sequencing identified a novel single nucleotide variant (SNV) in the FBN1 gene at a non-canonical splice site, c.443-3C>G. This variant resulted in two abnormal mRNA transcripts, leading to a frameshift and an in-frame insertion. Further in vitro experiments indicated that the c.443-3C>G variant in FBN1 was pathogenic and functionally harmful. This research identified a novel intronic pathogenic FBN1: c.443-3C>G gene variant, which led to two different aberrant splicing effects. Further functional analysis expands the variant spectrum and provides a strong indication and sufficient basis for preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disease (PGT-M)."

    "abstract": "People with Marfan syndrome (MFS) have clinical symptoms of hip pain, but to date, there is limited knowledge about hip-related structural abnormalities in these patients. Therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assess hip-related structural abnormalities and patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in a cohort of patients with MFS compared to healthy controls. Nineteen individuals with MFS (17 females, 39.8±11.5 years) and 19 age, sex, and body mass index-matched healthy, asymptomatic individuals (17 females, 36.2±12.5 years) underwent radiographic imaging and unilateral hip MRI. The Scoring Osteoarthritis with MRI (SHOMRI) technique was used to assess hip-related morphological abnormalities between the MFS and control groups. All participants completed the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) to assess hip-related symptoms, pain, and function during activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QOL). The MFS group exhibited higher lateral center edge angles (p < .001). Despite similar severity of femoral cartilage damage (p = 1.0), the MFS group exhibited a higher severity (p = 0.046) of acetabular cartilage degeneration (1.21±1.08) compared to the controls (0.53±1.02). There were no between-group differences in severity of labral pathology, subchondral cysts, or edema. Individuals with MFS also self-reported significantly lower HOOS symptoms (p = 0.003), pain (p = 0.014), ADL (p = 0.028), and QOL (p = 0.014) sub-scores, indicating worse hip-related PRO in MFS. Our study results suggest that individuals with MFS exhibit early signs of acetabular cartilage degeneration and poor hip-related clinical outcomes compared to healthy individuals. Future work should investigate the underlying biomechanical mechanisms associated with hip joint degeneration in the MFS population."

    "abstract": "The Bentall procedure, using a composite valve graft, has become one of the standard therapies for aortic root disease. Patients with Marfan syndrome are prone to aortic annular dilatation and dissection and often undergo aortic root replacement, including the Bentall procedure. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the long-term outcomes of the Bentall procedure between Japanese patients with and without Marfan syndrome. Data from 294 patients who underwent the Bentall procedure over 37 years were retrospectively analyzed. The study compared the data of patients with Marfan syndrome (n = 94) and those without it (n = 200). Patient characteristics, surgical techniques, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. Statistical analyses were performed to identify risk factors associated with early mortality, late mortality, reoperation, and aortic root reoperation. The early mortality rate was 4.1%, with no significant difference between patients with and without Marfan syndrome. The long-term survival rates at 10, 20, and 30 years were 81.0%, 66.5%, and 49.1%, respectively, with no significant between-group differences. Aortic reoperations were more frequent in patients with Marfan syndrome; however, the number did not differ significantly between the groups. Risk factors for late mortality included diabetes and coronary reimplantation with an inclusion technique. Aortic dissection, Marfan syndrome, and smoking were risk factors for aortic reoperation. Late mortality after the Bentall procedure was comparable between Japanese patients with and without Marfan syndrome although aortic reoperation was significantly frequent in patients with Marfan syndrome. Continuous monitoring and management, including the prevention of aortic dissection and dilation of residual aorta, are crucial for patients with Marfan syndrome undergoing the Bentall procedure."

    "abstract": "Patients with syndromic heritable thoracic aortic diseases (sHTAD) who underwent prophylactic aortic root replacement are at high risk of distal aortic events, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This prospective, longitudinal study evaluates the impact of valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR) on aortic fluid dynamics and biomechanics in these patients. Sixteen patients with Marfan or Loeys-Dietz syndrome underwent two time-resolved three-dimensional phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (4D flow CMR) studies before (sHTAD-preSx) and after VSARR (sHTAD-postSx). Two matched cohorts of 40 healthy volunteers (HV) and 16 sHTAD patients without indication for aortic root replacement (sHTAD-NSx) with available 4D flow CMR were included for comparison. In-plane rotational flow (IRF), systolic flow reversal ratio (SFRR), wall shear stress (WSS), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and aortic strain were analyzed in the ascending (AscAo) and descending aorta (DescAo). All patients with sHTAD presented altered hemodynamics and increased stiffness (p < 0.05) compared to HV, both in the AscAo (median PWV 7.4 in sHTAD-NSx; 6.8 in sHTAD-preSx; 4.9 m/s in HV) and DescAo (median PWV 9.1 in sHTAD-NSx; 8.1 in sHTAD-preSx; 6.3 m/s in HV). Patients awaiting VSARR had markedly reduced in-plane (median IRF -2.2 vs 10.4 cm<sup>2</sup>/s in HV, p = 0.001), but increased through-plane flow rotation (median SFRR 7.8 vs 3.8% in HV, p = 0.002), and decreased WSS (0.36 vs 0.47 N/m<sup>2</sup> in HV, p = 0.004) in the proximal DescAo. After VSARR, proximal DescAo IRF (p = 0.010) and circumferential WSS increased (p = 0.011), no longer differing from HV, but SFRR, axial WSS and stiffness remained altered. Patients in which aortic tortuosity was reduced after surgery showed greater post-surgical increase in IRF compared to those in which tortuosity increased (median IRF increase 18.1 vs 3.3 cm<sup>2</sup>/s, p = 0.047). Most AscAo flow alterations were restored to physiological values after VSARR. In patients with sHTAD, VSARR partially restores downstream fluid dynamics to physiological levels. However, some flow disturbances and increased stiffness persist in the proximal DescAo. Further longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate whether persistent alterations contribute to post-surgical risk."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is associated with Marfan syndrome (MFS), a connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in fibrillin-1. Sexual dimorphism has been recorded for TAA outcomes in MFS, but detailed studies on the differences in TAA progression in males and females and their relationships to outcomes have not been performed. The aims of this study were to determine sex differences in the diameter dilatation, mechanical properties, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling over time in a severe mouse model (<i>Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup></i> = MU) of MFS-associated TAA that has a shortened life span. Male and female MU and wildtype (WT) mice were used at 1-4 mo of age. Blood pressure and in vivo diameters of the ascending thoracic aorta were recorded using a tail-cuff system and ultrasound imaging, respectively. Ex vivo mechanics and ECM remodeling of the aorta were characterized using a biaxial test system and multiphoton imaging, respectively. We showed that mechanical properties, such as structural and material stiffness, and ECM remodeling, such as elastic and collagen fiber content, correlated with diameter dilatation during TAA progression. Male MU mice had accelerated rates of diameter dilatation, stiffening, and ECM remodeling compared with female MU mice which may have contributed to their decreased life span. The correlation of mechanical properties and ECM remodeling with diameter dilatation suggests that they may be useful biomarkers for TAA progression. The differences in diameter dilatation and life spans in male and female MU mice indicate that sex is an important consideration for managing thoracic aortic aneurysm in MFS. <b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Using a mouse model (<i>Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup></i> = MU) of severe thoracic aortic aneurysm in Marfan syndrome (MFS), we found that male MU aorta had an accelerated time line and increased amounts of dilatation, stiffening, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling compared with female MU aorta that may have contributed to an increased risk of fatigue failure with cyclic loading over time and a reduced life span. We suggest that aortic stiffness may provide useful information for clinical management of aneurysms in MFS."

Regular imaging surveillance is recommended for these conditions. However, no guidelines currently exist regarding imaging modality or surveillance intervals. This retrospective single-center observational study analyzed clinical and imaging data of patients attending an outpatient clinic for vascular connective tissue disorders between August 2008 and January 2024. Imaging (1424 data points in total) and clinical data were extracted from electronic health records. Analysis primarily included a comparison of vessel diameter progression across imaging modalities, with an additional review of the clinical history of vascular events. In total, 19 patients with vascular connective tissue disorders (vCTDs) underwent consultations at our outpatient clinic. Nine (47.4%) patients experienced vascular events, while two (10.5%) passed away during the study period. Multimodal imaging surveillance revealed a tendency towards arterial diameter increase. Consistent ultrasound monitoring provided more reliable diameter progression data for the same arterial segment than a combination of imaging modalities. Temporal analysis indicated a tendency for the continuous growth of the abdominal aorta, the common and internal carotid artery, and the common femoral and popliteal artery. The study highlights the importance of standardized, modality-specific imaging protocols in monitoring patients with vCTDs. The variability in disease progression among these patients further complicates surveillance strategies, contemplating the need for individualized approaches. Further research and prospective multicenter studies are required to refine and improve monitoring protocols."

    "abstract": "Rare diseases (RDs) affect millions of individuals collectively worldwide, contributing to significant burdens on patients and families in various aspects. However, there is a lack of evidence on the underlying patterns of burdens among diverse RDs for informing targeted social and health policies to address the unmet needs of this vulnerable population. This study aimed to examine the underlying patterns of the health and economic burden of 33 different RDs in China and identify the potential determinants. A nationwide internet-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in China between 2019 and 2020. Physical and mental health burden was measured by health-related quality of life. Economic burden was evaluated based on the proportions of direct medical, direct nonmedical, and indirect costs relative to household income. We used cluster analysis to identify patterns of health and economic burdens and conducted multinomial logistic regression to explore potential predictors of cluster membership. The study included 8454 adults and 8491 children affected by 33 RDs. The following 3 clusters were identified: \"extremely high burden\" (representing 92/8454, 1.1% and 19/8491, 0.2% of adult and pediatric patients, respectively), \"overall high burden\" (5933/8454, 70.2% and 4864/8491, 57.3%, respectively), and \"overall low burden\" (2429/8454, 28.7% and 3608/8491, 42.5%, respectively). Wilson disease, Marfan syndrome, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis more likely resulted in an \"extremely high burden\" than others. Poverty was significantly associated with being in this extremely high burden group. Diseases causing neuromuscular symptoms and requiring long-term treatment (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinocerebellar ataxia, and Dravet syndrome) were prevalent in the \"overall high burden\" group. Key predictors of this group included older age, lower socioeconomic status, diagnostic delay, and comorbidity. This study provides novel and valuable evidence on the burden of RDs in developing regions like China. The findings reveal significant disparities in the impact of RDs, emphasizing the need for targeted health care interventions and policies."

This retrospective study examined 230 consecutive patients who underwent TAAA repair between 2012 and 2022, including of 69 MFS patients and 161 non-MFS patients. The primary endpoint was long-term mortality. The secondary endpoint was a composite of early adverse events, including early mortality, permanent stroke, permanent paraplegia, permanent renal failure, and reoperation. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the impact of MFS on early composite adverse events, and univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to evaluate the association between MFS and overall mortality. Compared with non-MFS patients, MFS patients were younger (mean, 31.9 ± 8.5 years vs 44.8 ± 12.3 years; P < .001), had less comorbid coronary artery disease (0 vs 8.1%; P = .034), more frequently underwent Crawford extent III repair (56.5% vs 34.8%; P = .002) and applied normothermic iliac perfusion (91.3% vs 81.4%; P = .057). There was no significant difference in the rate of early composite adverse events between the MFS and non-MFS groups (23.2% vs 14.3%; P = .099), which was verified by multivariable logistic regression analyses with multiple models. Overall mortality was significantly lower in the MFS group compared to the non-MFS group (P = .026, log-rank test), with 1-, 5-, and 10-year cumulative mortality of 4.4% versus 8.7%, 8.1% versus 17.2%, and 20.9% versus 36.4%, respectively. Multivariable Cox regression analyses across different models further confirmed MFS as a significant protective factor for overall mortality (model 1: hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13-0.73; P = .007; model 2: HR, 0.32, 95% CI, 0.13-0.75; P = .009; model 3: HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15-0.95; P = .039).

Echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) showed an aortic root diameter of 55 mm and a large aneurysm of an aberrant right subclavian artery. Following multidisciplinary team discussion, valve-sparing aortic root and ascending aortic replacement was performed at 22 weeks of gestation without any complications. During the remaining pregnancy, the patient had frequent clinical and CMR follow-up investigations showing a mild increased size of the subclavian aneurysm. Uncomplicated caesarean delivery was performed at 35 weeks of gestation, and the subclavian artery aneurysm was successfully treated by interventional embolization. Although cardiovascular surgery in our patient during pregnancy was uncomplicated, the case illustrates that pre-pregnancy counselling in Marfan patients is recommended to reduce the risk for mother and child."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is an uncommon and frequently misdiagnosed condition characterized by a lower-than-normal volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) caused by leakage of CSF through the dural membrane. The primary manifestation of SIH is an orthostatic headache, which is frequently accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Patients with connective tissue disorders are at increased risk for spontaneous CSF leaks due to the structural weakness of their dural membranes. An 18-year-old woman with no reported past medical history presented to the emergency department with 10 days of a bifrontal headache that was orthostatic in nature with associated nausea and vomiting. She was noted to have several marfanoid features on physical examination. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension was ultimately diagnosed and treated successfully with an epidural blood patch. Subsequent genetic testing revealed a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is an uncommon cause of headache. Individuals with connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome are at increased risk for SIH. Knowledge of the relationship between these two conditions allows for a more rapid diagnosis of SIH."

    "abstract": "Mitral valve regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction are cardiovascular symptoms of Marfan syndrome. There is a paucity of information on tricuspid valve regurgitation and right ventricular function. In patients with Marfan syndrome, we looked at long-term changes in right ventricular function, tricuspid valve regurgitation and freedom from tricuspid valve repair. Retrospective-observational single-centre analysis on right ventricular function and tricuspid regurgitation in Marfan patients who underwent surgery with cardioplegic arrest between 1995 and 2020. Patients were followed-up from 1st operation until death, with echocardiographic changes analysed longitudinally. Composite end point was tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) ≤16 mm, severe tricuspid regurgitation or tricuspid repair. The study included 135 patients who underwent 193 operations, 58 of those were reoperations in 40 patients. Median age at 1st operation was 35 years [interquartile range (IQR) 26-46], median follow-up was 8.0 years (IQR 3.0-16.0) and median time to 1st reoperation was 7.5 years (IQR 3.4-12.5). The composite end point occurred in 81 observations in 40 patients, mostly as a recurrent event, after median 7.0 years (IQR 1.0-13.0). Ten-year cumulative incidence for composite end point was 22.0% (95% CI 15-31) and 9.0% (95% CI 4.4-16) for new-onset TAPSE ≤16 mm, but no significant change in TAPSE was observed at 10 years. Tricuspid regurgitation was associated with increased risk of annual progression (P < 0.001), but not clinically relevant at 10 years. Actuarial 10-year survival was 91.1%. In Marfan patients with a history of cardiac surgery and subsequent reoperations, the right ventricular function remains stable. The incidence of severe tricuspid regurgitation and tricuspid repair remain low."

Cardinal manifestations involve the cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal systems. Clinical diagnosis is based on the revised Ghent nosology. We present the case of a child with a Marfan systemic score of 9 whose genetic study revealed two pathogenic mosaic frameshift variants in the FBN1 gene. Mosaicism is very rare in patients diagnosed with MFS, and this is the first description of a patient with two pathogenic mosaic variants in the FBN1 gene. Both variants are present in cells derived from ectodermal (buccal swab) and mesodermal (leukocyte) tissues, suggesting a mutation prior to gastrulation. We propose a defective repair of the de novo variant in the complementary strand as the mechanism that led this individual to be a carrier of two different populations of mutant cells carrying adjacent variants."

Previous early studies showed hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) may also have increased risk, with echocardiography screening recommended; subsequent studies have not confirmed the risk or recommended echocardiography. This pediatric-based study assessed aortic dilation prevalence in those with hEDS by serial echocardiographic examinations and assessed family history for aortic dissections. We retrospectively identified individuals with hEDS who had echocardiography studies from the electronic medical records at one pediatric center. Aortic root Z-scores >2.0 were found in 15/225 subjects (average age 12.9 years) on initial echocardiograms, with no Z-score >3.0. Subsequent studies (n = 68) found statistically significant decline in aortic root Z-scores. Repeat echocardiography in those with initial aortic root Z-score >2.0 (n = 10) demonstrated a decline in Z score <2.0 in seven. On final examination, 9/225 (4.0%) had a Z-score >2.0, not statistically different from the general population. No aortic dissection occurred in first- or second-degree relatives. In conclusion, aortic root dilation rate in hEDS is likely not different from the general population. We propose that in the absence of other cardiac findings or suspicion for another disorder, echocardiography is not required in hEDS."

    "title": "Pulmonary artery aneurysm: computed tomography (CT) imaging findings and diagnosis.",
    "abstract": "Pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) is a rare pulmonary vascular disease with nonspecific symptoms and various etiologies. As the disease progresses, in addition to the dilation of the pulmonary arteries, it may be accompanied by remodeling of the cardiac structure and changes in the morphology of the aorta. Recognizing the cause of PAA is therefore a clinically challenging task. In this review article, we provide an overview of various causes of PAA with the support of corresponding imaging findings on computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) examination. Firstly, from the perspective of hemodynamics, a logical diagnosis is provided according to whether the main pulmonary artery (MPA) is dilated, and whether the PA is dilated locally or diffusely. Secondly, for the imaging examination of vascular wall lesions, due to the limitations of ultrasound examination and interventional procedures, the irreplaceability of dual-phase CTPA examination in disease assessment is especially emphasized. Finally, for highly suspected disorders, it is necessary to comprehensively check with the patient whether there is a family history or past medical history. For patients with PAA, especially those with Marfan syndrome (MFS) or arteritis, adequate preoperative imaging evaluation, regular postoperative radiographic follow-up, and concurrent treatment of the underlying disease (if necessary) are crucial, which are related to the prognosis and long-term quality of life of such patients. Despite the nonspecific features of PAA presentation, a thorough examination of the patient's clinical history and imaging characteristics will play an important role in diagnosing PAA and planning patient management strategies."

We present the case of a 72-year-old man with nonsyndromic TAAD undergoing prophylactic surgery after a gene panel test revealed a pathogenic variant in <i>TGFBR1</i>, but the indication for genetic testing in such elderly-onset cases still warrants further discussion. Hereditary thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) is a <i>serious</i> clinical condition resulting in a fatal outcome. Recently, variants in causative genes for syndromic hereditary TAAD, such as Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), have been reported to predispose to the development of nonsyndromic TAAD; however, genetic testing for patients with elderly-onset nonsyndromic TAAD warrants further discussion. We present a 72-year-old nonsyndromic Japanese man with moderate-sized aortic annulus ectasia (AAE) with moderate aortic regurgitation and ascending to distal arch aortic dilatation (maximum diameter: 46 mm). He had been treated for hypertension and dyslipidemia for 7 years, and his eldest son had AAE at 33 years old and type A aortic dissection at 43 years old. Surgical repair was considered a treatment option because the patient potentially had a nonsyndromic hereditary aortic disease, and genetic panel testing for TAAD identified a pathogenic missense variant in <i>TGFBR1</i> (c.934G > A, p.[Gly312Ser]), previously reported in patients with LDS type 1. He was diagnosed with nonsyndromic <i>TGFBR1</i>-related aortopathy and underwent prophylactic surgery using a modified Bentall operation and total arch replacement with open stent graft implantation. Genetic testing was useful in guiding the treatment strategy, but further analysis is warranted to establish the clinical value in the treatment plan for patients with elderly-onset nonsyndromic TAAD."

    "title": "Cardiovascular Management of Aortopathy in Children: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.",
    "abstract": "Aortopathy encompasses a spectrum of conditions predisposing to dilation, aneurysm, dissection, or rupture of the aorta and other blood vessels. Aortopathy is diagnosed commonly in children, from infancy through adolescence, primarily affecting the thoracic aorta, with variable involvement of the peripheral vasculature. Pathogeneses include connective tissue disorders, smooth muscle contraction disorders, and congenital heart disease, including bicuspid aortic valve, among others. The American Heart Association has published guidelines for diagnosis and management of thoracic aortic disease. However, these guidelines are predominantly focused on adults and cannot be applied adeptly to growing children with emerging features, growth and developmental changes, including puberty, and different risk profiles compared with adults. Management to reduce risk of progressive aortic dilation and dissection or rupture in children is complex and involves genetic testing, cardiovascular imaging, medical therapy, lifestyle modifications, and surgical guidance that differ in many ways from adult management. Pediatric practice varies widely, likely because aortopathy is pathogenically heterogeneous, including genetic and nongenetic conditions, and there is limited published evidence to guide care in children. To optimize care and reduce variation in management, experts in pediatric aortopathy convened to generate this scientific statement regarding the cardiovascular care of children with aortopathy. Available evidence and expert consensus were combined to create this scientific statement. The most common causes of pediatric aortopathy are reviewed. This document provides a general framework for cardiovascular management of aortopathy in children, while allowing for modification based on the personal and familial characteristics of each child and family."

    "abstract": "Mutations in fibrillin 1 (FBN1) is the main cause of Marfan syndrome (MFS) with thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) as the main complication. Activation of the complement system plays a key role in the formation of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms. However, the role of the complement system in MFS-associated aortic aneurysms remains unclear. In this study, we observed increased levels of complement C3a and C5a in the plasma of MFS patients and mouse, and the increased deposition of the activated complement system product C3b/iC3b was also observed in the elastic fiber rupture zone of 3-month-old MFS mice. The expression of C3a receptor (C3aR) was increased in MFS aortas, and recombinant C3a promoted the expression of cytokines in macrophages. The administration of a C3aR antagonist (C3aRA) attenuated the development of thoracic aortic aneurysms in MFS mice. The increased inflammation response and matrix metalloproteinases activities were also attenuated by C3aRA treatment in MFS mice. Therefore, these findings indicate that the complement C3a/C3aR inhibition alleviates the formation of aortic aneurysm in Marfan syndrome mice."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) represent a serious health concern, as they are associated with early aortic dissection and rupture. TAA formation is triggered by genetic conditions, in particular Marfan syndrome (MFS) and bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). During the aneurysmatic process, aortic endothelial cells can undergo endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (End-MT) with consequent phenotypic and functional alterations. We previously documented that MFS TAA is characterized by miR-632-driven End-MT exacerbation, whereas in BAV aortopathy, the occurrence of this process remains still controversial. We investigated the End-MT process and the underlined regulatory mechanisms in BAV, TAV and MFS TAA tissues. Gene expression and immunohistochemical analysis were performed in order to analyze some important miRNAs and genes characterizing End-MT. We documented that BAV endothelium maintains the expression of the endothelial homeostasis markers, such as <i>ERG</i>, <i>CD31</i> and miR-126-5p, while it shows lower levels of miR-632 and mesenchymal markers compared with MFS. Interestingly, we also found higher levels of miR-632 in MFS patients' blood. Our findings definitively demonstrate that the End-MT process does not characterize BAV that, among the other TAAs, better maintains the endothelial features. In addition, our results suggest miR-632 as a promising diagnostic/prognostic factor in MFS aortopathy."

This report presents the case of a patient with Marfan syndrome who experienced aortic root pseudoaneurysm and subacute severe aortic regurgitation following a traffic accident. A 64-year-old woman was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome 16 years ago and is undergoing ongoing follow-up at an outpatient clinic. Eight years previously, the patient underwent total arch replacement combined with J-graft open stent graft<sup>®</sup> (JGOS; Japan Lifeline Co., Tokyo, Japan) deployment for acute type A dissection. Five months before presentation, the patient suffered a left rib fracture in a traffic accident and received conservative management at a local hospital. The patient presented to the emergency room with worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea. Echocardiography revealed severe aortic regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Computed tomography revealed new-onset pseudoaneurysm at the aortic root. Surgical repair was successfully performed using a modified Bentall procedure with a bioprosthetic valve and tricuspid annuloplasty. Intraoperative findings revealed pseudoaneurysm with perforation of the right sinus of Valsalva. Although the left and right aortic valve leaflets were normal, the noncoronary leaflet exhibited a ruptured fibrous strand of a cusp fenestration, resulting in acute aortic regurgitation. This case report highlights the rare occurrence of aortic root pseudoaneurysm and subacute aortic regurgitation following a traffic accident. In cases of blunt chest trauma, particularly in patients with Marfan syndrome, frequent examination is crucial to assess the possibility of posttraumatic aortic regurgitation and aortic injury."

The subsequent drop in neutrophil counts from 7.54 × 10^9/L to 0.87 × 10^9/L leads to the discontinuation of ceftriaxone and the administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which effectively restored the neutrophil levels.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we analyze and compare literature on in vivo aortic stiffness measures in Marfan patients. Our aim is to assess the potential of these measurements as early indicators of aortic dilatation. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we collected literature on diameter and three in vivo stiffness measures: Pulse wave velocity (PWV), <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>β</mi></math> -stiffness index (SI) and distensibility, at five different aortic locations in patients with Marfan syndrome. Results were reviewed and compared against each other. For meta-analysis, an augmented dataset was created by combining data from the literature. Regression with respect to age and statistical comparisons were performed. Thirty articles reporting data from 1925 patients with Marfan and 836 patients without Marfan were reviewed. PWV was found to be higher in Marfan, but only in dilated aortas. Distensibility was found to be lower even in non-dilated aortas, and its decrease was associated with higher chances of developing aortic dilatation. <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>β</mi></math> -SI was higher in Marfan patients and was positively correlated with the rate of aortic dilatation, emphasizing its role as a valuable indicator. In our meta-analysis, all stiffness measures showed a significant variation with age. Distensibility and <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>β</mi></math> -stiffness index were different in Marfan patients at all locations, and the difference was more pronounced after accounting for age-related variation. From the literature, <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>β</mi></math> -SI and distensibility emerge as the best predictors of future aortic dilatation.

However, the description of self-care behaviors and their determinants in patients with Marfan syndrome are highly under-described. The adopted design was descriptive observational with a cross-sectional data collection on 111 patients with MFS in a single Italian specialized and reference center for this disease between 2020 and 2021. Performing healthy activities and managing illness, therapies, and follow-ups to maintain health over time (self-care maintenance) was almost adequate (mean score = 67.87 ± 13.17), as well as the ability to recognize signs and symptoms promptly (self-care monitoring, mean score = 67.95 ± 26.70).

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder caused by pathogenic mutations in FBN1. In bone, the protein fibrillin-1 is found in the extracellular matrix where it provides structural support of elastic fiber formation, stability for basement membrane, and regulates the bioavailability of growth factors. Individuals with MFS exhibit a range of skeletal complications including low bone mineral density and long bone overgrowth. However, it remains unknown if the bone phenotype is caused by alteration of fibrillin-1's structural function or distortion of its interactions with bone cells. To assess the structural effects of the fibrillin-1 mutation, we characterized bone curvature, microarchitecture, composition, porosity, and mechanical behavior in the <i>Fbn1</i> <sup>C1041G/+</sup> mouse model of MFS. Tibiae of 10, 26, and 52-week-old female <i>Fbn1</i> <sup>C1041G/+</sup> and littermate control (LC) mice were analyzed. Mechanical behavior was assessed via in vivo strain gauging, finite element analysis, <i>ex vivo</i> three-point bending, and nanoindentation. Tibial bone morphology and curvature were assessed with micro computed tomography (μCT). Bone composition was measured with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging. Vascular and osteocyte lacunar porosity were assessed by synchrotron computed tomography. <i>Fbn1</i> <sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice exhibited long bone overgrowth and osteopenia consistent with the MFS phenotype. Trabecular thickness was lower in <i>Fbn1</i> <sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice but cortical bone microarchitecture was similar in <i>Fbn1</i> <sup>C1041G/+</sup> and LC mice. Whole bone curvature was straighter below the tibio-fibular junction in the medial-lateral direction and more curved above in LC compared to <i>Fbn1</i> <sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice. The bone matrix crystallinity was 4 % lower in <i>Fbn1</i> <sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice compared to LC, implying that mineral platelets in LCs have greater crystal size and perfection than <i>Fbn1</i> <sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice. Structural and mechanical properties were similar between genotypes. Cortical diaphyseal lacunar porosity was lower in <i>Fbn1</i> <sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice compared to LC; this was a result of the average volume of an individual osteocyte lacunae being smaller. These data provide valuable insights into the bone phenotype and its contribution to fracture risk in this commonly used mouse model of MFS."

    "title": "Mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair as a bridge to treat aortic dissecting aneurysm in a case of Marfan syndrome: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome is an inherited disorder that manifests with various cardiovascular conditions. This case report discusses a patient with Marfan syndrome presenting with concurrent dissecting aortic aneurysm and acute mitral valve regurgitation (MR), exploring treatment strategies for this unique case. A 57-year-old man diagnosed with Marfan syndrome presented with progressive dyspnoea and awareness of orthopnoea. Acute heart failure (HF) due to acute MR associated with chordae rupture was diagnosed. However, contrast-enhanced CT revealed the coexistence of a massive dissecting aortic aneurysm, indicating surgical intervention. The dissecting aortic aneurysm extended over a large area. Given the high risk of simultaneous surgery with the mitral valve, a staged approach was adopted. Mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (MV-TEER) was performed as the initial step to reduce the perioperative HF risk, followed by a planned two-stage surgery for the dissecting aortic aneurysm. This strategy effectively facilitated surgical intervention for the dissecting aortic aneurysm in the chronic phase after MV-TEER. Several reports showed the effectiveness of MV-TEER in cases of degenerative MR where surgical operation carries a high risk, but case report of MV-TEER in Marfan syndrome is rare. In recent years, the effectiveness of MV-TEER has also been reported as a 'bridge therapy' for heart transplantation. Mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair is considered a potential option to serve as a bridge to other invasive intervention."

    "abstract": "Large-scale investigations on ascending aortic diameter, especially in the Asian population, are lacking. Furthermore, relevant evidence regarding the distribution of hypertension (HP), bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), and Marfan syndrome (MFS) is scarce. We aimed to examine the distribution of ascending aortic diameter in these populations in China. The data of a total number of 698 795 individuals who underwent cardiac ultrasound were subjected to retrospective analysis. After screening, 647 087 individuals were included in the final analysis. In the normal population, the mean ascending aortic diameter was 28.1 ± 3.2 mm (27.2 ± 3.1 mm in women vs. 29.0 ± 3.1 mm in men) (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Aortic diameter increased gradually with age (<i>P</i> < 0.001). The prevalence of aortic dilation, aneurysm, and dissection in individuals with HP was 12.83%, 2.70%, and 4.77%, respectively. In individuals with MFS, the corresponding rates were 43.92%, 35.31%, and 26.11%. Notably, although BAV patients had high incidences of aortic dilation (37.00%) and aortic aneurysm (16.46%), the incidence of aortic dissection was relatively low (0.74%). Most cases of aortic dissection occurred at an aortic diameter of less than 55 mm. However, in the overall population, the incidence of aortic dissection significantly increased with the increase in the aortic diameter, revealing the existence of an 'aortic paradox'. (i) The ascending diameter increases with age and is larger in men than in women; (ii) 'Aortic paradox' is explained; (iii) BAV bears a high rate of aortic dilation, but a low incidence of aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has been recognized as an important cause of acute coronary syndrome in women ≤ 50 years old, and up to 43% of pregnancy-associated myocardial infarction. SCAD has a strong association with extra-coronary arteriopathies, including either more common entities such as dissections, intracranial or other aneurysms, and extra-coronary and coronary arterial tortuosity or less common inherited vascular disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, leading to the conclusion that systemic arterial disorders may underlie SCAD. Fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common extra-coronary vascular abnormality identified among these patients, also sharing a common genetic variant with SCAD. The American Heart Association, in a scientific statement regarding the management of SCAD, recommends that patients with SCAD should undergo additional evaluation with imaging techniques including either computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). MRA has been shown to have sufficient diagnostic accuracy in identifying extra-coronary arterial abnormalities, almost equal to CTA and conventional angiography. The aim of this review is to appraise the most recent important evidence of extra-coronary arteriopathy in the setting of SCAD and to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of various non-invasive imaging methods for screening of extra-coronary arteriopathies in patients with SCAD."

A retrospective review of electronic medical records from December 2012 to December 2020 was conducted. Two hundred and ninety-seven consecutive children ≤18 years of age at presentation were identified and analyzed for demographic details, patient distribution, lens subluxation, visual, and refractive profiles before and after the interventions. Five hundred and ninety-four eyes of 297 (male 56%; <i>n</i> = 166) patients were analyzed. The mean age at presentation was 8.74 ± 3.89. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at presentation ranged from 0.3 logMAR to 3.5 logMAR; (Snellen: 6/9 - close to face [CF]) (mean 0.89 ± 0.68). High myopia (<i>n</i> = 201; 33.83%) and mild astigmatism (<i>n</i> = 340; 57.23%) were more frequent. Temporal (<i>n</i> = 108; 18.18%) subluxation was most common followed by superior. Lensectomy with limited vitrectomy was performed in 243 eyes of 127 patients (40.90%). Median preoperative BCVA was 1.0 (range: 0.3-3.5 logMAR; 20/40 - CF). Median postoperative BCVA was 0.5 logMAR (6/18) in the pseudophakic group and 0.6 logMAR (6/24) in the aphakic group. Spherical equivalent in myopic children reduced from -12.06 ± 6.84D to -1.57D (-0.25D to - 5.5D) in the pseudophakic group and +9.3D (+5.5D to 15.5D) in the aphakic group. This study is a large cohort of children presenting with ectopia lentis. Following intervention, an improvement in the median BCVA and refractive correction was noted in the entire cohort."

    "abstract": "In heritable aortic diseases, different vascular involvement may occur with potential variable implications in aortic dilation/dissection risk. This study aimed to analyze the aortic anatomy of individuals with Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome to identify possible morphological differences. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracoabdominal aorta from the proximal supra-aortic vessels to the femoral bifurcation level of 114 patients with Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes and 20 matched control subjects were examined. Aortic diameters, areas, length, and tortuosity were measured in different aortic segments using specific vessel analysis software. Patients with Marfan syndrome showed a higher prevalence of ascending aorta and aortic root dilation (<i>P</i> = .011), larger and longer aortic roots (<i>P</i> = .013) with pear-shaped phenotype, larger isthmus/descending aorta diameter ratio (<i>P</i> = .015), and larger suprarenal aorta and iliac arteries. Patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome showed longer indexed segments and a significantly longer arch (<i>P</i> = .006) with type 2/3 arch prevalence (<i>P</i> = .097). Measurement ratios analysis provided cut-off values (aortic root to ascending aorta length/aortic root diameter, aortic root/sinotubular junction, aortic root/ascending aorta diameter) differentiating patients with Marfan syndrome from patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, even in the early stage of the disease. Both syndromes show peculiar anatomic patterns at different aortic levels irrespective of aortic dilation and disease severity. These features may represent the expression of different genetic mutations on aortic development, with a potential impact on prognosis and possibly contributing to better management of the diseases. The systematic adoption of whole body imaging with magnetic resonance or computed tomography should always be considered, because they allow a complete vascular assessment with practical indicators of differential diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Evaluate long-term outcomes following Cionni modified capsule tension ring (MCTR) and in-the-bag intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in subluxated lenses. Retrospective case series. Forty-one eyes of 31 patients from Raghudeep Eye Hospital, India, with subluxated lenses who had completed a minimum of 5 years' postoperative follow-up were included. Lens extraction, capsular bag fixation with MCTR using 9-0 polypropylene suture, and in-the-bag IOL implantation were performed in all eyes. Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), IOL centration, posterior capsule opacification, glaucoma, and retinal complications were documented at final follow-up. The mean age of the cohort was 20.48 ± 16.46 (SD) years. Twenty-four eyes (58%) were below 15 years of age at the time of surgery. Marfan syndrome accounted for 37% cases. Mean follow-up was 9.89 ± 3.81 (SD) years. Thirty-two eyes (74%) had a CDVA of ≥0.3 logMAR at final follow-up. IOL decentration was noted in 7 eyes (17%), requiring a secondary surgery. The mean duration from primary surgery to resurgery was 8.79 years. Seventeen eyes (41%) required a laser capsulotomy, 88% of which were pediatric eyes. Retinal detachment occurred in 4 eyes (10%), 3 of which had Marfan syndrome. Capsular bag fixation with an MCTR using 9-0 polypropylene and in-the-bag IOL implantation had good long-term visual outcomes with an acceptable rate of serious postoperative complications in eyes with subluxated lenses. This approach allows preservation of the natural compartments of the eye and placement of an IOL in its most physiological position. However, considering a 17% rate of IOL decentration requiring surgical intervention, long-term stability with nonbiodegradable suture materials such as polytetrafluoroethylene as well as decentration rates following sutured or sutureless scleral fixation should be compared."

All patients presenting to our clinic from August 2017 to October 2023 with a suspected inherited heart disease and consenting for genetic testing were included. The probands were grouped into familial cardiomyopathies namely hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) and peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), channelopathies namely congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) and Brugada syndrome (BrS), and heritable connective tissue disorder namely Marfan Syndrome (MFS). Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used, and pre-test and post-test counseling were provided to probands and cascade screening offered to relatives. Mean age of the subjects (n = 77; 48 probands, 29 relatives) was 43 ± 18 years, 68 % male and 44 % symptomatic, with 36 HCM, 3 DCM, 3 ACM, 1 PPCM, 3 LQTS, 1 BrS and 1 MFS probands. The diagnostic yield of NGS-based genetic testing was 31 %; variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were identified in 54 %; and 15 % were genotype-negative. Twenty-nine relatives from 18 families with HCM (n = 12), DCM (n = 3), ACM (n = 2) and MFS (n = 1) underwent genetic testing. The genotype positive probands/relatives and VUS carriers with strong disease phenotype and/or high risk variant were advised periodic follow-up; the remaining probands/relatives were discharged from further clinical surveillance. Genetic testing guides treatment and follow-up of patients with inherited heart diseases and should be carried out in dedicated multidisciplinary clinics with expertise for counseling and cascade screening of family members."

    "abstract": "Hereditary connective tissue disorders (HCTDs) are a heterogeneous group of inherited diseases. These disorders show genetic mutations with loss of function of primary components of connective tissue, such as collagen and elastic fibers. There are more than 200 conditions that involve hereditary connective tissue disorders, while the most known are Marfan syndrome, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. These disorders need continuous updates, multidisciplinary skills, and specific methodologic evaluations sharing many medicolegal issues. Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes show a high risk of early sudden death. As a consequence of this, postmortem genetic testing can identify novel genotype-phenotype correlations which help the clinicians to assess personalized cardiovascular screening programs among the ill subjects. Genetic testing is also essential to identify children suffering from Osteogenesis Imperfecta, especially when a physical abuse is clinically suspected. However, this is a well-known clinical problem even though there are still challenges to interpret genetic data and variants of unknown significance due to the current extensive use of new genetic/genomic techniques. Additionally, the more significant applications and complexities of genomic testing raise novel responsibilities on the clinicians, geneticists, and forensic practitioners as well, increasing potential liability and medical malpractice claims. This systematic review provides a detailed overview on how multidisciplinary skills belonging to clinicians, medicolegal consultants, radiologists, and geneticists can cooperate to manage HCTDs from autopsy or clinical findings to genetic testing. Thus, technical aspects need to be addressed to the medicolegal community since there is no consensus works or guidelines which specifically discuss these issues."

On examination of the patient, features suggestive of Marfan syndrome were revealed, as well as bilateral intraocular lens subluxation. <b>Results:</b> The patient was refracted and glasses were recommended, which improved his vision. The patient was referred to the cardiology, orthopedic, and dental departments for a multidisciplinary approach to prevent complications and further management. <b>Discussion:</b> Lens subluxation is frequently presented as a primary clinical manifestation of Marfan syndrome. It can vary from asymptomatic, which is seen only after pupillary dilation, to significant subluxation, in which the equator of the lens in the pupillary axis causes diplopia or decreased vision. <b>Conclusion:</b> This case underscored the importance of considering the rare feature of Marfan syndrome."

    "abstract": "Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder due to mutations in fibrillin-1 ( <i>Fbn1</i> ), where a <i>Fbn1</i> missense mutation ( <i>Fbn1 <sup>C1039G/+</sup></i> ) can result in systemic increases in the bioavailability and signaling of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). In a well-established mouse model of MFS ( <i>Fbn1 <sup>C1041G/+</sup></i> ), pre-mature aging of the aortic wall and the progression of aortic root aneurysm are observed by 6-months-of-age. TGF-β signaling has been implicated in cerebrovascular dysfunction, loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and age-related neuroinflammation. We have reported that pre-mature vascular aging in MFS mice could extend to cerebrovasculature, where peak blood flow velocity in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) of 6-month-old (6M) MFS mice was reduced, similarly to 12-month-old (12M) control mice. Case studies of MFS patients have documented neurovascular manifestations, including intracranial aneurysms, stroke, arterial tortuosity, as well as headaches and migraines, with reported incidence of pain and chronic fatigue. Despite these significant clinical observations, investigation into cerebrovascular dysfunction and neuropathology in MFS remains limited. Using 6M-control ( <i>C57BL/6</i> ) and 6M-MFS ( <i>Fbn1 <sup>C1041G/+</sup></i> ) and healthy 12M-control male and female mice, we test the hypothesis that abnormal Fbn1 protein expression is associated with altered cerebral microvascular density, BBB permeability, and neuroinflammation in the PCA-perfused hippocampus, all indicative of a pre-mature aging brain phenotype. Using Glut1 staining, 6M-MFS mice and 12M-CTRL similarly present decreased microvascular density in the dentate gyrus (DG), cornu ammonis 1 (CA1), and cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) regions of the hippocampus. 6M-MFS mice exhibit increased BBB permeability in the DG, CA1, and CA3 as evident by Immunoglobulin G (IgG) staining, which was more comparable to 12M-CTRL mice. 6M-MFS mice show a higher number of microglia in the hippocampus compared to age-matched control mice, a pattern resembling that of 12M-CTRL mice. This study represents the first known investigation into neuropathology in a mouse model of MFS and indicates that the pathophysiology underlying MFS leads to a systemic pre-mature aging phenotype. This study is crucial for identifying and understanding MFS-associated neurovascular and neurological abnormalities, underscoring the need for research aimed at improving the quality of life and managing pre-mature aging symptoms in MFS and related connective tissue disorders."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a rare congenital disorder of the connective tissue, leading to thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) and dissection, among other complications. Currently, the most efficient strategy to prevent life-threatening dissection is preventive surgery. Periodic imaging applying complex techniques is required to monitor TAA progression and to guide the timing of surgical intervention. Thus, there is an acute demand for non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as for innovative therapeutic targets of MFS. Unraveling the intricate pathomolecular mechanisms underlying the syndrome is vital to address these needs. High-throughput platforms are particularly well-suited for this purpose, as they enable the integration of different datasets, such as transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles. In this narrative review, we summarize relevant studies investigating changes in both the coding and non-coding transcriptome and epigenome in MFS-induced TAA. The collective findings highlight the implicated pathways, such as TGF-β signaling, extracellular matrix structure, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Potential candidates as biomarkers, such as miR-200c, as well as therapeutic targets emerged, like Tfam, associated with mitochondrial respiration, or miR-632, stimulating endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. While these discoveries are promising, rigorous and extensive validation in large patient cohorts is indispensable to confirm their clinical relevance and therapeutic potential."

Here, we present two females with MFS who developed pediatric neuroblastoma. Patient 1 presented with neonatal MFS and developed an adrenal neuroblastoma with unfavorable tumor genetics at 10 months of age. Whole genome sequencing revealed a germline de novo missense FBN1 variant (NP_000129.3:p.(Asp1322Asn)), resulting in intron 32 inclusion and exon 32 retention. Patient 2 was diagnosed with classic MFS, caused by a germline de novo frameshift variant in FBN1 (NP_000129.3:p.(Cys805Ter)). At 18 years, she developed high-risk neuroblastoma with a somatic ALK pathogenic variant (NP_004295.2:p.(Arg1275Gln)). We identified 32 reported cases of MFS with cancer in PubMed, yet none with neuroblastoma. Among patients, we observed an early cancer onset and high frequency of MFS complications. We also queried cancer databases for somatic FBN1 variants, finding 49 alterations reported in PeCan, and variants in 2% of patients in cBioPortal. In conclusion, we report the first two patients with MFS and neuroblastoma and highlight an early age at cancer diagnosis in reported patients with MFS. Further epidemiological and functional studies are needed to clarify the growing evidence linking MFS and cancer."

The wide range of phenotypic presentations, spanning from mild, chronic, and asymptomatic to acute and life-threatening, can pose challenges in diagnosing MFS when disease manifestations are subtle. We report a pathogenetic variant of MFS characterized by subtle systemic findings that was identified only after the patient presented with visual changes and pain associated with angle closure, despite a medical history indicating other pathologies linked to this condition. This case underscores the importance of recognizing the varied and sometimes subtle clinical features of MFS. Vigilance in identifying the constellation of findings associated with MFS can enhance its diagnosis and treatment outcomes by enabling appropriate and timely referrals for prophylactic evaluation and care to address potentially life-threatening complications."

Over the span of 15 years (2008-2022), all surgically resected specimens of aorta showing aortopathy in all age groups were studied. Particular attention was paid to the changes in the media to assess the extent, grade and severity of aortopathy. During the 15-year study period, 73 surgically resected specimens of the ascending aorta showed features of aortopathy. There were 48 males and 25 females, who had chief complaints of dyspnea, chest pain and palpitation.

IOL implantation in children with pathology of the ligamentous apparatus of the lens remains an urgent problem of ophthalmic surgery due to the lack of a consensus regarding the IOL fixation method among practitioners. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of IOL implantation with transscleral fixation using the knotless Z-suture technique in pediatric patients with congenital lens subluxation. The study included 24 children (36 eyes) with grade III congenital subluxation of the lens who underwent phacoaspiration of the subluxated lens with IOL implantation with transscleral fixation using the knotless Z-suture performed in the Kazakh Research Institute of Eye Diseases in Almaty in the period from 2017 to 2021. The average observation period was 31.7±11.3 months (2.0 to 4.5 years). The stability of the IOL position, the state of the intrascleral sutures, visual acuity after surgery, the presence and severity of complications in the long-term period were evaluated. All patients (100%) had a significant improvement in visual acuity after surgery. No intraoperative complications were registered in any of the cases. Postoperative complications were noted in 8.3% of cases (<i>n</i>=3). The final functional outcome of surgical treatment depended on the presence of concomitant pathology, the main cause of low vision was the development of refractive amblyopia due to refractive errors. The presented technique of transscleral fixation of IOL has proven to be reliable, which is especially important for pediatric patients considering their high physical activity and expected lifespan."

Most cases are due to heterozygous mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1). Other associated genes include LTBP2, MYH11, MYLK, and SLC2A10. There is significant clinical overlap between MFS and other Marfan-like disorders. To expand the mutation spectrum of FBN1 gene and validate the pathogenicity of Marfan-related genes in patients with MFS and ocular manifestations. We recruited 318 participants (195 cases, 123 controls), including 59 sporadic cases and 88 families. All patients had comprehensive ophthalmic examinations showing ocular features of MFS and met Ghent criteria. Additionally, 754 cases with other eye diseases were recruited. Panel-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) screened mutations in 792 genes related to inherited eye diseases. We detected 181 mutations with an 84.7% detection rate in sporadic cases and 87.5% in familial cases. The overall detection rate was 86.4%, with FBN1 accounting for 74.8%. In cases without FBN1 mutations, 23 mutations from seven Marfan-related genes were identified, including four pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in LTBP2. The 181 mutations included 165 missenses, 10 splicings, three frameshifts, and three nonsenses. FBN1 accounted for 53.0% of mutations. The most prevalent pathogenic mutation was FBN1 c.4096G>A. Additionally, 94 novel mutations were detected, with 13 de novo mutations in 14 families. We expanded the mutation spectrum of the FBN1 gene and provided evidence for the pathogenicity of other Marfan-related genes.

Molecular genetic analysis of FBN1 gene mutations in patients was performed using next-generation sequencing based on a panel of ocular genetic diseases, and the impact of the genotype and anterior segment biometric parameters on the posterior segment manifestations was analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Sixty patients exhibited posterior segment lesions, including retinal detachment (4 cases, 3.31%), macular lesions (47 cases, 38.84%), and posterior scleral staphyloma (54 cases, 44.63%). There was statistically significant difference in axial length of the eye between patients with and without posterior scleral staphyloma [23.09 (22.24, 24.43) and 27.04 (25.44, 28.88) mm], between patients with and without macular lesions [23.16 (22.24, 24.61) and 27.04 (25.74, 28.78) mm], and between patients with and without atrophic macular lesions [23.16 (22.24, 24.61) and 27.04 (25.74, 28.79) mm] (all <i>P</i><0.001). There was statistically significant difference in anterior chamber depth between patients with and without macular lesions [3.11 (2.75, 3.30) and 3.34 (3.09, 3.60) mm] (<i>P</i><0.05). There was also statistically significant difference in corneal astigmatism between patients with and without posterior scleral staphyloma [2.15 (1.20, 2.93) and 1.40 (1.00, 2.20) diopters] (<i>P</i><0.05). The location and region of the FBN1 gene mutation not only showed statistically significant difference from the positive rates of posterior scleral staphyloma and macular lesions (all <i>P</i><0.05), but also influenced the occurrence of atrophic macular lesions (both <i>P</i><0.05). Patients with FBN1 mutations located in the transforming growth factor β regulatory sequence had the highest proportion of posterior scleral staphyloma and macular lesions (both 10/11). <b>Conclusions:</b> Posterior scleral staphyloma and macular lesions have a relatively high incidence in MFS patients and tend to progress to more severe grades. The age, axial length of the eye, anterior chamber depth, corneal astigmatism, and location and region of the FBN1 gene mutation are factors affecting the posterior segment lesions in MFS patients."

    "title": "Novel Insights into the Aortic Mechanical Properties of Mice Modeling Hereditary Aortic Diseases.",
    "abstract": "Hereditary aortic diseases (hADs) increase the risk of aortic dissections and ruptures. Recently, we have established an objective approach to measure the rupture force of the murine aorta, thereby explaining the outcomes of clinical studies and assessing the added value of approved drugs in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). Here, we applied our approach to six additional mouse hAD models. We used two mouse models (<i>Fbn1C1041G</i> and <i>Fbn1mgR</i> ) of Marfan syndrome (MFS) as well as one smooth-muscle-cell-specific knockout (SMKO) of <i>Efemp2</i> and three CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knock-in models (<i>Ltbp1</i>, <i>Mfap4</i>, and <i>Timp1</i>). One of the two MFS models was subjected to 4-week-long losartan treatment. Per mouse, three rings of the thoracic aorta were prepared, mounted on a tissue puller, and uniaxially stretched until rupture. The aortic rupture force of the SMKO and both MFS models was significantly lower compared with wild-type mice but in both MFS models higher than in mice modeling vEDS. In contrast, the <i>Ltbp1</i>, <i>Mfap4</i>, and <i>Timp1</i> knock-in models presented no impaired aortic integrity. As expected, losartan treatment reduced aneurysm formation but surprisingly had no impact on the aortic rupture force of our MFS mice. Our read-out system can characterize the aortic biomechanical integrity of mice modeling not only vEDS but also related hADs, allowing the aortic-rupture-force-focused comparison of mouse models. Furthermore, aneurysm progression alone may not be a sufficient read-out for aortic rupture, as antihypertensive drugs reducing aortic dilatation might not strengthen the weakened aortic wall. Our results may enable identification of improved medical therapies of hADs."

    "abstract": "Aortic aneurysm (AA) refers to the persistent dilatation of the aorta, exceeding three centimeters. Investigating the pathophysiology of this condition is important for its prevention and management, given its responsibility for more than 25000 deaths in the United States. AAs are classified based on their location or morphology. various pathophysiologic pathways including inflammation, the immune system and atherosclerosis have been implicated in its development. Inflammatory markers such as transforming growth factor β, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and many more may contribute to this phenomenon. Several genetic disorders such as Marfan syndrome, Ehler-Danlos syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome have also been associated with this disease. Recent years has seen the investigation of novel management of AA, exploring the implication of different immune suppressors, the role of radiation in shrinkage and prevention, as well as minimally invasive and newly hypothesized surgical methods. In this narrative review, we aim to present the new contributing factors involved in pathophysiology of AA. We also highlighted the novel management methods that have demonstrated promising benefits in clinical outcomes of the AA."

The final study sample was 144 patients being evaluated for MFS from 01/2012 to 12/2016, of whom 81 were non-MFS patients (46 [67%] female, 36 ± 16 years) and 63 were MFS patients (36 [57%] female, 35 ± 11 years) according to the 2010 Revised Ghent Nosology. All patients underwent 1.5T MRI with isotropic 1 × 1 × 1 mm<sup>3</sup> 3D T2-weighted acquisition of the lumbosacral spine. Segmentation and quantification of vertebral bodies L3-L5 and dural sac segments L3-S1 were performed using a shape-based machine learning algorithm. For comparison with the current clinical standard, anteroposterior diameters of vertebral bodies and dural sac were measured. Ratios between dural sac volume/diameter at the respective level and vertebral body volume/diameter were calculated. Three-dimensional volumetry revealed larger dural sac volumes (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and volume ratios (<i>p</i> < 0.001) at L3-S1 levels in MFS patients compared with non-MFS patients. For the detection of MFS, 3D volumetry achieved higher AUCs at L3-S1 levels (0.743, 0.752, 0.808, and 0.824) compared with dural sac diameter ratios (0.673, 0.707, 0.791, and 0.848); a significant difference was observed only for L3 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). MRI-derived 3D volumetry of the lumbosacral dural sac and vertebral bodies is a feasible method for quantifying dural ectasia using shape-based machine learning. Non-inferior diagnostic accuracy was observed compared with dural sac diameter ratio (the current clinical standard for MFS detection)."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the influences of varying severity of sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) on the outcomes after thoracic endovascular aorta repair (TEVAR) in patients with Stanford type B aortic dissection (TBAD). This observational study focused on individuals with TBAD plus SAS who received TEVAR between January 2018 and December 2022. Patients were divided into groups according to the results of the portable sleep-breathing monitoring systems: mild SAS (MSAS) and moderate-to-severe SAS (MSSAS). Clinical profiles were collected and analyzed. A total of 121 cases with TBAD plus SAS who underwent TEVAR were enrolled in this study. Two groups were formed by stratifying these cases: MSAS (74 cases) and MSSAS (47 cases). The MSSAS cases were found to be older relative to MSAS cases (51.7 ± 8.3 years vs 57.1 ± 12.8 years; P = .012) and had a higher body mass index (BMI; 25.7 ± 2.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>vs 27.0 ± 2.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; P = .038). The investigation did not find any appreciable differences between the MSAS and MSSAS groups in terms of complications (endoleak, P = .403; stent-induced new entry, P >.999; and stent displacement: P >.999). However, the MSSAS group exhibited a significantly higher overall mortality rate compared with the MSAS group (log-rank P = .027). The tendency continued when examining cases with Marfan syndrome combined with MSSAS, where the overall mortality rate was significantly greater compared with Marfan syndrome cases with MSAS (log-rank P = .037). The absence of a significant difference was noteworthy in the freedom from reintervention between the MSAS and MSSAS groups (log-rank P = .278). The overall mortality rate was significantly higher in MSSAS group even after adjusting for varying potential confounders in the multivariate cox regression analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.875; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.238-2.586; P = .012). A markedly higher rate of distal stent dilation in the MSSAS group was also observed compared with the MSAS group (HR, 2.5 mm/year [95% CI, 2-3 mm/year] vs HR, 4 mm/year [95% CI, 2.0-5.5 mm/year]; P = .029). MSSAS is associated with a significantly higher risk of overall mortality and dilation rate of the distal stent after TEVAR for TBAD patients. Hence, aggressive efforts to reverse the severity of SAS in time in these individuals seem to be necessary."

    "abstract": "Hereditary aortic aneurysms and dissections, such as Marfan syndrome, differ in that they occur in younger patients without generally recognized risk factors, have a predilection for the thoracic rather than the abdominal aorta, and are at risk for dissection even at smaller aortic diameters. Early diagnosis, careful follow-up, and early intervention, such as medication to reduce aortic root growth and prophylactic aortic replacement to prevent fatal aortic dissection, are essential for a better prognosis. Molecular genetic testing is extremely useful for early diagnosis. However, in actual clinical practice, the question often arises as to when and to which patient genetic testing should be offered since the outcome of the tests can have important implications for the patient and the relatives. Pre- and post-test genetic counseling is essential for early intervention to be effective. (This article is a secondary translation of Jpn J Vasc Surg 2023; 32: 261-267.)."

    "abstract": "Subluxation of the crystalline lens (Ectopia Lentis, EL) can lead to significant visual impairment and serves as a diagnostic criterion for genetic disorders such as the Marfan syndrome. There is no established criterion to diagnose and quantify EL. We prospectively investigated the distance between the zonular fibre insertion and the limbus (ZLD) in healthy subjects as a parameter to assess the position of the lens, quantify EL and provide normative data. This prospective, observational, cross-sectional study includes one-hundred-fifty eyes of 150 healthy participants (mean age 28 years, range 4-68). Pupils were dilated with tropicamide 0.5% and phenylephrine 2.5% eyedrops. ZLD was measured in mydriasis at the slit lamp as the distance between the most central visible insertions of the zonular fibres on the lens surface and the corneoscleral limbus. Vertical pupil diameter (PD) and refractive error were recorded. If zonular fibre insertions were not visible, the distance between limbus and the pupillary margin was recorded as ZLD. 145 right and 5 left eyes were examined. 93% of study subjects were Caucasian, 7% were Asian. In eyes with visible zonular fibre insertions (n = 76 eyes), ZLD was 1.30 ± 0.28 mm (mean ± SD, range 0.7-2.1) and PD was 8.79 ± 0.57 mm (7.5-9.8). In the remaining 74 eyes, ZLD was 1.38 ± 0.28 mm (0.7-2.1), and PD was 8.13 ± 0.58 mm (6.7-9.4). For all eyes, ZLD was 1.34 ± 0.29 mm (0.7-2.1), and PD was 8.47 ± 0.66 mm (6.7-9.8). Refractive error and sex did not significantly affect ZLD. Smaller PD and older age were associated with larger ZLD (P < 0.001 and P = 0.036, respectively). Average ZLD was 1.34 mm in eyes of healthy subjects. Older age correlated with larger ZLD. These normative data will aid in diagnosing and quantifying EL."

    "abstract": "Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are recognized as one of the commonest congenital heart diseases (CHD), accounting for up to 40% of all cardiac malformations, and occur as isolated CHDs as well as together with other cardiac and extracardiac congenital malformations in individual patients and families. The genetic etiology of VSD is complex and extraordinarily heterogeneous. Chromosomal abnormalities such as aneuploidy and structural variations as well as rare point mutations in various genes have been reported to be associated with this cardiac defect. This includes both well-defined syndromes with known genetic cause (e.g., DiGeorge syndrome and Holt-Oram syndrome) and so far undefined syndromic forms characterized by unspecific symptoms. Mutations in genes encoding cardiac transcription factors (e.g., NKX2-5 and GATA4) and signaling molecules (e.g., CFC1) have been most frequently found in VSD cases. Moreover, new high-resolution methods such as comparative genomic hybridization enabled the discovery of a high number of different copy number variations, leading to gain or loss of chromosomal regions often containing multiple genes, in patients with VSD. In this chapter, we will describe the broad genetic heterogeneity observed in VSD patients considering recent advances in this field."

A nationwide Japanese inpatient database that included data of 524 patients with SSP (884 hospitalizations) and 137,821 with primary spontaneous pneumothorax between July 2010 and March 2020 was used in this study. Hospitalization for SSP (n = 884) was categorized into surgical (n = 459) and nonsurgical (n = 425) groups, and the patient characteristics, treatment, and outcomes were compared between the groups. Multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate risk factors for pneumothorax recurrence. We also compared the characteristics of patients with different underlying heritable connective tissue disorders. Compared with the nonsurgical group, the surgical group had less frequent readmission for pneumothorax (26% vs 44%; hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.38-0.58). Young patients (2.46; 1.83-3.32) or those with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (2.53; 1.77-3.63) had a high risk of recurrence. Pneumothorax occurred frequently in teenagers with Marfan syndrome, in those aged 20 to 39 years with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and in those aged ≥40 years with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. Detailed information on the characteristics and clinical course of SSP in heritable connective tissue disorders will aid in the clinical decision-making process."

    "abstract": "A variety of systemic conditions involve the thorax and the eyes. While subtle or nonspecific eye symptoms can be the initial clinical manifestation of some disorders, there can be additional manifestations in the thorax that lead to a specific diagnosis and affect patient outcomes. For instance, the initial clinical manifestation of Sjögren syndrome is dry eye or xerophthalmia; however, the presence of Sjögren lung disease represents a fourfold increase in mortality. Likewise, patients with acute sarcoidosis can initially present with pain and redness of the eye from uveitis in addition to fever and parotitis. Nearly 90% of patients with sarcoidosis have thoracic involvement, and the ophthalmologic symptoms can precede the thoracic symptoms by several years in some cases. Furthermore, a diagnosis made in one system can result in the screening of other organs as well as prompt genetic evaluation and examination of family members, such as in the setting of Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Multimodality imaging, particularly CT and MRI, plays a vital role in identification and characterization of these conditions. While it is helpful for ophthalmologists to be knowledgeable about these conditions and their associations so that they can order the pertinent radiologic studies, it is also important for radiologists to use the clues from ophthalmologic examination in addition to imaging findings to suggest a specific diagnosis. Systemic conditions with thoracic and ophthalmologic manifestations can be categorized as infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, neoplastic, or hereditary in origin. The authors describe a spectrum of these conditions based on their underlying cause. <sup>©</sup>RSNA, 2024."

The progressive dilatation of the aorta and the potential risk of acute aortic syndromes influence the prognosis of these patients. We aim to describe population characteristics, long-term survival, and re-intervention patterns in patients who underwent aortic surgery with a previously confirmed clinical diagnosis of Marfan Syndrome in a middle-income country. A retrospective single-center case series study was conducted. All Marfan Syndrome patients who underwent aortic procedures from 2004 until 2021 were included. Qualitative variables were frequency-presented, while quantitative ones adopted mean ± standard deviation. A subgroup analysis between elective and emergent procedures was conducted. Kaplan-Meier plots depicted cumulative survival and re-intervention-free. Control appointments and government data tracked out-of-hospital mortality. Fifty patients were identified. The mean age was 38.79 ± 14.41 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. Common comorbidities included aortic valve regurgitation (66%) and hypertension (50%). Aortic aneurysms were observed in 64% without dissection and 36% with dissection. Surgical procedures comprised elective (52%) and emergent cases (48%). The most common surgery performed was the David procedure (64%), and the Bentall procedure (14%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 4%. Complications included stroke (10%), and acute kidney injury (6%). The average follow-up was 8.88 ± 5.78 years. Survival rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 89%, 73%, and 68%, respectively. Reintervention rates at 1, 2.5, and 5 years were 10%, 14%, and 17%, respectively. The emergent subgroup was younger (37.58 ± 14.49 years), had the largest number of Stanford A aortic dissections, presented hemodynamic instability (41.67%), and had a higher requirement of reinterventions in the first 5 years of follow-up (p = 0.030). In our study, surveillance programs played a pivotal role in sustaining high survival rates and identifying re-intervention requirements. However, challenges persist, as 48% of the patients required emergent surgery. Despite not affecting survival rates, a greater requirement for reinterventions was observed, emphasizing the necessity of timely diagnosis. Enhanced educational initiatives for healthcare providers and increased patient involvement in follow-up programs are imperative to address these concerns."

Cross-sectional study comprehensively investigating neurological abnormalities within a prospective cohort of adults (≥ 18 years) with genetically confirmed MFS referred to an Italian hub center for heritable connective tissue diseases (Jan. 1st - Nov. 15th, 2021). We included a total of 38 individuals (53% female). The commonest neurological symptom was migraine (58%), usually without aura (73%). Neuropsychological testing was generally unremarkable, whilst anxiety and depression were highly prevalent within our cohort (42% and 34%, respectively). The most frequent brain parenchymal abnormality was the presence of cortico-subcortical hypointense spots on brain MRI T2* Gradient-Echo sequences (39%), which were found only in patients with a prior history of aortic surgery. Migraineurs had a higher frequency of brain vessels tortuosity vs. individuals without migraine (73% vs. 31%; p = 0.027) and showed higher average and maximum tortuosity indexes in both anterior and posterior circulation brain vessels (all p < 0.05). At univariate regression analysis, the presence of brain vessels tortuosity was significantly associated with a higher risk of migraine (OR 5.87, CI 95% 1.42-24.11; p = 0.014). Our study confirms that neurological abnormalities are frequent in individuals with MFS. While migraine appears to be associated with brain vessels tortuosity, brain parenchymal abnormalities are typical of individuals with a prior history of aortic surgery. Larger prospective studies are needed to understand the relationship between parenchymal abnormalities and long-term cognitive outcomes."

Clinical and surgical characteristics were extracted from the children's electronic files: age, axial length (AL), gender, number of surgeries received, intraocular lens (IOL) implantation at the first surgery, complete removal of the capsular bag, and final best-corrected visual acuity. Risk factors associated with RD occurrence were identified. Among 158 eyes included (85 children), 35 eyes (22.2%) developed RD during follow-up. Bilateral detachment occurred in 11 patients (45.8%). Age at the time of the lens removal surgery was not different between groups. Children in the RD group had a higher AL (P < .001), longer follow-up, IOL implantation, and capsular residue. Multivariate analysis identified capsular residue (odds ratio, 16.8; 95% CI, 1.9-148.8; P = .01) and AL (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.01-1.7; P = .03) as predictors for RD. Children with MS and increased AL were more likely to develop an RD after lens surgery. When considering lens removal surgery in a pediatric population presenting with MS, a complete capsular removal seemed to be the safer option regarding RD risk."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS)-associated cardiomyopathy, defined as ventricular dilation and dysfunction unexplained by volume loading, is not well defined in children. This study evaluated ventricular size and function in paediatric MFS using cardiac MRI (cMRI). This retrospective cohort study examined patients with MFS <19 years old at first cMRI. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) <55% was considered abnormal, as were z-scores >2. Combined mitral and aortic regurgitation indexed to LV stroke volume <20% defined absent/mild volume load. Biventricular volumes and EF on serial cMRI studies were compared with normative paediatric cMRI values, with measures converted to z-scores as appropriate. Longitudinal changes in volumes and EF were evaluated by mixed linear regression. Associations between ventricular, aortic and mitral characteristics were evaluated. 58 patients (60% male) were evaluated. Median age at initial cMRI was 13.6 years (IQR 10.0-15.8 years). Among patients with absent/mild LV volume load at initial cMRI (n=44, 76%), indexed LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) was significantly increased above normative values (median z-score 1.8, IQR 0.6-3.5, p<0.0001) and LVEF was abnormal in 48% (21/44). In the absence of volume loading, mitral valve prolapse (MVP) was associated with larger ventricular volumes and lower LVEF. Among those with serial cMRIs, LVEF and EDV z-scores did not significantly change over a mean follow-up time between cMRI studies of 1.5 years. Ventricular dilation and reduced EF are common in children with MFS and occur with no/mild LV volume load, suggesting intrinsic cardiomyopathy. MVP may be associated with cardiomyopathy."

Acute myocardial infarction during pregnancy is also a rare event associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes. Herein, we report a case of a 30-year-old pregnant woman with a known history of MFS. The patient had been treated surgically for an ascending aorta aneurysm and mechanical prosthetic aortic valve repair.

    "title": "High-Throughput Genomics Identify Novel <i>FBN1/2</i> Variants in Severe Neonatal Marfan Syndrome and Congenital Heart Defects.",
    "abstract": "Fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, encoded by <i>FBN1</i> and <i>FBN2</i>, respectively, play significant roles in elastic fiber assembly, with pathogenic variants causing a diverse group of connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome (MFS) and congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCD). Different genomic variations may lead to heterogeneous phenotypic features and functional consequences. Recent high-throughput sequencing modalities have allowed detection of novel variants that may guide the care for patients and inform the genetic counseling for their families. We performed clinical phenotyping for two newborn infants with complex congenital heart defects. For genetic investigations, we employed next-generation sequencing strategies including whole-genome Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) microarray for infant A with valvular insufficiency, aortic sinus dilatation, hydronephrosis, and dysmorphic features, and Trio whole-exome sequencing (WES) for infant B with dextro-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) and both parents. Infant A is a term male with neonatal marfanoid features, left-sided hydronephrosis, and complex congenital heart defects including tricuspid regurgitation, aortic sinus dilatation, patent foramen ovale, patent ductus arteriosus, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, and pulmonary sinus dilatation. He developed severe persistent pulmonary hypertension and worsening acute hypercapnic hypoxemic respiratory failure, and subsequently expired on day of life (DOL) 10 after compassionate extubation. Cytogenomic whole-genome SNP microarray analysis revealed a deletion within the <i>FBN1</i> gene spanning exons 7-30, which overlapped with the exon deletion hotspot region associated with neonatal Marfan syndrome. Infant B is a term male prenatally diagnosed with isolated D-TGA. He required balloon atrial septostomy on DOL 0 and subsequent atrial switch operation, atrial septal defect repair, and patent ductus arteriosus ligation on DOL 5. Trio-WES revealed compound heterozygous c.518C>T and c.8230T>G variants in the <i>FBN2</i> gene. Zygosity analysis confirmed each of the variants was inherited from one of the parents who were healthy heterozygous carriers. Since his cardiac repair at birth, he has been growing and developing well without any further hospitalization. Our study highlights novel <i>FBN1/FBN2</i> variants and signifies the phenotype-genotype association in two infants affected with complex congenital heart defects with and without dysmorphic features. These findings speak to the importance of next-generation high-throughput genomics for novel variant detection and the phenotypic variability associated with <i>FBN1/FBN2</i> variants, particularly in the neonatal period, which may significantly impact clinical care and family counseling."

    "title": "Can Hemorrhagic Stroke Genetics Help Forensic Diagnosis in Pediatric Age (<5 Years Old)?",
    "abstract": "When stroke occurs in pediatric age, it might be mistakenly interpreted as non-accidental head injury (NAHI). In these situations, a multidisciplinary approach is fundamental, including a thorough personal and familial history, along with accurate physical examination and additional investigations. Especially when the clinical picture is uncertain, it is important to remember that certain genetic conditions can cause bleeding inside the brain, which may resemble NAHI. Pediatric strokes occurring around the time of birth can also be an initial sign of undiagnosed genetic disorders. Hence, it is crucial to conduct a thorough evaluation, including genetic testing, when there is a suspicion of NAHI but the symptoms are unclear. In these cases, a characteristic set of symptoms is often observed. This study aims to summarize some of the genetic causes of hemorrhagic stroke in the pediatric population, thus mimicking non-accidental head injury, considering elements that can be useful in characterizing pathologies. A systematic review of genetic disorders that may cause ICH in children was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review (PRISMA) standards. We selected 10 articles regarding the main genetic diseases in stroke; we additionally selected 11 papers concerning patients with pediatric stroke and genetic diseases, or studies outlining the characteristics of stroke in these patients. The disorders we identified were Moyamoya disease (MMD), <i>COL4A1</i>, <i>COL4A2</i> pathogenic variant, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (E-D), neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1), sickle cell disease (SCD), cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM), hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and Marfan syndrome. In conclusion, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the genetic disorders that could be tested in children when there is a suspicion of NAHI but an unclear picture."

    "title": "Causative role of a novel intronic indel variant in FBN1 and maternal germinal mosaicism in Marfan syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disease with wide clinical heterogeneity, and mainly caused by pathogenic variants in fibrillin-1 (FBN1). A Chinese 4-generation MFS pedigree with 16 family members was recruited and exome sequencing (ES) was performed in the proband. Transcript analysis (patient RNA and minigene assays) and in silico structural analysis were used to determine the pathogenicity of the variant. In addition, germline mosaicism in family member (Ι:1) was assessed using quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) and short tandem repeat PCR (STR) analyses. Two cis-compound benign intronic variants of FBN1 (c.3464-4 A > G and c.3464-5G > A) were identified in the proband by ES. As a compound variant, c.3464-5_3464-4delGAinsAG was found to be pathogenic and co-segregated with MFS. RNA studies indicated that aberrant transcripts were found only in patients and mutant-type clones. The variant c.3464-5_3464-4delGAinsAG caused erroneous integration of a 3 bp sequence into intron 28 and resulted in the insertion of one amino acid in the protein sequence (p.Ile1154_Asp1155insAla). Structural analyses suggested that p.Ile1154_Asp1155insAla affected the protein's secondary structure by interfering with one disulfide bond between Cys<sup>1140</sup> and Cys<sup>1153</sup> and causing the extension of an anti-parallel β sheet in the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF)13 domain. In addition, the asymptomatic family member Ι:1 was deduced to be a gonadal mosaic as assessed by inconsistent results of sequencing and STR analysis. To our knowledge, FBN1 c.3464-5_3464-4delGAinsAG is the first identified pathogenic intronic indel variant affecting non-canonical splice sites in this gene. Our study reinforces the importance of assessing the pathogenic role of intronic variants at the mRNA level, with structural analysis, and the occurrence of mosaicism."

A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, including patients with a genetically confirmed clinical diagnosis of MFS and age-, gender- and axial length-matched controls. Subjects with known corneal, conjunctival or scleral pathology and a history of ocular surgery, including pars plana vitrectomy, recent contact lens use or high-grade astigmatism were excluded. Subjects underwent non-cycloplegic autorefraction, Scheimpflug-based corneal tomography, axial length measurement and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). AST was manually measured at 1 mm (AST1), 2 mm (AST2) and 3 mm (AST3) from the scleral spur, temporally and nasally. A total of 56 subjects (28 subjects in the MFS group and 28 matched subjects in the control group) were included in this study. In patients with MFS, AST was significantly reduced compared to matched controls, both overall and at every analysed measuring point in the nasal and temporal areas (p < 0.001). Central corneal thickness (CCT) and mean keratometry (Kmean) values were significantly lower in patients with MFS (p < 0.05). A positive correlation was found between nasal AST and CCT in patients with MFS. No correlation was found between AST and Kmean or between AST and axial length. In patients with MFS with ectopia lentis, compared to those without, temporal AST3 was significantly lower (p < 0.05). AST was significantly lower in patients with MFS harbouring a variant predicted to cause haploinsufficiency compared to those with a variant expected to lead to a dominant negative effect for both nasal and temporal measurements. Based on anterior segment OCT measurements, AST of patients with MFS is significantly lower compared to matched controls."

    "abstract": "Patients diagnosed with Marfan syndrome or a related syndrome require frequent aorta monitoring using imaging techniques like transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and computed tomography (CT). Accurate aortic measurement is crucial, as even slight enlargement (>2 mm) often necessitates surgical intervention. The 2022 ACC/AHA guideline for Aortic Disease Diagnosis and Management includes updated imaging recommendations. We aimed to compare these with the 2010 guideline. This retrospective study involved 137 patients with Marfan syndrome or a related disorder, undergoing TTE and ECG-triggered CT. Aortic diameter measurements were taken based on the old 2010 guideline (TTE: inner edge to inner edge, CT: external diameter) and the new 2022 guideline (TTE: leading edge to leading edge, CT: internal diameter). Bland-Altman plots compared measurement differences. Using the 2022 guideline significantly reduced differences outside the clinical agreement limit from 49% to 26% for the aortic sinus and from 41% to 29% for the ascending aorta. Mean differences were -0.30 mm for the aortic sinus and +1.12 mm for the ascending aorta using the 2022 guideline, compared to -2.66 mm and +1.21 mm using the 2010 guideline. This study demonstrates for the first time that the 2022 ACC/AHA guideline improves concordance between ECG-triggered CT and TTE measurements in Marfan syndrome patients, crucial for preventing life-threatening aortic complications. However, the frequency of differences >2 mm remains high. Accurate aortic diameter measurement is vital for patients at risk of fatal aortic complications. While the 2022 guideline enhances concordance between imaging modalities, frequent differences >2 mm persist, potentially impacting decisions on aortic repair. The risk of repeat radiation exposure from ECG-triggered CT, considered the 'gold standard', continues to be justified."

    "abstract": "The goal of this multicentre retrospective cohort study was to evaluate technical success and early and late outcomes of thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) with grafts deployed upside down through antegrade access, to treat thoracic aortic diseases. Antegrade TEVAR operations performed between January 2010 and December 2021 were collected and analysed. Both elective and urgent procedures were included. Exclusion criteria were endografts deployed in previous or concomitant surgical or endovascular repairs. Fourteen patients were enrolled; 13 were males (94%) with a mean age of 71 years (interquartile range 62; 78). Five patients underwent urgent procedures (2 ruptured aortas and 3 symptomatic patients). Indications for treatment were 8 (57%) aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms, 3 (21%) dissections and 3 (21%) penetrating aortic ulcers. Technical success was achieved in all procedures. Early mortality occurred in 4 (28%) cases, all urgent procedures. Median follow-up was 13 months (interquartile range 1; 44). Late deaths occurred in 2 (20%) patients, both operated on in elective settings. The first died at 19 months of aortic-related reintervention; the second died at 34 months of a non-aortic-related cause. Two patients (14%) underwent aortic-related reinterventions for late type I endoleak. The survival rate of those having the elective procedures was 100%, 84% and 67% at 12, 24 and 36 months, respectively. Freedom from reintervention was 92%, 56% and 56% at 12, 24 and 36 months, respectively. Antegrade TEVAR can seldom be considered an alternative when traditional retrograde approach is not feasible. Despite good technical success and few access-site complications, this study demonstrates high rates of late type I endoleak and aortic-related reinterventions."

    "title": "Investigation of Strategies to Block Downstream Effectors of AT1R-Mediated Signalling to Prevent Aneurysm Formation in Marfan Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular outcome in Marfan syndrome (MFS) patients most prominently depends on aortic aneurysm progression with subsequent aortic dissection. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) prevent aneurysm formation in MFS mouse models. In patients, ARBs only slow down aortic dilation. Downstream signalling from the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) is mediated by G proteins and β-arrestin recruitment. AT1R also interacts with the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) receptor, resulting in inflammation. In this study, we explore the targeting of β-arrestin signalling in MFS mice by administering TRV027. Furthermore, because high doses of the ARB losartan, which has been proven beneficial in MFS, cannot be achieved in humans, we investigate a potential additive effect by combining lower concentrations of losartan (25 mg/kg/day and 5 mg/kg/day) with barbadin, a β-arrestin blocker, and DMX20, a C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) blocker. A high dose of losartan (50 mg/kg/day) slowed down aneurysm progression compared to untreated MFS mice (1.73 ± 0.12 vs. 1.96 ± 0.08 mm, <i>p</i> = 0.0033). TRV027, the combination of barbadin with losartan (25 mg/kg/day), and DMX-200 (90 mg/kg/day) with a low dose of losartan (5 mg/kg/day) did not show a significant beneficial effect. Our results confirm that while losartan effectively halts aneurysm formation in <i>Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup></i> MFS mice, neither TRV027 alone nor any of the other compounds combined with lower doses of losartan demonstrate a notable impact on aneurysm advancement. It appears that complete blockade of AT1R function, achieved by administrating a high dosage of losartan, may be necessary for inhibiting aneurysm progression in MFS."

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with genetic aortopathies (GA) is controversial, given concerns of durability. We describe characteristics and outcomes after TEVAR in patients with GA. All patients undergoing TEVAR between 2010 and 2023 in the Vascular Quality Iniatitive were identified and categorized as having a GA or not. Demographics, baseline, and procedural characteristics were compared among groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the independent association of GA with postoperative outcomes. Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate 5-year survival and 2-year reinterventions. Of 19,340 patients, 304 (1.6%) had GA (87% Marfan syndrome, 9% Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and 4% vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). Compared with patients without GA, patients with GA were younger (50 years [interquartile range, 37-72 years] vs 70 years [interquartile range, 61-77 years]), more often presented with acute dissection (28% vs 18%), postdissection aneurysm (48% vs 17%), had a symptomatic presentation (50% vs 39%), and were less likely to have degenerative aneurysms (18% vs 47%) or penetrating aortic ulcer (and intramural hematoma) (3% vs 13%) (all P < .001). Patients with GA were more likely to have prior repair of the ascending aorta/arch (open, 56% vs 11% [P < .001]; endovascular, 5.6% vs 2.1% [P = .017]) or the descending thoracic aorta (open, 12% vs 2% [P = .007]; endovascular, 8.2% vs 3.6% [P = .011]). No significant differences were found in prior abdominal suprarenal repairs; however, patients with GA had more prior open infrarenal repairs (5.3% vs 3.2%), but fewer prior endovascular infrarenal repairs (3.3% vs 5.5%) (all P < .05). After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and disease characteristics, patients with GA had similar odds of perioperative mortality (4.6% vs 7.0%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-1.9; P = .75), any in-hospital complication (26% vs 23%; aOR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.92-1.6; P = .14), or in-hospital reintervention (13% vs 8.3%; aOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.84-1.80; P = .25) compared with patients without GA. However, patients with GA had a higher likelihood of postoperative vasopressors (33% vs 27%; aOR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9; P = .006) and transfusion (25% vs 23%; aOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.03-1.9; P = .006). The 2-year reintervention rates were higher in patients with GA (25% vs 13%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.4-2.9; P < .001), but 5-year survival was similar (81% vs 74%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.70-1.50; P = .1). TEVAR for patients with GA seemed to be safe initially, with similar odds for in-hospital complications, in-hospital reinterventions, and perioperative mortality, as well as similar hazards for 5-year mortality compared with patients without GA. However, patients with GA had higher 2-year reintervention rates. Future studies should assess long-term durability after TEVAR compared with the recommended open repair to appropriately weigh the risks and benefits of endovascular treatment in patients with GA."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS), which is a dominantly inherited connective tissue disease resulting from a mutation in the FBN1 gene, exhibits variable manifestations affecting the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, ophthalmologic, and pulmonary systems. Notably, neurologic deficiency, which involves ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, is a rare but severe manifestation. The safety of rt-PA treatment for ischemic stroke caused by MFS is still under discussion. In the current report, we discuss 3 atypical MFS cases presented as acute ischemic stroke, compared to those exhibiting cardiovascular and musculoskeletal abnormalities. Three patients were diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke accompanied by MFS based on clinical manifestations, imaging examinations, and genetic testings. The first case underwent intravenous thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA, the second case received antiplatelet therapy, and the third case received anticoagulant therapy and perfusion therapy. The neurologic deficiency of all three patients showed improvement upon discharge, and there were no symptoms of recurrence observed during the follow-up period. MFS is a rare etiology in young people with embolic stroke of undetermined source. Physicians should take MFS into consideration when they observe the characteristic symptoms during a consultation. The potential pathogenesis of ischemic stroke secondary to MFS may include cardio-embolism, arterial dissection, and hypoperfusion. Although intravenous thrombolysis is a promising therapy to treat acute ischemic stroke, further examinations should be conducted to rule out contraindications in patients with a suspicion of MFS."

To investigate the diagnostic yield of MAD by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), its prevalence and progression during childhood. We included patients <21 years old with MFS, defined by 2010 Ghent criteria and a pathogenic FBN1 variant or ectopia lentis. Two readers measured systolic separation between the mitral valve (MV) posterior hinge point and left ventricular (LV) myocardium on initial and subsequent imaging. MAD was defined as MV-LV separation ≥2 mm, MV prolapse (MVP) as atrial displacement ≥2 mm. Kappa coefficients evaluated echocardiogram-CMR agreement. Bland-Altman and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) assessed inter-rater and inter-modality reliability. Univariable mixed-effects linear regression was used to evaluate longitudinal changes of MAD. MAD was detected in 60% (110/185) eligible patients. MVP was present in 48% (53/110) of MAD and MAD in 90% (53/59) of MVP. MAD detection by CMR and echocardiography had 96% overall agreement (Kappa = 0.89, P < 0.001) and a 0.32 mm estimate bias (95% CI 0.00, 0.65). ICC by echocardiography, CMR, and between modalities were 0.97 (95% CI 0.93, 0.98), 0.92 (95% CI 0.79, 0.97), and 0.91 (95% CI 0.85, 0.94), respectively. MAD was associated with aortic root dilation (P < 0.001). MAD was found in children of all ages, increased +0.18 mm/year (95% CI +0.14, +0.22) during a median duration of 5.5 years (IQR 3.1, 7.5 years). MAD indexed by height yielded a constant value +0.0002 mm/m/year (95% CI -0.0002, +0.0005 mm/m/year). MAD was common in pediatric MFS and was associated with aortic root dilation. MAD detection by echocardiography and CMR was highly reliable, suggesting that routine assessment in MFS is feasible. MAD was present in neonates and progressed over time but remained constant when indexing by height. Further studies are needed to evaluate MAD as a biomarker for clinical outcomes in pediatric MFS."

Aortic aneurysm phenotype was defined as aortic root Z-score ≥4.5, aortic root growth rate ≥75th percentile, aortic dissection, and aortic surgery. Severe cardiac phenotype was defined as aortic dissection, aortic Z-score ≥4.5, aortic valve surgery, at least moderate mitral regurgitation, mitral valve surgery, left ventricular dysfunction, or death. Extracardiac manifestations were characterized by specific organ system involvement and by a novel aggregate extracardiac score (AES) that was created for this study based on the original Ghent nosology. Mixed effects logistic regression analysis compared AES and systems involvement to outcomes. Of 608 participants (60% male), the median age at enrollment was 10.8 years (interquartile range: 6, 15.4). Aortic aneurysm phenotype was observed in 71% of participants and 64% had severe cardiac phenotype. On univariable analysis, skeletal (OR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.01, 3.72; p = 0.05), skin manifestation (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.13, 2.34; p = 0.01) and AES (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.34; p = 0.02) were associated with aortic aneurysm phenotype but were not significant in multivariable analysis. There was no association between extracardiac manifestations and severe cardiac phenotype. Thus, the severity of cardiac manifestations in Marfan syndrome (MFS) was independent of extracardiac phenotype and AES. Severity of extracardiac involvement did not appear to be a useful clinical marker for cardiovascular risk-stratification in this cohort of children and young adults with MFS."

Since the diagnosis of CDH, the patient underwent a clinical multidisciplinary follow-up leading to the diagnosis of MFS in accordance with revised Ghent Criteria: the child had typical clinical features and a novel heterozygous de novo single-base deletion in exon 26 of the FBN1 gene, identified by Whole-Exome Sequencing. MFS diagnosis permitted to look for cardiovascular complications and treat them, though asymptomatic, in order to prevent major cardiovascular life-threatening events. Our case shows the importance of a long-term and multidisciplinary follow-up in all children with diagnosis of CDH."

    "title": "A Case of Marfan Syndrome With Congenital Hip Dysplasia and Spine Abnormality.",
    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome, a hereditary disorder of connective tissue marked by FBN1 gene mutations, presents a clinical tapestry requiring a multidisciplinary approach for optimal management. This case report details the presentation of an 11-year-old male exhibiting musculoskeletal deformities, notably an abnormally curved spine and congenital hip dysplasia, indicative of Marfan syndrome. The absence of cardiovascular abnormalities and family history challenges the diagnostic process. Clinical evaluation revealed classical signs, including positive wrist and thumb signs, pectus carinatum, a loose skin fold, and scapular winging. Laboratory investigations, including imaging studies, confirmed the diagnosis. The patient's management involves a multifaceted strategy, addressing cardiovascular risks through beta-blockers and potential surgical interventions, orthopedic measures for musculoskeletal complications, and ophthalmologic interventions for ocular manifestations. Genetic counseling facilitates informed decision-making, and psychosocial support ensures holistic care. This case underscores the necessity of recognizing atypical presentations and employing a holistic, collaborative approach for early diagnosis and effective management of Marfan syndrome, thereby emphasizing the importance of ongoing research and heightened clinical awareness in enhancing outcomes for individuals living with this intricate genetic disorder."

    "title": "Genotype and clinical phenotype of children with Marfan syndrome in Southeastern Anatolia.",
    "abstract": "The cardinal phenotypic hallmarks of Marfan syndrome (MFS) include cardiac, ocular, and skeletal abnormalities. Since the clinical phenotype of MFS is highly heterogeneous, with certain symptoms appearing as children age, the diagnostic process and establishing a genotype-phenotype association in childhood MFS can be challenging. The lack of sufficient childhood studies also makes it difficult to interpret the subject. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between clinical symptoms used as diagnostic criteria and FBN1 variations in children with MFS. This study investigated the relationships between genotypes and phenotypes in 131 children suspected of having Marfan syndrome (MFS). Diagnosis of MFS was made according to the revised Ghent nosology. FBN1 variants were categorized based on exon regions, type of variant, and pathogenicity classes. These FBN1 variants were then correlated with the clinical manifestations including cardiovascular, ocular, facial, and skeletal abnormalities. Out of the children, 43 were diagnosed with MFS. FBN1 variant was identified in 32 (74.4%) of the MFS children. MFS diagnosis could not be made in five (15.6%) FBN1 variant-positive children. The most common cardinal finding is cardiac anomalies n = 38 (88.3%). The most common FBN1 pathogenic variant was c.1786 T > C/p.Cys596Arg n = 4 (12.5%). The distribution of pathogenic variants was as follows: 29 (90.6%) missense, 2 (6.3%) frameshift, and 1 (3.1%) nonsense. The numbers of AD and EL of the variant-positive children were 16 (50%) and 14 (43.7%), respectively. Ocular abnormalities were more common in children with FBN1-positive MFS (p = 0.009). There was no difference in the number of cardiac abnormalities between FBN1-positive and FBN1-negative MFS patients (p = 0.139). Conclusion: This study examines the relationship between FBN1 variants and clinical features used as diagnostic criteria in MFS children. The findings emphasize the importance of long-term monitoring of heterogeneous clinical phenotypes and bioinformatic reanalysis in determining the genotype-phenotype relationship in children, as MFS symptoms can vary with age. What is Known: • Marfan syndrome has highly variable phenotypic heterogeneity. • The genotype-phenotype relationship in childhood Marfan syndrome is not clear enough due to the variation in the time of onset of the findings. What is New: • This article provides regional data for the field of research on genotype-phenotype relationships in childhood Marfan syndrome. • Long-term follow-up of clinical findings and bioinformatics reanalysis is an important requirement for a well-established genotype-phenotype relationship in childhood Marfan syndrome."

    "abstract": "This cross-sectional controlled study aims to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of children and adolescents with a molecular diagnosis of Marfan syndrome (MFS) or related disorders and to evaluate the factors associated with HRQoL in this population. Sixty-three children with MFS and 124 age- and sex-matched healthy children were recruited. HRQoL was assessed using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™) generic questionnaire. The correlation between HRQoL scores and the different continuous parameters (age, body mass index, disease severity, systemic score, aortic sinus diameter, and aerobic physical capacity) was evaluated using Pearson's or Spearman's coefficient. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed on the two health summary self-reported PedsQL™ scores (physical and psychosocial) to identify the factors associated with HRQoL in the MFS group. Except for emotional functioning, all other domains of HRQoL (psychosocial and physical health, social and school functions) were significantly lower in children with MFS compared to matched healthy children. In the MFS group, the physical health summary score was significantly lower in female than in male patients (self-report: absolute difference [95%CI] = -8.7 [-17.0; -0.47], P = 0.04; proxy-report: absolute difference [95%CI] = -8.6 [-17.3; 0.02], P = 0.05) and also negatively correlated with the systemic score (self-report: R = -0.24, P = 0.06; proxy-report: R = -0.29, P = 0.03) and with the height Z-score (proxy-report: R = -0.29, P = 0.03). There was no significant difference in the physical health summary scores between the different genetic subgroups. In the subgroup of 27 patients who performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test, self- and proxy-reported physical health summary scores were highly correlated with their aerobic physical capacity assessed by peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>max) and ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT). In the multivariate analysis, the most important independent predictors of decreased physical health were increased height, decreased body mass index, decreased VAT and use of prophylactic therapy. This study reports an impaired HRQoL in children and adolescents with MFS or related conditions, in comparison with matched healthy children. Educational and rehabilitation programs must be developed and evaluated to improve exercise capacity and HRQoL in these patients. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03236571 . Registered 28 July 2017."

    "abstract": "To report the long-term clinical and endothelial cell count (ECC) results of lensectomy with primary anterior chamber iris claw lens implantation in the eyes of patients ≤18-year-old with ectopia lentis due to Marfan syndrome. The medical records of Marfan patients operated on at a single institution from September 2007 to August 2020, with minimum follow-up of 2 years, were reviewed retrospectively. The following data were analyzed: sex, age at surgery, indication for surgery, the position of the lens in relation to the undilated and dilated pupil, corneal endothelial cell counts (ECC), peri- and postoperative complications, pre- and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity. A total of forty-two eyes of 23 patients (12 girls and 11 boys) were included. At least two or more postoperative ECCs were collected from 33 eyes (17 patients). Median age at IOL implantation was 6.1 years (range, 1.8-18). Median overall follow-up time was 6.2 years (range, 2-13.5). Median ECC follow-up time was 6.2 years (range, 2-10). Mean best-corrected visual acuity was 0.71 ± 0.38 logMAR before surgery and 0.02 ± 0.25 logMAR at final follow-up. The mean annual ECC decline was 0.71% ± 2.24. Total cell loss from first to last postoperative measurement was 150 cells ± 394 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> (4.81%). Pre- and first postoperative data were available for 17 eyes of 10 patients, with a mean cell loss before and directly after surgery of 269 ± 268 cells (7.94%). Surgery related complications were iris bombé due to blockage of peripheral iridectomy in 3 eyes and claw dislocation due to direct impact trauma in 3 eyes. In our large, pediatric study cohort, anterior chamber iris claw IOL implantation resulted in an excellent visual outcome and normal endothelial cell loss compared with normative data. Safety measures are recommended to avoid traumatic dislocation of IOLs."

From 1988 through 2020, 60 patients with MFS had surgery to correct mitral regurgitation (MR): 19 had isolated MV surgery, 32 had combined MV and aortic root surgery, and 9 had MV surgery after aortic root surgery. Follow-up was complete for a median of 16.1 years. MV pathology was myxomatous degeneration in all patients and of advanced degree in 78.6% with bileaflet prolapse in 65.5%, mitral annulus disjunction in 57.5%, and mitral annulus calcification in 8.2% of patients. The MV was repaired in 47 patients and replaced in 13. Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative mortality at 20 years 21.3% for all patients, 6.7% after MV repair, and 57.8% after replacement (P < .001). MV reoperations were performed in 5 patients: 2 after repair and 3 after replacement. The cumulative incidence rate of reoperations on the MV was 3.8% at 10 years and 11.0% at 20 years in the entire cohort. Among 47 patients who had MV repair, moderate MR developed in 11 patients and severe in 2. Both patients with severe MR underwent MV reoperation. The cumulative incidence rate of recurrent moderate or severe MR after MV repair was 20.4% at 10 years, and 36.5% at 20 years. MV repair was associated with better survival than MV replacement, but recurrent MR after repair occurred in approximately one-third of the patients at 20 years after surgery."

In the oral and maxillofacial regions, epidermoid cysts usually develop in the floor of the mouth and rarely in other sites. We describe a rare case of an epidermoid cyst arising in the right maxillary sinus. A 29-year-old man with a known diagnosis of Marfan syndrome presented with progressive swelling and tenderness in the right buccal region, mimicking facial cellulitis, and refractory to medical treatment. Computed tomography scan showed a cystic lesion extending widely into the right maxillary sinus. The cyst was successfully removed with a medial maxillectomy through inferior antrostomy approach under general anesthesia. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of an epidermoid cyst, showing a cystic wall lined with a thin layer of keratinizing squamous epithelium and fibroma connective tissue infiltrated with inflammatory cells, with no skin appendages. There has been no evidence of recurrence during the 4 year follow-up. We also conduct a review of the English literature for the reported cases of maxillary epidermoid cyst."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MIM: # 154700; MFS) is an autosomal dominant disease representing the most common form of heritable connective tissue disorder. The condition presents variable multiorgan expression, typically involving a triad of cardiovascular, eye, and skeletal manifestations. Other multisystemic features are often underdiagnosed. Moreover, the disease is characterized by age related penetrance. Diagnosis and management of MFS in the adult population are well-described in literature. Few studies are focused on MFS in the pediatric population, making the clinical approach (cardiac and multiorgan) to these cases challenging both in terms of diagnosis and serial follow-up. In this review, we provide an overview of MFS manifestations in children, with extensive revision of major organ involvement (cardiovascular ocular and skeletal). We attempt to shed light on minor aspects of MFS that can have a significant progressive impact on the health of affected children. MFS is an example of a syndrome where an early personalized approach to address a dynamic, genetically determined condition can make a difference in outcome. Applying an early multidisciplinary clinical approach to MFS cases can prevent acute and chronic complications, offer tailored management, and improve the quality of life of patients."

    "abstract": "Myxomatous valve disease (MVD) is the most common cause of mitral regurgitation, leading to impaired cardiac function and heart failure. MVD in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome includes valve leaflet thickening and progressive valve degeneration. However, the underlying mechanisms by which the disease progresses remain undefined. Mice with <i>Fibrillin 1</i> gene variant <i>Fbn1</i><sup><i>C1039G/+</i></sup> recapitulate histopathologic features of Marfan syndrome, and Wnt (Wingless-related integration site) signaling activity was detected in <i>TCF/Lef-lacZ</i> (T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor-β-galactosidase) reporter mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed from mitral valves of wild-type and <i>Fbn1</i><sup><i>C1039G/+</i></sup> mice at 1 month of age. Inhibition of Wnt signaling was achieved by conditional induction of the secreted Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 (Dickkopf-1) expression in periostin-expressing valve interstitial cells of <i>Periostin</i>-Cre; <i>tetO-Dkk1; R26rtTA; TCF/Lef-lacZ; Fbn1</i><sup><i>C1039G/+</i></sup> mice. Dietary doxycycline was administered for 1 month beginning with MVD initiation (1-month-old) or MVD progression (2-month-old). Histological evaluation and immunofluorescence for ECM (extracellular matrix) and immune cells were performed. Wnt signaling is activated early in mitral valve disease progression, before immune cell infiltration in <i>Fbn1</i><sup><i>C1039G/+</i></sup> mice. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed similar mitral valve cell heterogeneity between wild-type and <i>Fbn1</i><sup><i>C1039G/+</i></sup> mice at 1 month of age. Wnt pathway genes were predominantly expressed in valve interstitial cells and valve endothelial cells of <i>Fbn1</i><sup><i>C1039G/+</i></sup> mice. Inhibition of Wnt signaling in <i>Fbn1</i><sup><i>C1039G/+</i></sup> mice at 1 month of age prevented the initiation of MVD as indicated by improved ECM remodeling and reduced valve leaflet thickness with decreased infiltrating macrophages. However, later, Wnt inhibition starting at 2 months did not prevent the progression of MVD. Wnt signaling is involved in the initiation of mitral valve abnormalities and inflammation but is not responsible for later-stage valve disease progression once it has been initiated. Thus, Wnt signaling contributes to MVD progression in a time-dependent manner and provides a promising therapeutic target for the early treatment of congenital MVD in Marfan syndrome."

Thirty-eight women who had one or more single pregnancies were included. The ascending aorta was measured during pregnancy and postpartum. During pregnancy, a significant increase of diameters of the sinus aortae (median 1.4 mm; [-1.3; 3.8]) and ascending aorta (median 2.1 mm; [0.0; 4.0]) was noted. Systemic hypertension gives dilation of the aorta, but it did not influence the overall trajectory during pregnancy. Significant aortic dilatation is noted during pregnancy in women with underlying AOP, even persisting in the long term. Pre-existing systemic hypertension is associated with larger aortic diameters prior to pregnancy. More research on a larger study population however is needed."

The questionnaire consists of free-text questions, the German versions of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-G14), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), and the Graded Chronic Pain Status (GCPS). A total of 76 participants with diagnosed MFS were included. Of these, 65.8% showed TMD symptoms, the most common being pain or stiffness of the masticatory muscles in the jaw angle (50.0%). Only 14.5% of the participants were already diagnosed with TMD. Of the participants with an increased likelihood of a depression disorder, 76.9% showed TMD symptoms. Of those with a critical score for an anxiety disorder, 90.9% showed TMD symptoms. 73.3% of participants with TMD symptoms reached the critical score for a stress disorder. TMD symptoms were associated with a higher risk for chronic pain. In the median, participants with TMD showed statistically notably higher OHIP-G14 scores than participants without TMD (11.5 [IQR 17] vs. 1 [IQR 3] points, p ≤ 0.001). TMD symptoms had a noticeable impact on OHRQoL in patients with MFS, i.e., chronic pain and psychological impairment. TMD seems underdiagnosed, and more research is needed to prevent the associated chronification of pain and psychological burden to improve the OHRQoL."

    "abstract": "Aortic regurgitation (AR) associated with detachment of the aortic valve commissure is extremely rare. We present a case of progressively worsening severe chronic AR due to detachment of the aortic valve commissure during hospitalization that was confirmed with multimodality imaging. A 50-year-old male with Marfan syndrome visited our hospital to receive treatment for cholelithiasis. Pre-operative examination revealed severe AR and aortic root aneurysm. Because the patient was asymptomatic, it was decided that cholecystectomy should be performed first. However, the patient's heart failure worsened acutely when his blood pressure increased just before induction of anaesthesia. The patient required intubation and management of heart failure. Five days later, the patient underwent cholecystectomy. He was treated for heart failure and underwent open heart surgery on the 35th hospital day. Intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography revealed that his AR was caused by both enlargement of the aortic root and localized dissection of the aortic valve commissure, which was supported by intraoperative findings and histopathological evaluation. Aortic regurgitation was exacerbated by a new localized dissection, resulting in acute worsening of heart failure. Aortic valve commissure detachment can easily lead to sudden onset of severe AR, deteriorating haemodynamics, and acute pulmonary oedema. Since delayed medical treatment leads to poor clinical outcomes, prompt and accurate diagnosis and appropriately timed surgical intervention are essential. This very rare case of severe AR worsening due to spontaneous aortic valve commissure dissection was evaluated with multiple modalities during hospitalization. Understanding this clinical condition will help cardiologists provide better medical care."

After aortic root replacement (ARR), vascular remodeling and progressive aneurysm formation can occur due to alterations in up- and downstream wall biomechanics and hemodynamics. We aim to compare the ventriculo-vascular properties of patients with MFS with controls, and investigate the correlation between ascending aortic area strain and descending aortic area strain (DAAS) with other clinical variables. Nineteen patients with MFS (47% males), including 6 with ARR were studied. In 26 studies, aortic area strain was measured using cross-sectional cardiac magnetic resonance images at the ascending and proximal descending aortic levels. Left atrial, left ventricular longitudinal, and left ventricle circumferential strain (left atrial longitudinal strain, left ventricular longitudinal strain, and left ventricular circumferential strain, respectively) were measured using cardiac magnetic resonance-feature tracking. Compared with healthy controls, patients with MFS had significantly impaired left ventricular longitudinal strain and left ventricular circumferential strain (-15.8 ± 4.7 vs -19.7 ± 4.8, P = 0.005, and -17.7 ± 4.0 vs -27.0 ± 4.1, P < 0.001). Left atrial longitudinal strain was comparable between patients with MFS and controls. AAAS was significantly reduced (19.0 [11.9, 23.7] vs 46.1 ± 11.3, P < 0.001), whereas DAAS was not significantly decreased. AAAS and DAAS were negatively correlated with age, whereas no significant associations were identified with left ventricle function indices. No significant differences were observed between the ventriculo-vascular properties of patients with MFS who underwent ARR and those who did not. Patients with MFS demonstrated impaired ventricular and vascular function compared with healthy controls. Further investigations are warranted to determine clinical utility of aortic stiffness indices for predicting primary and repeat aortic events."

We retrospectively included 88 consecutive patients (39% females, mean age 37.1 ± 14.2 years) with genetically confirmed MFS who underwent at least one MRI or CT examination of the lumbosacral spine. Vertebral scalloping (VS) and dural sac ratio (DSR) were calculated from L3 to S3. Likely pathogenic or pathogenic FBN1 variants were categorized as either protein-truncating or in-frame. The latter were further classified according to their impact on the cysteine content of fibrillin-1. Higher values of the systemic score (revised Ghent criteria) were associated with greater DSR at lumbar (p < 0.001) and sacral (p = 0.021) levels. Patients with protein-truncating variants exhibited a greater annual increase in lumbar (p = 0.039) and sacral (p = 0.048) DSR. Mutations affecting fibrillin-1 cysteine content were linked to higher VS (p = 0.009) and DSR (p = 0.038) at S1, along with a faster increase in VS (p = 0.032) and DSR (p = 0.001) in the lumbar region. Our study shed further light on the relationship between genotype, dural pathology, and the overall clinical spectrum of MFS. The identification of protein-truncating variants and those impacting cysteine content may therefore suggest closer patient monitoring, in order to address potential complications associated with DE."

The back-calculated ELP and ELP error were evaluated among demographic and biometric parameters, including axial length (AL), corneal curvature radius (CCR) and white-to-white (WTW). A total of 292 eyes from 200 patients were included. The back-calculated ELP was lower in patients undergoing scleral-fixated IOL than those receiving in-the-bag IOL implantation (4.54 (IQR 3.65-5.20) mm vs 4.98 (IQR 4.56-5.67) mm, p<0.001). The theoretical ELP of the SRK/T formula exhibited the highest accuracy, with no difference from the back-calculated ELP in patients undergoing in-the-bag IOL implantation (5.11 (IQR 4.83-5.65) mm vs 4.98 (IQR 4.56-5.67) mm, p=0.209).

CCA is characterized by arachnodactyly, camptodactyly, contracture of major joints, scoliosis, pectus deformities, and crumpled ears, but rarely with lethal cardiovascular manifestations as in Marfan syndrome. It is imperative to conduct a comprehensive analysis and review of the pathogenesis of CCA resulting from pathogenic variants in FBN2 gene. Using whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing, we identified a novel pathogenic splice-altering variant (c.4472-3C>A) in intron 34 of FBN2 gene in a CCA pedigree. The transcriptional result of the splicing-altering variant was analyzed by RNA sequencing. We systematically analyzed the clinical manifestations of all reported cases of CCA caused by splicing-altering pathogenic variants and focused on all the pathogenic variants in FBN2 gene that are associated with severe cardiovascular manifestations. The splice-altering variant (c.4472-3C>A) in FBN2 was demonstrated to result in the exon 35 skipping and cause an in-frame deletion. Furthermore, we identified exons 31 to 35 may be a hotspot region in FBN2 gene associated with severe cardiovascular phenotype. This study enriched the pathogenic spectrum of CCA and identified a hotspot region in FBN2 gene associated with severe cardiovascular manifestations. We recommend that patients carrying pathogenic variants in exons 31 to 35 of FBN2 pay more attention to cardiac evaluation."

    "abstract": "Marfanoid habitus and intellectual disability (MHID) co-occur in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Among those, Lujan-Fryns, an X-linked genetic disorder associated with variants in MED12 was the first such syndrome identified. Accurate molecular diagnosis for these MHID syndromes remains a challenge due to significant clinical and genetic heterogeneity. We present a case report of a 20-year-old male patient with MHID and severe social anxiety. A comprehensive clinical evaluation, including morphotype assessment, cognitive, and psychometric and genetic testing, was conducted to provide a detailed understanding of the patient's complex clinical presentation. Psychometric assessments revealed severe social anxiety and various cognitive and emotional challenges. Despite some autism-like symptoms, the patient's clinical presentation was more aligned with mild intellectual disability. Exome sequencing was inconclusive but identified a heterozygous de novo missense variant in the PCDHGA5 gene. This gene is not known in human pathology yet, but we also report a second patient with a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder and a rare de novo variant which leads us to propose this as a candidate gene. Our findings emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary approach in the diagnosis and management of MHID. This case report underscores the need for objective clinical evaluations and standardized tools to better understand the complex clinical profiles of patients with NDDs. The identification of novel PCDHGA5 gene variants adds this gene's candidacy to the genetic landscape of MHID-NDD, warranting further investigation to determine its potential contribution."

    "abstract": "AGT (angiotensinogen) is the unique precursor for the generation of all the peptides of the renin-angiotensin system, but it has received relatively scant attention compared to many other renin-angiotensin system components. Focus on AGT has increased recently, particularly with the evolution of drugs to target the synthesis of the protein. AGT is a noninhibitory serpin that has several conserved domains in addition to the angiotensin II sequences at the N terminus. Increased study is needed on the structure-function relationship to resolve many unknowns regarding AGT metabolism. Constitutive whole-body genetic deletion of <i>Agt</i> in mice leads to multiple developmental defects creating a challenge to use these mice for mechanistic studies. This has been overcome by creating <i>Agt</i>-floxed mice to enable the development of cell-specific deficiencies that have provided considerable insight into a range of cardiovascular and associated diseases. This has been augmented by the recent development of pharmacological approaches targeting hepatocytes in humans to promote protracted inhibition of AGT synthesis. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of <i>Agt</i> has been demonstrated to be beneficial in a spectrum of diseases experimentally, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, aortic and superior mesenteric artery aneurysms, myocardial dysfunction, and hepatic steatosis. This review summarizes the findings of recent studies utilizing AGT manipulation as a therapeutic approach."

    "abstract": "Acute Type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular disease associated with high mortality rates, where surgical intervention remains the primary life-saving treatment. However, the mortality rate for ATAAD operations continues to be alarmingly high. To address this critical issue, our study aimed to assess the correlation between preoperative laboratory examination, clinical imaging data, and postoperative mortality in ATAAD patients. Additionally, we sought to establish a reliable prediction model for evaluating the risk of postoperative death. In this study, a total of 384 patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) who were admitted to the emergency department for surgical treatment were included. Based on preoperative laboratory examination and clinical imaging data of ATAAD patients, logistic analysis was used to obtain independent risk factors for postoperative in-hospital death. The survival prediction model was based on cox regression analysis and displayed as a nomogram. Logistic analysis identified several independent risk factors for postoperative in-hospital death, including Marfan syndrome, previous cardiac surgery history, previous renal dialysis history, direct bilirubin, serum phosphorus, D-dimer, white blood cell, multiple aortic ruptures and age. A survival prediction model based on cox regression analysis was established and presented as a nomogram. The model exhibited good discrimination and significantly improved the prediction of death risk in ATAAD patients. In this study, we developed a novel survival prediction model for acute type A aortic dissection based on preoperative clinical features. The model demonstrated good discriminatory power and improved accuracy in predicting the risk of death in ATAAD patients undergoing open surgery."

    "abstract": "Patients with Marfan syndrome, who present with a variety of symptoms and complex psychosocial problems, require interprofessional collaboration in their care. However, it is unclear how health care providers contribute to interprofessional collaboration for these patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the characteristics of interprofessional collaboration for patients with Marfan syndrome in the cardiovascular field. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with health care specialists (5 physicians, 2 nurses, and 3 certified genetic counselors) were analyzed qualitatively. Based on the medical collaboration for the management of cardiovascular complications in patients and their relatives, interprofessional collaboration was identified, such as collaboration and cooperation between physicians and certified genetic counselors, and nursing practice to facilitate interprofessional collaboration. In addition, issues such as difficulties in dealing with and coordinating medical care for noncardiovascular complications, lack of specialist physicians, and lack of opportunities to collaborate with nurses were identified. Effective interprofessional collaboration requires the acquisition of Marfan syndrome and genetic knowledge by healthcare providers and the development of a healthcare delivery system based on departments that can provide leadership. In addition, the assignment of nurses to work across organizational boundaries and effective collaboration between genetic counselors and nurses should be considered."

    "abstract": "Aortic root aneurysm is a potentially life-threatening condition that may lead to aortic rupture and is often associated with genetic syndromes, such as Marfan syndrome (MFS). Although studies with MFS animal models have provided valuable insights into the pathogenesis of aortic root aneurysms, this understanding of the transcriptomic and epigenomic landscape in human aortic root tissue remains incomplete. This knowledge gap has impeded the development of effective targeted therapies. Here, this study performs the first integrative analysis of single-nucleus multiomic (gene expression and chromatin accessibility) and spatial transcriptomic sequencing data of human aortic root tissue under healthy and MFS conditions. Cell-type-specific transcriptomic and cis-regulatory profiles in the human aortic root are identified. Regulatory and spatial dynamics during phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), the cardinal cell type, are delineated. Moreover, candidate key regulators driving the phenotypic modulation of VSMC, such as FOXN3, TEAD1, BACH2, and BACH1, are identified. In vitro experiments demonstrate that FOXN3 functions as a novel key regulator for maintaining the contractile phenotype of human aortic VSMCs through targeting ACTA2. These findings provide novel insights into the regulatory and spatial dynamics during phenotypic modulation in the aneurysmal aortic root of humans."

From January 2009 to December 2019,the clinical data of Marfan syndrome patients who underwent TEVAR for TBAD at the Department of Vascular Surgery were collected. A total of 23 patients were enrolled,including 15 males and 8 females. The age was (38.0±11.0) years (range:24 to 56 years). Among them,12 patients had history of ascending aortic surgery. Details of TEVAR,perioperative complications and reintervention were recorded and survival rate was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curve. <b>Results:</b> Technical success was 91.3% (21/23). Two patients with technical failure were as follows:one patient had type Ⅰa endoleak at the completion angiography,which healed spontaneously during the follow-up,and the other patient suffered aortic intimal intussusception after the deployment of the first stent-graft, and the second stent-graft was deployed. However, type Ⅲ endoleak was detected,which disappeared during the follow-up. One patient died during hospitalization. The median follow-up time (<i>M</i>(IQR)) was 60 (48) months (range:12 to 132 months). Reintervention was performed on 7 patients,including 3 distal stent-graft-induced new entry,2 distal aortic dilation,1 Ⅰa endoleak and 1 retrograde type A aortic dissection,respectively. Five-year cumulative survival rate was 86.7% (95%<i>CI</i>:86.6% to 86.8%) and the 5-year freedom from reintervention rate was 81.8% (95%<i>CI</i>:61.8% to 92.8%). <b>Conclusions:</b> TEVAR is feasible in the treatment of TBAD in Marfan syndrome patients who has no history of aortic arch replacement.

    "abstract": "Two major constituents of exfoliation material, fibrillin-1 and lysyl oxidase-like 1 (encoded by FBN1 and LOXL1), are implicated in exfoliation glaucoma, yet their individual contributions to ocular phenotype are minor. To test the hypothesis that a combination of FBN1 mutation and LOXL1 deficiency exacerbates ocular phenotypes, the pan-lysyl oxidase inhibitor β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) was used to treat adult wild-type (WT) mice and mice heterozygous for a missense mutation in Fbn1 (Fbn1<sup>C1041G</sup><sup>/+</sup>) for 8 weeks and their eyes were examined. Although intraocular pressure did not change and exfoliation material was not detected in the eyes, BAPN treatment worsened optic nerve and axon expansion in Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice, an early sign of axonal damage in rodent models of glaucoma. Disruption of elastic fibers was detected only in Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice, which increased with BAPN treatment, as shown by histologic and immunohistochemical staining of the optic nerve pia mater. Transmission electron microscopy showed that Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice had fewer microfibrils, smaller elastin cores, and a lower density of elastic fibers compared with WT mice in control groups. BAPN treatment led to elastin core expansion in both WT and Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice, but an increase in the density of elastic fiber was confined to Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice. LOX inhibition had a stronger effect on optic nerve and elastic fiber parameters in the context of Fbn1 mutation, indicating the Marfan mouse model with LOX inhibition warrants further investigation for exfoliation glaucoma pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "A 30-year-old woman with ankylosing spondylitis was referred to our clinic with abnormal fetal echocardiography findings, including ascending aortic dilatation, giant main pulmonary artery aneurysm, and aortic and pulmonary valve stenosis at 22 weeks of gestation. The full-term male neonate was born by cesarean section and was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit soon after delivery for respiratory distress with low percutaneous oxygen saturation. Based on cardiovascular and genetic analysis findings, the patient was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome. Surgery was performed; however, the patient died due to cardiac arrest. In conclusion, main pulmonary artery dilatation and aneurysms are uncommon in Marfan syndrome; therefore, presentation with these findings during the fetal life, as in the present case, is likely a sign of severe Marfan syndrome-related cardiac involvement."

    "abstract": "Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms arise from pathological tissue remodeling that leads to abnormal wall dilation and increases the risk of fatal dissection/rupture. Large variability in disease manifestations across family members who carry a causative genetic variant for thoracic aortic aneurysms suggests that genetic modifiers may exacerbate clinical outcomes. Decreased perlecan expression in the aorta of mgΔ<sup><i>l</i><i>p</i><i>n</i></sup> mice with severe Marfan syndrome phenotype advocates for exploring perlecan-encoding <i>Hspg2</i> as a candidate modifier gene. To determine the effect of concurrent <i>Hspg2</i> and <i>Fbn1</i> mutations on the progression of thoracic aortopathy, we characterized the microstructure and passive mechanical response of the ascending thoracic aorta in female mice of four genetic backgrounds: wild-type, heterozygous with a mutation in the <i>Fbn1</i> gene (mgΔ<sup><i>l</i><i>p</i><i>n</i></sup>), heterozygous with a mutation in the <i>Hspg2</i> gene (<i>Hspg2</i><sup><i>+</i><i>/</i><i>-</i></sup>), and double mutants carrying both the <i>Fbn1</i> and <i>Hspg2</i> variants (dMut). Elastic fiber fragmentation and medial disarray progress from the internal elastic lamina outward as the ascending thoracic aorta dilates in mgΔ<sup><i>l</i><i>p</i><i>n</i></sup> and dMut mice. Concurrent increase in total collagen content relative to elastin reduces energy storage capacity and cyclic distensibility of aortic tissues from mice that carry the <i>Fbn1</i> variant. Inherent circumferential tissue stiffening strongly correlates with the severity of aortic dilatation in mgΔ<sup><i>l</i><i>p</i><i>n</i></sup> and dMut mice. Perlecan haploinsufficiency superimposed to the mgΔ<sup><i>l</i><i>p</i><i>n</i></sup> mutation curbs the viability of dMut mice, increases the occurrence of aortic enlargement, and reduces the axial stretch in aortic tissues. Overall, our findings show that dMut mice are more vulnerable than mgΔ<sup><i>l</i><i>p</i><i>n</i></sup> mice without an <i>Hspg2</i> mutation, yet later endpoints and additional structural and functional readouts are needed to identify causative mechanisms."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) associated with Marfan syndrome (MFS) are unique in that extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) levels do not behave the way they do in other cardiovascular pathologies. EMMPRIN is shed into the circulation through the secretion of extracellular vesicles. This has been demonstrated to be dependent upon the Membrane Type-1 MMP (MT1-MMP). We investigated this relationship in MFS TAA tissue and plasma to discern why unique profiles may exist. <b>Methods</b>: Protein targets were measured in aortic tissue and plasma from MFS patients with TAAs and were compared to healthy controls. The abundance and location of MT1-MMP was modified in aortic fibroblasts and secreted EMMPRIN was measured in conditioned culture media. <b>Results</b>: EMMPRIN levels were elevated in MFS TAA tissue but reduced in plasma, compared to the controls. Tissue EMMPRIN elevation did not induce MMP-3, MMP-8, or TIMP-1 expression, while MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 were elevated. MMP-2 and MMP-9 were reduced in TAA tissue but increased in plasma. In aortic fibroblasts, EMMPRIN secretion required the internalization of MT1-MMP. <b>Conclusions</b>: In MFS, impaired EMMPRIN secretion likely contributes to higher tissue levels, influenced by MT1-MMP cellular localization. Low EMMPRIN levels, in conjunction with other MMP analytes, distinguished MFS TAAs from controls, suggesting diagnostic potential."

We utilized the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) system to identify relevant codes and extracted data from the NIS database covering the period 2016-2019. Descriptive statistics and χ<sup>2</sup> tests were employed to summarize and compare baseline characteristics. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses (adjusted for age, race, hospital region, smoking status, and alcohol misuse) were conducted to evaluate association between MFS and adverse obstetric outcomes. The regression analyses were summarized as Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Among the 2,854,149 pregnant individuals, 179 had MFS. Baseline characteristics revealed significant associations between MFS and age, race, and hospital location. Univariate analysis showed MFS individuals had significantly increased risks of amniotic fluid/membrane abnormalities (AFAs, OR=1.64, 95% CI: 1.01-2.68, P=0.045) and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH, OR=3.73, 95% CI: 2.41-5.78, P<0.001). Several obstetric outcomes showed some trends towards increased (multiple gestation, placenta previa, and preterm labor) and decreased (premature rupture of membrane, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia) obstetric risks with MFS; however, they were not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis showed MFS was significantly associated with increased risks of AFAs (adjusted OR=1.68, 95% CI: 1.03-2.74, P=0.037) and PPH (adjusted OR=3.62, 95% CI: 2.31-5.68, P<0.001). MFS is associated with increased risks of adverse obstetric outcomes, specifically AFAs and PPH. These results highlight the importance of monitoring these specific pregnancy outcomes in MFS individuals to ensure optimal maternal-fetal health."

This was a retrospective single center study. Data were retrospectively collected and analyzed for consecutive patients undergoing open TAAA repair (TAAAR) after TEVAR from November 2016 to June 2021. Indications for TAAAR included aneurysm progression due to endoleak, persisted false lumen perfusion, proximal/distal disease progression, and aorta rupture. The risk factor of operative mortality was analyzed by multivariable logistic regression model and the survival was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier. Sixty-three patients who met the inclusion criteria for the study were identified. The mean age at TAAAR was 41 ± 12 years and 43 (68.3%) were male. Marfan syndrome (MFS) was presented in 39 patients (61.9%). 60 (95.2%) patients presented with post-dissection aneurysm and 3 (4.8%) patients with degenerative aneurysm. The extent of TAAA was Crawford I in 9 (14.3%), II in 22 (34.9%), III in 23 (36.5%), and IV in 9 (14.3%).

This systematic review aimed at estimating the overall prevalence of MVP in individuals with the most common TSA, including not only the oldest studies (before the year 2000) but also the most recent ones (after the year 2000). PubMed and EMBASE databases were systematically reviewed in November 2023. Studies assessing the relationship between MVP and TSA and estimating the MVP prevalence in pectus excavatum (PE), pectus carinatum (PC), scoliosis, straight back syndrome (SBS) and Marfan syndrome (MS) were included. There was no limitation on time periods. Twenty-five studies with a total of 2800 patients (27.9 ± 13.9 years, 48.2% females) were analyzed. The highest prevalence of MVP was observed among MS patients (47.3%), while the lowest was detected in PC individuals (23%). Prevalence of MVP was similar among PE (30.8%), scoliosis (26.3%) and SBS (25.5%) patients. When dividing the studies on the basis of temporal period, the average MVP prevalence was approximately two-fold higher in all studies conducted before the year 2000 in comparison with the most recent ones, regardless of TSA type. This discrepancy might be primarily ascribed to relevant differences in the echocardiographic criteria employed for MVP diagnosis before (less specific) and after (more specific) the year 2000, respectively. The estimated MVP prevalence in TSA individuals is significantly higher than that observed in the general population. Individuals with TSA should be screened for MVP presence on transthoracic echocardiography."

Diagnostic standards (Ghent nosology) and genetic test were applied in all patients with CEL to determine the presence or absence of MFS. Three potential MFS predictors were tested and chosen to build a prediction model using logistic regression. The predictive performance of the nomogram was validated internally through time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. Eyes from 103 patients under 20 years old and with CEL were enrolled in this study. Z score of body mass index (odds ratio [OR] = 0.659; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.453-0.958), corneal curvature radius (OR = 3.397; 95% CI, 1.829-6.307), and aortic root diameter (OR = 2.342; 95% CI, 1.403-3.911) were identified as predictors of MFS. The combination of the above predictors shows good predictive ability, as indicated by area under the curve of 0.889 (95% CI, 0.826-0.953). The calibration curves showed good agreement between the prediction of the nomogram and the actual observations. In addition, decision curve analysis showed that the nomogram was clinically useful and had better discriminatory power in identifying patients with MFS. For better individual prediction, an online MFS calculator was created. The nomogram provides accurate and individualized prediction of MFS in children with CEL who cannot be identified with the Ghent criteria, enabling clinicians to personalize treatment plans and improve MFS outcomes. The prediction model may help clinicians identify MFS in its early stages, which could reduce the likelihood of developing severe symptoms and improve MFS outcomes."

Aortic aneurysm phenotype was defined as aortic root Z-score ≥ 4.5, aortic root growth rate ≥ 75th percentile, aortic dissection, and aortic surgery. Severe cardiac phenotype was defined as aortic dissection, aortic Z-score ≥4.5, aortic valve surgery, at least moderate mitral regurgitation, mitral valve surgery, left ventricular dysfunction, or death. Extracardiac manifestations were characterized by specific organ system involvement and by a novel aggregate extracardiac score that was created for this study based on the original Ghent nosology. Logistic regression analysis compared aggregate extracardiac score and systems involvement to outcomes. Of 608 participants (60% male), the median age at enrollment was 10.8 years (interquartile range: 6, 15.4). Aortic aneurysm phenotype was observed in 71% of participants and 64% had severe cardiac phenotype. On univariate analysis, skeletal (OR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.01, 3.72; p = 0.05), skin manifestation (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.13, 2.34; p = 0.01) and aggregate extracardiac score (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.34; p = 0.02) were associated with aortic aneurysm phenotype but were not significant in multivariate analysis. There was no association between extracardiac manifestations and severe cardiac phenotype. Thus, the severity of cardiac manifestations in Marfan syndrome was independent of extracardiac phenotype and aggregate extracardiac score. Severity of extracardiac involvement did not appear to be a useful clinical marker for cardiovascular risk-stratification in this cohort of children and young adults with Marfan syndrome."

    "title": "Frequency of Cardiac Valvulopathies in Patients With Marfan Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a progressive connective tissue disease with a broad range of clinical manifestations. We sought to establish the spectrum of structural valvular abnormalities as cardiovascular involvement has been identified as the most life-threatening aspect of the syndrome. This was a systematic review with a meta-analysis of studies indexed in Medline from the inception of the database to November 7, 2022. Using the random-effects model, separate Forest and Galbraith plots were generated for each valvular abnormality assessed. Heterogeneity was assessed using the <i>I<sup>2</sup></i> statistics whilst funnel plots and Egger's test were used to assess for publication bias. From a total of 35 studies, a random-effects meta-analysis approximated the pooled summary estimates for the prevalence of cardiac valve abnormalities as mitral valve prolapse 65% (95% CI: 57%-73%); mitral valve regurgitation 40% (95% CI: 29%-51%); aortic valve regurgitation 40% (95% CI: 28%-53%); tricuspid valve prolapse 35% (95% CI: 15%-55%); and tricuspid valve regurgitation 43% (95% CI: 8%-78%). Only one study reported on the involvement of the pulmonary valve (pulmonary valve prolapse was estimated at 5.3% (95% CI: 1.9%-11.1%) in a cohort of 114 patients with MFS). We believe this study provides a description of the structural valvular disease spectrum and may help inform providers and patients in understanding the clinical history of MFS in the current treatment era with its increased life expectancy."

    "title": "Ameliorative Effect of Coenzyme Q10 on Phenotypic Transformation in Human Smooth Muscle Cells with <i>FBN1</i> Knockdown.",
    "abstract": "Mutations of the <i>FBN1</i> gene lead to Marfan syndrome (MFS), which is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder featured by thoracic aortic aneurysm risk. There is currently no effective treatment for MFS. Here, we studied the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the phenotypic transformation of human smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and whether a mitochondrial boosting strategy can be a potential treatment. We knocked down <i>FBN1</i> in SMCs to create an MFS cell model and used rotenone to induce mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, we incubated the <i>shFBN1</i> SMCs with Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) to assess whether restoring mitochondrial function can reverse the phenotypic transformation. The results showed that <i>shFBN1</i> SMCs had decreased <i>TFAM</i> (mitochondrial transcription factor A), mtDNA levels and mitochondrial mass, lost their contractile capacity and had increased synthetic phenotype markers. Inhibiting the mitochondrial function of SMCs can decrease the expression of contractile markers and increase the expression of synthetic genes. Imposing mitochondrial stress causes a double-hit effect on the <i>TFAM</i> level, oxidative phosphorylation and phenotypic transformation of <i>FBN1</i>-knockdown SMCs while restoring mitochondrial metabolism with CoQ10 can rapidly reverse the synthetic phenotype. Our results suggest that mitochondria function is a potential therapeutic target for the phenotypic transformation of SMCs in MFS."

    "title": "miRNA Regulation of Cell Phenotype and Parietal Remodeling in Atherosclerotic and Non-Atherosclerotic Aortic Aneurysms: Differences and Similarities.",
    "abstract": "Aortic aneurysms are a serious health concern as their rupture leads to high morbidity and mortality. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) exhibit differences and similarities in their pathophysiological and pathogenetic features. AAA is a multifactorial disease, mainly associated with atherosclerosis, characterized by a relevant inflammatory response and calcification. TAA is rarely associated with atherosclerosis and in some cases is associated with genetic mutations such as Marfan syndrome (MFS) and bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). MFS-related and non-genetic or sporadic TAA share aortic degeneration with endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (End-Mt) and fibrosis, whereas in BAV TAA, aortic degeneration with calcification prevails. microRNA (miRNAs) contribute to the regulation of aneurysmatic aortic remodeling. miRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs, which post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. In this review, we report the involvement of deregulated miRNAs in the different aortic remodeling characterizing AAAs and TAAs. In AAA, miRNA deregulation appears to be involved in parietal inflammatory response, smooth muscle cell (SMC) apoptosis and aortic wall calcification. In sporadic and MFS-related TAA, miRNA deregulation promotes End-Mt, SMC myofibroblastic phenotypic switching and fibrosis with glycosaminoglycan accumulation. In BAV TAA, miRNA deregulation sustains aortic calcification. Those differences may support the development of more personalized therapeutic approaches."

    "abstract": "Children with Marfan (MFS) and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) report limitations in physical activities, sports, school, leisure, and work participation in daily life. This observational, cross-sectional, multicenter study explores associations between physical fitness and cardiovascular parameters, systemic manifestations, fatigue, and pain in children with MFS and LDS. Forty-two participants, aged 6-18 years (mean (SD) 11.5(3.7)), diagnosed with MFS (n = 36) or LDS (n = 6), were enrolled. Physical fitness was evaluated using the Fitkids Treadmill Test's time to exhaustion (TTE) outcome measure. Cardiovascular parameters (e.g., echocardiographic parameters, aortic surgery, cardiovascular medication) and systemic manifestations (systemic score of the revised Ghent criteria) were collected. Pain was obtained by visual analog scale. Fatigue was evaluated by PROMIS® Fatigue-10a-Pediatric-v2.0-short-form and PROMIS® Fatigue-10a-Parent-Proxy-v2.0-short-form. Multivariate linear regression analyses explored associations between physical fitness (dependent variable) and independent variables that emerged from the univariate linear regression analyses (criterion p < .05). The total group (MFS and LDS) and the MFS subgroup scored below norms on physical fitness TTE Z-score (mean (SD) -3.1 (2.9); -3.0 (3.0), respectively). Univariate analyses showed associations between TTE Z-score aortic surgery, fatigue, and pain (criterion p < .05). Multivariate analyses showed an association between physical fitness and pediatric self-reported fatigue that explained 48%; 49%, respectively, of TTE Z-score variance (F (1,18) = 18.6, p ≤ .001, r<sup>2</sup> = .48; F (1,15) = 16,3, p = .01, r<sup>2</sup> = .49, respectively). Conclusions: Physical fitness is low in children with MFS or LDS and associated with self-reported fatigue. Our findings emphasize the potential of standardized and tailored exercise programs to improve physical fitness and reduce fatigue, ultimately enhancing the physical activity and sports, school, leisure, and work participation of children with MFS and LDS. What is Known: • Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndrome are heritable connective tissue disorders and share cardiovascular and systemic manifestations. • Children with Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndrome report increased levels of disability, fatigue and pain, as well as reduced levels of physical activity, overall health and health-related quality of life. What is New: • Physical fitness is low in children with Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndrome and associated with self-reported fatigue. • Our findings emphasize the potential of standardized and tailored exercise programs to improve physical fitness and reduce fatigue, ultimately enhancing the physical activity and sports, school, leisure, and work participation of children with Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndrome."

    "title": "In vivo phenotypic vascular dysfunction extends beyond the aorta in a mouse model for fibrillin-1 (Fbn1) mutation.",
    "abstract": "In individuals with Marfan Syndrome (MFS), fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) mutations can lead to vascular wall weakening and dysfunction. The experimental mouse model of MFS (Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup>) has been advantageous in investigating MFS-associated life-threatening aortic aneurysms. It is well established that the MFS mouse model exhibits an accelerated-aging phenotype in elastic organs like the aorta, lung, and skin. However, the impact of Fbn1 mutations on the in vivo function and structure of various artery types with the consideration of sex and age, has not been adequately explored in real-time and a clinically relevant context. In this study, we investigate if Fbn1 mutation contributes to sex-dependent alterations in central and cerebral vascular function similar to phenotypic changes associated with normal aging in healthy control mice. In vivo ultrasound imaging of central and cerebral vasculature was performed in 6-month-old male and female MFS and C57BL/6 mice and sex-matched 12-month-old (middle-aged) healthy control mice. Our findings confirm aortic enlargement (aneurysm) and wall stiffness in MFS mice, but with exacerbation in male diameters. Coronary artery blood flow velocity (BFV) in diastole was not different but left pulmonary artery BFV was decreased in MFS and 12-month-old control mice regardless of sex. At 6 months of age, MFS male mice show decreased posterior cerebral artery BFV as compared to age-matched control males, with no difference observed between female cohorts. Reduced mitral valve early-filling velocities were indicated in MFS mice regardless of sex. Male MFS mice also demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall, these results underscore the significance of biological sex in vascular function and structure in MFS mice, while highlighting a trend of pre-mature vascular aging phenotype in MFS mice that is comparable to phenotypes observed in older healthy controls. Furthermore, this research is a vital step in understanding MFS's broader implications and sets the stage for more in-depth future analyses, while providing data-driven preclinical justification for re-evaluating diagnostic approaches and therapeutic efficacy."

    "title": "Cardiovascular and obstetrical outcomes among delivering patients with Marfan or Loeys-Dietz syndrome: a retrospective analysis by hospital delivery setting.",
    "abstract": "Pregnancy is a high-risk time for patients with Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome because of the risk for cardiovascular complications, including the risk for aortic dissection. Little is known about the differences in obstetrical and cardiac outcomes based on delivery hospital setting (academic or academic-affiliated vs community medical centers). This study aimed to evaluate the obstetrical and cardiac outcomes of patients with Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome based on delivery hospital setting. This was a secondary analysis of a retrospective, observational cohort study of singleton pregnancies among patients with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome from 1990 to 2016. Patients were identified through the Marfan Foundation, the Loeys-Dietz Syndrome Foundation, or the Cardiovascular Connective Tissue Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Data were obtained via self-reported obstetrical history and verified by review of medical records. Nonparametric analyses were performed using Fisher's exact tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. A total of 273 deliveries among patients with Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome were included in this analysis (Table 1). More patients who had a known diagnosis before delivery of either Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome delivered at an academic hospital as opposed to a community hospital (78.6% vs 59.9%; P=.001). Patients with Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome who delivered at academic centers were more likely to have an operative vaginal delivery than those who delivered at community centers (23.7% vs 8.6%; P=.002). When the indications for cesarean delivery were assessed, connective tissue disease was the primary indication for the mode of delivery at community centers when compared with academic centers (55.6% vs 43.5%; P=.02). There were higher rates of cesarean delivery for arrest of labor and/or malpresentation at community hospitals than at academic centers (23.6% vs 5.3%; P=.01). There were no differences between groups in terms of the method of anesthesia used for delivery. Among those with a known diagnosis of Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome before delivery, there were increased operative vaginal delivery rates at academic hospitals than at community hospitals (27.2% vs 15.1%; P=.03) (Table 2). More patients with an aortic root measuring ≥4 cm before or after pregnancy delivered at academic centers as opposed to community centers (33.0% vs 10.2%; P=.01), but there were no significant differences in the median size of the aortic root during pregnancy or during the postpartum assessment between delivery locations. Cardiovascular complications were rare; 8 patients who delivered at academic centers and 7 patients who delivered at community centers had an aortic dissection either in pregnancy or the postpartum period (P=.79). Patients with Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome and more severe aortic phenotypes were more likely to deliver at academic hospitals. Those who delivered at academic hospitals had higher rates of operative vaginal delivery. Despite lower frequencies of aortic root diameter >4.0 cm, those who delivered at community hospitals had higher rates of cesarean delivery for the indication of Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Optimal delivery management of these patients requires further prospective research."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a multisystem disease with a unique combination of skeletal, cardiovascular and ocular features. Geleophysic/acromicric dysplasias (GPHYSD/ACMICD), characterised by short stature and extremities, are described as 'the mirror image' of MFS. The numerous <i>FBN1</i> pathogenic variants identified in MFS are located all along the gene and lead to the same final pathogenic sequence. Conversely, in GPHYSD/ACMICD, the 28 known heterozygous <i>FBN1</i> pathogenic variants all affect exons 41-42 encoding TGFβ-binding protein-like domain 5 (TB5). Since 1996, more than 5000 consecutive probands have been referred nationwide to our laboratory for molecular diagnosis of suspected MFS. We identified five MFS probands carrying distinct heterozygous pathogenic in-frame variants affecting the TB5 domain of FBN1. The clinical data showed that the probands displayed a classical form of MFS. Strikingly, one missense variant affects an amino acid that was previously involved in GPHYSD. Surprisingly, pathogenic variants in the TB5 domain of FBN1 can lead to two opposite phenotypes: GPHYSD/ACMICD and MFS, suggesting the existence of different pathogenic sequences with the involvement of tissue specificity. Further functional studies are ongoing to determine the precise role of this domain in the physiopathology of each disease."

    "abstract": "Cannulation strategy in acute type A dissection (ATAD) varies widely without known gold standards. This study compared ATAD outcomes of axillary vs femoral artery cannulation in a large cohort from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD). The study retrospectively reviewed 2145 patients from the IRAD Interventional Cohort (1996-2021) who underwent ATAD repair with axillary or femoral cannulation (axillary group: n = 1106 [52%]; femoral group: n = 1039 [48%]). End points included the following: early mortality; neurologic, respiratory, and renal complications; malperfusion; and tamponade. All outcomes are presented as axillary with respect to femoral. The proportion of patients younger than 70 years in both groups was similar (n = 1577 [74%]), as were bicuspid aortic valve, Marfan syndrome, and previous dissection. Patients with femoral cannulation had slightly more aortic insufficiency (408 [55%] vs 429 [60%]; P = .058) and coronary involvement (48 [8%] vs 70 [13%]; P = .022]. Patients with axillary cannulation underwent more total aortic arch (156 [15%] vs 106 [11%]; P = .02) and valve-sparing root replacements (220 [22%] vs 112 [12%]; P < .001). More patients with femoral cannulation underwent commissural resuspension (269 [30.9%] vs 324 [35.3%]; P = .05). Valve replacement rates were not different. The mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was longer in the femoral group (190 [149-237] minutes vs 196 [159-247] minutes; P = .037). In-hospital mortality was similar between the axillary (n = 165 [15%]) and femoral (n = 149 [14%]) groups (P = .7). Furthermore, there were no differences in stroke, visceral ischemia, tamponade, respiratory insufficiency, coma, or spinal cord ischemia. Axillary cannulation is associated with a more stable ATAD presentation, but it is a more extensive intervention compared with femoral cannulation. Both procedures have equivalent early mortality, stroke, tamponade, and malperfusion outcomes after statistical adjustment."

    "abstract": "Surgery for Stanford type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is associated with an increased risk of late aortic reoperations due to degeneration of the dissected aorta. The subjects of this analysis were 990 TAAD patients who survived surgery for acute TAAD and had complete data on the diameter and dissection status of all aortic segments. After a mean follow-up of 4.2 ± 3.6 years, 60 patients underwent 85 distal aortic reoperations. Ten-year cumulative incidence of distal aortic reoperation was 9.6%. Multivariable competing risk analysis showed that the maximum preoperative diameter of the abdominal aorta (SHR 1.041, 95%CI 1.008-1.075), abdominal aorta dissection (SHR 2.133, 95%CI 1.156-3.937) and genetic syndromes (SHR 2.840, 95%CI 1.001-8.060) were independent predictors of distal aortic reoperation. Patients with a maximum diameter of the abdominal aorta >30 mm and/or abdominal aortic dissection had a cumulative incidence of 10-year distal aortic reoperation of 12.0% compared to 5.7% in those without these risk factors (adjusted SHR 2.076, 95%CI 1.062-4.060). TAAD patients with genetic syndromes, and increased size and dissection of the abdominal aorta have an increased the risk of distal aortic reoperations. A policy of extensive surgical or hybrid primary aortic repair, completion endovascular procedures for aortic remodeling and tight surveillance may be justified in these patients.

    "abstract": "Degenerative changes in the peripheral regions of the ocular fundus allow a closer look at both the role of collagen genes and their mutations in children with high myopia. The study investigates the features of genetic mutations in children with high myopia combined with peripheral retinal degenerations. Study group was formed from the database of genetic studies of the Scientific and Clinical Center OOO Oftalmic, which consists of 4362 patients referred for medical genetic counseling and molecular genetic testing from 2016 to 2021. Selection criteria were: male and female patients, aged 5-18 years old, who had the following clinical signs: high myopia (>6.00 D) and the presence of peripheral retinal degenerations (PRD). The study considered both isolated cases of ophthalmic pathology, as well as its syndromic forms. The final selection included 40 children. All patients had consulted with a geneticist. Whole-exome sequencing (WES), next generation sequencing (NGS), and single gene sequencing were conducted by taking 5 mL of peripheral venous blood and extracting deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). In patients with isolated cases of ophthalmic pathology (peripheral retinal degenerations and high myopia) with a confirmed genetic diagnosis, mutations in the <i>COL2A1</i> gene were detected in 77.4% of cases, and in the <i>COL11A1</i> gene - in 22.6% of cases. In Stickler syndrome with a confirmed genetic diagnosis, mutations in the <i>COL2A1</i> gene were detected in 33.3% of cases. In Marshall syndrome, the mutation in the <i>COL11A1</i> gene was detected in 11.1% of cases. In children with Ehlers-Danlos, Knobloch type 1, Cohen, Marfan, Wagner syndromes mutations in the genes <i>COL5A1</i>, <i>COL18A1</i>, <i>VPS13B</i>, <i>FBN1</i>, <i>VCAN</i> were detected in 55.6% of cases. In 33.3% of cases of Knobloch type 1, Cohen, Wagner syndromes the mutation is found in both copies of the gene (i.e., in both chromosomes), which leads to the development of peripheral retinal degenerations with high myopia. The results of the conducted molecular genetic testing expand our understanding of the mutation spectrum in the genes of children with both isolated cases of ophthalmic pathology, as well as syndromic pathology."

    "abstract": "Analysis of lens changes in Marfan syndrome (MS), in addition to assessing the position of the lens itself, should include the possibility of examining its supporting and accommodative components (ciliary zonule and ciliary body), or what can be called the entire anatomical complex of the lens. Optical methods of studying the structures of the anterior segment of the eye, due to iris opacity, allow only to analyze the state of the lens within the natural or medically enlarged pupil width. Visualization of the structures located behind the iris is possible with the use of radiation diagnostic methods, in particular ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). This study assesses the state of the anatomical complex of the lens in MS using UBM. The study was carried out on clinical material previously used by us to analyze changes in the fibrous membrane of the eye in MS. At the first stage, the main (19 patients with MS, 38 eyes) and the control (24 patients with myopia, 48 eyes) groups were formed for comparative evaluation. The formed groups were standardized according to the age of the patients and the axial length of the eye. At the second stage, patients with MS were divided into subgroups depending on the absence or presence of biomicroscopic signs of ectopia lentis (22 and 16 eyes, respectively). For UBM, an ultrasound linear sensor with a scanning frequency of 50 MHz was used (Aviso device, Quantel Medical, France). Various biometric UBM indicators were determined: lens thickness, diameter of the lens, lens-axial length factor, iris-lens angle, iris-lens contact distance, posterior chamber depth, length of the fibers of ciliary zonule, thickness of the ciliary body, sclera-ciliary process angle. There are changes in the anatomical complex of the lens as a whole in MS (in the lens itself, the ciliary zonule, and the ciliary body), which are characterized by an increase in lens thickness and a decrease in the diameter of the lens, an increase in the length of the fibers of the ciliary zonule and a decrease in the thickness of the ciliary body. At the same time, the displacement of the lens detected by optical biomicroscopy (ectopia lentis) can be considered as an advanced stage of changes in the anatomical complex of the lens. UBM provides the possibility of full-fledged visualization of all components of the anatomical complex of the lens in terms of both diagnostics, and monitoring of changes in MS. The question of the advisability of including this method in the algorithm for diagnosing ocular manifestations in order to verify the MS remains open. Possible obstacles may be, on the one hand, related to the need for special and expensive equipment, and on the other hand, the absence of a generally accepted «normal» values of UBM indicators of the anatomical complex of the lens."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MS) is an orphan hereditary connective tissue disease associated with a mutation in the <i>FBN1</i> gene, which pathological manifestations are characterized by polysystemic involvement. The fibrillin-1 protein is an integral component of the sclera and cornea of the eye, and in MS its structure is distrubed. This study assesses potential structural and functional changes in the cornea and sclera of a patient with MS. Two groups were formed, comparable in the axial length of the eye and age: the main group - 19 patients (38 eyes) with a verified diagnosis of MS, and the control group - 24 patients (48 eyes) with myopia of varying degrees. The results obtained from MS patients were analyzed depending on the absence or presence of ectopia lentis. In addition to measuring the basic ophthalmological parameters (refraction, axial length, visual acuity), topographic keratometry, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, and ocular response analyzer were used for structural and functional assessment of the cornea and sclera. In MS there was a statistically significant increase in the radius of curvature and a decrease in corneal refraction in the central zone compared to the control group. There were no significant differences in central corneal thickness, but there was a significant decrease in the thickness of the sclera in the limbal zone compared to the control group. There were no statistically significant changes in corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor in MS. This study confirmed the previously obtained data on the tendency of the optical power to reliably decrease in MS (flattening of the cornea). This symptom can be considered as a compensatory factor affecting clinical refraction, while the decrease in the thickness of the sclera - as the main reason for aaxial length elongation in MS. There were no clear patterns of dependence of the changes in the cornea and sclera analyzed in this study on the presence or absence of ectopia lentis. Changes in the lens, perhaps, should be regarded only as one of the potential components of the ocular symptom complex in MS."

It is well-known that epigenetic factors modulate gene expression. This mechanism appears to be of interest especially knowing the relevance of genetic susceptibility and genetic factors in the complex pathophysiology of aortic aneurysms, and of sporadic forms; in fact, the latter are the result of a close interaction between genetic and modifiable lifestyle factors (i.e., nutrition, smoking, infections, use of drugs, alcohol, sedentary lifestyle, etc.). Epigenetic factors include DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications, and non-coding RNA. Here, our attention is focused on the role of miRNA in syndromic and sporadic forms of thoracic aortic aneurysms. They could be both biomarkers and targets of novel therapeutic strategies."

A 48 year old male complaining of recurrent throbbing headache, for 3 years, 2 years ago he developed progressively lower back pain, associated with numbness and tingling sensation of the lower limbs. A year ago he experienced defecation and urinary incontinence. On further questioning the patient reported to have first degree relative with neurofibromatosis. On examination he has multiple café au laite on the trunk, back and left arm, and plexiform on the left palm, mild right deviation on thoracic region on the back. Lower limb muscle power grade 4/5 bilaterally, sensation was intact.

In most cases patients with dural ectasia are asymptomatic few may present with low back pain, radicular pain in the buttocks or legs and headache and rarely caudal equina syndrome. The management of dura ectasia may be conservative for asymptomatic patient and for a symptomatic patient surgery such as stabilization, marsupialization and lumbar peritoneal shunt. Dural ectasia with cauda equina syndrome are rarely complication of neurofibromatosis.

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder, poses unique challenges in neurosurgery, given the fragility of vascular structures. Superior cerebellar artery (SCA) aneurysms in patients with the syndrome are rare and present distinct surgical difficulties, necessitating innovative approaches. A 29-year-old male with Marfan syndrome presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured SCA aneurysm. Given the lack of a defined aneurysm neck and the small diameter of the SCA, standard clipping and endovascular therapies were unsuitable. A microsurgical approach using microsutures was successfully employed, effectively managing the aneurysm while preserving the parent artery. This case underscores the efficacy of the microsuture technique in complex neurosurgical scenarios, particularly in patients with connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome. The adaptability of surgical strategies, as demonstrated in this case, is crucial for achieving successful outcomes in patients with unique anatomical challenges."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to report on mid-term outcomes after endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) in patients with Marfan (MFS) or Loeys-Dietz (LDS) syndrome. We analysed data from 2 European centres of patients with MFS and LDS undergoing EVAR. Patients were analysed based on (i) timing of the procedure (planned versus emergency procedure) and (ii) the nature of the landing zone (safe versus non-safe). The primary end-point was freedom from reintervention. Secondary end-points were freedom from stroke, bleeding and death. A population of 419 patients with MFS (n = 352) or LDS (n = 67) was analysed for the purpose of this study. Thirty-nine patients (9%) underwent EVAR. Indications for thoracic endovascular aortic repair or EVAR were aortic dissection in 13 (33%) patients, aortic aneurysm in 22 (57%) patients and others (intercostal patch aneurysm, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, pseudoaneurysm, kinking of frozen elephant trunk (FET)) in 4 (10%) patients. Thoracic endovascular repair was performed in 34 patients, and abdominal endovascular aortic repair was performed in 5 patients. Mean age at 1st thoracic endovascular aortic repair/EVAR was 48.5 ± 15.4 years. Mean follow-up after 1st thoracic endovascular aortic repair/EVAR was 5.9 ± 4.4 years. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of reinterventions between patients with non-safe landing zone and the patients with safe proximal landing zone (P = 0.609). Furthermore, there was no increased probability for reintervention after planned endovascular intervention compared to emergency procedures (P = 0.916). Mean time to reintervention, either open surgical or endovascular, after planned endovascular intervention was in median 3.9 years (95% confidence interval 2.0-5.9 years) and 2.0 years (95% confidence interval -1.1 to 5.1 years) (P = 0.23) after emergency procedures. EVAR in patients with MFS and LDS and a safe landing zone is feasible and safe. Endovascular treatment is a viable option when employed by a multi-disciplinary aortic team even if the landing zone is in native tissue."

Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by pathogenetic variants in FBN1. Here, we report a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus, AVP-D, and Marfan syndrome. Although the coexistence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and AVP-D is rare, for those patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the existence of AVP-D should be considered when polyuria is not in accordance with the blood glucose levels, especially for those with a low urine specific gravity. Specific symptoms or signs help to identify Marfan syndrome early, and genetic testing of the FBN1 pathogenetic variant helps to make a definitive diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Individuals diagnosed with connective tissue disorders (CTD) are known to be predisposed to incisional hernia formation. However, there is a scarcity of data on outcomes for these patients undergoing hernia repair. We sought to describe our outcomes in performing abdominal wall reconstructions in these complex patients. Adult patients with CTD undergoing open, elective, posterior component separation with permanent synthetic mesh at our institution from January 2018 to October 2022 were queried from a prospectively collected database in the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative. We evaluated 30-day wound morbidity, perioperative complications, long-term hernia recurrence, and patient-reported quality of life. Twelve patients were identified. Connective tissue disorders included Marfan's n = 7 (58.3%), Loeys-Dietz syndrome n = 2 (16.7%), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus n = 2 (16.7%), and Scleroderma n = 1 (8.3%). Prior incisions included three midline laparotomies and nine thoracoabdominal, mean hernia width measured 14 cm, and 9 were recurrent hernias. Surgical site occurrences (SSOs) were observed in 25% of cases, and 16.7% necessitated procedural intervention. All twelve patients were available for long-term follow-up, with a mean of 34 (12-62) months. There were no instances of reoperation or mesh excision related to the TAR procedure. One patient developed a recurrence after having his mesh violated for repair of a new visceral aneurysm. Mean HerQLes scores at 1 year were 70 and 89 at ≥ 2 years; Mean scaled PROMIS scores were 30.7 at 1 year and 36.3 at ≥ 2 years. Ventral hernia repair with TAR is feasible in patients with connective tissue disorder and can be a suitable alternative in patients with large complex hernias."

Young adult AAAD patients (younger than 45 years old) underwent surgical treatment at our institution from January 2017 to December 2020 were consecutive enrolled. The hospital survivors completed 1 year of follow up. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of Marfan syndrome (MFS). A 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) with a caliper 0.2 was conducted to balance potential bias in baseline. The follow-up data were analyzed primarily for change in quality of life and anxiety status. After PSM, 32 comparable pairs were matched. The baseline data were comparable and postoperative complications were similar between groups. In terms of SF-36 scale, the role physical, bodily pain, role emotional and mental health subscales were no significantly improved in MFS patients over time. At 1 year after discharged, the subscale of mental health and bodily pain were significantly lower in the MFS group than in the non-MFS group. In terms of HADS assessments, the level of anxiety in MFS patients was significantly higher than in non-MFS patients at 1 year after discharged. The QoL in young AAAD patients with MFS is lower than those without MFS after surgery. This may be associated with the uncontrollable persistent chronic pain and the uncertainty and concerns for the disease's progression."

Natriuretic peptides, such as BNP and NT-proBNP, play a crucial role in diagnosing HF due to their s pecificity and reproducibility. It is important to measuring natriuretic peptides, especially in cases of acute dyspnea, to differentiate cardiac causes from others. Specific thresholds are recommended, with high values strongly suggest HF, while normal levels rule out the diagnosis. Clinical characteristics, such as age, renal function, atrial fibrillation, obesity, and gender, influence natriuretic peptides levels and should be considered in interpretation. For diabetic, hypertensive, and obese patients, early screening for HF through natriuretic peptides measurement is crucial. Furthermore, these natriuretic peptides are useful for monitoring chronic heart failure patients. They assist in confirming decompensation, titrating treatment, evaluating treatment response, and establishing prognosis. However, it's essential to choose a single biomarker (BNP or NT-proBNP) to avoid confusion."

This study included patients with MFS who had in-the-bag intraocular lens (IOL) implantation assisted by CTR-CH or modified CTR (MCTR). The safety analysis focused on the resurgery rate. The efficacy analysis compared the corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and the incidence of laser capsulotomy after propensity score matching (PSM). This study encompassed 148 eyes that had the CTR-CH procedure and 162 eyes that received MCTR implantation. In the CTR-CH group, the median age at the time of surgery was 5 years, with a mean follow-up duration of 1.81 ± 0.4 years. 5 eyes (3.38%) required a second surgery because of retinal detachment (2, 1.35%), IOL decentration (2, 1.35%), and CH dislocation (1, 0.68%). The resurgery rate was comparable with that of the MCTR group ( P = .486). After PSM, a total of 108 eyes were recruited in each group. Postoperative CDVA was significantly improved in both groups (both P < .001), but comparable between the groups ( P = .057). The posterior capsular opacification took place earlier ( P = .046) while the anterior capsular opacification required laser capsulotomy at a later stage ( P = .037) compared with the MCTR group. The CTR-CH procedure was a feasible, safe, and efficient approach for managing EL in patients with MFS."

The TriNetX Analytics platform, a federated health research network of aggregated deidentified electronic health record data of more than 119 million patients, was used to identify patients diagnosed with Marfan syndrome. Univariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of ocular manifestations of Marfan syndrome (such as retinal tears/detachment, lens dislocation, and myopia), with cardiovascular comorbidities. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed using propensity matching. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated for incidence of cardiovascular comorbidities (including aortic dissection, valvular disease, and arrhythmias) following diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. A total of 19,105 patients were identified who were diagnosed with Marfan disease without ocular manifestations, and an additional 3887 Marfan patients with ocular comorbidities. Patients who were diagnosed with ocular disease included 883 with ectopic lens, 417 with retinal tear or detachment, 683 with aphakia, 534 with pseudophakia, and 2465 with myopia. Patients with any ocular manifestations of Marfan were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with all cardiovascular comorbidities modeled including aortic aneurysm and dissection (OR 2.035; P < .0001), mitral valve prolapse (OR 2.725; P < .0001), tricuspid valve disorders (OR 2.142; P < .0001), cardiac arrhythmias (OR 1.836; P < .0001), and all cardiovascular outcomes combined (OR 2.194; P < .0001).

The identification of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in the FBN1 gene, associated with specific clinical features such as aortic root dilatation or ectopia lentis, is a major diagnostic criterion for MFS. Understanding genotype-phenotype correlations is useful for determining the timing of follow-up, guiding prophylactic aortic root surgery, and providing more precise information to patients and their family members during genetic counseling. Genetic testing is also relevant in distinguishing MFS from other conditions that present with heritable thoracic aortic diseases, allowing for tailored and individualized management. Genetic testing is essential in different steps of the MFS patients' clinical pathway, starting from the phase of diagnosis to management and specific treatment."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation is a non-invasive, widely employed procedure that uses diode laser to target the ciliary body to lower the intraocular pressure. Despite its acknowledged efficacy, certain complications are recognized, with neurotrophic keratopathy being a rare yet serious consequence. This report seeks to shed light on a potential high-risk subgroup susceptible to neurotrophic keratopathy, exemplified by our patient with Marfan syndrome, a condition characterized by thin sclera. CASE REPORT Our patient, who was confirmed to have Marfan syndrome with pseudophakic glaucoma, underwent micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation due to high intraocular pressure bilaterally and subsequently quickly manifested neurotrophic keratopathy in both eyes postoperatively. Swift initiation of management involved a comprehensive approach, including topical antibiotics, preservative-free lubrication, medroxyprogesterone acetate 1%, serum balanced salt solution (BSS) 50%, and the application of bandage contact lenses to expedite healing. Fortunately, the left eye demonstrated resolution within 10 days, while the right eye exhibited delayed healing, leading to subsequent scarring. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights the critical importance of recognizing populations predisposed to neurotrophic keratopathy before subjecting them to micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation. Such awareness allows for the fine-tuning of procedural parameters, offering a strategic approach to mitigate the risk of neurotrophic keratopathy development. By further exploring and recognizing potential risk factors, clinicians can enhance patient outcomes and refine the safety profile of micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation."

Accordingly, drug therapy uses TGFβ receptor blockade to slow down the cardiovascular manifestations, above all aortic root dilatation. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to reduce TGFβ levels in adults. Data on childhood are lacking and are now being investigated in the TiGer For Kids study presented here. We examined 125 children without chronic disease and 31 pediatric Marfan patients with a proven <i>FBN1</i> variant with regard to TGFβ levels. In addition, we measured TGFβ levels during the initiation of ARB therapy in pediatric Marfan patients. In children without chronic disease, TGFβ levels were found to decrease from childhood to adolescence (<i>p</i> < 0.0125). We could not measure a relevantly increased TGFβ level in pediatric Marfan patients. However, we showed a significant suppression of the TGFβ level after treatment with ARBs (<i>p</i> < 0.0125) and a renewed increase shortly before the next dose. The TGFβ level in childhood changes in an age-dependent manner and decreases with age. The TGFβ level drops significantly after taking ARBs. Based on our experience and data, a TGFβ receptor blockade in childhood seems reasonable. So far, TGFβ level cannot be used as an MFS screening biomarker."

Non-invasive imaging modalities, including echocardiogram, computerized tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, are essential in monitoring these patients, as well as providing new prognostic factors of arterial stiffness that may help with risk stratification in the future. Diagnosis of heritable aortopathies should be considered with identification of aortic root dilation, particularly in children and young adults, or when there is a family history of aortic disease.

Medical records of CEL patients under 6-year-old who were diagnosed with Marfan syndrome at the initial visit from January 2014 to March 2022 were collected and were divided into surgery and non-surgery groups. Mean change rate of SE in the two groups was evaluated, and the potential associated factors of SE change rate were investigated by mixed-effect regression model. A total of 94 preschool patients from 14 provinces of China were included. Among the 42 children of the surgery group, the mean age with standard deviation (SD) was 5.02 ± 0.81 years and patients experienced a myopic shift of -0.05 ± 0.09 D/month in average. The mean age with SD of the 52 children of the non-surgery group was 4.34 ± 1.02 years, and the mean myopic shift was -0.09 ± 0.14 D/month. The mixed-effect regression model identified that higher degree of myopia at baseline was associated with slower myopic shift both in surgery (β = 0.901, 95% CI: 0.822 ~ 0.980, P < 0.001) and in non-surgery group (β = 1.006, 95% CI: 0.977 ~ 1.034, P < 0.001) in CEL patients. Surgical treatment (β = 2.635, 95% CI: 1.376 ~ 3.894, P < 0.001) was associated with slower myopic shift in all participants CEL patients.

    "abstract": "Major pathologic changes in the proximal aorta underlie the life-threatening aortic aneurysms and dissections in Marfan Syndrome; current treatments delay aneurysm development without addressing the primary pathology. Because excess oxidative stress and nitric oxide/protein kinase G signaling likely contribute to the aortopathy, we hypothesized that cobinamide, a strong antioxidant that can attenuate nitric oxide signaling, could be uniquely suited to prevent aortic disease. In a well-characterized mouse model of Marfan Syndrome, cobinamide dramatically reduced elastin breaks, prevented excess collagen deposition and smooth muscle cell apoptosis, and blocked DNA, lipid, and protein oxidation and excess nitric oxide/protein kinase G signaling in the ascending aorta. Consistent with preventing pathologic changes, cobinamide diminished aortic root dilation without affecting blood pressure. Cobinamide exhibited excellent safety and pharmacokinetic profiles indicating it could be a practical treatment. We conclude that cobinamide deserves further study as a disease-modifying treatment of Marfan Syndrome."

Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality; secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and complications. We identified 78 cases of type A aortic dissection in heart transplantation recipients. Compared with type A aortic dissection patients without a history of solid organ transplantation (N = 70,715), our patients were younger (55.3 vs 60.7 years), less likely female (18.5% vs 33.5%), and more frequently Black or Hispanic (55% vs 23%).

Genome sequencing on a proband and her mother with comparable phenotypic features revealed that both patients were heterozygous for a stop-gain variant c.1084C>T (p.Arg362*). Complementary RNA-seq on fibroblasts revealed significantly reduced levels of mutant EFEMP1 transcript. Considering the absence of other molecular explanations, we extrapolated that EFEMP1 could be the cause of the patient's phenotypes. Furthermore, nonsense-mediated decay was demonstrated for the mutant allele as the principal mechanism for decreased levels of EFEMP1 mRNA. We provide strong clinical and genetic evidence for the haploinsufficiency of EFEMP1 due to nonsense-medicated decay to cause severe kyphoscoliosis, generalized hypermobility of joints, high and narrow arched palate, and potentially severe diverticulosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an autosomal dominant EFEMP1-associated hereditary connective tissue disorder and therefore expands the phenotypic spectrum of EFEMP1 related disorders."

    "abstract": "Aortic root aneurysms are one of the most common aortic root diseases, involving the aortic valve, aortic sinus, bilateral coronary arteries, and part of the ascending aorta. It is a life-threatening aortic disease with a high mortality rate of approximately 90%, due to aortic aneurysm rupture. Aortic valve insufficiency is one of the most common complications of aortic root aneurysms that can lead to acute left heart failure. The etiology of aortic root aneurysms is not yet completely clear and is mainly related to genetic diseases, such as Marfan syndrome and atherosclerosis. It can also occur secondary to aortic valve stenosis or a bivalve deformity. Surgery is the primary treatment for aortic root aneurysms, and aortic root replacement is a classic surgical method. However, the incidences of perioperative complications and mortality are relatively high, particularly in high-risk patients. In recent years, the anatomical structure of the aortic root has been gradually refined, and an in-depth understanding of root aneurysms has led to individualized treatment methods. Conservative drug therapy (ß-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers), Bentall and modified Bentall surgeries (Button technology, Cabrol surgery, and modified Cabrol surgery), valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David and Yacoub), personalized external aortic root support, and endovascular intervention therapy have significantly improved the perioperative and long-term survival rates of patients with aortic root aneurysms. However, different treatment methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. This review aimed to summarize the current research progress and treatment of aortic root aneurysms."

    "abstract": "Four-dimensional (4D) flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often relies on the injection of gadolinium- or iron-oxide-based contrast agents to improve vessel delineation. In this work, a novel technique is developed to acquire and reconstruct 4D flow data with excellent dynamic visualization of blood vessels but without the need for contrast injection. Synchronization of Neighboring Acquisitions by Physiological Signals (SyNAPS) uses pilot tone (PT) navigation to retrospectively synchronize the reconstruction of two free-running three-dimensional radial acquisitions, to create co-registered anatomy and flow images. Thirteen volunteers and two Marfan syndrome patients were scanned without contrast agent using one free-running fast interrupted steady-state (FISS) sequence and one free-running phase-contrast MRI (PC-MRI) sequence. PT signals spanning the two sequences were recorded for retrospective respiratory motion correction and cardiac binning. The magnitude and phase images reconstructed, respectively, from FISS and PC-MRI, were synchronized to create SyNAPS 4D flow datasets. Conventional two-dimensional (2D) flow data were acquired for reference in ascending (AAo) and descending aorta (DAo). The blood-to-myocardium contrast ratio, dynamic vessel area, net volume, and peak flow were used to compare SyNAPS 4D flow with Native 4D flow (without FISS information) and 2D flow. A score of 0-4 was given to each dataset by two blinded experts regarding the feasibility of performing vessel delineation. Blood-to-myocardium contrast ratio for SyNAPS 4D flow magnitude images (1.5 ± 0.3) was significantly higher than for Native 4D flow (0.7 ± 0.1, p < 0.01) and was comparable to 2D flow (2.3 ± 0.9, p = 0.02). Image quality scores of SyNAPS 4D flow from the experts (M.P.: 1.9 ± 0.3, E.T.: 2.5 ± 0.5) were overall significantly higher than the scores from Native 4D flow (M.P.: 1.6 ± 0.6, p = 0.03, E.T.: 0.8 ± 0.4, p < 0.01) but still significantly lower than the scores from the reference 2D flow datasets (M.P.: 2.8 ± 0.4, p < 0.01, E.T.: 3.5 ± 0.7, p < 0.01). The Pearson correlation coefficient between the dynamic vessel area measured on SyNAPS 4D flow and that from 2D flow was 0.69 ± 0.24 for the AAo and 0.83 ± 0.10 for the DAo, whereas the Pearson correlation between Native 4D flow and 2D flow measurements was 0.12 ± 0.48 for the AAo and 0.08 ± 0.39 for the DAo. Linear correlations between SyNAPS 4D flow and 2D flow measurements of net volume (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.83) and peak flow (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.87) were larger than the correlations between Native 4D flow and 2D flow measurements of net volume (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.79) and peak flow (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.76). The feasibility and utility of SyNAPS were demonstrated for joint whole-heart anatomical and flow MRI without requiring electrocardiography gating, respiratory navigators, or contrast agents. Using SyNAPS, a high-contrast anatomical imaging sequence can be used to improve 4D flow measurements that often suffer from poor delineation of vessel boundaries in the absence of contrast agents."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the Fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) with significant clinical features in the skeletal, cardiopulmonary, and ocular systems. To gain deeper insights into the contribution of epigenetics in the variability of phenotypes observed in MFS, we undertook the first analysis of integrating DNA methylation and gene expression profiles in whole blood from MFS and healthy controls (HCs). The Illumina 850K (EPIC) DNA methylation array was used to detect DNA methylation changes on peripheral blood samples of seven patients with MFS and five HCs. Associations between methylation levels and clinical features of MFS were analyzed. Subsequently, we conducted an integrated analysis of the outcomes of the transcriptome data to analyze the correlation between differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and explore the potential role of methylation-regulated DEGs (MeDEGs) in MFS scoliosis. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to find gene modules with the highest correlation coefficient with target MeDEGs to annotate their functions in MFS. Our study identified 1253 DMPs annotated to 236 genes that were primarily associated with scoliosis, cardiomyopathy, and vital capacity. These conditions are typically associated with reduced lifespan in untreated MFS. We calculated correlations between DMPs and clinical features, such as cobb angle to evaluate scoliosis and FEV1% to assess pulmonary function. Notably, cg20223687 (PTPRN2) exhibited a positive correlation with cobb angle of scoliosis, potentially playing a role in ERKs inactivation. Taken together, our systems-level approach sheds light on the contribution of epigenetics to MFS and offers a plausible explanation for the complex phenotypes that are linked to reduced lifespan in untreated MFS patients."

    "abstract": "Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) is a large, cysteine-rich, calcium binding extracellular matrix glycoprotein encoded by <i>FBN1</i> gene. It serves as a structural component of microfibrils and provides force-bearing mechanical support in elastic and nonelastic connective tissue. As such, mutations in the <i>FBN1</i> gene can cause a wide variety of genetic diseases such as Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by ocular, skeletal and cardiovascular abnormalities. FBN1 also interacts with numerous microfibril-associated proteins, growth factors and cell membrane receptors, thereby mediating a wide range of biological processes such as cell survival, proliferation, migration and differentiation. Dysregulation of FBN1 is involved in the pathogenesis of many human diseases, such as cancers, cardiovascular disorders and kidney diseases. Paradoxically, both depletion and overexpression of FBN1 upregulate the bioavailability and signal transduction of TGF-β via distinct mechanisms in different settings. In this review, we summarize the structure and expression of FBN1 and present our current understanding of the functional role of FBN1 in various human diseases. This knowledge will allow to develop better strategies for therapeutic intervention of FBN1 related diseases."

Currently, no effective pharmacological therapies have been identified to slow TAA development and prevent TAA rupture. Large TAAs are treated with open surgical repair and less invasive thoracic endovascular aortic repair, both of which have high perioperative mortality risk. Therefore, there is an urgent medical need to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying TAA development and rupture to develop new therapies. In this review, we summarize animal TAA models including recent developments in porcine and zebrafish models: porcine models can assess new therapeutic devices or intervention strategies in a large mammal and zebrafish models can employ large-scale small-molecule suppressor screening in microwells. The second part of the review covers current views of TAA pathogenesis, derived from recent studies using these animal models, with a focus on the roles of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) pathway and the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)-elastin-contractile unit. The last part discusses TAA treatment options as they emerge from recent preclinical studies."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS), caused by pathogenic variants of FBN1 (fibrillin-1), is a systemic connective tissue disorder with variable phenotypes and treatment responsiveness depending on the variant. However, a significant number of individuals with MFS remain genetically unexplained. In this study, we report novel pathogenic intronic variants in FBN1 in two unrelated families with MFS. We evaluated subjects with suspected MFS from two unrelated families using Sanger sequencing or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of FBN1 and/or panel-based next-generation sequencing. As no pathogenic variants were identified, whole-genome sequencing was performed. Identified variants were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR and targeted sequencing of FBN1 mRNA harvested from peripheral blood or skin fibroblasts obtained from affected probands. We found causative deep intronic variants, c.6163+1484A>T and c.5788+36C>A, in FBN1. The splicing analysis revealed an insertion of in-frame or out-of-frame intronic sequences of the FBN1 transcript predicted to alter function of calcium-binding epidermal growth factor protein domain. Family members carrying c.6163+1484A>T had high systemic scores including prominent skeletal features and aortic dissection with lesser aortic dilatation. Family members carrying c.5788+36C>A had more severe aortic root dilatation without aortic dissection. Both families had ectopia lentis. Variable penetrance of the phenotype and negative genetic testing in MFS families should raise the possibility of deep intronic FBN1 variants and the need for additional molecular studies. This study expands the mutation spectrum of FBN1 and points out the importance of intronic sequence analysis and the need for integrative functional studies in MFS diagnosis."

Myocardial dysfunction has been observed in a subset of patients with MFS and in several MFS mouse models. However, there is limited understanding of the intrinsic consequences of FBN1 variants on cardiomyocytes (CMs). To elucidate the CM-specific contribution in Marfan's cardiomyopathy, cardiosphere cultures of CMs and cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are used. CMs and CFs were derived by human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation from MFS iPSCs with a pathogenic variant in FBN1 (c.3725G>A; p.Cys1242Tyr) and the corresponding CRISPR-corrected iPSC line (Cor). Cardiospheres containing MFS CMs show decreased FBN1, COL1A2 and GJA1 expression. MFS CMs cultured in cardiospheres have fewer binucleated CMs in comparison with Cor CMs. 13% of MFS CMs in cardiospheres are binucleated and 15% and 16% in cardiospheres that contain co-cultures with respectively MFS CFs and Cor CFs, compared to Cor CMs, that revealed up to 23% binucleation when co-cultured with CFs. The sarcomere length of CMs, as a marker of development, is significantly increased in MFS CMs interacting with Cor CF or MFS CF, as compared to monocultured MFS CMs. Nuclear blebbing was significantly more frequent in MFS CFs, which correlated with increased stiffness of the nuclear area compared to Cor CFs. Our cardiosphere model for Marfan-related cardiomyopathy identified a contribution of CFs in Marfan-related cardiomyopathy and suggests that abnormal early development of CMs may play a role in the disease mechanism."

It is frequently associated with lens subluxation, translating into a high degree of variable lenticular myopia and defective accommodation. The purpose of this report is to describe the treatment of a three-year-old female patient with microspherophakia, with the scleral fixation of an intraocular lens using the z-suture technique. A three-year-old female patient with Marfan Syndrome presented with high bilateral myopia and esotropia. Lens subluxation was perceived, and she was proposed for bilateral surgery. Scleral fixation of the intraocular lens was performed using the z-suture technique. During the five-year follow-up period, she maintained a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20 in both eyes wearing bifocal glasses. Microspherophakia is a rare but impactful condition, frequently related to severe and variable refractive error due to the lens shape and zonule instability. Intraocular lens implantation in the capsular bag is usually impossible, and scleral fixation is a valid alternative. The z-suture technique avoids suture knots and the need for intrascleral flaps, reducing the risk of suture-related complications."

A total of 4,092 patients undergoing primary TKA were analyzed, of which 372 had MFS. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were done for medical complications up to 90 days and surgical complications up to 2 years. 90-day emergency department-visits and inpatient readmissions were also documented. Compared to the matched controls, patients who have MFS displayed elevated rates of surgical complications, including prosthetic instability (1-year, odds ratio (OR) 3.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.58 to 8.66]; 2-year, OR 4.39, 95% CI [2.16 to 8.44]), and revision surgery (2 year, OR 1.79, 95% CI [1.05 to 2.91]). Additionally, patients who have MFS demonstrated significant higher rates of medical complications, including aortic dissection (2.15 versus 0%) and transfusion (OR 2.63, 95% CI [1.31 to 4.90]). Patients who have MFS are at higher risks of postoperative complications after TKA, encompassing both medical and surgical complications. Specifically, patients who have MFS have a significantly higher likelihood of experiencing prosthetic instability and requiring revision surgery. Given these results, it is crucial for orthopedic surgeons and patients alike to consider these risks when determining a course of TKA for patients who have MFS."

    "abstract": "Liver transplantation is the definitive therapy for patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Marfan syndrome is a systemic inheritable connective tissue disease associated with fibrillin-1 gene mutations, which cause abnormalities in connective tissue. Vascular changes due to Marfan syndrome occur mostly in the main vessels due to the high amount of connective tissue within the vessel wall and the high pressure and blood flow to which they are exposed. The incidence of changes in visceral arteries is about 0.42% and usually presents with cystic medial necrosis. This report is the first deceased-donor liver transplantation with a donor with Marfan syndrome with a history of abdominal surgery. A patient in his 50s underwent liver transplantation for decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis. The donor, a 50s male with Marfan syndrome, was diagnosed with brain-death due to a cerebral hemorrhage caused by a cerebral aneurysm. The donor's clinical presentation as Marfan syndrome was aortic dissection, with multiple surgical procedures performed from the aortic root to the abdominal aorta. An intraoperative biopsy of the hepatic artery showed no abnormality, so this organ was considered appropriate. The surgery was completed without any problems of the arterial anastomosis. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was transferred to a hospital for recuperation on the 18th postoperative day. One year after the surgery, the patient is still alive without any complications from the transplantation or arterial problems. Even if the patient had a history of surgery for vascular anomalies extending to the abdominal aorta due to Marfan syndrome, the patient can be a donor for liver transplantation under appropriate judgment, including intraoperative biopsy."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection (TAAD) is a lethal vascular disease, and several pathological factors participate in aortic medial degeneration. We previously discovered that the complement C3a-C3aR axis in smooth muscle cells promotes the development of thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) through regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 2. However, discerning the specific complement pathway that is activated and elucidating how inflammation of the aortic wall is initiated remain unknown. We ascertained that the plasma levels of C3a and C5a were significantly elevated in patients with TAD and that the levels of C3a, C4a, and C5a were higher in acute TAD than in chronic TAD. We also confirmed the activation of the complement in a TAD mouse model. Subsequently, knocking out Cfb (Cfb) or C4 in mice with TAD revealed that the alternative pathway and Cfb played a significant role in the TAD process. Activation of the alternative pathway led to generation of the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, and knocking out their receptors reduced the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the aortic wall. Moreover, we used serum from wild-type mice or recombinant mice Cfb as an exogenous source of Cfb to treat Cfb KO mice and observed that it exacerbated the onset and rupture of TAD. Finally, we knocked out Cfb in the FBN1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> Marfan-syndrome mice and showed that the occurrence of TAA was reduced. In summary, the alternative complement pathway promoted the development of TAAD by recruiting infiltrating inflammatory cells. Targeting the alternative pathway may thus constitute a strategy for preventing the development of TAAD.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> The alternative complement pathway promoted the development of TAAD by recruiting infiltrating inflammatory cells.

However, in some cases, both interventions are challenging because of the inability to reach an aneurysm through a safe route or postoperative adhesion. This report describes the case of a 43-year-old patient with a left subclavian artery aneurysm and Marfan syndrome. In this case, the patient's 5 previous surgeries related to Marfan syndrome made surgery and endovascular treatment difficult. Therefore, an alternative was researched, and we decided to perform a method of percutaneous embolization with coils and N-butyl cyanoacrylate using the direct puncture technique, which succeeded in eliminating the blood flow in the left subclavian artery aneurysm. No severe complications were associated with the procedure. The patient was free from the risk of an aneurysm rupture post-treatment, and the left back pain improved. Follow-up computed tomography 2 years postsurgery revealed the aneurysm being under control without re-enlarging. Our method is considered an effective and safe therapeutic option for cases in which surgical approach and transarterial access routes are limited."

In the study, we explored the pathogenic gene variant and aqueous humor (AH) metabolites alterations of MFS. Using WGS, a novel heterozygous variant (NM_000138: c.G4192A, p.D1398 N) in the fibrilin-1 (<i>FBN1)</i> gene was identified. This variant was co-segregated with the phenotype and considered \"deleterious\" and highly conserved during evolution. The p.D1398 N variant is located in a cbEGF-like domain and predicted to lead to a new splice site, which might result in structural and functional changes to the FBN1 protein. <i>FBN1</i> is highly expressed in the mouse cornea, conjunctiva and lens capsule, which highlights the important role of FBN1 in eyeball development. AH metabolomics analysis identified eight differentially expressed metabolites, including 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 4-pyridoxic acid, aminoadipic acid, azelaic acid, chlordiazepoxide, niacinamide, ribose, 1,5-bisphosphate and se-methylselenocysteine, associated with relevant metabolic pathways likely involved in the pathogenesis of ocular symptoms in MFS. Our analysis extends the existing spectrum of disease-causing mutations and reveals metabolites information related to the ophthalmic features of MFS. This may provide a new sight and a basis for the diagnosis and mechanism of MFS."

In this study, we examine the structure-function-mechanics relations of the mitral valve related to specific transitions in ECM composition and organization in progressive MVD in MFS mice from Postnatal day (P)7 to 1 year-of-age. Mechanistic links between mechanical forces and biological changes in MVD progression were examined in Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> MFS mice. By echocardiography, mitral valve dysfunction is prevalent at 2 months with a decrease in cardiac function at 6 months, followed by a preserved cardiac function at 12 months. Mitral valve (MV) regurgitation occurs in a subset of mice at 2-6 months, while progressive dilatation of the aorta occurs from 2 to 12 months. Mitral valve tissue mechanical assessments using a uniaxial Permeabilizable Fiber System demonstrate decreased stiffness of MFS MVs at all stages. Histological and microscopic analysis of ECM content, structure, and fiber orientation demonstrate that alterations in ECM mechanics, composition, and organization precede functional abnormalities in Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup>MFS MVs. At 2 months, ECM abnormalities are detected with an increase in proteoglycans and decreased stiffness of the mitral valve. By 6-12 months, collagen fiber remodeling is increased with abnormal fiber organization in MFS mitral valve leaflets. At the same time, matrifibrocyte gene expression characteristic of collagen-rich connective tissue is increased, as detected by RNA in situ hybridization and qPCR. Together, these studies demonstrate early prevalence of proteoglycans at 2 months followed by upregulation of collagen structure and organization with age in MVs of MFS mice. Altogether, our data indicate dynamic regulation of mitral valve structure, tissue mechanics, and function that reflect changes in ECM composition, organization, and gene expression in progressive MVD. Notably, increased collagen fiber organization and orientation, potentially dependent on increased matrifibrocyte cell activity, is apparent with altered mitral valve mechanics and function in aging MFS mice."

Regnase-1 is an endoribonuclease shown to cleave the mRNA of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6. Considering the major anti-inflammatory effects of regnase-1, here, we aimed to determine whether adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated vascular overexpression of the protein could provide protection from the development and progression of aortic aneurysms in Marfan syndrome. The overexpression of regnase-1 resulted in a marked decrease in inflammatory parameters and elastin degradation in aortic smooth muscle cells <i>in vitro</i>. Intravenous injection of a vascular-targeted AAV vector resulted in the efficient transduction of the aortic wall and overexpression of regnase-1 in a murine model of Marfan syndrome, associated with lower circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines and decreased MMP expression and activity. Regnase-1 overexpression strongly improved elastin architecture in the media and reduced aortic diameter at distinct locations. Therefore, AAV-mediated regnase-1 overexpression may represent a novel gene therapy approach for inhibiting aortic aneurysms in Marfan syndrome."

While various conditions causing TAAD exhibit aortic accumulation of the proteoglycans versican (Vcan) and aggrecan (Acan), it is unclear whether these ECM proteins are involved in aortic disease. Here, we find that Vcan, but not Acan, accumulated in Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> aortas, a mouse model of MFS. Vcan haploinsufficiency protected MFS mice against aortic dilation, and its silencing reverted aortic disease by reducing Nos2 protein expression. Our results suggest that Acan is not an essential contributor to MFS aortopathy. We further demonstrate that Vcan triggers Akt activation and that pharmacological Akt pathway inhibition rapidly regresses aortic dilation and Nos2 expression in MFS mice. Analysis of aortic tissue from MFS human patients revealed accumulation of VCAN and elevated pAKT-S473 staining. Together, these findings reveal that Vcan plays a causative role in MFS aortic disease in vivo by inducing Nos2 via Akt activation and identify Akt signaling pathway components as candidate therapeutic targets."

Our aim was to analyze the management of spontaneous pneumothorax in children and adolescents with Marfan syndrome, comparing syndromic and non-syndromic patients. Retrospective analysis of pediatric patients (18 years) with SP diagnosed at our tertiary pediatric hospital (January 10-June 22), with special emphasis on diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up (FU). Sixty-six patients with SP were identified, with nine (13%) having MS. In terms of baseline, there were no significant differences between the groups (age, sex, asthma, symptoms, and side, first-line treatment and hospitalization length). Overall, Marfan patients had significantly more first-line treatment failures requiring additional surgery, as well as more contralateral occurrences and the need for surgery/chest drain during the follow-up. Instead, conservative management resulted in significantly more ipsilateral recurrences and the need for surgery/chest drain in Marfan patients than controls during the follow-up. Treatment failure, contralateral occurrence, ipsilateral recurrence, and the need for surgery/chest drain during follow-up make management of patients with Marfan syndrome and spontaneous pneumothorax more difficult.

    "abstract": "The study objective was to determine repair durability and survival in patients with and without connective tissue disorders undergoing concomitant aortic valve reimplantation and mitral valve repair. From 2002 to 2019, 68 patients underwent concomitant aortic valve reimplantation and mitral valve repair, including 27 patients with Marfan syndrome (39.7%). Follow-up echocardiograms were analyzed using nonlinear multiphase mixed-effects cumulative logistic regression. The regurgitation grade over time was estimated by averaging patient-specific profiles. Survival and freedom from reoperation were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. At 7 years, 11% of patients had aortic insufficiency greater than mild (severe in 2 patients). There was no difference in greater than mild aortic insufficiency between patients with or without Marfan syndrome (<i>P</i> = .37). Twenty percent of patients had progressed to mitral regurgitation greater than mild (severe in only 1 patient). The prevalence of recurrent mitral regurgitation was higher in those without Marfan syndrome, with greater than mild regurgitation increasing to 24% by 2 years and remaining constant thereafter (<i>P</i> = .04). Freedom from reoperation on the aortic valve or mitral valve was 83% at 10 years and did not differ between Marfan syndrome groups. There were no cases of perioperative mortality. Survival at 5 and 10 years was 94% and 87%, respectively, without a difference between those with and without Marfan syndrome. Patients can undergo a total repair strategy using combined aortic valve reimplantation and mitral valve repair procedures with a low risk of mortality and complications, with favorable freedom from both residual valve regurgitation and reoperation."

    "abstract": "Congenital ectopia lentis is characterized by dislocation of the lens caused by partial or complete abnormalities in the zonular fibers. It can be caused by either systemic diseases or isolated ocular diseases. Gene detection techniques can provide valuable information when an etiological diagnosis is challenging. Herein, we report the case of a six-year-old girl with a confirmed diagnosis of isolated ectopia lentis caused by a compound heterozygous ADAMTSL4 gene mutation. The patient was a 6-year-old Chinese Han girl with strabismus in the right eye. Slit lamp examination revealed that the lens in the right eye was opacified and dislocated, without an ectopic pupil. Gene detection demonstrated the presence of a compound heterozygous mutation in the ADAMTSL4 gene [c. 2270dupG (p.Gly758Trpfs *59) and c. 2110A > G (p.Ser704Gly)], and the diagnosis of isolated ectopia lentis was confirmed. She underwent lens extraction, and a sutured scleral-fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) was placed in the right eye. The best-corrected visual acuity was 0.1 one month postoperatively. Gene detection plays a crucial role in diagnosing disorders with similar symptoms, such as isolated ectopia lentis and Marfan syndrome. In this study, we used whole exons sequencing to diagnose isolated ectopia lentis and identified the variant c.2110A > G (p.Ser704Gly), which may be associated with the development of ectopia lentis and early-onset cataract in the patient. These pathogenic gene mutations have significant implications for the genetic diagnosis of congenital ectopia lentis, treatment, surveillance, and hereditary and prenatal counseling for the patient and their family members."

This retrospective assessment included consecutive patients undergoing acute type A aortic dissection surgery in the authors' hospital from September 2017 to June 2021. The authors used LASSO (logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression analysis to identify the most relevant variables associated with PI by running cyclic coordinate descent with 10-times cross-validation. The variables selected by LASSO regression analysis were subjected to multivariate logistic analysis. A calibration plot, receiver operating characteristic curve, and decision curve analysis were used to validate the model. There were 469 patients in the study, including 94 (27.5%) with postoperative PI. Ten variables were selected from LASSO regression: body mass index, diabetes, Marfan syndrome, stroke, preoperative skin moisture, hemoglobin, albumin, serum creatinine, platelet, and d-dimer. Four risk factors emerged after multivariate logistic regression: Marfan syndrome, preoperative skin moisture, albumin, and serum creatinine. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model was 0.765. The calibration plot and the decision curve analysis both suggested that the model was suitable for predicting postoperative PI. This study built an efficient predictive model that could help identify high-risk patients."

Due to concomitant Marfan syndrome, the patient also presented an aortic root aneurysm needing surgical treatment under cardiopulmonary bypass. Concerns arose regarding the ability to maintain sufficient perfusion pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass due to the arterio-venous malformations. To address this, an intravascular balloon occlusion at the level of the aortic bifurcation was placed in order to limit arterial inflow into the arterio-venous malformations and achieve optimal perfusion pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass.

The aortic root is reconstructed according to the remodelling technique, the aortic valve is repaired according to the principle of effective height, and an external ring provides annular support. The purpose of this study was to evaluate operative and mid-term outcomes using this technique in patients with Marfan syndrome. Adult patients with Marfan syndrome who had an indication for aortic root surgery according to European Society of Cardiology guidelines and were operated on using this new root replacement technique were retrospectively evaluated. Follow-up was obtained from standard outpatient visits and included echocardiography. The study group comprised 22 patients (mean age 36 years, 68% males). Mean follow-up was 7.5 years. There were no mortalities. Two patients required aortic valve replacement because of aortic regurgitation. In both patients, the aortic root was severely dilated (≥65 mm) preoperatively, with grade III aortic valve regurgitation and aortic valve cusps that were very fragile. Aortic regurgitation was grade ≤I on follow-up in 18 of the remaining 20 patients. Valve-sparing root replacement using remodelling combined with aortic-ring annuloplasty is safe in patients with Marfan syndrome. The mid-term outcome is promising in patients undergoing elective valve-sparing root replacement at recommended root diameters. However, in patients with extremely dilated aortic roots and already severe aortic regurgitation, the technique should be used cautiously as aortic cusps are fragile and might not be suitable for durable repair.

Several non- and syndromic conditions such as a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and Marfan syndrome (MFS) have a severely increased risk to develop a thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection. To date, the medial layer has been extensively studied in search of the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to aortic complications. We aim to determine whether intimal layer pathology is characteristic in all thoracic aortopathy regardless of the underlying etiology. A total of 176 aortic wall specimen were studied for the intimal layer architecture including the intimal thickness, endothelial cell morphology, and atherosclerosis. Specimens were derived from four patient groups: BAV (<i>n</i> = 70, age 57 ± 8.9 years), isolated tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) (<i>n</i> = 38, age 64.9 ± 11.0 years), MFS with a TAV (<i>n</i> = 8, age 34.2 ± 11.0 years), type A dissections with a TAV (<i>n</i> = 60, age 62.7 ± 10 years). The intimal layer is significantly thinner in BAV, MFS, and type A aortic dissection as compared to the isolated TAV patients (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Intimal atherosclerosis was also significantly less present in the three groups as compared to the isolated TAV (<i>p</i> < 0.05). A thin intimal layer is a common finding in the thoracic aortopathy patients. Studies aiming at preventing future aortic complications should focus on the intimal pathology as a common effector pathway in thoracic aortopathy."

Early detection in ophthalmology clinics and timely intervention of cardiovascular complications can be lifesaving. In this study, a modified proteomics workflow with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based data-independent acquisition (DIA) and field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) to profile the proteomes of aqueous humor (AH) and lens tissue from MFS children with ectopia lentis is utilized. Over 2300 and 2938 comparable proteins are identified in AH and the lens capsule, respectively. Functional enrichment analyses uncovered dysregulation of complement and coagulation-related pathways, collagen binding, and cell adhesion in MFS. Through weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and machine learning, distinct modules associated with clinical traits are constructed and a unique biomarker panel (Q14376, Q99972, P02760, Q07507; gene names: GALE, MYOC, AMBP, DPT) is defined. These biomarkers are further validated using advanced parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) in an independent patient cohort. The results provide novel insights into the proteome characterization of ectopia lentis and offer a promising approach for developing a valuable biomarker panel to aid in the early diagnosis of Marfan syndrome via AH proteome."

A 47-year-old woman underwent ascending aortic replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for type A acute aortic dissection involving the right coronary artery ostium in 2017. Subsequently, she was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome. Five years later in 2022, she underwent aortic arch replacement, the Bentall procedure, and repeat CABG because of aortic root enlargement and aortic regurgitation progression. Twelve days after surgery, coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) revealed left anterior descending (LAD) artery stenosis, whereas pre-operative CCTA was normal. On post-operative day 13, coronary angiography revealed 99% LAD artery stenosis. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) showed a non-echoic mass with clear margins, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated a crystalloid mass. Both images suggested that the embolus was inorganic matter, suspected as being the surgical adhesive BioGlue. We could not remove the embolus by repeated thrombectomy; therefore, drug-eluting stent implantation was performed. Seven months after surgery, she had no symptoms, and CCTA confirmed stent patency. To our knowledge, this is the first case report to describe BioGlue embolism observed by OCT. We performed an <i>in vitro</i> study using a blood vessel model, and the obtained OCT image was very similar to the <i>in vivo</i> image.

Rare-disease policy, specifically research priority setting for the allocation of limited research resources, is an area where evidence generation through stakeholder involvement is expected to be effective. We generated evidence for rare-disease policymaking through stakeholder involvement and explored effective collaboration among stakeholders. We constructed a space called 'Evidence-generating Commons', where patients, family members, researchers, and former policymakers can share their knowledge and experiences and engage in continual deliberations on evidence generation. Ten rare diseases were consequently represented. In the 'Commons', 25 consecutive workshops were held predominantly online, from 2019 to 2021. These workshops focused on (1) clarification of difficulties faced by rare-disease patients, (2) development and selection of criteria for priority setting, and (3) priority setting through the application of the criteria. For the first step, an on-site workshop using sticky notes was held. The data were analysed based on KJ method. For the second and third steps, workshops on specific themes were held to build consensus. The workshop agendas and methods were modified based on participants' feedback. The 'Commons' was established with 43 participants, resulting in positive effects such as capacity building, opportunities for interactions, mutual understanding, and empathy among the participants. The difficulties faced by patients with rare diseases were classified into 10 categories. Seven research topics were identified as priority issues to be addressed including 'impediments to daily life', 'financial burden', 'anxiety', and 'burden of hospital visits'. This was performed by synthesising the results of the application of the two criteria that were particularly important to strengthen future research on rare diseases. We also clarified high-priority research topics by using criteria valued more by patients and family members than by researchers and former policymakers, and criteria with specific perspectives. We generated evidence for policymaking in the field of rare diseases. This study's insights into stakeholder involvement can enhance evidence-informed policymaking. We engaged in comprehensive discussions with policymakers regarding policy implementation and planned analysis of the participants' experiences in this project."

However, the prescription pattern and effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs for these patients are unclear. We aimed to investigate the prescription pattern and effectiveness of different classes of antihypertensive drugs in surgical patients with aortic dissection. <b>Methods:</b> Newly diagnosed aortic dissection patients who underwent surgery, aged >20 years, from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2017 were identified. Patients with missing data, in-hospital mortality, aortic aneurysms, or congenital connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, were excluded. Prescription patterns of antihypertensive drugs were identified from medical records of outpatient visits within 90 days after discharge. Antihypertensive drugs were classified into four classes: 1) β-blockers, 2) calcium channel blockers (CCBs), 3) renin-angiotensin system, and 4) other antihypertensive drugs. Patients were classified according to the number of classes of antihypertensive drugs as follows: 1) class 0, no exposure to antihypertensive drugs; 2) class 1, antihypertensive drugs of the same class; 3) class 2, antihypertensive drugs of two classes; 4) class 3, antihypertensive drugs of three classes; or 5) class 4, antihypertensive drugs of four classes. The primary composite outcomes included rehospitalization associated with aortic dissection, death due to aortic dissection, and all-cause mortality. <b>Results:</b> Most patients were prescribed two (28.87%) or three classes (28.01%) of antihypertensive drugs. In class 1, β-blockers were most commonly used (8.79%), followed by CCBs (5.95%). In class 2, β-blockers+CCB (10.66%) and CCB+RAS (5.18%) were the most common drug combinations. In class 3, β-blockers + CCB+RAS (14.84%) was the most prescribed combination. Class 0 had a significantly higher hazard of the composite outcome (HR, 2.1; CI, 1.46-3.02; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and all-cause mortality (HR, 2.34; CI, 1.56-3.51; <i>p</i> < 0.001) than class 1. There were no significant differences in hazards for rehospitalization associated with aortic dissection among classes. <b>Conclusion:</b> Among operated patients with type A aortic dissection, no specific type of antihypertensive drug was associated with a better outcome, whereas among those with type B aortic dissection, the use of β-blockers and CCBs was related to a significantly lower risk of the composite outcome."

    "abstract": "In individuals with Marfan Syndrome (MFS), fibrillin-1 gene ( <i>FBN1</i> ) mutations can lead to vascular wall weakening and dysfunction. The experimental mouse model of MFS ( <i>FBN1 <sup>C1041G/+</sup></i> ) has been advantageous in investigating MFS-associated life-threatening aortic aneurysms. Although the MFS mouse model presents an accelerated-aging phenotype in elastic organs (e.g., lung, skin), the impact of <i>FBN1</i> mutations on other central and peripheral arteries function and structure with the consideration of the impact of sex remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate if <i>FBN1</i> mutation contributes to sex-dependent alterations in central and cerebral vascular function similar to phenotypic changes associated with normal aging in healthy control mice. <i>In vivo</i> ultrasound imaging of central and cerebral vasculature was performed in 6-month-old male and female MFS and C57BL/6 mice and sex-matched 12-month-old (middle-aged) healthy control mice. Our findings confirm aortic enlargement (aneurysm) and wall stiffness in MFS mice, but with exacerbation in male diameters. Coronary artery blood flow velocity (BFV) in diastole was not different but left pulmonary artery BFV was decreased in MFS and 12-month-old control mice regardless of sex. At 6 months of age, MFS male mice show decreased posterior cerebral artery BFV as compared to age-matched control males, with no difference observed between female cohorts. Reduced mitral valve early-filling velocities were indicated in MFS mice regardless of sex. Male MFS mice also demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall, these results underscore the significance of biological sex in vascular function and structure in MFS mice, while highlighting a trend of pre-mature vascular aging phenotype in MFS mice that is comparable to phenotypes observed in older healthy controls."

We review our mid- to long-term outcomes after valve-sparing aortic root replacement and describe factors that impact survival and valve reintervention and insufficiency. A retrospective review of 284 consecutive patients undergoing valve-sparing aortic root replacement between November 1999 and January 2022 at Austin Health, Melbourne, Australia, was undertaken, with a median follow-up of 6.43 ± 4.83 years, but up to 22.0 years. Freedom from mortality, aortic reintervention, and insufficiency was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods, Cox proportional hazard models, and Fine-Gray analysis. The median age of patients at intervention was 60.0 years (interquartile range, 48.0-67.0), of whom 68 (23.9%) had bicuspid aortic valve disease, 27 (9.5%) had Marfan syndrome, 119 (41.9%) had severe aortic root dilation (>50 mm), and 155 had (54.6%) severe aortic insufficiency at the time of intervention. The 30-day mortality was 1.8%, with freedom from mortality of 96.0% (95% CI, 92.6-97.8) at 5 years and 88.2% (95% CI, 81.4-92.6) at 10 years. Freedom from aortic reintervention was 92.2% (95% CI, 87.7-95.2) at 5 years and 79.8% (95% CI, 71.8-85.8) at 10 years. Factors associated with reintervention were concomitant leaflet repair (hazard ratio, 8.13, 95% CI, 1.07-61.7) and bicuspid valvulopathy (hazard ratio, 2.23, 95% CI, 1.07-4.68), with reintervention in the bicuspid aortic valve being more likely due to aortic stenosis and in the tricuspid aortic valve due to aortic insufficiency (chi-square P = .05). The freedom from aortic insufficiency was 89.1% (95% CI, 83.5-92.9), 84.9% (95% CI, 77.8-89.9) at 5 and 10 years, respectively, and 80.7% (95% CI, 71.0-87.4). Valve-sparing aortic root replacement has excellent long-term outcomes, with low mortality and reintervention rates. Concomitant leaflet repair and bicuspid valve disease are the only long-term factors associated with reintervention."

    "abstract": "The fibrillinopathies represent a group of diseases in which the 10-12 nm extracellular microfibrils are disrupted by genetic variants in one of the genes encoding fibrillin molecules, large glycoproteins of the extracellular matrix. The best-known fibrillinopathy is Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition affecting the cardiovascular, ocular, skeletal, and other systems, with a prevalence of around 1 in 3,000 across all ethnic groups. It is caused by variants of the FBN1 gene, encoding fibrillin-1, which interacts with elastin to provide strength and elasticity to connective tissues. A number of mouse models have been created in an attempt to replicate the human phenotype, although all have limitations. There are also natural bovine models and engineered models in pig and rabbit. Variants in FBN2 encoding fibrillin-2 cause congenital contractural arachnodactyly and mouse models for this condition have also been produced. In most animals, including birds, reptiles, and amphibians, there is a third fibrillin, fibrillin-3 (FBN3 gene) for which the creation of models has been difficult as the gene is degenerate and nonfunctional in mice and rats. Other eukaryotes such as the nematode C. elegans and zebrafish D. rerio have a gene with some homology to fibrillins and models have been used to discover more about the function of this family of proteins. This review looks at the phenotype, inheritance, and relevance of the various animal models for the different fibrillinopathies."

    "title": "Decision-making processes behind seeking regular cardiac checkups for individuals with Marfan syndrome: A grounded theory study.",
    "abstract": "Patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) present with various symptoms, such as aortic aneurysm/dissection, tall stature, and lens deviation. Among them, acute aortic dissection is a complication that leads to sudden death. Some individuals with MFS are reluctant to see a cardiologist and discontinue regular checkups until they develop life-threatening complications. We conducted a grounded theory study to investigate how individuals with MFS decided whether to adhere to healthcare recommendations, specifically to attend cardiology appointments. The study recruited individuals with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of MFS from a Japanese university hospital and individuals from a support group. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 28 consenting participants. In this study, we identified the decision-making processes of individuals with MFS concerning their cardiology visits. We extracted \"perception of the gap between their health status and medical recommendations\" as the central category. This decision-making process consisted of three parts: (A) the process by which an individual with MFS sees a cardiologist for the first time, (B) the process by which an individual with MFS keeps up with cardiology checkups, and (C) the process by which parents bring their children with MFS to the cardiologist. Individuals who learned of the possibility of MFS decided whether to adhere to medical recommendations depending on how they perceived the gap between their health status and the medical recommendations. In addition to medical information and treatment experience, adaptation to MFS, which changed through interactions with others, influenced the perception of the gap. This study suggests the role of genetic counseling and molecular genetic diagnosis as factors that may facilitate adaptation to MFS. The involvement of genetic counselors is important for helping individuals with MFS keep up with regular checkups while affirming their own experiences. These results provide insight into adherence to medical recommendations for individuals with MFS."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome is a rare inherited connective tissue disease, which may be present in patients who have advanced hip pathologies that may require total hip arthroplasty (THA). The postoperative course of patients who have Marfan syndrome following THA has not yet been defined. Adult patients who have and do not have Marfan syndrome and underwent THA were identified in a national database. Patients diagnosed who had infection, trauma, or neoplasms within the 90 days prior to surgery were excluded. Those who have versus those who did not have Marfan syndrome were matched 1:10 based on age, sex, and a comorbidity index. After matching, 144 patients who have Marfan syndrome and 1,440 who do not have Marfan syndrome were identified. The 90-day postoperative adverse events and 5-year revisions were assessed and compared with multivariable analyses and log rank tests, respectively. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that Marfan syndrome was independently associated with greater odds of 90-day adverse events: venous thromboembolic events (odds ratio [OR]: 2.9, P = .001), cardiac events (OR: 4.5, P = .034), pneumonia (OR: 3.5, P < .001), and urinary tract infections (OR: 5.2, P < .001). There was no significant difference in 5-year rates of revision. Following THA, Marfan syndrome was independently associated with greater rates of several 90-day adverse events, but not higher 5-year rates of revision. The identified at-risk adverse events may help guide surgeons to improve perioperative care pathways, while having confidence regarding joint survival of THA in this rare disease population."

    "abstract": "Hereditary connective tissue disorders are a broad group of congenital disorders that are characterized by a pathological weakness of the connective tissue as a result of an incorrect genesis, leading to multisystem complaints. We describe a 14-year-old patient with the hereditary connective tissue disorder Loeys-Dietz syndrome who was admitted to a child psychiatric crisis unit because of depressive and anxiety symptoms. A systematic literature search was carried out to analyze the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in individuals with hereditary connective tissue disorders Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome, to identify a possible association between these disorders and explanations for this. We conclude that there is an increased incidence of depression and anxiety symptoms in which pain, fatigue, social support and functioning, quality of life and functional limitations seem to play a role. There is a need for further research to determine exactly which factors contribute and how these can be targeted in prevention and treatment."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection Stanford type A (AADA) is a surgical emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality. Although surgical management has improved, the optimal therapy is a matter of debate. Different surgical strategies have been proposed for patients under 60 years old. This paper evaluates the postoperative outcome and the need for secondary aortic operation after a limited surgical approach (proximal arch replacement) vs. extended arch repair. Between January 2000 and January 2018, 530 patients received surgical treatment for AADA at our hospital; 182 were under 60 years old and were enrolled in this study - Group A (n=68), limited arch repair (proximal arch replacement), and group B (n=114), extended arch repair (> proximal arch replacement). More pericardial tamponade (P=0.005) and preoperative mechanical resuscitation (P=0.014) were seen in Group A. More need for renal replacement therapy (P=0.047) was seen in the full arch group. Mechanical ventilation time (P=0.022) and intensive care unit stay (P<0.001) were shorter in the limited repair group. Thirty-day mortality was comparable (P=0.117). New onset of postoperative stroke was comparable (Group A four patients [5.9%] vs. Group B 15 patients [13.2%]; P=0.120). Long-term follow-up did not differ significantly for secondary aortic surgery. Even though young patients received only limited arch repair, the outcome was comparable. Full-arch replacement was not beneficial in the long-time follow-up. A limited approach is justified in the cohort of young AADA patients. Exemptions, like known Marfan syndrome and the presence of an intimal tear in the arch, should be considered."

    "abstract": "A small number of case reports have documented a link between atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD) and vertebral artery dissection (VAD), but this association has never been described in patients with hereditary connective tissue disorders. We present a case of an 18-year-old female patient, diagnosed with Marfan syndrome since the age of one, who underwent brain MRA for intracranial aneurysm screening revealing tortuosity of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries as well as atlantoaxial dislocation. Since the patient was asymptomatic, a wait-and-see approach was chosen, but a follow-up MRA after 18 months showed the appearance of a dissecting pseudoaneurysm of the V3 segment of the left vertebral artery. Despite the patient being still asymptomatic, it was decided to proceed with C1-C2 stabilization to prevent further vascular complications. Follow-up imaging showed realignment of the atlantoaxial joint and reduction of the dissecting pseudoaneurysm of the left vertebral artery. In our patient, screening MRA has led to the discovery of asymptomatic arterial and skeletal abnormalities which, if left untreated, might have led to severe cerebrovascular complications. Therefore, AAD correction or close monitoring with MRA should be provided to MFS patients with this craniovertebral junction anomaly, even if asymptomatic."

    "abstract": "It is unclear if the addition of a prophylactic arch operation is beneficial at the time of root replacement in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS). This project aims to understand the fate of the distal aorta following elective root replacement in patients with MFS. Between 2000 and 2019, 124 adult patients with MFS were identified as having undergone elective aortic root replacement with a clamped distal aortic anastomosis during their lifetime. Serial axial imaging was analyzed. The primary outcome was a composite of subsequent type B aortic dissection (TBAD), aneurysmal degeneration (>4 cm), and aortic reintervention. Secondary outcomes included subsequent TBAD and mortality. Mean age at root replacement was 33.3 years. Median follow-up was 11.3 years. Thirty-one patients (25%) experienced the primary outcome, with no survival difference (P = .9). The crossclamp and aortic cannulation sites were stable (growth rate, 0.33 mm/year), and 2 patients (1.6%) required reintervention there. Twenty-three patients (19.8%) experienced subsequent TBAD. Patients with TBAD had a higher rate of distal degeneration (P < .001), but no significant change in survival (P = .2). Preoperative hypertension (odds ratio, 3.96; P < .05) and younger age at root replacement (odds ratio, 1.05; P < .05) increased the risk of TBAD, based on regression analysis. The distal aorta (including the clamp and cannulation site) overall appears stable in patients with MFS following elective root replacement without prophylactic arch operation. Development of TBAD seems to be the primary driver of distal degeneration. Factors associated with TBAD development included hypertension, underscoring the importance of strict blood pressure control in these patients."

We explored the determinants of type B dissection risk in a large, single-center MFS registry. Demographic and anthropometric features, cardiovascular disease, and surgical history were compared in patients with MFS with and without type B dissection. Of 336 patients with MFS, 47 (14%) experienced a type B dissection (vs type A in 9%). Patients with type B dissection were more likely to have undergone elective aortic root replacement (ARR) (79 vs 46%; P < 0.001). Of the patients, 55% had type B dissection a mean of 13.3 years after ARR, whereas 45% experienced type B dissection before or in the absence of ARR; 41 patients (87%) were aware of their MFS diagnosis before type B dissection. Among those with predissection imaging, the descending aorta was normal or minimally dilated (<4.0 cm) in 88%. In multivariable analyses, patients with type B dissection were more likely to have undergone ARR and independent mitral valve surgery, to have had a type II dissection, and to have lived longer. In our contemporary cohort, type B dissections are more common than type A dissections and occur at traditional nonsurgical thresholds. The associations of type B dissection with ARR, independent mitral valve surgery, and type II dissection suggest a more severe phenotype in the setting of prolonged life expectancy."

    "abstract": "This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the application of 4D flow CMR in MFS through a systematic review and meta-analysis. We conducted a comprehensive search of databases from their inception to May 1, 2023. Eligibility criteria were established based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The quality of studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), with studies scoring above five deemed high quality. Meta-analyses were performed using Stata 15.1 software. Nine studies were analyzed. Findings indicate MFS patients had increased vortex flow in the descending aorta (DAo), larger aortic root diameter (ARD) and Z-scores, lower inner wall shear stress (WSS) in the proximal descending aorta (pDAo), reduced in-plane rotational flow (IRF) in the aortic arch and proximal descending aorta (pDAo), and increased pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the ascending aorta (AAo) and DAo compared to healthy subjects. No significant difference in systolic flow reversal ratio was observed. Sensitivity analysis showed no heterogeneity and Egger's test revealed no publication bias. This meta-analysis underscores the effectiveness of 4D flow CMR in detecting MFS, particularly through indicators such as vortex flow, WSS, IRF, ARD, and PWV. The findings provide insights into diagnosing cardiovascular diseases and predicting cardiovascular events in MFS patients. Further case-control studies are needed to establish measurement standards and explore potential indicators for improved diagnosis and treatment of MFS."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder caused by <i>FBN1</i> gene mutations leading to TGF-β signaling hyperactivation, vascular wall weakness, and thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs). The pathogenetic mechanisms are not completely understood and patients undergo early vascular surgery to prevent TAA ruptures. We previously reported miR-632 upregulation in MFS TAA tissues compared with non-genetic TAA tissues. DNAJB6 is a gene target of miR-632 in cancer and plays a critical role in blocking epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by inhibiting the Wnt/β catenin pathway. TGF-β signaling also activates Wnt/β catenin signaling and induces endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (End-Mt) and fibrosis. We documented that miR-632 upregulation correlated with DNAJB6 expression in both the endothelium and the tunica media of MFS TAA (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Wnt/β catenin signaling, End-Mt, and fibrosis markers were also upregulated in MFS TAA tissues (<i>p</i> < 0.05, <i>p</i> < 0.01 and <i>p</i> < 0.001). Moreover, miR-632 overexpression inhibited <i>DNAJB6</i>, inducing Wnt/β catenin signaling, as well as End-Mt and fibrosis exacerbation (<i>p</i> < 0.05 and <i>p</i> < 0.01). TGF-β1 treatment also determined miR-632 upregulation (<i>p</i> < 0.01 and <i>p</i> < 0.001), with the consequent activation of the aforementioned processes. Our study provides new insights about the pathogenetic mechanisms in MFS aortopathy. Moreover, the high disease specificity of miR-632 and DNAJB6 suggests new potential prognostic factors and/or therapeutic targets in the progression of MFS aortopathy."

In this study, we investigated cardiac function with a focus on the left atrium (LA) in a relatively large cohort of patients with MFS. After screening of 1165 patients that had been examined in our center between 2016 and 2020, 231 adult MFS patients with and without aortic operation were included in our study and compared to a healthy control group (<i>n</i> = 106). Cardiac function was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography and NT-proBNP was used as a secretory marker. Most (94.8%) of the patients received genetic testing. Left ventricular function was within normal ranges and not impaired. Interestingly, we found that LA size and secretory activity were increased in MFS patients, despite normal left ventricular filling pressures. This finding was even more pronounced in MFS patients with prior aortic surgery. A correlation between LA size or NT-proBNP levels and the type of pathogenic <i>FBN1</i> variant could not be identified. Right ventricular function and right atrial size were increased only in MFS patients that had undergone aortic surgery. In conclusion, these findings suggest that MFS leads to structural changes in the LA that are not solely resulting from left ventricular dysfunction, but probably can be considered a primary pathology of MFS."

Previous research found that pathogenic variants clustered in exons 24-32 of fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene result in more severe clinical phenotypes. Furthermore, genotype-phenotype correlation studies suggested that more severe cardiovascular phenotypes were related to variants held responsible for haploinsufficiency. Our objective was to analyze the differences in clinical manifestations and genotypes of individuals with early-onset Marfan syndrome and to assess their impact on management strategies. We analyzed clinical and genetic data of a new patient with early-onset Marfan syndrome together with 51 previously reported ones in the PubMed database between 1991 and 2022. Analysis showed 94% (49/52) of pathogenic variants clustered in exons 24-32 of the FBN1. The most common skeletal features were arachnodactyly (98%), reduced elbow extension (48%), pectus deformity (40%), and scoliosis (39%). Haploinsufficiency variants were reported as having poor outcome in 87.5% of the cases. Among patients carrying variants that substitute a cysteine for another amino acid and those that do not change cysteine content, cardiac intervention was found to be associated with a better outcome (p = 0.035 vs. p = 0.002). Variants that create an extra cysteine residue were found to be associated with a higher risk of ectopia lentis. Additionally, children up to 36-months-old were more often reported as still alive at the time of publication compared to newborns (p < 0.01). Our findings have implications for prognosis, because different genotype groups and their resulting phenotype may require personalized care and management."

We attempted to determine long-term outcomes of valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) in this group, including cardiovascular reoperations for aortic aneurysm and dissection. We conducted a retrospective analysis of pediatric patients with CTD who received VSRR in a single center from 2002 to 2021. The primary end point was a composite event of all-cause death and cardiovascular reoperations. The median follow-up duration was 8.3 years, with a maximum of 20.7 years. The median age of 24 pediatric patients who had VSRR was 14.4 years. Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome affected 19 (79.2%) and 5 (20.8%) patients, respectively. There was no early death. The 15-year survival rate was 91.7%. At 10 years after VSRR, the cumulative incidence of reoperation for aortic regurgitation was 15.6%, and for aortic aneurysm or dissection, it was 29.1%. The 10-year rate of freedom from the primary end point was 53.1%. The Cox multivariable analysis revealed younger age at surgery (hazard ratio, 1.279; 95% confidence interval, 1.086-1.505; P = .003) and VSRR before 13 years of age (hazard ratio, 5.005; 95% confidence interval, 1.146-21.850; P = .032) as independent prognostic factors for the primary endpoint. VSRR for aortic root dilatation in pediatric patients with CTD demonstrated good long-term survival and low reoperation rates for aortic regurgitation. However, several patients developed later aortic aneurysm or dissection, and careful surveillance may be required, particularly in those who received VSRR at younger age."

Seventeen affected family members were examined clinically by cardiologists and ophthalmologists. The proband, a 48-year-old woman with obvious signs of MFS, her DNA sample subjected to whole-exome sequencing (WES). The candidate variant was validated by bidirectional sequencing of proband and other available family members. In silico analysis and molecular modeling were conducted to determine the pathogenic effects of the candidate variants. The most frequent cardiac complications are mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation. Ophthalmic examination revealed iridodonesis and ectopic lentis. A heterozygous missense variant (c.2179T>C/p.C727R) in exon 19 of <i>FBN1</i> gene was identified and found to cosegregate with affected family members.

Patients with HTAD had genetic aortopathies or presented at age ≤50 years, and 35% (62 of 177) had Marfan syndrome. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of operative death and adverse event, a composite of operative death and persistent (present at discharge) stroke, paraplegia, paraparesis, and renal failure necessitating dialysis. Long-term outcomes were analyzed with competing risks analysis. Patients with HTAD had lower rates of operative mortality (1.7% vs 7.0%, P = .01) and composite adverse event (2.8% vs 12.3%, P < .001) than non-HTAD patients. Most HTAD patients were discharged home (92.6% vs 76.9%, P < .001). Predictors of operative death were increasing age, aortic dissection, tobacco use, chronic symptoms, and rupture. Predictors for adverse event were increasing age, acute symptoms, chronic dissection, and rupture. Patients with HTAD had substantially better repair-failure-free survival (P < .001). Open extent I TAAA repair was effective in patients with HTAD, with low operative mortality and adverse event rates, better late survival, and excellent long-term durability, making a compelling argument for preferring open repair in these patients."

LDS is caused by loss-of-function variants of genes that encode components of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling; nevertheless, LDS type 1/2 caused by TGFBR1/2 pathogenic variants is frequently found to have paradoxical increases in TGF-β signaling in the aneurysmal aortic wall. Here, we present a Japanese LDS family having a novel SMAD3 variant. The proband was tested via clinical, genetic, and histological analyses. In vitro analysis was performed for pathogenic evaluation. The novel heterozygous missense variant of SMAD3 [c.1262G>A, p.(Cys421Tyr)], located just upstream of the C-terminal Ser423-X-Ser425 phosphorylation motif, was found in this instance of LDS type 3. This variant led to reduced phospho-SMAD3 (Ser423/Ser425) levels and transcription activity in vitro; however, a paradoxical upregulation of TGF-β signaling was evident in the aortic wall. Our results revealed the presence of TGF-β paradox in this case with the novel loss-of-function SMAD3 variant. The precise mechanism underlying the paradox is unknown, but further research is warranted to clarify the influence of the SMAD3 variant type and location on the LDS3 phenotype as well as the molecular mechanism leading to LDS3 aortopathy."

    "title": "Re-evaluation of a Fibrillin-1 Gene Variant of Uncertain Significance Using the ClinGen Guidelines.",
    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is caused by fibrillin-1 gene (<i>FBN1</i>) variants. Mutational hotspots and/or well-established critical functional domains of <i>FBN1</i> include cysteine residues, calcium-binding consensus sequences, and amino acids related to interdomain packaging. Previous guidelines for variant interpretation do not reflect the features of genes or related diseases. Using the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) <i>FBN1</i> variant curation expert panel (VCEP), we re-evaluated <i>FBN1</i> germline variants reported as variants of uncertain significance (VUSs). We re-evaluated 26 VUSs in <i>FBN1</i> reported in 161 patients with MFS. We checked the variants in the Human Genome Mutation Database, ClinVar, and VarSome databases and assessed their allele frequencies using the gnomAD database. Patients' clinical information was reviewed. Four missense variants affecting cysteines (c.460T>C, c.1006T>C, c.5330G>C, and c.8020T>C) were reclassified as likely pathogenic and were assigned PM1_strong or PM1. Two intronic variants were reclassified as benign by granting BA1 (stand-alone). Four missense variants were reclassified as likely benign. BP5 criteria were applied in cases with an alternate molecular basis for disease, one of which (c.7231G>A) was discovered alongside a pathogenic <i>de novo</i> COL3A1 variant (c.1988G>T, p.Gly633Val). Considering the high penetrance of <i>FBN1</i> variants and clinical variability of MFS, the detection of pathogenic variants is important. The ClinGen <i>FBN1</i> VCEP encompasses mutational hotspots and/or well-established critical functional domains and adjusts the criteria specifically for MFS; therefore, it is beneficial not only for identifying pathogenic <i>FBN1</i> variants but also for distinguishing these variants from those that cause other connective tissue disorders with overlapping clinical features."

    "title": "Exaggerated elastin turnover in young individuals with Marfan syndrome: new insights from the AIMS trial.",
    "abstract": "The fragmentation and loss of elastic fibre in the tunica media of the aorta are pathological hallmarks of Marfan syndrome (MFS) but the dynamics of elastin degradation and its relationship to aortic size and physiological growth remain poorly understood. In this <i>post hoc</i> analysis of the AIMS randomized controlled trial, the association of plasma desmosine (pDES)-a specific biomarker of mature elastin degradation-with age and aortic size was analysed in 113 patients with MFS and compared to 109 healthy controls. There was a strong association between age and pDES in both groups, with higher pDES levels in the lower age groups compared to adults. During childhood, pDES increased and peaked during early adolescence, and thereafter decreased to lower adult levels. This trend was exaggerated in young individuals with MFS but in those above 25 years of age, pDES levels were comparable to controls despite the presence of aortic root dilation. In MFS children, increased aortic diameter relative to controls was seen at an early age and although the increase in diameter was less after adolescence, aortic root size continued to increase steadily with age. In MFS participants, there was an indication of a positive association between baseline pDES levels and aortic root dilatation during up to 5 years of follow-up. This study has shown that developmental age has a significant effect on levels of elastin turnover as measured by pDES in MFS individuals as well as healthy controls. This effect is exaggerated in those with MFS with increased levels seen during the period of physiologic development that plateaus towards adulthood. This suggests an early onset of pathophysiology that may present an important opportunity for disease-modifying intervention."

    "title": "Case Report: Decrypting an interchromosomal insertion associated with Marfan's syndrome: how optical genome mapping emphasizes the morbid burden of copy-neutral variants.",
    "abstract": "Optical genome mapping (OGM), which allows analysis of ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW) DNA molecules, represents a response to the restriction created by short-read next-generation-sequencing, even in cases where the causative variant is a neutral copy-number-variant insensitive to quantitative investigations. This study aimed to provide a molecular diagnosis to a boy with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and intellectual disability (ID) carrying a <i>de novo</i> translocation involving chromosomes 3, 4, and 13 and a 1.7 Mb deletion at the breakpoint of chromosome 3. No <i>FBN1</i> alteration explaining his Marfan phenotype was highlighted. UHMW gDNA was isolated from both the patient and his parents and processed using OGM. Genome assembly was followed by variant calling and annotation. Multiple strategies confirmed the results. The 3p deletion, which disrupted <i>ROBO2</i>, (MIM*602431) included three copy-neutral insertions. Two came from chromosome 13; the third contained 15q21.1, including the <i>FBN1</i> from intron-45 onwards, thus explaining the MFS phenotype. We could not attribute the ID to a specific gene variant nor to the reshuffling of topologically associating domains (TADs). Our patient did not have vesicular reflux-2, as reported by missense alterations of <i>ROBO2</i> (VUR2, MIM#610878), implying that reduced expression of all or some isoforms has a different effect than some of the point mutations. Indeed, the <i>ROBO2</i> expression pattern and its role as an axon-guide suggests that its partial deletion is responsible for the patient's neurological phenotype. Conclusion: OGM testing 1) highlights copy-neutral variants that could remain invisible if no loss of heterozygosity is observed and 2) is mandatory before other molecular studies in the presence of any chromosomal rearrangement for an accurate genotype-phenotype relationship."

    "title": "Patterns of genetic mutations explored by systematic screening of patients with aortopathy and their family members.",
    "abstract": "Genetic aortopathy, if left untreated, leads to aortic catastrophe in most affected individuals. We sought to determine the genetic mutation patterns and detection rates in patients with aortopathy and their families with a systematic screening protocol. In 2016 to 2020, patients with aortic dissection or root aneurysm (Z score ≥2) and their first-degree relatives were enrolled in a prospective registry at a tertiary referral center. The individuals underwent systematic single- or multi-gene panel testing depending on clinical presentations. Among 575 enrolled individuals (mean age, 46.6 ± 14.5 years; 203 women), 346 (60.2%) underwent genetic testing. Rates of relevant gene mutations identified were 39.4% (91/231), 27.1% (54/199) and 72.4% (n = 105) in aneurysm, dissection, and family screening groups, respectively (<i>P</i> < .001). Mutated genes frequently identified were <i>FBN1</i> (n = 199; Marfan), <i>TGFBR1/2</i> or <i>SMAD3</i> (n = 14; Loeys-Dietz), <i>COL3A1/COL5A2</i> (n = 15; Ehlers-Danlos), and <i>ACTA2</i> (n = 10). After enrollment, 123 aortic surgeries were performed in 117 patients (20.3%) including 15 family members, with resultant operative mortality of 0.8% (n = 1). In logistic regression analysis, systemic score in Ghent nosology was the only significant factor associated with positive gene mutation (odds ratio, 14.81; 95% confidence interval, 6.87-31.96), and its 3.5 point cutoff showed the best predictive value with 78.2% sensitivity and 87.2% specificity. Genetic aortopathy was identified in a considerable proportion of patients with aortopathy and their family members by systematic genetic testing. This strategy is recommended for timely diagnosis and proactive management of genetic aortopathy."

    "title": "Charting a roadmap for heart failure research in India: Insights from a qualitative survey.",
    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is emerging as a major health problem in India. The profile of HF in India is divergent from elsewhere in the world. While cardiologists must equip themselves with the requisite clinical management tools, scientists and health policymakers would need epidemiological data on HF and information on the resources required to meet the challenges ahead. The aim of this study was to identify the lacunae and to suggest recommendations to improve HF research. We surveyed a multidisciplinary group of HF experts using a two stage process. An email-based survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire, followed by an online discussion. The experts prioritized the major challenges in convergence research in India and inter-rater agreement values were calculated. In addition, they enlisted potential research gaps and barriers in the domains of epidemiology, diagnostics, management and technology and suggested recommendations to overcome those barriers. The experts identified a paucity of data on HF burden, lack of state-of-the-art diagnostic facilities and trained personnel, overt dependence on imported devices/equipment/reagents, lack of interaction/awareness/information among stakeholders and lack of biobanks, as major barriers in HF research. Three fourths of the experts agreed that lack of interaction among stakeholders was the major challenge with the highest inter-rater agreement in both stages (19 out of 25 and 11 out of 17, respectively). The experts recommended the creation of multidisciplinary taskforces dedicated to population sciences, data sciences, technology development and patient management with short-, intermediate- and long-term strategies. The study generated a wish list for advances in HF research and management, and proposed recommendations for facilitating convergence research as a way forward to reduce the burden of HF in India."

Methods and Results Subjects with a pathogenic <i>COL3A1</i> variant diagnosed at age <50 years were included from 2 institutions and the GenTAC Registry (National Registry of Genetically Triggered Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Cardiovascular Conditions). Height-adjusted vertebral artery tortuosity index (VTI-h) using magnetic resonance or computed tomography angiography was calculated. Associations between VTI-h and outcomes of (1) cardiovascular events (arterial dissection/rupture, aneurysm requiring intervention, stroke), or (2) hollow organ collapse/rupture at age <50 years were evaluated using receiver operator curve analysis (using outcome by age 30 years) and mixed-effects Poisson regression for incidence rate ratios. Of 65 subjects (54% male), median VTI-h was 12 (interquartile range, 8-16). Variants were missense in 46%, splice site in 31%, and null/gene deletion in 14%. Thirty-two subjects (49%) had 59 events, including 28 dissections, 5 arterial ruptures, 4 aneurysms requiring intervention, 4 strokes, 11 hollow organ ruptures, and 7 pneumothoraces. Receiver operator curve analysis suggested optimal discrimination at VTI-h ≥15.5 for cardiovascular events (sensitivity 70%, specificity 76%) and no association with noncardiovascular events (area under the curve, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.22-0.78]). By multivariable analysis, older age was associated with increased cardiovascular event rate while VTI-h ≥15.5 was not (incidence rate ratios, 1.79 [95% CI, 0.76-4.24], <i>P</i>=0.185). However, VTI-h ≥15.5 was associated with events among those with high-risk variants <40 years (incidence rate ratios, 4.14 [95% CI, 1.13-15.10], <i>P</i>=0.032), suggesting effect modification by genotype and age. Conclusions Increased arterial tortuosity is associated with a higher incidence rate of cardiovascular events in Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Vertebral tortuosity index may be a useful biomarker for prognosis when evaluated in conjunction with genotype and age."

    "abstract": "Retrospective cohort study. Spinal deformities in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) are distinct from those in patients with idiopathic scoliosis (IS). It is more prone to progression and more likely to present with sagittal malalignment than IS. However, the etiology of this characteristic spinal deformity in MFS remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the spinal musculature characteristics in patients with MFS on the hypothesis that the paraspinal muscles of patients with MFS would be qualitatively or quantitatively different from those of patients with IS. Seventeen consecutive patients with MFS aged 25 years or younger undergoing surgery for scoliosis in our hospital were compared with age- and sex-matched patients with IS undergoing surgery for scoliosis. The body size-adjusted relative cross-sectional area (rCSA), fatty infiltration ratio (FI%), and relative functional cross-sectional area (rFCSA) of the psoas muscles (PM) and paravertebral muscles (PVM) at L3/4 and L4/5 were measured using preoperative T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Functional CSA was defined as total CSA minus the fatty infiltration area of each muscle and rFCSA was calculated as the body size-adjusted functional CSA. The rCSA of the PM at L3/4 and L4/5 was significantly smaller in the MFS group than in the IS group (L3/4, P = .021; L4/5, P = .002). The FI% of the PM at L4/5 was significantly higher in the MFS group (P = .044). Consequently, the rFCSA of the PM at L3/4 and L4/5 and the rFCSA of the PVM at L3/4 in the MFS group were significantly smaller than those in the IS group (PM at L3/4, P = .021; PM at L4/5, P = .001; PVM at L3/4, P = .025). Compared with patients with IS, patients with MFS exhibited significantly decreased body-size-adjusted CSA of the PM and reduced body-size-adjusted functional CSA of the PVM and PM. These findings may partially explain the characteristics of distinctive spinal deformities in patients with MFS."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the early and long-term outcomes after total arch replacement (TAR) and frozen elephant trunk (FET) implantation in adult patients ≤30 years with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). All young adult patients (≤30 years) with ATAAD who underwent TAR and FET between 2009 and 2017 were enrolled. The end points were major organ morbidity and mortality, aortic-related events and reoperation. The mean age of all 83 patients was 25.9 (standard deviation, 3.3) years. The in-hospital mortality was 9.64% (8/83), and 9 (10.8%) patients required re-exploration for bleeding. The aortic-related events risk was 42.7% (32/75) and the aortic reoperation risk was 17.3% (13/75). Overall survival was 85.5% [95% confidence interval (CI), 75.9-91.5%] at 5 years and 75.9% (95% CI, 63.3-84.7%) at 10 years. The cumulative incidence of aortic-related events was 35% (95% CI, 24-47%) at 5 years and 58% (95% CI, 36-75%) at 10 years; the cumulative reoperation rate was 15% (95% CI, 7.9-24%) at 5 years and 17% (95% CI, 9.2-27%) at 10 years. Marfan syndrome significantly increased the aortic-related events (P = 0.036) and reoperation (P = 0.041) risks. Despite extensive repair in young ATAAD patients, the late aortic dilatation and reoperation risk remain high. The TAR and FET procedures achieved satisfactory early outcomes and reduced late aortic dilatation and reoperation in young patients compared with other records. Close follow-up and aggressive early reintervention are essential for patients with aortic-related risk factors early in life."

    "abstract": "Hereditary thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD) such as Marfan syndrome (MFS), Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), and vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (VEDS) frequently result in complex cardiovascular pathology that can lead to premature death. However, given limited research and lack of detailed pediatric management guidelines, practice in the U.S. is largely guided by personal experience and/or advice from other professionals. A REDCap survey was composed that covered topics including genetic testing, imaging, and medication choice (all in children), among others. After piloting, the survey was distributed via email and advertised on PediHeartNet. Email addresses of providers were obtained through an established aortic research collaborative and a clinic directory offered through The Marfan Foundation. There were 64 survey responses (pediatric cardiologists 66%; geneticists 13%, genetic counselors 6%; the remaining 15% was comprised of a combination of cardiothoracic surgeons, adult cardiologists, adult congenital specialists, combined cardiology and genetics specialist, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and nurse coordinators). The most supported indication for genetic evaluation in a child with mild aortic root dilation was family history of thoracic aortic dissection (100%), in contrast to mild root dilation with no other HTAD features (39% supported, 45% did not, 15% saying it would depend on other factors). The majority would start medical therapy in MFS at an aortic root z-score of 2, however differences existed regarding medication preferences for initiation (47% angiotensin receptor blockers, 36% beta blockers, 17% would not or cannot prescribe medication/defer medication choice to another provider). Variation existed for cross-sectional imaging indications and modality and for exercise restrictions, although on average respondents were more lenient than the Bethesda guidelines. While there are areas of general agreement in the cardiac management of children with HTAD, there are also several areas of considerable variation. This highlights the need for additional study in these areas with the ultimate goal of creating consensus guidelines."

Zhongshan ophthalmic center, Guangzhou, China. Retrospective cohort study. Medical data of patients diagnosed with ectopia lentis and MFS that underwent surgery younger than 8 years were collected. Refractive errors and ocular biometric parameters were collected preoperatively and at each follow-up visit. Patients were stratified into groups according to age at surgery, and only the eye operated on first was selected. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the association between refractive shift and potential risk factors. In total, 54 eyes of 54 patients were enrolled. The median age at surgery was 6.21 years (interquartile range [IQR], 5.25 to 6.85), and the median follow-up was 2.0 years (IQR, 1.2 to 2.8 years). At age 8 years, patients demonstrated a median myopic shift ranged from -1.75 diopters (D) (IQR, -2.75 to -1.00 D) for the 4-year-old group to -0.13 D (IQR, -0.50 to -0.06 D) for the 7-year-old group. Multivariate analysis showed that greater myopic shift was associated with younger age at surgery ( P = .004), male sex ( P = .026), and shorter preoperative axis length ( P = .005). A tendency toward increasing postoperative myopic was demonstrated in children with ectopia lentis and MFS, with the greatest myopic shift in the younger age groups. If the goal is to reach emmetropia by age 8 years, the immediate postoperative hypermetropic targets should be 1.75 D for age 4 years, 1 D for age 5 years, 0.5 D for age 6 years, and 0 to 0.25 D for age 7 years."

The aim of the manuscript is to review the aortic involvement and complications in MFS, including aortal dissection, thoracic aortic aneurysm, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and acute aortic syndrome. Dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysm and progressing aortic root enlargement are the major causes of MFS morbidity and mortality. Guidelines on aortic disease endorsed by the American College of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association recommend the measurement of the external and internal aortic diameters perpendicular to the axis of blood flow when Computed Tomography, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or Cardiac Echography are performed. The pathophysiology, diagnosis, prevention, and medical and surgical treatments of MFS associated with aortic complications are reported in this narrative review. Development and strengthening of centers specialized in cardiovascular diseases and MFS, together with an improvement in the knowledge of its pathogenesis through genetics and proteomics investigations, can ameliorate the prognosis of this disease."

We herein report the case of a 42-year-old male with MFS who presented with congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock. His transthoracic echocardiography revealed a giant aortic root aneurysm, causing severe aortic regurgitation and dilated cardiomyopathy, along with LVNC. This case provides a brief overview of this rare medical condition, particularly the natural history of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm, which is considered a silent complication and the most life-threatening one, combined with LVNC that correspondingly impairs the heart."

CytoSorb is a blood purification therapy used to remove circulating cytokines in conditions of hyperinflammation. This report is of a patient with COVID-19 requiring redo replacement of the aortic valve and aorta due to aortic aneurysm of the ascending aorta (Bentall procedure) associated with Marfan syndrome. The patient was successfully treated with extracorporeal cytokine hemoadsorption. CASE REPORT A 34-year-old man with Marfan syndrome, who had undergone a Bentall procedure in 2018, was admitted with symptoms of worsening dyspnea, tachycardia, fever, and confirmed COVID-19. Further diagnostic workup revealed dehiscence of the aortic root as well as moderate aortic regurgitation, in the context of a hyperinflammatory state. Anti-infective treatment was initiated. Given the severity of symptoms, COVID-19, echocardiography findings, and risk of aortic rupture, urgent Bentall surgery was performed. Additionally, a CytoSorb hemoadsorber was integrated into the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit to attenuate the anticipated systemic hyperinflammation. Intraoperatively, several blood products were administered due to excessive bleeding from the friable tissues and the pre-existing anemia and thrombocytopenia. Treatment was associated with marked improvements in vital parameters and inflammatory markers, and weaning from the ventilator and inotropes was possible after 48 hours. The remaining time in hospital was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS This report supports the findings from recent studies and reports that extracorporeal cytokine hemoadsorption has a role to play in reducing the systemic effects of cytokine storm associated with complex surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass alongside severe infections, including COVID-19."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Inherited deficiencies in the FBN1 gene, which encodes fibrillin-1, result in Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder that is associated with aortic root dilatation and predisposes to aortic dissection. This report is of a 37-year-old woman presenting at 39 weeks of pregnancy with acute thoracic aortic dissection due to previously undiagnosed FBN1-related Marfan syndrome. This case report aims to illustrate the challenges in the diagnosis and in the peri-operative management of acute aortic dissection during pregnancy. CASE REPORT A healthy 37-year-old woman at 39 weeks of gestation presented to our hospital with dyspnea and chest pain. Initial evaluation for pulmonary embolism with chest computed tomography was unrevealing. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for further management. Overnight, her clinical conditions deteriorated, and a transthoracic echocardiography was obtained, demonstrating an acute ascending aortic dissection. She emergently underwent a successful combined cesarean section and ascending aortic dissection repair, with no immediate complications. On postoperative day 4 she developed cardiac tamponade, for which she underwent emergent mediastinal exploration. She was discharged home on postoperative day 10. A month later she completed genetic testing, which revealed a pathogenic mutation in the FBN1 gene, consistent with a molecular diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. CONCLUSIONS This report has shown that FBN1-related Marfan's syndrome has a variable clinical presentation that can include life-threatening aortic dissection during pregnancy. Successful diagnosis and management of these patients is challenging and requires multidisciplinary expertise, including confirmation of the diagnosis by a clinical geneticist."

Outcome measures were Marfan incidence, de novo mutation rate, risk of ectopia lentis. Marfan syndrome was identified in 17 patients during the 30-year period, yielding an incidence of 0.52 per 100,000 people/year (95% CI, 0.27-0.77). Mean age at diagnosis was 24.4 years (range, 1.7 year to 51.3 years). Nine patients (53%) were female.

Computer tomography angiography revealed a prostheto-prosthetic pseudoaneurysm, initially measured 21x16x23 mm, rapidly increased at 1-year follow-up at 27x24x33 mm. Coronary angiography showed the presence of turbulent flow inside the pseudoaneurysm with a decreased coronary perfusion. We resected the pseudoaneurysm and a new prostheto-prosthetic anastomosis was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful without any complications. We report this case because in literature there has been few reports regarding prostheto-prosthetic pseudoaneurysm after Cabrol procedure."

    "title": "Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome: Unraveling a Rare Vascular Disorder.",
    "abstract": "Arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal twists and turns of arteries, leading to cardiovascular complications. This syndrome, first reported around 55 years ago, is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and affects both genders. ATS manifests primarily in childhood, with arterial abnormalities disrupting blood circulation, increasing shear stress, and causing complications, such as atherosclerosis and strokes. This article reviews the genetics, etiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, associated conditions, management, and challenges of ATS. The syndrome's genetic cause is linked to mutations in the SLC2A10 gene, affecting collagen and elastin synthesis. Arterial tortuosity, a complex phenomenon, arises from factors such as vessel elongation, anatomic fixation, and vessel diameter. ATS is one of many conditions associated with arterial tortuosity, including Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Recent studies highlight arterial tortuosity's potential as a prognostic indicator for adverse cardiovascular events. Management requires a multidisciplinary approach, and surveillance and prevention play key roles. Despite challenges, advancements in understanding ATS offer hope for targeted therapies and improved patient care."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a multisystem genetic disorder with over 3000 mutations described in the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene. Like MFS, other connective tissue disorders also require a deeper understanding of the phenotype-genotype relationship due to the complexity of the clinical presentation, where diagnostic criteria often overlap. Our objective was to identify mutations in patients with connective tissue disorders using a genetic multipanel and to analyze the genotype-phenotype associations in a cohort of Mexican patients. We recruited 136 patients with MFS and related syndromes from the National Institute of Cardiology. Mutations were identified using next-generation sequencing (NGS). To examine the correlation between mutation severity and severe cardiovascular conditions, we focused on patients who had undergone Bentall-de Bono surgery or aortic valve repair. The genetic data obtained allowed us to reclassify the initial clinical diagnosis across various types of connective tissue disorders. The transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGFBR2) rs79375991 mutation was found in 10 out of 16 (63%) Loeys-Dietz patients. We observed a high prevalence (65%) of more severe mutations, such as frameshift indels and stop codons, among patients requiring invasive treatments like aortic valve-sparing surgery, Bentall and de Bono procedures, or aortic valve replacement due to severe cardiovascular injury. Although our study did not achieve precise phenotype-genotype correlations, it underscores the importance of a multigenetic panel evaluation. This could pave the way for a more comprehensive diagnostic approach and inform medical and surgical treatment decision-making."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome causes a hereditary form of thoracic aortic aneurysms with worse outcomes in male compared to female patients. In this study, we examine the effects of 17 β-estradiol on aortic dilation and rupture in a Marfan mouse model. Marfan male mice were administered 17 β-estradiol, and the growth in the aortic root, along with the risk of aortic rupture, was measured. Transcriptomic profiling was used to identify enriched pathways from 17 β-estradiol treatments. Aortic smooth muscle cells were then treated with cytokines to validate functional mechanisms. We show that 17 β-estradiol decreased the size and rate of aortic root dilation and improved survival from rupture. The Marfan transcriptome was enriched in inflammatory genes, and the addition of 17 β-estradiol modulated a set of genes that function through TNFα mediated NF-κB signaling. In addition, 17 β-estradiol suppressed the induction of these TNFα induced genes in aortic smooth muscle cells in vitro in an NF-κB dependent manner, and 17 β-estradiol decreased the formation of adventitial inflammatory foci in aortic roots in vivo. In conclusion, 17 β-estradiol protects against the dilation and rupture of aortic roots in Marfan male mice through the inhibition of TNFα-NF-κB signaling."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by aortic aneurysm, skeletal abnormalities, and lens dislocation, and is caused by variants in the FBN1 gene. To explore causes of MFS and the prevalence of the disease in Iceland we collected information from all living individuals with a clinical diagnosis of MFS in Iceland (n = 32) and performed whole-genome sequencing of those who did not have a confirmed genetic diagnosis (27/32). Moreover, to assess a potential underdiagnosis of MFS in Iceland we attempted a genotype-based approach to identify individuals with MFS. We interrogated deCODE genetics' database of 35,712 whole-genome sequenced individuals to search for rare sequence variants in FBN1. Overall, we identified 15 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in FBN1 in 44 individuals, only 22 of whom were previously diagnosed with MFS. The most common of these variants, NM_000138.4:c.8038 C > T p.(Arg2680Cys), is present in a multi-generational pedigree, and was found to stem from a single forefather born around 1840. The p.(Arg2680Cys) variant associates with a form of MFS that seems to have an enrichment of abdominal aortic aneurysm, suggesting that this may be a particularly common feature of p.(Arg2680Cys)-associated MFS. Based on these combined genetic and clinical data, we show that MFS prevalence in Iceland could be as high as 1/6,600 in Iceland, compared to 1/10,000 based on clinical diagnosis alone, which indicates underdiagnosis of this actionable genetic disorder."

    "abstract": "Although abnormal TGFβ signaling is observed in several heritable forms of thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections including Marfan syndrome, its precise role in aortic disease progression is still disputed. Using a mouse genetic approach and quantitative isobaric labeling proteomics, we sought to elucidate the role of TGFβ signaling in three Fbn1 mutant mouse models representing a range of aortic disease from microdissection (without aneurysm) to aneurysm (without rupture) to aneurysm and rupture. Results indicated that reduced TGFβ signaling and increased mast cell proteases were associated with microdissection. In contrast, increased abundance of extracellular matrix proteins, which could be reporters for positive TGFβ signaling, were associated with aneurysm. Marked reductions in collagens and fibrillins, and increased TGFβ signaling, were associated with aortic rupture. Our data indicate that TGFβ signaling performs context-dependent roles in the pathogenesis of thoracic aortic disease."

    "abstract": "The usefulness of aortic valve sparing operations to treat aortic root aneurysm in patients with Marfan syndrome (MS) remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients with MS who have undergone valve-preserving aortic root replacement. Patients with MS who had aortic valve sparing operations (reimplantation of the aortic valve or remodeling of the aortic root) from 1988 through 2019 were followed prospectively for a median of 14 years. Pertinent data from clinical, echocardiographic, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance images of the aorta were collected and analyzed. There were 189 patients whose mean age was 36 years, and 67% were men. Ten patients presented with acute type A dissection and 29 had mitral regurgitation. There were 52 patients at risk at 20 years. Mortality rate at 20 years was 21.5% (95% CI: 14.7%-30.8%); advancing age and preoperative aortic dissections were associated with increased risk of death by multivariable analysis. At 20 years, the cumulative incidence of moderate or severe aortic insufficiency was 14.5% (95% CI: 9.5%-22.0%), reoperation on the aortic valve was 7.5% (95% CI: 3.9%-14.7%), and new distal aortic dissections was 19.9% (95% CI: 13.9%-28.5%). Remodeling of aortic root was associated with greater risk of developing aortic insufficiency and aortic valve reoperation than reimplantation of the aortic valve. Aortic valve sparing operations provide stable aortic valve function and low rates of valve-related complications during the first 2 decades of follow-up but aortic dissections remain problematic in patients with MS."

To report on the outcomes and durability of aortic cusp repair in valve sparing in patients with Marfan syndrome. All consecutive adult patients with Marfan syndrome who underwent remodelling and annuloplasty with aortic valve repair for aortic insufficiency between May 2005 and December 2020 were included. Patients with Marfan syndrome treated for aortic aneurysm, but without aortic insufficiency, were excluded. Data were collected prospectively and reviewed retrospectively from the Aorticvalve repair International Registry (AVIATOR). During the study period, 71 patients with Marfan syndrome were referred to surgery. Fifty-five patients with connective tissue disease and aortic insufficiency with aorta aneurysm were treated: 46 underwent aortic valve repair and nine underwent aortic valve replacement (five mechanical aortic valve replacements and four biological aortic valve replacements). The mean age was 42.9±15.4 years, and the mean EuroScore II was 2.5±2.2. No patient died, and no patient had significant aortic insufficiency (grade≥II) at discharge. The 5-year survival rate estimate was 94.4%, which seems statistically similar to that of the age- and sex-matched general population. At 5 years, freedom from reoperation was 94.6%, and the incidence of infective endocarditis was 2.6%. No valve thrombosis, aortic dissection, major bleeding events, thromboembolic events (stroke) or myocardial infarctions were noted during follow-up. Remodelling and aortic valve repair showed excellent durability at 5 years, even in connective tissue disorders."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene. These mutations result in defects in the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems. Aortic aneurysm is the leading cause of premature mortality in untreated MFS patients. Elastic fiber fragmentation in the aortic vessel wall is a hallmark of MFS-associated aortic aneurysms. FBN1 mutations result in FBN1 fragments that also contribute to elastic fiber fragmentation. Although recent research has advanced our understanding of MFS, the contribution of elastic fiber fragmentation to the pathogenesis of aneurysm formation remains poorly understood. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular mechanisms of elastic fiber fragmentation and its role in the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysm progression. Increased comprehension of elastic fragmentation has significant clinical implications for developing targeted interventions to block aneurysm progression, which would benefit not only individuals with Marfan syndrome but also other patients with aneurysms. Moreover, this review highlights an overlooked connection between inhibiting aneurysm and the restoration of elastic fibers in the vessel wall with various aneurysm inhibitors, including drugs and chemicals. Investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms could uncover innovative therapeutic strategies to inhibit elastin fragmentation and prevent the progression of aneurysms."

This review describes the latest advances in skeletal dysplasia that is due to impaired TGF-β/BMP signaling and results in short stature (acromelic dysplasia and cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome) or tall stature (Marfan syndrome). We thoroughly describe the clinical features of the patients, the underlying genetic findings, and the pathomolecular mechanisms leading to disease, which have been investigated mainly using patient-derived skin fibroblasts and mouse models. Although no pharmacological treatment is yet available for skeletal dysplasia due to impaired TGF-β/BMP signaling, in recent years advances in the use of drugs targeting TGF-β have been made, and we also discuss these advances."

In this contribution, we provide an overview of the genetic mutations currently identified in order to have a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms. Moreover, an update is presented on the basis of the most recent diagnostic criteria, which enable an early diagnosis. Finally, therapeutic strategies are proposed with the goal of improving the rates of patient survival and the quality of life of those affected by these SADs."

The association of lens coloboma with MFS has been described in literature, but the coexistence of lens coloboma with ectopia lentis is a rare feature. Here, we describe three cases of MFS including a case of bilateral lens coloboma with ectopia lentis: case 1 - a 39-year-old male with inferotemporal lens subluxation in the right eye and superotemporal lens subluxation in the left eye with open-angle glaucoma and high myopia, case 2 - a 15-year-old child with bilateral superonasal lens subluxation with lens coloboma, and case 3 - a 56-year-old female with bilateral lens coloboma. Case 1 and case 2 had clear lenses with good refractive correction; hence, they were optically rehabilitated with contact lenses, whereas case 3 was advised for cataract surgery. It is important to distinguish the lens coloboma from a more common entity, ectopia lentis as former usually remains stable while the latter might need a surgical intervention."

This study characterizes the mortality and morbidities of thoracic aortic interventions (TAI) in the Marfan syndrome population in the state of Texas from 2009 to 2019. A retrospective review of the Texas Inpatient Discharge Dataset from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2019. Discharges from acute care hospitals with a Marfan syndrome diagnosis by the International Classification of Diseases 9/10 codes and a procedure code for TAI were analysed utilizing descriptive, univariate and multivariable regression statistics. There were 4641 Marfan syndrome discharges identified, of whom 644 (13.9%) underwent TAI. Thoracic or thoraco-abdominal aortic dissection or rupture was noted in 223 (34.6%). Thirty-three (5.1%) had a concomitant coronary artery intervention. There were 30 (4.7%) in-hospital mortalities, 126 (19.6%) diagnoses of acute renal failure (ARF), 52 (8.1%) had mechanical ventilation >96 h and the median length of stay was 10 [interquartile range (IQR) 7-16] days. After adjustment, concomitant coronary artery intervention was associated with in-hospital mortality [odds ratio (OR) 3.69 [IQR 1.15-11.90], P = 0.029] and ARF (OR 2.66 [IQR 1.19-5.94], P = 0.017).

TAI are frequent among the hospitalized Marfan Syndrome population. Concomitant coronary intervention is associated with increased risk of death and aortic dissections/ruptures are associated with increased morbidity.

Posterior strokes are usually associated with embolism or hemodynamic impairment. Extensive disease involving the V3 and V4 segments of the vertebral artery (VA) remains infrequent, and optimal management is limited owing to the infrequency of this disease. We illustrate the case of a 65-year-old man who presented with recurrent transient episodes of dizziness with acute onset of instability, nausea, and left visual blurring. Magnetic resonance imaging findings of the head were normal, and computed tomography angiography revealed severe atherosclerotic disease of both VAs, with proximal occlusion of the right VA and multiple tight stenoses of the left VA at the V1 and V4 segments. Duplex ultrasound found markedly reduced anterograde flow in the VAs and basilar arteries and nonsignificant stenosis of the internal carotid arteries. Optimal medical treatment led to a decrease of transient symptoms. However, the patient developed a cerebellar infarction in the left posteroinferior cerebellar artery territory with left VA V4 segment occlusion. Surgical revascularization of the right VA was decided by the multidisciplinary team. Through an anterolateral approach of the right VA V3 segment, revascularization was performed using a common carotid artery-to-right VA bypass using a reversed saphenous vein graft. The patient fully recovered and was free of symptoms during the next 14 months of follow-up. In the case of extensive VA occlusive disease, surgical reconstruction of the distal VA using a bypass from the common carotid artery represents an option to improve hemodynamics and/or eliminate an embolic source of posterior stroke on a case-by-case basis."

Traditionally, the root is replaced using a mechanical composite valve graft (CVG); however, this valve-replacing (VR) approach necessitates a lifelong regimen of anticoagulation with a potential for late bleeding complications. In time, valve-sparing (VS) approaches were developed. Today, several options for aortic root replacement (ARR) exist; each has advantages and disadvantages that helps inform choice. The Aortic Valve Operative Outcomes in Marfan Patients (AVOMP) is a multi-center international registry to analyze clinical outcomes of ARR in MFS patients using either VR or VS techniques to better elucidate choice. We summarize outcomes of AVOMP and present our own experience. We performed 223 consecutive elective ARR [1991-2023] in patients with MFS; 15 such repairs were included in AVOMP. Repairs included 113 (51%) using a mechanical CVG, 62 (28%) using a VS approach, and 48 (22%) using a bioprosthetic root. Many patients underwent aortic arch repair (30% to 54% by type). The median patient age was 38 [29-52] years. In comparing VS and VR groups, patients were similar in age and rates of major comorbidities and symptoms. Patients with VR repair had a more complex aortic history. The rate of redo sternotomy was 24% (n=54). Operative death was uncommon [4% overall (10/223); ranging from 2% to 8% by type], and stroke was rare [1/223 (<1%)]. Late survival and reoperation differed by operative approach; survival was improved in patients who underwent VS repair. We found that repair in patients with MFS undergoing ARR resulted in low operative risk. Our late results were similar to those of AVOMP in that patients undergoing VS repair tended to experience greater rates of valvular-structural deterioration, although this did not appear to impact survival."

We report a case of aortic aneurysm recurrence 11 years after thoracoabdominal aortic replacement resulting from recanalization of the intercostal arteries like a type II endoleak in a patient with Marfan syndrome. A 50-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome presented with left-sided back pain after meals. She underwent abdominal aortic replacement at 35 years of age, distal aortic arch and thoracoabdominal aortic replacement for type B chronic aortic dissection at 38 years of age, and aortic root to the remnant arch replacement with a mechanical valve conduit for type A acute aortic dissection at 43 years of age, which resulted in complete replacement of the entire aorta with prosthetic grafts. The patient has been taking warfarin since then. The prothrombin time-international normalized ratio levels were controlled almost within the range of 1.5-2.5 during the follow-up period, but it was elevated up to 3.4 at 1 month before she felt back pain and kept high at 4.2 on admission. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed an aneurysm between the descending graft and the remaining native aortic wall, compressing the esophagus. However, there were no abnormal findings on the CT performed 10 months prior to admission. Surgery revealed that the orifices of the intercostal arteries were patent with backflow. We closed the patent intercostal arteries using nonabsorbable sutures. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and the CT performed 1 year later showed no aneurysmal recurrence. Here, we describe a rare case of recurrent aortic aneurysm long term after graft replacement due to recanalization of the intercostal arteries of the remaining aortic wall. Our findings suggest that closing all orifices of the intercostal arteries during aortic repair, regardless of backflow, could prevent delayed reopening; systemic anticoagulation after aortic replacement may be a risk factor for recanalization, and that postoperative periodic CT follow-up is essential, especially in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy."

However, whether FBN1 modulates cervical artery dissection (CAD) development and the potential molecular mechanisms of abnormal FBN1 in CAD remains elusive. In this study, FBN1 deficiency participated in the development of CAD and influenced the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. FBN1 knockout induced alternations in mRNA levels of the transcriptome, protein expression of the proteome, and abundance of N-glycosylation of the N-glycoproteome. Comprehensive analysis of multiple omics showed up-regulation in mRNA levels of ECM proteins; yet, both the ECM protein levels and relative abundance of N-glycosylation were decreased. Moreover, we performed in vivo experiments to confirm the altered glycosylation of proteins in vascular smooth muscle cells. In conclusion, FBN1 deletion in vascular smooth muscle cells can result in altered N-glycosylation of ECM protein, which were critical for the stability of ECM and the process of CAD. This may open the way for a novel therapeutic strategy to treat people with CAD."

We recently reported that allopurinol, a xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor, blocked aortopathy in a MFS mouse model acting as an antioxidant without altering uric acid (UA) plasma levels. Hyperuricaemia is ambiguously associated with cardiovascular injuries as UA, having antioxidant or pro-oxidant properties depending on the concentration and accumulation site. We aimed to evaluate whether hyperuricaemia causes harm or relief in MFS aortopathy pathogenesis. Two-month-old male wild-type (WT) and MFS mice (<i>Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup></i>) were injected intraperitoneally for several weeks with potassium oxonate (PO), an inhibitor of uricase (an enzyme that catabolises UA to allantoin). Plasma UA and allantoin levels were measured via several techniques, aortic root diameter and cardiac parameters by ultrasonography, aortic wall structure by histopathology, and pNRF2 and 3-NT levels by immunofluorescence. PO induced a significant increase in UA in blood plasma both in WT and MFS mice, reaching a peak at three and four months of age but decaying at six months. Hyperuricaemic MFS mice showed no change in the characteristic aortic aneurysm progression or aortic wall disarray evidenced by large elastic laminae ruptures. There were no changes in cardiac parameters or the redox stress-induced nuclear translocation of pNRF2 in the aortic tunica media. Altogether, the results suggest that hyperuricaemia interferes neither with aortopathy nor cardiopathy in MFS mice."

    "abstract": "The eye is prone to various forms of afflictions, either as a manifestation of primary ocular disease or part of systemic disease, including the cardiovascular system. A thorough cardiovascular examination should include a brief ocular assessment. Hypertension and diabetes, for example, would present with retinopathy and dyslipidaemia would present with corneal arcus. Multisystem autoimmune diseases, such as Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis and sarcoidosis, would present with proptosis, episcleritis and scleritis, respectively. Myasthenia gravis, while primarily a neuromuscular disease, presents with fatigable ptosis and is associated with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and giant cell myocarditis. Connective tissue diseases such as Marfan syndrome, which commonly presents with aortic root dilatation, would be associated with ectopia lentis and myopia. Wilson's disease, which is associated with arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies, would present usually with the characteristic Kayser-Fleischer rings. Rarer diseases, such as Fabry disease, would be accompanied by ocular signs such as cornea verticillata and such cardiac manifestations include cardiac hypertrophy as well as arrhythmias. This review examines the interplay between the eye and the cardiovascular system and emphasises the use of conventional and emerging tools to improve diagnosis, management and prognostication of patients."

    "abstract": "Cardiomyopathy is a complication in adults with Marfan syndrome (MFS). Early recognition of MFS patients at high risk of cardiomyopathy could impact monitoring and treatment. Abnormal ventricular strain has been associated with impaired ventricular function among adults with MFS but remains understudied in children. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients with MFS undergoing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) performed in 2003-2018 at age < 19 years. Correlations were evaluated between initial global circumferential strain (GCS) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) and the outcomes of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), aortic root z-score, and vertebral artery tortuosity index corrected for height (VTI-h), all measured from CMR, using Spearman correlation. In those with serial CMR, the ability of ventricular strain to predict development of abnormal LVEF within a 5-year period was assessed. A total of 31 subjects were included (median age at initial CMR 13.5 years, Q1Q3 10.7-16.2 years), with 48% (n = 15) having LVEF < 55%. Worse GCS and worse GLS were associated with lower LVEF (ρ = - 0.629, p < 0.001 and ρ = - 0.411, p = 0.030, respectively). A clinical cutoff of GCS = - 34% predicted LVEF < 55% with sensitivity = 80% and specificity = 50%. Neither GCS nor GLS was associated with aortic root z-score (GCS: p = 0.524; GLS: p = 0.624) nor VTI-h (GCS: p = 0.949; GLS: p = 0.593). Of those with LVEF ≥ 55%, initial GCS and GLS did not differ between those with later normal versus abnormal LVEF (GCS: p = 0.505; GLS: p = 0.232). In this cohort, abnormal LV strain was associated with abnormal LVEF, but not with aortic dilation or low LVEF within the 5 years post-CMR."

Cardiovascular complications of MFS such as aortic root or valve disease and aortic aneurysm or dissection are potential cause of access route problems of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Here, we report a case of a patient with MFS who underwent MT for AIS. A 58-year-old woman with MFS presented with a sudden onset of consciousness disturbance and right hemiparesis, and was referred to our hospital. After the infusion of tissue plasminogen activator, CTA showed a type III arch in the aortic arch and severe tortuosity of the thoracoabdominal aorta; thus, angiography was performed using the transbrachial approach. Left common carotid angiogram showed complete recanalization of the left middle cerebral artery. On the sixth day, the patient presented a sudden consciousness disturbance and left hemiparesis. MRA showed right internal carotid artery occlusion. MT was performed by the transbrachial approach, and complete recanalization was achieved on the first pass. MT via the transbrachial approach is a treatment option that should be considered, especially in MFS, where the transfemoral approach is difficult due to anatomical problems."

This study assesses the clinical risks and hemodynamic consequences of a prophylactic aortic arch replacement strategy in Loeys-Dietz syndrome and characterizes smooth muscle cell phenotype in Loeys-Dietz syndrome aneurysmal and normal-sized downstream aorta. Patients with genetically confirmed Loeys-Dietz syndrome (n = 8) underwent prophylactic aortic arch replacement during valve-sparing aortic root replacement. Four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging studies were performed in 4 patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (valve-sparing aortic root replacement + arch) and compared with patients with contemporary Marfan syndrome (valve-sparing aortic root replacement only, n = 5) and control patients (without aortopathy, n = 5). Aortic tissues from 4 patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome and 2 organ donors were processed for anatomically segmented single-cell RNA sequencing and histologic assessment. Patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome valve-sparing aortic root replacement + arch had no deaths, major morbidity, or aortic events in a median of 2 years follow-up. Four-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated altered flow parameters in patients with postoperative aortopathy relative to controls, but no clear deleterious changes due to arch replacement. Integrated analysis of aortic single-cell RNA sequencing data (>49,000 cells) identified a continuum of abnormal smooth muscle cell phenotypic modulation in Loeys-Dietz syndrome defined by reduced contractility and enriched extracellular matrix synthesis, adhesion receptors, and transforming growth factor-beta signaling. These modulated smooth muscle cells populated the Loeys-Dietz syndrome tunica media with gradually reduced density from the overtly aneurysmal root to the nondilated arch. Patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome demonstrated excellent surgical outcomes without overt downstream flow or shear stress disturbances after concomitant valve-sparing aortic root replacement + arch operations. Abnormal smooth muscle cell-mediated aortic remodeling occurs within the normal diameter, clinically at-risk Loeys-Dietz syndrome arch segment. These initial clinical and pathophysiologic findings support concomitant arch replacement in Loeys-Dietz syndrome."

    "abstract": "Disturbances in the formation of connective tissue lead to significant pathological changes in both individual organs and tissues, and at the organismal level. The complexity of diagnostics is also connected with the fact that there is no single terminology, a single view of the diagnostic criteria, a single approach among doctors of different specialties. The prevalence of external phenotypic signs of connective dysplasia is quite high, which can lead to overdiagnosis. On the other hand, insufficient attention to the manifestations of dysplasia can lead to delayed diagnosis, which can cause adverse complications. The most studied are clinical manifestations in dysplastic changes in the cardiovascular system, musculoskeletal system. This article provides an overview of current data on changes in the nervous system. Sufficient attention was paid to the pathology of the nervous system in differentiated forms (Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos, etc.). Currently, the role of various vascular anomalies, aneurysms associated with undifferentiated forms of connective tissue dysplasia is widely discussed. Much attention is also paid to clinical manifestations of the autonomic nervous system: sympathicotonic manifestations predominate in connective tissue dysplasia. There is evidence of an association of headaches, musculoskeletal pain, and connective tissue dysplasia in both children and adults."

Previous studies revealed sexual dimorphisms in formation of aortic aneurysm in patients with MFS. The current study aimed to investigate the combined role of a high-fat diet (HFD) and biological sex in aortic disease using the mgR/mgR MFS mouse model. Male and female mgR/mgR mice, as well as wild-type (WT) littermate mice, were fed a control diet (CD [10% fat]) or HFD (60% fat) from 4 to 12 weeks of age. Key aortic disease parameters analyzed included the diameter of the aortic wall; elastic fibre fragmentation; proteoglycan content; mRNA levels of Mmp12, Col1a1, Col3a1, and Fbn1; and fibrillin-1 deposition in the aortic wall. HFD-fed female mgR/mgR mice had significantly reduced aortic diameters (35%), elastic fibre fragmentation (56%), pathologically enhanced proteoglycans (45%), and expression of Mmp12 (64%), Col1a1 (41%), and Col3a1 (43%) compared with male mgR/mgR mice on HFD. Fibrillin-1 deposition and Fbn1 mRNA levels were unaffected. The data reveal a protective effect of HFD in female mice. In contrast, CD did not exert any protective effects. This study demonstrates a specific sexual dimorphism in MFS mice, with HFD exerting an explicit protective effect on severity of aortic disease in female mice. These preclinical data may be useful for developing nutritional recommendations for individuals with MFS in the longer term."

    "abstract": "To compare the measurement of aortic diameters using a novel flow-independent MR-Angiography (3D modified Relaxation-Enhanced Angiography without Contrast and Triggering (modified REACT)) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in Marfan syndrome (MFS) patients. This retrospective, single-center analysis included 46 examinations of 32 MFS patients (mean age 37.5 ± 11.3 years, 17 women, no prior aortic surgery) who received TTE and 3D modified REACT (ECG- and respiratory-triggering, Compressed SENSE factor 9 for acceleration of image acquisition) of the thoracic aorta. Aortic diameters (sinus of Valsalva (SV), sinotubular junction (STJ), and ascending aorta (AoA)) were independently measured by two cardiologists in TTE (leading-edge) and two radiologists in modified REACT (inner-edge, using multiplanar reconstruction). Intraclass correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman analyses, and Pearson's correlation (r) were used to assess agreement between observers and methods. Interobserver correlation at the SV, STJ, and AoA were excellent for both, TTE (ICC = 0.95-0.98) and modified REACT (ICC = 0.99-1.00). There was no significant difference between TTE and modified REACT for diameters measured at the SV (39.24 ± 3.24 mm vs. 39.63 ± 3.76 mm; p = 0.26; r = 0.78) and the STJ (35.16 ± 4.47 mm vs. 35.37 ± 4.74 mm; p = 0.552; r = 0.87). AoA diameters determined by TTE were larger than in modified REACT (34.29 ± 5.31 mm vs. 30.65 ± 5.64 mm; p < 0.01; r = 0.74). The mean scan time of modified REACT was 05:06 min ± 02:47 min, depending on the patient's breathing frequency and heart rate. Both TTE and modified REACT showed a strong correlation for all aortic levels; however, at the AoA, diameters were larger using TTE, mostly due to the limited field of view of the latter with measurements being closer to the aortic valve. Given the excellent interobserver correlation and the strong agreement with TTE, modified REACT represents an attractive method to depict the thoracic aorta in MFS patients."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection, characterized by severe intramural hematoma formation and acute endometrial rupture, is caused by excessive bleeding within the aortic wall or a severe tear within the intimal layer of the aorta, which subsequently promotes the separation or dissection in the layers of the aortic wall. Epidemiological surveys showed that aortic dissection was most observed among those patients from 55 to 80 years of age, with a prevalence of approximately 40 cases per 100,000 individuals per year, posing serious risks to future health and leading to high mortality. Other risk factors of aortic dissection progression contained dyslipidemia, hypertension, and genetic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome. Currently, emerging evidence indicates the pathological progression of aortic dissection is significantly complicated, which is correlated with the aberrant infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells into the aortic wall, subsequently facilitating the apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and inducing the aberrant expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interferon (IF). Other pro-inflammatory-related cytokines, including the colony-stimulating factor (CSF), chemotactic factor, and growth factor (GF), played an essential function in facilitating aortic dissection. Multiple studies focused on the important relationship between pro-inflammatory cytokines and aortic dissection, which could deepen the understanding of aortic dissection and further guide the therapeutic strategies in clinical practice. The present review elucidated pro-inflammatory cytokines' functions in modulating the risk of aortic dissection are summarized. Moreover, the emerging evidence that aimed to elucidate the potential mechanisms wherebyvarious pro-inflammatory cytokines affected the pathological development of aortic dissection was also listed."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between axial length (AL) growth and FBN1 genotype in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) after lens surgery and customize the selection of intraocular lens (IOL) power. Patients with MFS who had lens surgery and primary IOL implantation received panel-based next-generation sequencing (NGS). The rate of axial length growth (RALG) was calculated using pre- and postoperative AL measurements and corrected log10-transformed age. A multivariable regression model of RALG was developed after analyzing the effect of FBN1 genotypes and confounding factors. A total of 139 probands of MFS with a median age at lens surgery of 6.25 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 4.67, 12.50 years) were followed up for a median duration of 2.08 years (IQR = 1.16, 3.00 years). The AL growth curve between the age of 3 and 15 years old was logarithmic. Dominant-negative (DN) variants affecting the disulfide-bridge forming cysteines and the conserved residues for calcium-binding had significantly higher RALG than DN variants affecting other structures (P = 0.001) but comparable to that of haplo-insufficiency variants (P = 1.000). Pre-operative AL (b = 0.563, P = 0.011) and genotype constant (b = 2.603, P = 0.011) were significantly associated with RALG in the final model. A Python-based calculator, Marfan IOL Calculator version 2.0, was programmed using the RALG to predict postoperative AL and customize IOL selection based on the ocular biometric parameters and FBN1 genotype. FBN1 genotype impacted the growth of AL in patients with MFS after IOL implantation. Knowing the FBN1 genotype could help cataract surgeons to customize IOL selection."

Seventy-nine children diagnosed with CEL and with FBN1 mutations confirmed via whole-exome sequencing were included for genotypes and phenotypes analysis. The axial length (AL), corneal curvature, and refractive status were included for ocular phenotypes analysis. The cardiovascular examination was performed by echocardiography, and aortic root Z score was calculated to evaluate the severity of aortic dilatation. The heart disorders were classified as aortic root dilatation, valvular disorders, and others. Both the ocular and cardiac manifestations were collected for comprehensive analysis and compared among patients with different genotypes, including the mutation involving cysteine substitution or mutation in different regions. In CEL children with FBN1 mutations, 77.2% patients could be diagnosed as MFS. It was observed that children with mutations in exons 22-42 had significant higher aortic root Z score (P = 0.003) and higher incidence of cardiovascular disorders (P = 0.004). Additionally, children with cysteine substitution mutations had significant higher aortic root Z score (P = 0.011), and the aortic root Z score was positively associated with axial length (AL) in children under 6 years old (P = 0.035). Those with long AL (≥ 26 mm) had significant higher incidence of valve disorders (P = 0.023). In addition, nearly half the children with CEL (46.8%) were diagnosed with cardiovascular disease for the first time. CEL children with FBN1 mutations involving cysteine substitution or mutations in exons 22-42 or with long AL had higher risks of severe cardiovascular complications. Knowing the phenotype may help in anticipating severe cardiovascular disease in CEL patients."

    "abstract": "Transmural failure of the aorta is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality; it occurs when mechanical stress exceeds strength. The aortic root and ascending aorta are susceptible to dissection and rupture in Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder characterized by a progressive reduction in elastic fiber integrity. Whereas competent elastic fibers endow the aorta with compliance and resilience, cross-linked collagen fibers confer stiffness and strength. We hypothesized that postnatal reductions in matrix cross-linking increase aortopathy when turnover rates are high. We combined ex vivo biaxial mechanical testing with multimodality histological examinations to quantify expected age- and sex-dependent structural vulnerability of the ascending aorta in <i>Fbn1</i><sup><i>C1041G/+</i></sup> Marfan versus wild-type mice without and with 4-week exposures to β-aminopropionitrile, an inhibitor of lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-linking of newly synthesized elastic and collagen fibers. We found a strong β-aminopropionitrile-associated sexual dimorphism in aortic dilatation in Marfan mice and aortic rupture in wild-type mice, with dilatation correlating with compromised elastic fiber integrity and rupture correlating with compromised collagen fibril organization. A lower incidence of rupture of β-aminopropionitrile-exposed Marfan aortas associated with increased lysyl oxidase, suggesting a compensatory remodeling of collagen that slows disease progression in the otherwise compromised <i>Fbn1</i><sup><i>C1041G/+</i></sup> aorta. Collagen fiber structure and function in the Marfan aorta are augmented, in part, by increased lysyl oxidase in female and especially male mice, which improves structural integrity, particularly via fibrils in the adventitia. Preserving or promoting collagen cross-linking may represent a therapeutic target for an otherwise vulnerable aorta."

A total of 215 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 78 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified via \"Limma\" package. 60 DEGs, mainly enriched in abnormal transportation of structure and energy substances, were selected after protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, of which 20 were chosen for machine learning after three algorithms (betweenness, closeness, and degree) filtration using Cytoscape. Four overlapping DEGs (ACTN1, CFTR, GCKR, LAMA3) were finally selected as the candidate markers based on three machine-learning approaches (Lasso, random forest, and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination). Furthermore, we collected peripheral blood from MFS patients and healthy control to validate the findings and the results showed that compared with the control, the expression of the four DEGs was all statistically different in MFS patients validated by qRT-PCR. Besides, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was greater than 0.8 for each DEG. Single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis showed that the four DEGs were strongly associated with inflammation and myogenesis pathway. Finally, we constructed the mRNA-miRNA network based on the intersection of DEMs and predicted miRNAs targeting DEGs.

Redox homeostasis depends in part on the enzymatic antioxidant system, which includes thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and glutathione peroxidases (GPx), both of which require an adequate concentration of selenium (Se). Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if Se levels are decreased in the TAA of patients with MFS since this could contribute to the formation of an aneurysm in these patients. The results show that interleukins IL-1β, IL-6 TGF-β1, and TNF-α (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.03), and carbonylation (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.03) were increased in the TAA of patients with MFS in comparison with control subjects, while Se, thiols (<i>p</i> = 0.02), TrxR, and GPx (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.001) were decreased. TLR4 and NOX1 (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.03), MMP9 and MMP2 (<i>p</i> = 0.04) and NOS2 (<i>p</i> < 0.001) were also increased. Therefore, Se concentrations are decreased in the TAA of MFS, which can contribute to a decrease in the activities of TrxR and GPx, and thiol groups. A decrease in the activities of these enzymes can lead to the loss of redox homeostasis, which can, in turn, lead to an increase in the pro-inflammatory interleukins associated with the overexpression of MMP9 and MMP2."

We performed an observational exposed (confirmed HTAD) vs. non-exposed (<65 years old) study of TEVAR-treated patients. The preoperative, 1 year, and last available CT scans were analyzed. The thoracic and abdominal aortic diameters, aortic length, and volumes were measured. The entry tears and false lumen (FL) status were assessed.

At 1 year, the whole aortic volume increased by +21.2% in the HTAD group and by +0.2% the non-HTAD groups, <i>p</i> = 0.005. An increase in the whole aortic volume > 10% was observed in ten cases (58.8%) in the HTAD group and in five cases (22.7%) in the non-HTAD group (<i>p</i> = 0.022). FL thrombosis was achieved in nine cases (52.9%) in the HTAD group vs. twenty (90.9%) cases in the non-HTAD group (<i>p</i> < 0.01). The risk factors for unfavorable anatomical evolution were male gender and the STABILISE technique. With a linear model, we observed a significantly different aortic volume evolution between the two groups (<i>p</i> < 0.01) with the STABILISE technique; this statistical difference was not found in the TEVAR subgroup. In the HTAD patients, there was a significant difference in the total aortic volume evolution progression between the patients treated with the STABILISE technique and the patients treated with TEVAR (+160.1 ± 52.3% vs. +47 ± 22.5%, <i>p</i> < 0.01 and +189.5 ± 92.5% vs. +58.6 ± 34.8%, <i>p</i> < 0.01 at 1 year and at the end of follow-up, respectively). <b>Conclusions:</b> TEVAR in the HTAD patients seemed to be associated with poorer anatomical outcomes at 1 year.

Cardinal clinical phenotypes of MFS are highly variable in terms of severity, and commonly involve cardiovascular, ocular, and musculoskeletal systems with a wide range of manifestations, such as ascending aorta aneurysms and dissection, mitral valve prolapse, ectopia lentis and long bone overgrowth, respectively. Of note, an accurate and prompt diagnosis is pivotal in order to provide the best treatment to the patients as early as possible. To date, the diagnosis of the syndrome has relied upon a systemic score calculation as well as DNA mutation identification. The aim of this review is to summarize the latest MFS evidence regarding the definition, differences and similarities with other connective tissue pathologies with severe systemic phenotypes (e.g., Autosomal dominant Weill-Marchesani syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) and clinical assessment. In this regard, the management of MFS requires a multidisciplinary team in order to accurately control the evolution of the most severe and potentially life-threatening complications. Based on recent findings in the literature and our clinical experience, we propose a multidisciplinary approach involving specialists in different clinical fields (i.e., cardiologists, surgeons, ophthalmologists, orthopedics, pneumologists, neurologists, endocrinologists, geneticists, and psychologists) to comprehensively characterize, treat, and manage MFS patients with a personalized medicine approach."

    "title": "An Uncommon Presentation of Acute Thoracic Aortic Dissection.",
    "abstract": "We present a case of a 40-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of polysubstance abuse (cocaine and methamphetamine), who presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of intermittent cough with associated chest discomfort and shortness of breath for 2 weeks. Initial vital signs demonstrated borderline tachycardia (98 beats per minute), tachypnea (37 times per minutes), and hypoxia (oxygen saturation 89% on room air), and his physical exam was grossly unremarkable. A preliminary workup including a computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a type A aortic dissection with both thoracic and abdominal involvement for which the patient was admitted. This patient had resection of the ascending aorta with graft placement, cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic root replacement using composite prosthesis and left and right coronary reconstruction and reimplantation and survived a complicated hospital course. This case demonstrates the classic association known to exist between recreational drug use, specifically stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines, and acute aortic dissection (AAD). However, such a presentation of borderline subacute, painless dissection in the setting of polysubstance use raises further questions, since uncommon AAD is typically found in higher-risk populations such as those with connective tissue disorders (Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome), bicuspid aortic valve, chronic hypertension, or previous aortic pathology. We therefore suggest clinicians strongly consider uncommon AAD as part of their differential diagnosis in patients with known or highly suspected polysubstance abuse."

    "abstract": "Researches on Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome leading to early-onset aortic dissection (AD) emphasize the importance of gene variants, but the genetic pathogenesis, clinical characteristics and outcomes of early-onset isolated Stanford type B aortic dissection (iTBAD) patients remain unclear and need to be further elucidated. Isolated type B AD patients with an onset age of less than 50 years were enrolled in this study. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed to detect 11 known thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) gene variants. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared between patients with and without gene variants. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for aortic-related adverse events (ARAEs) after endovascular aortic repair. A total of 37 patients were included. Ten patients carried 10 variants in five TAAD genes, four of whom carried pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Compared to patients without the variants, patients with variants had a lower incidence of hypertension (50.0% <i>vs</i>. 88.9%, P=0.021), a higher incidence of other vascular abnormalities (60.0% <i>vs</i>. 18.5%, P=0.038), all-cause mortality (40.0% <i>vs</i>. 3.7%, P=0.014) and aortic related mortality (30.0% <i>vs</i>. 3.7%, P=0.052). Multivariate analysis confirmed the presence of TAAD gene variants as the only independent risk factor for ARAEs [hazard ratio (HR) =4.00; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.26-12.74; P=0.019]. Routine genetic testing is necessary for early-onset iTBAD patients. Individuals with a high risk of ARAEs can be identified by detecting TAAD gene variants, which is important for risk stratification and proper management."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disorder that causes sudden or chronic cardiovascular problems, which can be fatal. Since MFS patients require regular close medical observation, it is important to understand the factors and pathways associated with psychosocial adaptation to the disease. This study aimed to identify the relationships among illness uncertainty, uncertainty appraisal, and psychosocial adaptation in MFS patients using path analysis. This descriptive cross-sectional survey study was conducted from October 2020 to March 2021, in compliance with STROBE guidelines. Using data from 179 participants aged older than 18 years, we constructed a hypothetical path model to identify determinants of illness uncertainty, uncertainty appraisal, and psychosocial adaptation. In the path analysis, disease severity, illness uncertainty, anxiety, and social support were significant factors influencing MFS patients' psychosocial adaptation. Disease severity and illness uncertainty exerted direct effects, while anxiety and social support exerted both direct and indirect (through illness uncertainty) effects. Finally, anxiety showed the greatest total effect. These findings are useful for enhancing MFS patients' psychosocial adaptation. Medical professionals should focus on managing disease severity, decreasing anxiety, and increasing social support."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder caused by variants in the extracellular microfibril fibrillin (<i>FBN1</i>) gene. Here we report an <i>FBN1</i> variant in a child with an unusual skin rash mimicking cutaneous vasculitis, and mild aortic root dilatation. The case was complicated by lack of typical skeletal MFS phenotype; and severe needle phobia preventing any blood testing for workup of suspected vasculitis. Therefore inflammatory markers, autoantibody profile and general hematology/biochemistry results were unknown. Diagnosis of MFS was made via genetic testing of a saliva sample alone using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) targeted gene panel designed to screen for monogenic forms of vasculitis and noninflammatory vasculopathic mimics. This revealed the patient was heterozygous for a pathogenic frameshift variant in <i>FBN1</i>; NM_000138, c.1211delC, p.(Pro404Hisfs*44), predicted to cause premature protein truncation leading to loss of function. The variant has not been detected in control populations and has previously been detected in individuals with MFS. This rapid diagnosis significantly impacted the patient management: avoidance of invasive investigations; avoidance of unnecessary immunosuppression; facilitating genetic counselling of the index case and family; and directly informing lifelong monitoring and ongoing treatment for aortic root involvement from MFS. This case further emphasizes the diagnostic utility of NGS early in the diagnostic workup of paediatric patients referred with suspected vasculitis, and we emphasize that MFS can present with cutaneous vasculitic-like features in the absence of the typical Marfanoid skeletal phenotype."

    "abstract": "Spinal deformities are common in Marfan syndrome (MFS). They usually involve the thoraco-lumbar spine but rarely involves the cervical spine. Kyphosis is the common spine deformity of the cervical spine and mandates surgical correction as they are at risk of neurological deterioration since they are refractory to conservative management. Few studies of surgical correction of spine deformity included cervical deformity. To analyze the challenges faced during surgery, clinical and radiological outcome, and complications following surgical correction for cervical kyphosis in Marfan syndrome. We identified that 5 patients with a diagnosis of MFS with cervical kyphosis who underwent fusion surgery between the years 2010 and 2022 were reviewed, retrospectively. We analyzed the demographic details, radiological parameters, operative variables (blood loss and nuances), perioperative complications, length of stay, clinical and radiological outcome, and complications following fusion surgery for cervical kyphosis in MFS. The mean age of patients was 16.6 ± 4.72 years (range, 12-23 years). The average kyphotic vertebra involved is 3 ± 0.7 bodies (range 2-4) with 2 patients with thoracic deformity. All patients underwent surgical deformity correction. All patients improved clinically with Nurick grade (pre vs. post: 3.4 vs. 2.2) and mJOA (pre vs. post: 8.2 vs. 12.6). There was significant deformity correction from 37.48° to 9.1°. Mean blood loss encountered was 900 ± 173.2 ml. Perioperative complications: wound complication with CSF leak (1). Late complications: ventilator dependence (1) and junctional kyphosis (1). Mean length of hospital stay was 103 ± 178.9 days. All patients were doing symptomatically better after mean follow-up of 58 ± 28.32 months. One patient is bedridden and hospitalized. Cervical kyphosis is a rare spine deformity in patients with MFS, and they usually present with neurological deterioration mandating surgical correction. Multidisciplinary approach (pediatrics, genetics and cardiology) is required for systematic evaluation of these patients. They should be evaluated with necessary imaging to rule out associated spinal deformity (atlanto-axial subluxation, scoliosis, and intraspinal pathology like ductal ectasia). Our results suggest better surgical outcome in terms of low operative complications with neurologic improvement in MFS patients. These patients require regular follow-up to identify late complications (instrument failure, non-union, and pseudarthrosis)."

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 2021 to April 2021, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINHL Complete, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through June 2022 during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee, where appropriate. Recommendations from previously published AHA/ACC guidelines on thoracic aortic disease, peripheral artery disease, and bicuspid aortic valve disease have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing comprehensive care for patients with aortic disease have been developed. There is added emphasis on the role of shared decision making, especially in the management of patients with aortic disease both before and during pregnancy. The is also an increased emphasis on the importance of institutional interventional volume and multidisciplinary aortic team expertise in the care of patients with aortic disease."

We sought to derive and validate a simple score that can help predict SCAD in patients with AMI. We analyzed the Nationwide Readmissions Database and created a risk score for SCAD in patients with an index hospitalization for AMI. We used a multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the independent predictors of SCAD, and each was assigned points proportional to its regression coefficient. Among 1,155,164 patients with AMI, 8,630 (0.75%) had SCAD. Based on the derivation cohort, the independent predictors of SCAD were fibromuscular dysplasia (odds ratio [OR] 67.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 42.0 to 107.9, p <0.01), Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.7 to 12.5, p <0.01), polycystic ovarian syndrome (OR 5.4, 95% CI 3.0 to 9.8, p <0.01), female gender (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.9 to 2.1, p <0.01), and aortic aneurysm (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7, p <0.01). The SCAD risk score included fibromuscular dysplasia (5 points), Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (2 points), polycystic ovarian syndrome (2 points), female gender (1 point), and aortic aneurysm (1 point). The C-statistics of the score were 0.58 (derivation cohort) and 0.61 (validation cohort). In conclusion, the SCAD score is an easy bedside clinical tool that can help clinicians identify patients with AMI who are at risk for SCAD."

Data were collected on patients with type B aortic dissection who underwent TEVAR from January 2008 to August 2022. Patients were divided into a distal aortic segmental enlargement (DSAE) group and a non-DSAE group based on whether the distal false lumen was dilated more than 5 mm on computed tomographic angiography (CTA) images. To analyze the independent influences on distal false lumen dilatation after TEVAR, the variables with a <i>P</i> value < 0.05 during univariate analysis were included in the binary logistic regression analysis model. A total of 335 patients were included in this study, with 85 in the DSAE group and 250 in the non-DSAE group. The mean age was 52.40 ± 11.34 years, 289 (86.27%) were male patients, and the median follow-up time was 6.41 (11.99-29.99) months. There were significant differences in Marfan syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and follow-up time between the two groups. In terms of morphology, there were statistically significant differences in the number of tears, the size of the primary tear, and the length of dissection between the two groups. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that Marfan syndrome, COPD, and the primary tear size were associated with distal false lumen dilatation. Marfan syndrome, COPD, and the primary tear size influence distal aortic segmental enlargement after TEVAR in type B aortic dissection patients."

    "abstract": "Specialized valve endothelial cell (VEC) populations are localized oriented to blood flow in developing aortic and mitral valves, but their roles in valve development and disease are unknown. In the aortic valve (AoV), a population of VECs on the fibrosa side expresses the transcription factor Prox1 together with genes found in lymphatic ECs. In this study, we examine Prox1's role in regulating a lymphatic-like gene network and promoting VEC diversity required for the development of the stratified trilaminar extracellular matrix (ECM) of murine AoV leaflets. To determine whether disruption of Prox1 localization affects heart valve development, we generated mice (<i>NFATc1<sup>enCre</sup></i> <i>Prox1</i> gain-of-function) in which Prox1 is overexpressed on the ventricularis side of the AoV beginning in embryonic development. To identify potential targets of Prox1, we performed cleavage under targets and release using nuclease on wild-type and <i>NFATc1<sup>enCre</sup></i> <i>Prox1</i> gain-of-function AoVs with validation by colocalization in vivo using RNA in situ hybridization in <i>NFATc1<sup>enCre</sup></i> <i>Prox1</i> gain-of-function AoVs. Natural induction of Prox1 and target gene expression was evaluated in myxomatous AoVs in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome (<i>Fbn1<sup>C1039G/+</sup></i>). The overexpression of Prox1 is sufficient to cause enlargement of AoVs by postnatal day (P)0, as well as a decrease in ventricularis-specific gene expression and disorganized interstitial ECM layers at P7. We identified potential targets of Prox1 known to play roles in lymphatic ECs including <i>Flt1</i>, <i>Efnb2</i>, <i>Egfl7</i>, and <i>Cx37</i>. Ectopic Prox1 colocalized with induced <i>Flt1</i>, <i>Efnb2</i>, and <i>Cx37</i> expression in <i>NFATc1<sup>enCre</sup></i> <i>Prox1</i> gain-of-function AoVs. Moreover, in Marfan syndrome myxomatous AoVs, endogenous Prox1, and its identified targets, were ectopically induced in ventricularis side VECs. Our results support a role for Prox1 in localized lymphatic-like gene expression on the fibrosa side of the AoV. Furthermore, localized VEC specialization is required for development of the stratified trilaminar ECM critical for AoV function and is dysregulated in congenitally malformed valves."

    "abstract": "Neonatal Marfan syndrome is a rare disease with mortality in the first year of life reported as high as 95% predominantly due to progressive heart failure from valvar regurgitation and cardiomyopathy. Multisystem involvement and uncertain prognosis have historically precluded transplant candidacy, and current management options are of limited success. We present a baby girl with a postnatal diagnosis of neonatal Marfan syndrome who at 1 year of age underwent mitral valve and tricuspid valve repair with postoperative profound left ventricular and moderate right ventricular dysfunction necessitating biventricular assist device (BiVAD) support and subsequent heart transplant. A number of noncardiac issues persisted in our patient; however, she enjoyed a good quality of life for the initial 3 years posttransplant. Unfortunately, she subsequently developed rapidly progressive coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) with progressive deterioration in function and cardiac arrest. To our best knowledge, this is only the second case of neonatal Marfan syndrome to undergo heart transplant reported in the literature and the first with BiVAD support as a bridge to candidacy. This is also the first case of neonatal Marfan syndrome associated with intragenic duplication. This case though demonstrating that earlier listing, ventricular assist device (VAD) support and even primary transplant as treatment in neonatal Marfan syndrome should all be considered viable options but also portends a cautionary tale given the spectrum of comorbidities in this rare and severe disorder."

    "abstract": "The aorta and aortic wall have a complex biological system of structural, biochemical, biomolecular, and hemodynamic elements. Arterial stiffness could be considered a manifestation of wall structural and functional variations, and it has been revealed to have a strong connection with aortopathies and be a predictor of cardiovascular risk, especially in patients affected by hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and nephropathy. Stiffness affects the function of different organs, especially the brain, kidneys, and heart, promoting remodeling of small arteries and endothelial dysfunction. This parameter could be easily evaluated using different methods, but pulse-wave velocity (PWV), the speed of transmission of arterial pressure waves, is considered the gold standard for a good and precise assessment. An increased PWV value indicates an elevated level of aortic stiffness because of the decline in elastin synthesis and activation of proteolysis and the increase in fibrosis that contributes to parietal rigidity. Higher values of PWV could also be found in some genetic diseases, such as Marfan syndrome (MFS) or Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS). Aortic stiffness has emerged as a major new cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor, and its evaluation using PWV could be very useful to identify patients with a high cardiovascular risk, giving some important prognostic information but also being used to value the benefits of therapeutic strategies."

Even a minor alteration to the DNA sequence can be harmful if it affects the cell's fundamental functions. As a result, the gene begins to act abnormally. The sorts of genetic abnormalities brought on by mutation include chromosomal disorders, complex disorders, and single-gene disorders. Therefore, a detailed diagnosis method is required. Thus, we proposed an Elephant Herd Optimization-Whale Optimization Algorithm (EHO-WOA) optimized Stacked ResNet-Bidirectional Long Term Short Memory (ResNet-BiLSTM) model for detecting genetic disorders. Here, a hybrid EHO-WOA algorithm is presented to assess the Stacked ResNet-BiLSTM architecture's fitness. The ResNet-BiLSTM design uses the genotype and gene expression phenotype as input data. Furthermore, the proposed method identifies rare genetic disorders such as Angelman Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, and Prader-Willi Syndrome. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed model with greater accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, and f1-score. Thus, a wide range of DNA deficiencies including Prader-Willi syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Early Onset Morbid Obesity, Rett syndrome, and Angelman syndrome are predicted accurately."

Fibrillin 2 (FBN2) was first discovered while studying Marfan syndrome, and its encoded products are associated with elastin fibres. To date, the role of FBN2 in BLCA remains unclear. The authors first downloaded data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The patients were divided into high FBN2 expression and low FBN2 expression groups, and the survival curve, clinical characteristics, tumour microenvironment (TME), and immune cell differences were analysed between the two groups. Then, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were filtered, and functional enrichment for DEGs was performed. Finally, chemotherapy drug susceptibility analysis based on the high and low FBN2 groups was conducted. The authors found upregulated expression of FBN2 in BLCA and proved that FBN2 could be an independent prognostic factor for BLCA. TME analysis showed that the expression of FBN2 affects several aspects of the TME. The upregulated expression of FBN2 was associated with a high stromal score, which may lead to immunosuppression and be detrimental to immunotherapy. In addition, the authors found that NK cells resting, macrophage M0 infiltration, and other phenomena of immune cell infiltration appeared in the high expression group of FBN2. The high expression of FBN2 was related to the high sensitivity of some chemotherapy drugs. The authors systematically investigated the effects and mechanisms of FBN2 on BLCA and provided a new understanding of the role of FBN2 as a risk factor and TME influencer in BLCA."

    "abstract": "Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) represents the most frequent cause of primary mitral regurgitation. For several years, biological mechanisms underlying this condition attracted the attention of investigators, trying to identify the pathways responsible for such a peculiar condition. In the last ten years, cardiovascular research has moved from general biological mechanisms to altered molecular pathways activation. Overexpression of TGF-β signaling, for instance, was shown to play a key role in MVP, while angiotensin-II receptor blockade was found to limit MVP progression by acting on the same signaling pathway. Concerning extracellular matrix organization, the increased valvular interstitial cells density and dysregulated production of catalytic enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases above all) altering the homeostasis between collagen, elastin and proteoglycan components, have been shown to possibly provide a mechanistic basis contributing to the myxomatous MVP phenotype. Moreover, it has been observed that high levels of osteoprotegerin may contribute to the pathogenesis of MVP by increasing collagen deposition in degenerated mitral leaflets. Although MVP is believed to represent the result of multiple genetic pathways alterations, it is important to distinguish between syndromic and non-syndromic conditions. In the first case, such as in Marfan syndrome, the role of specific genes has been clearly identified, while in the latter a progressively increasing number of genetic loci have been thoroughly investigated. Moreover, genomics is gaining more interest as potential disease-causing genes and loci possibly associated with MVP progression and severity have been identified. Animal models could be of help in better understanding the molecular basis of MVP, possibly providing sufficient information to tackle specific mechanisms aimed at slowing down MVP progression, therefore developing non-surgical therapies impacting on the natural history of this condition. Although continuous progress has been made in this field, further translational studies are advocated to improve our knowledge of biological mechanisms underlying MVP development and progression."

We conducted a systematic review and searched multiple databases for studies addressing six questions identified by the Society for Vascular Surgery guideline committee about evaluating and managing patients with genetic aortopathies and arteriopathies. Studies were selected and appraised by pairs of independent reviewers. We included 12 studies in this systematic review. We did not identify studies about the long-term outcomes of endovascular repair for aortic aneurysm in patients with heritable aortopathy or about new aortic events in pregnant women with a history of aortic dissection (AD) or aneurysm. A small case series demonstrated a 100% survival rate and 100% aortic intervention-free survival at 15 months (range, 7-28 months) after endograft repair for type B AD. A positive genetic diagnosis was discovered in 36% of patients with aortic aneurysms and dissections who had no risk factors for hereditary aortopathies, and these patients had a mortality rate of 11% at a median follow-up duration of 5 months. Black patients had lower 30-day mortality than White patients (5.6% vs 9.0%, respectively), but they had a higher overall aortic reintervention rate at 30 days after AD repair (47% vs 27%, respectively). Aortic reinterventions owing to aneurysmal expansion and endoleak at 30 days were higher in Black patients than White patients. The certainty of evidence was judged to be very low across all the outcomes evaluated in this systematic review. The available evidence suggests high survival after thoracic endovascular aortic repair for type B AD in young patients with heritable aortopathies, but with limited long-term follow-up. Genetic testing in patients with acute aortic aneurysms and dissections had a high yield. It was positive for most patients with risk factors for hereditary aortopathies and in more than one-third for all other patients, and was associated with new aortic events within 15 years."

A review of literature published until 25 January 2022 and collected from various databases using the relevant keywords was conducted. All publications (original articles, review articles, as well as case reports) describing the ocular features in CTDs were studied in detail. The objective of this review is to recognize the common ophthalmic presentations of various autoimmune and heritable CTDs, distinguish them from overlapping diseases, elaborate on the prognosis and management of these varied eye presentations, and deliberate on their impact on other ophthalmic surgeries."

    "title": "Outcomes After Endovascular Aortic Intervention in Patients With Connective Tissue Disease.",
    "abstract": "Endovascular treatment is not recommended for aortic pathologies in patients with connective tissue diseases (CTDs) other than in redo operations and as bridging procedures in emergencies. However, recent developments in endovascular technology may challenge this dogma. To assess the midterm outcomes of endovascular aortic repair in patients with CTD. For this descriptive retrospective study, data on demographics, interventions, and short-term and midterm outcomes were collected from 18 aortic centers in Europe, Asia, North America, and New Zealand. Patients with CTD who had undergone endovascular aortic repair from 2005 to 2020 were included. Data were analyzed from December 2021 to November 2022. All principal endovascular aortic repairs, including redo surgery and complex repairs of the aortic arch and visceral aorta. Short-term and midterm survival, rates of secondary procedures, and conversion to open repair. In total, 171 patients were included: 142 with Marfan syndrome, 17 with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and 12 with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). Median (IQR) age was 49.9 years (37.9-59.0), and 107 patients (62.6%) were male. One hundred fifty-two (88.9%) were treated for aortic dissections and 19 (11.1%) for degenerative aneurysms. One hundred thirty-six patients (79.5%) had undergone open aortic surgery before the index endovascular repair. In 74 patients (43.3%), arch and/or visceral branches were included in the repair. Primary technical success was achieved in 168 patients (98.2%), and 30-day mortality was 2.9% (5 patients). Survival at 1 and 5 years was 96.2% and 80.6% for Marfan syndrome, 93.8% and 85.2% for Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and 75.0% and 43.8% for vEDS, respectively. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 4.7 years (1.9-9.2), 91 patients (53.2%) had undergone secondary procedures, of which 14 (8.2%) were open conversions. This study found that endovascular aortic interventions, including redo procedures and complex repairs of the aortic arch and visceral aorta, in patients with CTD had a high rate of early technical success, low perioperative mortality, and a midterm survival rate comparable with reports of open aortic surgery in patients with CTD. The rate of secondary procedures was high, but few patients required conversion to open repair. Improvements in devices and techniques, as well as ongoing follow-up, may result in endovascular treatment for patients with CTD being included in guideline recommendations."

    "abstract": "This case series aimed to determine the feasibility of simultaneous modified Ravitch and David procedures for Marfan syndrome patients with pectus excavatum and annuloaortic ectasia. Between March 2014 and December 2019, 7 consecutive patients underwent simultaneous surgery of modified Ravitch and David procedures for pectus excavatum and annuloaortic ectasia. The completion of cardiac surgery and sternal closure were followed by the modified Ravitch procedure. The bilateral fourth to seventh costal cartilages were resected, the sternal body partially wedge resected and the sternum raised anteriorly with re-suture. An oblique incision was performed on bilateral third costal cartilages, and they were fixed on top of each other, with the medial end superior and the lateral end inferior. The sternum was raised anteriorly, bypassing the fourth to seventh rib ends through the back of the sternum with threads. The feasibility and safety of the procedure were assessed through a retrospective review of the patients' clinical charts. The total sample had a median age of 28 years and comprised 5 males and 2 females. There was a significant difference in the preoperative and postoperative median Haller index, which were 6.8 and 3.9, respectively. All patients were discharged without serious complications, and there was no significant recurrence of pectus excavatum at 35-92 months postoperatively. The results of our case series suggest the feasibility of one-stage surgery for pectus excavatum combined with cardiac surgery using the modified Ravitch procedure. Future efforts should be tailored for more uneventful postoperative clinical courses."

    "title": "Longitudinal analysis of thoracic aortic expansion in non-syndromic real-world patients.",
    "abstract": "Remodeling of the thoracic aorta is commonly seen and viewed as a precursor to an aortic aneurysm. However, while aneurysms have been shown to expand at a rate of approximately 1 mm annually, the expansion of the pre-aneurysmal aorta is poorly characterized, especially in relation to age, gender, and aortic size <i>per se</i>. We identified patients that had undergone echocardiography at least twice at a large university medical center. Diagnosis codes, medications, and blood test results were obtained from hospital records. Syndromic patients were excluded (e.g., Marfan's syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve). Final population comprised n = 24,928 patients (median age 61.2 years (inter-quartile range (IQR): 50.6-71.5); 55.8% males) that had undergone a median of 3 echocardiograms (2-4; range 2-27) during a median of 4.0 years (IQR: 2.3-6.2). Hypertension was present in 39.6% of patients and diabetes in 20.7%, median LV ejection fraction was 56.0% (IQR: 41.0-62.0). Aortic size measurements were analyzed in mixed models while clustering on individual patients. Mean expansion was determined for sinus of Valsalva as 1.93 (95% confidence interval; CI<sub>95</sub>: 1.87-1.99) mm per decade, and for ascending aorta as 1.76 (CI<sub>95</sub>: 1.70-1.82) mm per decade. Faster expansion was found in males, with larger aortic size, and younger age (<i>p</i> for interaction <0.05 for all). In conclusion, expansion of the thoracic aorta, in real world, non-syndromic patients, is slow and averages <2 mm per decade. This will help to inform management of this large patient group."

    "title": "Pathology and pathophysiology of the aortic root.",
    "abstract": "Pathologies of the aortic root amenable to repair with valve preservation include aneurysm formation, development of aortic insufficiency (AI) and aortic dissection. In the normal aortic root, the walls are constructed of 50-70 layers of concentric lamellar units. These units consist of sheets of elastin sandwiching smooth muscle cells interspersed with collagen and glycosaminoglycans. Medial degeneration results in disruption of the extracellular matrix (ECM), loss of smooth muscle cells and pooling of proteoglycans/glycosaminoglycans. These structural changes are associated with aneurysm formation. Aortic root aneurysms are commonly linked to hereditary thoracic aortic diseases including Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. One important pathway for hereditary thoracic aortic diseases is the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) cell-signalling pathway. Pathogenic gene mutations affecting various levels of this pathway have been implicated in aortic root aneurysm formation. Secondary effects of aneurysm formation include AI. Severe chronic AI leads to a pressure and volume load on the heart. Once symptoms develop or significant left ventricular remodelling and dysfunction occurs, the patient's prognosis is poor without surgery. Another consequence of aneurysm formation and medial degeneration is the risk of aortic dissection. Aortic root surgery is performed in 34-41% of surgeries for type A aortic dissection. Predicting those who will experience aortic dissections remains a challenge. Finite element analysis, study of fluid-structure interactions and aortic wall biomechanics are important areas of ongoing research."

    "abstract": "Aortic valve sparing operations were introduced three decades ago but controversy remains regarding its appropriateness, reproducibility and durability. This article describes the long-term outcomes of patients who had reimplantation of the aortic valve. All patients who had reimplantation of a tricuspid aortic valve at Toronto General Hospital from 1989 through 2019 were selected for this study. Patients were followed prospectively with periodical clinical assessments and imaging of the heart and aorta. Four hundred and four patients were identified. The median age was 48.0 [interquartile range (IQR), 35.0-59.0] years and 310 (76.7%) were men. There were 150 patients with Marfan syndrome, 20 with Loeys-Dietz syndrome and 33 with acute or chronic aortic dissections. The median follow-up was 11.7 (IQR, 6.8-17.1) years. There were 55 patients alive and without reoperation at 20 years. The cumulative mortality at 20 years was 26.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 20.6-34.2%], the cumulative incidence of reoperation on the aortic valve was 7.0% (95% CI: 4.0-12.2%) and the development of moderate or severe aortic insufficiency was 11.8% (95% CI: 8.5-16.5%). We could not identify variables associated with reoperation on the aortic valve or with the development of aortic insufficiency. New distal aortic dissections were common in patients with associated genetic syndromes. Reimplantation of the aortic valve in patients with tricuspid aortic valve provides excellent aortic valve function during the first two decades of follow-up. Distal aortic dissections are relatively common in patients with associated genetic syndromes."

However, data regarding their use in the pediatric population is limited. This study reports on our experience with aortic valve-sparing procedures in children. A retrospective review was conducted of all patients who underwent an aortic valve-sparing procedure at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia between April 2006 and April 2016. Clinical and echocardiographic data were analyzed. The study included 17 patients, with a median age of 15.7 years and a majority of patients being male (82.4%). The most common diagnosis was transposition of great arteries after arterial switch operation, followed by Loeys-Dietz syndrome and Marfan syndrome. Preoperative echocardiography showed more than moderate aortic regurgitation in 94.1% of the patients. The David procedure was performed in all 17 patients, with no mortality during follow-up. Reoperation was required in 29.4% of patients, and 23.5% required aortic valve replacement. Freedom from reoperation for aortic valve replacement at 1, 5, and 10 years was 93.8%, 93.8% and 68.2% respectively. Aortic valve-sparing surgery can be successfully performed in the pediatric population. However, it requires a highly skilled surgeon due to the often dysplastic or distorted nature of these valves and the need for additional procedures on the aortic valve leaflets."

The objective of this review was to summarize our experience with root remodeling encompassing 28 years. We performed root remodeling in 1,189 patients (76% male, mean age 53±14 years) between October 1995 and September 2022. The original valve morphology was unicuspid in 33 (2%), bicuspid in 472 (40%) and tricuspid in 684 (58%) patients. Fifty-four patients (5%) had Marfan's syndrome. Objective measurement of valve configuration was performed in 804 (77%) and an external suture annuloplasty was added in 524 patients (44%). Cusp repair was performed in 1,047 (88%) patients, most commonly for prolapse (n=972; 82%). Mean follow-up was 6.7±5.5 years [1 month to 28 years]. Follow-up was 95% complete (7,700 patient-years). Survival was 71% at 20 years; freedom from cardiac death was 80%. Freedom from aortic regurgitation ≥2 was 77% at 15 years. Freedom from reoperation was 89% and was higher in tricuspid aortic valves (94%) compared to bicuspid (84%) and unicuspid valves (P<0.001). Since the introduction of effective height measurement, freedom from reoperation has remained stable at 15 years (91%). With the addition of a suture annuloplasty, freedom from reoperation was 94% at 12 years. The difference with or without annuloplasty (91%) was not significant (P=0.949). Root remodeling is a viable option in valve-preserving root replacement. Concomitant cusp prolapse is frequent and can be corrected reproducibly by intraoperative measurement of effective height. The long-term benefit of an annuloplasty still needs to be defined."

    "title": "Opioid Utilization After Scoliosis Surgery is Greater in Marfan Syndrome Than Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.",
    "abstract": "Retrospective matched case cohort. Compare postoperative opioid utilization and prescribing behaviors between patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) after posterior spinal fusion (PSF). Opioids are an essential component of pain management after PSF. However, due to the potential for opioid use disorder and dependence, current analgesic strategies aim to minimize their use, especially in younger patients. Limited information exists on opioid utilization after PSF for syndromic scoliosis. Twenty adolescents undergoing PSF with MFS were matched with patients with AIS (ratio, 1:2) by age, sex, degree of spinal deformity, and the number of vertebral levels fused. Inpatient and outpatient pharmaceutical data were reviewed for the quantity and duration of opioid and adjunct medications. Prescriptions were converted to morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) using CDC's standard conversion factor. Compared with patients with AIS, patients with MFS had significantly greater total inpatient MME use (4.9 vs . 2.1 mg/kg, P ≤ 0.001) and longer duration of intravenous patient-controlled anesthesia (3.4 vs . 2.5 d, P = 0.001). Within the first 2 postop days, MFS patients had more patient-controlled anesthesia boluses (91 vs . 52 boluses, P = 0.01) despite similar pain scores and greater use of adjunct medications. After accounting for prior opioid use, MFS was the only significant predictor of requesting an opioid prescription after discharge (odds ratio: 4.1, 95% CI: 1.1-14.9, P = 0.03). Patients with MFS were also more likely to be discharged with a more potent prescription (1.0 vs . 0.72 MME per day/kg, P ≤ 0.001) and to receive a longer-duration prescription (13 vs . 8 d, P = 0.005) with a greater MME/kg (11.6 vs . 5.6 mg/kg, P ≤ 0.001) as outpatients. Despite a similar intervention, patients with MFS and AIS seem to differ in their postoperative opioid usage after PSF, presenting an opportunity for further research to assist clinicians in better anticipating the analgesic needs of individual patients, particularly in light of the ongoing opioid epidemic."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) are abnormal aortic dilatations and a major cardiovascular complication of Marfan syndrome. We previously demonstrated a critical role for vascular smooth muscle (VSM) SirT1 (sirtuin-1), a lysine deacetylase, against maladaptive aortic remodeling associated with chronic oxidative stress and aberrant activation of MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases). In this study, we investigated whether redox dysregulation of SirT1 contributed to the pathogenesis of TAA using fibrillin-1 hypomorphic mice (Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup>), an established model of Marfan syndrome prone to aortic dissection/rupture. Oxidative stress markers 3-nitrotyrosine and 4-hydroxynonenal were significantly elevated in aortas of patients with Marfan syndrome. Moreover, reversible oxidative post-translational modifications (rOPTM) of protein cysteines, particularly S-glutathionylation, were dramatically increased in aortas of Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> mice, before induction of severe oxidative stress markers. Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> aortas and VSM cells exhibited an increase in rOPTM of SirT1, coinciding with the upregulation of acetylated proteins, an index of decreased SirT1 activity, and increased MMP2/9 activity. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that TGFβ (transforming growth factor beta), which was increased in Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> aortas, stimulated rOPTM of SirT1, decreasing its deacetylase activity in VSM cells. VSM cell-specific deletion of SirT1 in Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> mice (SMKO-Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup>) caused a dramatic increase in aortic MMP2 expression and worsened TAA progression, leading to aortic rupture in 50% of SMKO-Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> mice, compared with 25% of Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> mice. rOPTM of SirT1, rOPTM-mediated inhibition of SirT1 activity, and increased MMP2/9 activity were all exacerbated by the deletion of Glrx (glutaredoxin-1), a specific deglutathionylation enzyme, while being corrected by overexpression of Glrx or of an oxidation-resistant SirT1 mutant in VSM cells. Our novel findings strongly suggest a causal role of S-glutathionylation of SirT1 in the pathogenesis of TAA. Prevention or reversal of SirT1 rOPTM may be a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent TAA and TAA dissection/ruptures in individuals with Marfan syndrome, for which, thus far, no targeted therapy has been developed."

The genetic abnormality associated with eoMFS is located in a so-called critical neonatal region in exons 25-26 of the <i>fibrillin-1</i> (<i>FBN1</i>) gene. A female neonate was delivered by emergency cesarean section at 37 weeks gestation due to fetal distress with bradycardia, cyanosis, and no spontaneous breathing. On examination, the patient had multiple musculoskeletal deformities, including loose redundant skin, arachnodactyly, flat soles, and joint contractures. Echocardiography showed poor cardiac contractility with multiple valvular abnormalities. She died 13 h after birth. We identified a novel missense variant c.3218A>G (p.Glu1073Gly) in exon 26 of the <i>FBN1</i> gene by targeted next-generation sequencing. A literature review revealed that arachnodactyly and aortic root dilatation in the fetus are predictive of eoMFS. However, the predictive potential of ultrasonography alone is limited. Genetic testing of the <i>FBN1</i> gene restriction region associated with short life expectancy and characteristic fetal ultrasound findings could be important for prenatal diagnosis of eoMFS, postnatal management, and parental preparedness. We identified a novel missense mutation located in exons 25-26 of the Fibrillin-1 gene in a neonate with early-onset Marfan syndrome (eoMFS) who died of severe early heart failure shortly after birth. This mutation was located in a narrowly defined critical neonatal region, recently reported to cause eoMFS, and its clinical profile was consistent with early-onset severe heart failure. In addition to ultrasonography, genetic analysis of this region is important for predicting prognosis in eoMFS."

Contractile element genes uniquely predispose to ATAA. Aside from known syndromic connective tissue disease and poly-aneurysmal syndromes (Marfan disease, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), there is only limited genetic overlap between AAA and ATAA. The rapid advances in genotyping and bioinformatics will elucidate further the various pathways associated with the development of aneurysms affecting various parts of the aorta."

Genome-wide DNA methylation and somatic mutational profiles of tumours from two germline MLH1: c.-11C > T and one MLH1: c.-[28A > G; 7C > T] carriers and three MLH1 methylated EOCRCs (< 45 years) were compared with 38 reference CRCs. Methylation-sensitive droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to detect mosaic MLH1 methylation in blood, normal mucosa and buccal DNA. Genome-wide methylation-based Consensus Clustering identified four clusters where the tumour methylation profiles of germline MLH1: c.-11C > T carriers and MLH1 methylated EOCRCs clustered with the constitutional MLH1 epimutation CRCs but not with the sporadic MLH1 methylated CRCs.

Detection and urgent fixation or lung resection are critical to avoid catastrophic sequelae of lung necrosis, bronchopleural fistulae, and death.

This was a case of lobar torsion in a patient with Marfan syndrome and the degree of connective tissue disease may have predisposed the patient to this rare surgical complication.

    "abstract": "Alu elements are retrotransposons with ubiquitous presence in the human genome that have contributed to human genomic diversity and health. These approximately 300-bp sequences can cause or mediate disease by disrupting coding/splicing regions in the germline, by insertional mutagenesis in somatic cells, and in promoting formation of copy-number variants. Alu elements may also disrupt epigenetic regulation by affecting non-coding regulatory regions. There are increasing reports of apparently sporadic and inherited genetic disorders caused by Alu-related gene disruption, but Marfan syndrome resulting from Alu element insertion has not been previously described. We report a family with classic features of Marfan syndrome whose previous FBN1 genetic testing was inconclusive. Using contemporary next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, a pathogenic/disruptive Alu insertion occurring in the coding region of the FBN1 gene was identified (c.6564_6565insAlu; p. Glu2189fs) and was confirmed and specified further with Sanger sequencing. This identified the molecular basis of disease in the family that was missed using previous genetic testing technologies and highlights a novel pathogenic mechanism for Marfan syndrome. This case adds to the growing literature of Mendelian diseases caused by Alu retrotransposition, and it also shows the growing capability of genomic technologies for detecting atypical mutation events."

    "abstract": "Fibrillin-1 is an extracellular matrix protein that assembles into microfibrils which provide critical functions in large blood vessels and other tissues. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene are associated with cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal abnormalities in Marfan syndrome. Here, we reveal that fibrillin-1 is critical for angiogenesis which is compromised by a typical Marfan mutation. In the mouse retina vascularization model, fibrillin-1 is present in the extracellular matrix at the angiogenic front where it colocalizes with microfibril-associated glycoprotein-1, MAGP1. In <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice, a model of Marfan syndrome, MAGP1 deposition is reduced, endothelial sprouting is decreased, and tip cell identity is impaired. Cell culture experiments confirmed that fibrillin-1 deficiency alters vascular endothelial growth factor-A/Notch and Smad signaling which regulate the acquisition of endothelial tip cell/stalk cell phenotypes, and we showed that modulation of MAGP1 expression impacts these pathways. Supplying the growing vasculature of <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice with a recombinant C-terminal fragment of fibrillin-1 corrects all defects. Mass spectrometry analyses showed that the fibrillin-1 fragment alters the expression of various proteins including ADAMTS1, a tip cell metalloprotease and matrix-modifying enzyme. Our data establish that fibrillin-1 is a dynamic signaling platform in the regulation of cell specification and matrix remodeling at the angiogenic front and that mutant fibrillin-1-induced defects can be rescued pharmacologically using a C-terminal fragment of the protein. These findings, identify fibrillin-1, MAGP1, and ADAMTS1 in the regulation of endothelial sprouting, and contribute to our understanding of how angiogenesis is regulated. This knowledge may have critical implications for people with Marfan syndrome."

We report a middle-aged female, heterozygous for the R18W novel variant of the SMAD3 gene, with a history of an aortic valve disorder and three aortic valve replacements in a span of 15 years. The patient neither has a history of congenital connective tissue disorders nor any known congenital valvular defects. The patient had genetic testing for thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD)/Marfan syndrome/related disorders. She was found to be heterozygous for the p.Arg18Trp (R18W) protein variant of the SMAD3 gene (chromosome position 15:67430416), coding DNA c.52 C>T. Members of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) family and their downstream signaling proteins, including SMAD, are important for establishing proper embryogenic development and maintaining adult tissue homeostasis. Investigating the disturbances within the TGF-β signaling pathways may provide insightful knowledge of how genetic factors can cause structural and functional valvular defects."

Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis is categorized as idiopathic or reported depending on the coexistent initiating factors; however, congenital contractural arachnodactyly, which is caused by abnormal production of elastin based on a mutation in the <i>fibrillin-2</i> gene, is rarely reported with lung lesion resembling pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis. We present a case of pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis in a patient with a novel mutation in the <i>fibrillin-2</i> gene, which encodes the prenatal fibrillin-2 protein as a scaffold for elastin."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a rare autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder affecting the cardiovascular, skeletal, and ophthalmic systems. This report aimed to describe a novel genetic background and treatment prognosis of MFS. A proband was initially diagnosed with bilateral pathologic myopia and suspected MFS. We performed whole exome sequencing and found a pathogenic nonsense FBN1 mutation in the proband, which confirmed the diagnosis of MFS. Notably, we identified a second pathogenic nonsense mutation in SDHB, which increased the risk of tumours. In addition, the proband karyotype was X trisomy, which may cause X trisomy syndrome. At the 6-month follow-up after posterior scleral reinforcement surgery, the proband's visual acuity improved significantly; however, myopia was still progressing. We report a rare case of MFS with a X trisomy genotype, a mutation in FBN1 and a mutation in SDHB for the first time, and our findings could be helpful for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of this disease."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an inherited autosomal-dominant connective tissue disorder with multiorgan involvement including musculoskeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, ocular, and skin manifestations. Life expectancy in patients with MFS is primarily determined by the degree of cardiovascular involvement. Aortic disease is the major cardiovascular manifestation of MFS. However, non-aortic cardiac diseases, such as impaired myocardial function and arrhythmia, have been increasingly acknowledged as additional causes of morbidity and mortality. We present two cases demonstrating the phenotypical variation in patients with MFS and how CMR (Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance) could serve as a \"one stop shop\" to retrieveS all the necessary information regarding aortic/vascular pathology as well as any potential underlying arrhythmogenic substrate or cardiomyopathic process."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is the most common inherited connective tissue disorder and its association with intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) has been debated for more than two decades. Here, we report the prevalence of ICAs at screening neuroimaging in a population of genetically confirmed MFS patients and present the results of a meta-analysis including our cohort of patients and those of previous studies. We enrolled 100 consecutive MFS patients, who underwent screening with brain magnetic resonance angiography at our tertiary center between August 2018 and May 2022. We did a PubMed and Web of Science search to retrieve all studies on the prevalence of ICAs in patients with MFS published before November, 2022. Of the 100 patients included in this study (94% Caucasians, 40% females, mean age 38.6 ± 14.6 years), three had an ICA. We pooled the current study with five previously published studies, including a total of 465 patients, 43 of which harbored at least one unruptured ICA, leading to an overall ICA prevalence of 8.9% (95% CI 5.8%-13.3%). In our cohort of genetically confirmed MFS patients, the prevalence of ICAs was 3%, which is substantially lower compared to previous studies based on neuroimaging. The high frequency of ICA found in previous studies could be explained by selection bias and lack of genetic testing, which may have led to the inclusion of patients with different connective tissue disorders. Further studies, including several centers and a large number of patients with genetically confirmed MFS, are needed to confirm our results."

The loss of TGF-β2, and only TGF-β2, resulted in 80% of the double mutant animals dying earlier, by postnatal day 20, than MFS only mice. Death was not from thoracic aortic rupture, as observed in MFS mice, but was associated with hyperplastic aortic valve leaflets, aortic regurgitation, enlarged aortic root, increased heart weight, and impaired lung alveolar septation. Thus, there appears to be a relationship between loss of fibrillin1 and TGF-β2 in the postnatal development of the heart, aorta and lungs."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome causes a hereditary form of thoracic aortic aneurysms with dilation of the aortic root. Human and animal models suggest a worse phenotype for males compared to females with respect to aneurysm size and risk of dissection. In this study we examine the effects of 17 β-estradiol on aortic dilation and rupture in a Marfan mouse model. Marfan male mice were administered 17 β-estradiol and the growth in aortic root size along with the risk of aortic rupture or dissection with the addition of angiotensin II was measured. Transcriptomic profiling was used to identify enriched pathways from 17 β-estradiol treatment. Aortic smooth muscle cells were then treated with cytokines in order to validate the mechanism of 17 β-estradiol protection. We show that 17 β-estradiol decreased the size and rate of aortic root dilation and improved survival from rupture and dissection after treatment with angiotensin II. The Marfan transcriptome was enriched in inflammatory genes and the addition of 17 β-estradiol modulated a set of genes that function through TNFα mediated NF-κB signaling. These included many proteins known to play a role in the phenotypic shift of aortic smooth muscle cells from a contractile to a more inflammatory-like state such as Vcam-1, Mcp-1, Lgals3, Il-6, Il-1b, and C3. In addition, 17 β-estradiol suppressed the induction of these TNFα induced genes in aortic smooth muscle cells in vitro and this effect appears to be NF-κB dependent. In conclusion, 17 β-estradiol protects against the dilation and rupture of aortic roots in Marfan male mice through the inhibition of TNFα -NF-κB signaling and thus prevents the phenotypic switch of aortic smooth muscle cells from a contractile to an inflammatory state."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to explore the literature on fatigue in patients with syndromic heritable thoracic aortic disease (sHTAD), including Marfan syndrome (MFS), Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), vascular Ehlers Danlos syndrome (vEDS) and other sHTADs, critically appraise and synthesize the relevant literature. We also aimed to investigate how adults with sHTAD experience and perceive fatigue, and to discuss clinical implications and direction for further research. First, a systematic review was performed by searching the published literature in all relevant databases and other sources until 20th October 2022. Second, a qualitative focus group interview study was conducted of 36 adults with sHTADs (LDS n = 11, MFS n = 14, vEDS n = 11). In the systematic review, 33 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria (3 reviews and 30 primary studies). Of the primary studies: 25 dealt with adults (MFS n = 17, MFS/EDS n = 1, EDS n = 2, LDS/vEDS n = 3, different sHTADs n = 2), 5 with children (MFS n = 4, different sHTADs n = 1). Twenty-two were cross-sectional quantitative studies, 4 prospective and 4 qualitative studies. The quality of the included studies was mostly good, but many had small sample sizes, low response rates and/or participants without verified diagnosis. Despite these limitations, studies indicated high prevalence of fatigue (ranging from 37 to 89%), and fatigue was associated with both health and psychosocial aspects. Few studies found that fatigue was associated with disease-related symptoms. In the qualitative focus groups most of the participants reported that they had experienced fatigue which influenced several aspects of life. Four themes related to fatigue were elucidated: (1) different diagnoses-different fatigue?, (2) the nature of fatigue, (3) searches for causes of fatigue, (4) dealing with fatigue in daily life. The four themes seemed mutually interrelated in terms of barriers, strategies and facilitators for dealing with fatigue. The participants experienced fatigue as a consistent dilemma between self-assertion and inadequacy. Fatigue seems to influence several aspects of daily life and may be one of the most debilitating symptoms of having a sHTAD. Fatigue seems to negatively impact the lives of people with sHTADs and should be recognized as an important aspect in the lifelong follow-up of these patients. The life-threatening complications of sHTADs may result in emotional stress, including fatigue and the risk of developing a sedentary lifestyle. Research and clinical initiatives should consider rehabilitation interventions aiming at postponing the onset or reducing symptoms of fatigue."

We present the case of an 11-year-old boy, with medical history of Marfan syndrome, with orthostatic headache and persistent vomiting (12 hours) following a fall on the sacrococcygeal region. Magnetic resonance showed extradural fluid collections at dorsal and lumbosacral levels, compatible with CSF leak. The condition was resolved with treatment, but the patient had two new episodes during the follow-up period. Thus, an epidural blood patch was performed two years after the first episode. Although HIS is uncommon in children, it should be suspected in patients with orthostatic headache, particularly if the patient presents a connectivopathy. Few studies have assessed the management of HIS in paediatric age. The case presented here and the reviewed available literature provides further data for these type of cases."

This observational, multicenter study included 127 children, aged 4-18 years, with Marfan syndrome (MFS) (59%), Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) (8%), Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) (12%) and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) (23%). The assessments included the Children's Somatization Inventory or parent proxy (CSI, PCSI), pain visual-analogue scale (VAS), SUPERKIDZ body diagram, Pain Catastrophizing Scale Child or parent proxy (PCS-C, PCS-P) and Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ-30). Data from children aged ≥8 years were compared to normative data. In children ≥ 8 years (n = 90), pain was present in 59%, with a median of 4 (IQR = 3-9) pain areas. Compared to normative data, the HCTD group reported significantly higher on the CSI (p ≤ 0.001, d = 0.85), VAS pain intensity (p ≤ 0.001, d = 1.22) and CHAQ-30 (p ≤ 0.001, d = 1.16) and lower on the PCS-C (p = 0.017, d = -0.82) and PCS-P (p ≤ 0.001, d = -0.49). The intensity of nonspecific somatic symptoms and pain explained 45% of the variance in disability (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.45 F(2,48) = 19.70, p ≤ 0.001). In children ≤ 7 years (n = 37), pain was present in 35% with a median of 5(IQR = 1-13) pain areas. The mean(SD) VAS scores for pain intensity was 1.5(2.9). Functional disability was moderately correlated to the number of pain areas (r = 0.56, p ≤ 0.001), intensity of nonspecific somatic symptoms (r = 0.63, p ≤ 0.001) and pain (r = 0.83, p ≤ 0.001). In conclusion, this study supports the need for comprehensive assessment of nonspecific somatic symptoms, pain, and disability in children with HCTD to allow tailored treatment."

Owing in part to the rarity of pathologies, the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms (IA) in MFS is poorly defined. There is debate as to whether or not there is an association between the two. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of IA in a population of patients with MFS who underwent intracranial imaging. This was a single-center retrospective review of patients with MFS. Between 1995 and 2021, 983 patients were reviewed. We identified 198 patients with MFS who had intracranial imaging. Imaging consisted of CTA and/or MRA, and was read by an attending radiologist. Details of the aneurysm, patient demographics, and aortic characteristics were collected. The prevalence of IA was 7.1% (14/198). Age of patients with IA (55.0 ± 15.1 years) was not significantly different than those without IA (52.6 ± 16.0 years) (P = .58). The most common location of IA was the internal carotid artery. The mean diameter of the IA was 7 ± 5.8 mm. No ruptures of the internal carotid artery were identified. One patient (0.5%) underwent intervention for the IA. There were no significant differences found in aortic characteristic including dimensions, history of dissection, or aneurysm. In a large, single-center experience over 20 years, we identified patients with confirmed MFS who underwent intracranial imaging. The prevalence of IA in our experience was 7.1%. There were no patient or aortic characteristics found to be significantly associated with IA; however, this finding may be due to the small number of aneurysms. Although this number is higher than the historically reported prevalence in the general population, a collection of experiences from multiple institutions will likely be required to truly define the risk of IA in MFS and to determine whether screening is warranted."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain the leading cause of death worldwide and pharmacotherapy of most of them is suboptimal. Thus, there is a clear unmet clinical need to develop new pharmacological strategies with greater efficacy and better safety profiles. In this review, we summarize the most relevant advances in cardiovascular pharmacology in 2022 including the approval of first-in-class drugs that open new avenues for the treatment of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (mavacamten), type 2 diabetes mellitus (tirzepatide), and heart failure (HF) independent of left ventricular ejection fraction (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors). We also dealt with fixed dose combination therapies repurposing different formulations of \"old\" drugs with well-known efficacy and safety for the treatment of patients with acute decompensated HF (acetazolamide plus loop diuretics), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (moderate-dose statin plus ezetimibe), Marfan syndrome (angiotensin receptor blockers plus β-blockers), and secondary cardiovascular prevention (i.e. low-dose aspirin, ramipril and atorvastatin), thereby filling existing gaps in knowledge, and opening new avenues for the treatment of CVD. Clinical trials confirming the role of dapagliflozin in patients with HF and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, long-term evolocumab to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, vitamin K antagonists for stroke prevention in patients with rheumatic heart disease-associated atrial fibrillation, antibiotic prophylaxis in patients at high risk for infective endocarditis before invasive dental procedures, and vutrisiran for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-related amyloidosis with polyneuropathy were also reviewed. Finally, we briefly discuss recent clinical trials suggesting that FXIa inhibitors may have the potential to uncouple thrombosis from hemostasis and attenuate/prevent thromboembolic events with minimal disruption of hemostasis."

We identified all consecutive patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair between 1997 and 2022. Primary outcome was composite of major adverse events. Secondary outcomes were individual complications and long-term survival. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was performed. Weighted Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate long-term survival. Multivariable analysis identified factors associated with major adverse events. Six hundred eighty-four patients underwent open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Ninety (13.1%) had Marfan syndrome, whereas 594 (86.9%) did not. Marfan patients were younger (46 years [range, 36-56 years] vs 69 years [range, 61-76 years]; P < .001). Extent II or III aneurysms (57 out of 90 [63.3%] vs 211 out of 594 [35.6%]; P < .001) and type I or III chronic dissection (77 out of 90 [85.3%] vs 242 out of 594 [40.8%]; P < .001) were more common. Cardiovascular risk factors were less frequent in Marfan patients. There was no difference in major adverse events between groups (12 out of 90 [13.3%] vs 100 out of 594 [16.8%]; P = .49). Operative mortality was similar between groups (3 out of 90 [3.3%] vs 28 out of 594 [4.7%]; P = .75). Unweighted survival at 10 years was 78.7% vs 46.8% (P = .001). Weighted Kaplan-Meier curves showed no difference in long-term survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.32-1.99; P = .62; Log-rank P = .12). At multivariable analysis, renal insufficiency (odds ratio, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.43-3.68; P < .01) and urgent/emergency procedure (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.35-3.48; P < .01) were associated with major adverse events, whereas Marfan syndrome was not (odds ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.69-3.49; P = .28). Open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair can be performed with similar operative outcomes in patients with and without Marfan syndrome despite differing risk profiles. Operative/perioperative strategies must be tailored to specific needs of each patient to optimize outcomes."

We retrospectively included 136 Marfan patients with a total of 645 MRAs who underwent a median of five MRAs (range: 2-13) at 1.5 T and 3 T in annual intervals. Of these, 41 patients (34.8 ± 12 years) had undergone aortic root replacement. The remaining 95 patients (29.0 ± 17 years) still had a native aorta and served as the control group. Thoracic aortic diameters were independently measured at eleven predefined levels. Estimated growth rates were calculated using a mixed effects model adjusted for sex, age, BMI, and medication. Marfan patients with aortic root replacement revealed the highest mean estimated growth rate in the proximal descending aorta (0.77 mm/year, CI: 0.31-1.21). Mean growth rates at all levels of the distal thoracic aorta were significantly higher in patients with aortic root replacement (0.28-0.77 mm/year) when compared to patients without aortic root replacement (0.03-0.07 mm/year) (all p < 0.001). Antihypertensive medication, gender, and BMI had no significant impact on the distal aortic growth rates. Distal thoracic aortic diameters increase at a significantly higher rate in Marfan patients with aortic root replacement compared to Marfan patients without aortic root replacement. Further studies are warranted to investigate if the increased growth rate of the distal thoracic aorta after aortic root replacement is caused by altered hemodynamics due to the rigid aortic root graft or due to the general genetic disposition of post-operative Marfan patients. High growth rates of the distal aorta after aortic root replacement underline the need for careful life-long aortic imaging of Marfan patients after aortic root replacement. • Aortic growth rates in Marfan patients with aortic root replacement are highest in the mid-aortic arch, the proximal- and mid-descending aorta. • Growth rates of the distal thoracic aorta are significantly higher in Marfan patients with aortic root replacement compared to Marfan patients without aortic root replacement. • Antihypertensive medication, gender, and BMI have no significant impact on distal aortic growth rates in Marfan patients."

Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene result in Marfan syndrome (MFS), an autosomal dominant disease of the connective tissue. Although the kidney is not considered a classically affected organ in MFS, several case reports describe glomerular disease in patients. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the kidney in the mgΔlpn-mouse model of MFS. Affected animals presented a significant reduction of glomerulus, glomerulus-capillary, and urinary space, and a significant reduction of fibrillin-1 and fibronectin in the glomerulus. Transmission electron microscopy and 3D-ultrastructure analysis revealed decreased amounts of microfibrils which also appeared fragmented in the MFS mice. Increased collagen fibers types I and III, MMP-9, and α-actin were also observed in affected animals, suggesting a tissue-remodeling process in the kidney. Video microscopy analysis showed an increase of microvessel distribution coupled with reduction of blood-flow velocity, while ultrasound flow analysis revealed significantly lower blood flow in the kidney artery and vein of the MFS mice. The structural and hemodynamic changes of the kidney indicate the presence of kidney remodeling and vascular resistance in this MFS model. Both processes are associated with hypertension which is expected to worsen the cardiovascular phenotype in MFS."

Overall operative mortality was nil (P = 1.000); the incidence of major postoperative complications was 1.2% (0.9% vs 1.3%; P = 1.000) and did not differ between groups. Residual mild aortic insufficiency (AI) was more frequent in the CTD group (9.3% vs 1.3%, P < .001) with no difference in moderate or greater AI. Ten-year survival was 97.3% (97.2% vs 97.4%; log-rank P = .801). Of the 15 patients with residual AI, 1 had none, 11 remained mild, 2 had moderate, and 1 had severe AI on follow-up.

Few studies reported the blood calcium and lipid profile of MFS, and the effect of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic switching on MFS aortic aneurysm is unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of calcium-related VSMC phenotypic switching in MFS. We retrospectively collected MFS patients' clinical data, performed bioinformatics analysis to screen the enriched biological process in MFS patients and mice, and detected markers of VSMC phenotypic switching on Fbn1<sup>C1039G/+</sup> mice and primary aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. We found that patients with MFS have elevated blood calcium levels and dyslipidemia. Furthermore, the calcium concentration levels were increased with age in MFS mice, accompanied by the promoted VSMC phenotypic switching, and SERCA2 contributed to maintaining the contractile phenotype of VSMCs. This study provides the first evidence that the increased calcium is associated with the promoted VSMC phenotype switching in MFS. SERCA may become a novel therapeutic target for suppressing aneurysm progression in MFS."

There was no correlation between age and diameter at the time of dissection (<20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, <61 years; P = 0.78). Freedom from intervention after dissection was 53%, 44% and 33% at 1, 5 and 10 years. Aortic growth rate in those patients that had to undergo intervention within the 1st year after dissection was 10.2 mm/year (95% CI: 4.4-15.9) compared to 5.8 mm/year (95% CI: 3.3-8.3, P = 0.109) in those thereafter. The mean time between dissection and intervention was 1.8 years (95% CI: 0.6-3.0). While type B dissection seems more frequent after previous elective aortic repair (58% vs 42%), there was no difference between valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) compared to Bentall procedures [Hazard ratio (HR) for VSRR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.31-2.0, P-value = 0.61]. The mean age of the entire population at the end of follow-up was 42 years (95% CI: 39.2-44.7). The mean follow-up time was 9 years (95% CI: 7.8-10.4). Stanford type B dissection in patients with MFS occurs far below accepted thresholds for intervention. Risk for type B dissection is present throughout lifetime and two-thirds of patients need an intervention after dissection. There is no difference in freedom from type B dissection between a Bentall procedure and a VSRR."

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypic reprogramming toward a mixed synthetic-proteolytic state is a central feature of aortic root aneurysm in Marfan syndrome (MFS). Previous work identified <i>Klf4</i> as a potential mediator of SMC plasticity in MFS. MFS (<i>Fbn1</i><sup><i>C1041G/+</i></sup>) mouse strains with an inducible vascular SMC fluorescent reporter (<i>MFS</i><sup><i>SMC</i></sup>) with or without SMC-specific deletion of <i>Klf4</i> exons 2 to 3 (<i>MFS</i><sup><i>SMC-Klf4Δ</i></sup>) were generated. Simultaneous SMC tracing and <i>Klf4</i> loss-of-function (<i>Klf4Δ</i> mice) was induced at 6 weeks of age. Aneurysm growth was assessed via serial echocardiography (4-24 weeks). Twenty-four-week-old mice were assessed via histology, RNA in situ hybridization, and aortic single-cell RNA sequencing. MFS mice demonstrated progressive aortic root dilatation compared with control (WT<sup>SMC</sup>) mice regardless of <i>Klf4</i> genotype (<i>P</i><0.001), but there was no difference in aneurysm growth in <i>MFS</i><sup><i>SMC-Klf4Δ</i></sup> versus <i>MFS</i><sup><i>SMC</i></sup> (<i>P</i>=0.884). Efficient SMC <i>Klf4</i> deletion was confirmed via lineage-stratified genotyping, RNA in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. Single-cell RNA sequencing of traced SMCs revealed a highly similar pattern of phenotype modulation marked by loss of contractile markers (eg, <i>Myh11, Cnn1</i>) and heightened expression of matrix genes (eg, <i>Col1a1, Fn1</i>) between <i>Klf4</i> genotypes. Pseudotemporal quantitation of SMC dedifferentiation confirmed that <i>Klf4</i> deletion did not alter the global extent of phenotype modulation, but reduced expression of 23 genes during this phenotype transition in <i>MFS</i><sup><i>SMC-Klf4Δ</i></sup>mice, including multiple chondrogenic genes expressed by only the most severely dedifferentiated SMCs (eg, <i>Cytl1, Tnfrsf11b</i>). <i>Klf4</i> is not required to initiate SMC phenotype modulation in MFS aneurysm but may exert regulatory control over chondrogenic genes expressed in highly dedifferentiated SMCs."

    "abstract": "Background Aortic dissection (AD) during pregnancy and puerperium is a rare catastrophe with devastating consequences for both parent and fetus. Population-level incidence trends and outcomes remain relatively undetermined. Methods and Results We queried a US population-based health care database, the National Inpatient Sample, and identified all patients with a pregnancy-related AD hospitalization from 2002 to 2017. In total, 472 pregnancy-related AD hospitalizations (mean age, 30.9±0.6 years) were identified from 68 514 000 pregnancy-related hospitalizations (0.69 per 100 000 pregnancy-related hospitalizations), with 107 (22.7%) being type A and 365 (77.3%) being type B. The incidence of AD appeared to increase over the 16-year study period but was not statistically significant (<i>P</i> for trend >0.05). Marfan syndrome, primary hypertension, and preeclampsia/eclampsia were found in 21.9%, 14.4%, and 11.5%, respectively. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, Marfan syndrome was associated with the highest risk of developing AD during pregnancy and puerperium (adjusted odds ratio, 3469.36 [95% CI, 1767.84-6831.75]; <i>P</i><0.001). The in-hospital mortalities of AD, type A AD, and type B AD were 7.3%, 4.3%, and 8.1%, respectively. Length of hospital stay for the AD, type A AD, and type B AD groups were 7.7±0.8, 10.4±1.9, and 6.9±0.9 days, respectively. Conclusions We quantified population-level incidence and in-hospital mortality in the United States and observed an increase in the incidence of pregnancy-related AD. In contrast, its in-hospital mortality appears lower than that of non-pregnancy-related AD."

    "abstract": "Hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency (HAE-C1INH) is caused by dysfunctional C1-INH protein due to mutations in the SERPING1 gene encoding C1-INH. Marfan syndrome is a genetic connective tissue disease that affects the cardiovascular and ocular systems along with the skeletal system. In this case, we present the successful treatment of post-pericardiotomy syndrome unresponsive to classical therapy, which has not been described in the literature. The syndrome developed in a patient with hereditary angioedema (HAE) who underwent open heart surgery due to cardiac involvement in Marfan syndrome. A nine-year-old male HAE-C1INH patient underwent open heart surgery secondary to cardiac involvement caused by Marfan syndrome. To prevent HAE attacks, 1000 units of C1 inhibitor concentrate therapy were given 2 hours before and 24 hours after the operation. Post-pericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed on the postoperative second day and ibuprofen 15 mg/kg/day (3 weeks) was started. Since there was no response to classical treatment on the 21st postoperative day, C1 inhibitor concentrate treatment was planned as 1000 units/ dose for 2 days a week considering a prolonged hereditary angioedema attack. In the second week of treatment, complete recovery was achieved for pericardial effusion with a total of 4 doses. We emphasize that in patients with hereditary angioedema undergoing this treatment, care should be taken in terms of complications that may be associated with the disease even if short-term prophylaxis is given before operations and that longer-term use of C1 inhibitor concentrate has a place in treatment."

    "abstract": "Although vaccine hesitancy has been reported in many patient groups and countries, there is a lack of data on vaccine hesitancy in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS). MFS is a rare genetic disorder that can lead to cardiovascular, ocular, and musculoskeletal issues. Because MFS patients may face an increased risk of COVID-19 complications, vaccination is crucial for this population. This brief report aims to describe vaccine hesitancy rates in MFS patients and compare the characteristics of patients who are hesitant and those who are not to gain a better understanding of this specific population. This study analyzes previously published cross-sectional data that examined mental health, sociodemographic, and clinical factors associated with PTSD, depression, anxiety, and insomnia in MFS patients during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Lombardy, Italy. Of the 112 MFS patients who participated, 26 (23.9%) reported vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy may be associated mainly with younger age and not be related to other patient characteristics. Therefore, this report found no differences in individual-level variables, such as sex, education, comorbidities, and mental health symptoms, between those who were hesitant and those who were not. The study findings are insightful and suggest that interventions to address vaccine hesitancy in this population may need to focus on attitudes and beliefs related to vaccination rather than targeting specific sociodemographic or clinical factors."

Adult patients presenting with pathogenic FBN1 mutations and an available pan-aortic contrast-enhanced CTA in eight French MFS clinics from April to October 2018 were included. Clinical and radiological data, particularly the presence of aortic lesions and PNAL (including aneurysm and ectasia), were retrospectively analyzed. Out of 138 patients, 28 (20.3%) had PNAL. In total, 27 aneurysms in 13 patients and 41 ectasias in 19 patients were reported mainly in the subclavian, iliac, and vertebral segments. Four patients (31%) with aneurysms and none with ectasia required prophylactic intervention during follow-up (median: 46 months). In multivariate analysis, factors associated with PNAL were history of AD (OR = 3.9, 95%CI: 1.3-12.1, <i>p</i> = 0.018), history of previous descending aortic surgery (OR = 10.3, 95%CI: 2.2-48.3, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and age (per 10 years OR = 1.6, 95%CI: 1.1-2.4, <i>p</i> = 0.008). PNAL is not rare in MFS patients with evolutive aortic disease. Natural history may differ between aneurysms and ectasia, emphasizing the need for standardized definitions and systematic screening for PNAL."

    "abstract": "Fibrillin-1 microfibrils are essential elements of the extracellular matrix serving as a scaffold for the deposition of elastin and endowing connective tissues with tensile strength and elasticity. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) are linked to Marfan syndrome (MFS), a systemic connective tissue disorder that, besides other heterogeneous symptoms, usually manifests in life-threatening aortic complications. The aortic involvement may be explained by a dysregulation of microfibrillar function and, conceivably, alterations in the microfibrils' supramolecular structure. Here, we present a nanoscale structural characterization of fibrillin-1 microfibrils isolated from two human aortic samples with different FBN1 gene mutations by using atomic force microscopy, and their comparison with microfibrillar assemblies purified from four non-MFS human aortic samples. Fibrillin-1 microfibrils displayed a characteristic \"beads-on-a-string\" appearance. The microfibrillar assemblies were investigated for bead geometry (height, length, and width), interbead region height, and periodicity. MFS fibrillin-1 microfibrils had a slightly higher mean bead height, but the bead length and width, as well as the interbead height, were significantly smaller in the MFS group. The mean periodicity varied around 50-52 nm among samples. The data suggest an overall thinner and presumably more frail structure for the MFS fibrillin-1 microfibrils, which may play a role in the development of MFS-related aortic symptomatology."

Technological advances have revolutionized genetic testing for many ophthalmic disorders, and this study aims to provide insights into the clinical utility of genetic analysis in paediatric ectopia lentis. Children that underwent lens extraction for ectopia lentis between 2013 and 2017 were identified, and gene panel testing findings and surgical outcomes were collected. Overall, 10/11 cases received a probable molecular diagnosis. Genetic variants were identified in four genes: <i>FBN1</i> (associated with Marfan syndrome and cardiovascular complications; <i>n</i> = 6), <i>ADAMTSL4</i> (associated with non-syndromic ectopia lentis; <i>n</i> = 2), <i>LTBP2</i> (<i>n</i> = 1) and <i>ASPH</i> (<i>n</i> = 1). Parents appeared unaffected in 6/11 cases; the initial presentation of all six of these children was to an ophthalmologist, and only 2/6 had <i>FBN1</i> variants. Notably, 4/11 cases required surgery before the age of 4 years, and only one of these children carried an <i>FBN1</i> variant. In summary, in this retrospective cohort study, panel-based genetic testing pointed to a molecular diagnosis in >90% of paediatric ectopia lentis cases requiring surgery. In a subset of study participants, genetic analysis revealed changes in genes that have not been linked to extraocular manifestations and highlighted that extensive systemic investigations were not required in these individuals. We propose the introduction of genetic testing early in the diagnostic pathway in children with ectopia lentis."

SLS cases (n = 135) were recruited from Family Cancer Clinics across Australia and New Zealand. Targeted panel sequencing was performed on tumor (n = 137; 80×CRCs, 33×ECs and 24xSSTs) and matched blood-derived DNA to assess for microsatellite instability status, tumor mutation burden, COSMIC tumor mutational signatures and to identify germline and somatic MMR gene variants. MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC) and MLH1 promoter methylation were repeated. In total, 86.9% of the 137 SLS tumors could be resolved into established subtypes. For 22.6% of these resolved SLS cases, primary MLH1 epimutations (2.2%) as well as previously undetected germline MMR pathogenic variants (1.5%), tumor MLH1 methylation (13.1%) or false positive dMMR IHC (5.8%) results were identified. Double somatic MMR gene mutations were the major cause of dMMR identified across each tumor type (73.9% of resolved cases, 64.2% overall, 70% of CRC, 45.5% of ECs and 70.8% of SSTs). The unresolved SLS tumors (13.1%) comprised tumors with only a single somatic (7.3%) or no somatic (5.8%) MMR gene mutations. A tumor-focused testing approach reclassified 86.9% of SLS into Lynch syndrome, sporadic dMMR or MMR-proficient cases. These findings support the incorporation of tumor sequencing and alternate MLH1 methylation assays into clinical diagnostics to reduce the number of SLS patients and provide more appropriate surveillance and screening recommendations."

We present a case of a 2-year-old Hispanic male who was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) because of poor social interaction, lack of eye contact, and speech delays. Several months after the ASD diagnosis and receiving therapies without improvement, he was unexpectedly found to have severe myopia and bilateral ectopia lentis. These findings prompted further evaluation that subsequently led to a clinical and molecular diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. After correction of his refractive error, his social skills and eye contact had significantly improved and his speech gradually caught up and resolved to a normal level for his age. This report emphasizes the need for comprehensive investigation of children with delays to include ocular assessments before determining ASD in the context of developmental delays."

    "abstract": "Genetic mutations in fibrillin microfibrils cause serious inherited diseases, such as Marfan syndrome and Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS). These diseases typically show major dysregulation of tissue development and growth, particularly in skeletal long bones, but links between the mutations and the diseases are unknown. Here we describe a detailed structural analysis of native fibrillin microfibrils from mammalian tissue by cryogenic electron microscopy. The major bead region showed pseudo eightfold symmetry where the amino and carboxy termini reside. On the basis of this structure, we show that a WMS deletion mutation leads to the induction of a structural rearrangement that blocks interaction with latent TGFβ-binding protein-1 at a remote site. Separate deletion of this binding site resulted in the assembly of shorter fibrillin microfibrils with structural alterations. The integrin α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>-binding site was also mapped onto the microfibril structure. These results establish that in complex extracellular assemblies, such as fibrillin microfibrils, mutations may have long-range structural consequences leading to the disruption of growth factor signaling and the development of disease."

Herein, we examine the mechanism and potential efficacy of integrin αv blockade as a therapeutic strategy to reduce aneurysm progression in MFS. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were differentiated into aortic SMCs of the second heart field (SHF) and neural crest (NC) lineages, enabling in vitro modeling of MFS thoracic aortic aneurysms. The pathological role of integrin αv during aneurysm formation was confirmed by blockade of integrin αv with GLPG0187 in <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1039G/+</sup> MFS mice. iPSC-derived MFS SHF SMCs overexpress integrin αv relative to MFS NC and healthy control SHF cells. Furthermore, integrin αv downstream targets (FAK [focal adhesion kinase]/Akt<sup>Thr308</sup>/mTORC1 [mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1]) were activated, especially in MFS SHF. Treatment of MFS SHF SMCs with GLPG0187 reduced p-FAK/p-Akt<sup>Thr308</sup>/mTORC1 activity back to control SHF levels. Functionally, MFS SHF SMCs had increased proliferation and migration compared to MFS NC SMCs and control SMCs, which normalized with GLPG0187 treatment. In the <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1039G/+</sup> MFS mouse model, integrin αv, p-Akt<sup>Thr308</sup>, and downstream targets of mTORC1 proteins were elevated in the aortic root/ascending segment compared to littermate wild-type control. Mice treated with GLPG0187 (age 6-14 weeks) had reduced aneurysm growth, elastin fragmentation, and reduction of the FAK/Akt<sup>Thr308</sup>/mTORC1 pathway. GLPG0187 treatment reduced the amount and severity of SMC modulation assessed by single-cell RNA sequencing. The integrin αv-FAK-Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> signaling pathway is activated in iPSC SMCs from MFS patients, specifically from the SHF lineage. Mechanistically, this signaling pathway promotes SMC proliferation and migration in vitro. As biological proof of concept, GLPG0187 treatment slowed aneurysm growth and p-Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> signaling in <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1039G/+</sup> mice. Integrin αv blockade via GLPG0187 may be a promising therapeutic approach to inhibit MFS aneurysmal growth."

While beta-blockers are used to slow aortic root dilatation in nonpregnant MFS patients, the benefit of such therapy in pregnant MFS patients remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of beta-blockers on aortic root dilatation during pregnancy in MFS patients. This was a longitudinal single-center retrospective cohort study of females with MFS who completed a pregnancy between 2004 and 2020. Clinical, fetal, and echocardiographic data were compared in patients on- versus off-beta-blockers during pregnancy. A total of 20 pregnancies completed by 19 patients were evaluated. Beta-blocker therapy was initiated or continued in 13 (65%) of the 20 pregnancies.

Using univariate linear regression, maximum systolic blood pressures (SBP), increase in SBP, and absence of beta-blocker use in pregnancy were found to be significantly associated with greater increase in aortic diameter during pregnancy. There were no differences in rates of fetal growth restriction between pregnancies on- versus off-beta-blockers. This is the first study that we are aware of to evaluate changes in aortic dimensions in MFS pregnancies stratified by beta-blocker use.

    "abstract": "The cross-sectional shape of the aortic root is cloverleaf, not circular, raising controversy regarding how best to measure its radiographic \"diameter\" for aortic event prediction. We mathematically extended the law of Laplace to estimate aortic wall stress within this cloverleaf region, simultaneously identifying a new metric of aortic root dimension that can be applied to clinical measurement of the aortic root and sinuses of Valsalva on clinical computerized tomographic scans. Enforcing equilibrium between blood pressure and wall stress, finite element computations were performed to evaluate the mathematical derivation. The resulting Laplace diameter was compared with existing methods of aortic root measurement across four patient groups: non-syndromic aneurysm, bicuspid aortic valve, Marfan syndrome, and non-dilated root patients (total 106 patients, 62 M, 44 F). (1) Wall stress: Mean wall stress at the depth of the sinuses followed this equation: Wall stress = BP × Circumscribing circle diameter/(2 × Aortic wall thickness). Therefore, the diameter of the circle enclosing the root cloverleaf, that is, twice the distance between the center, where the sinus-to-commissure lines coincide, and the depth of the sinuses, may replace diameter in the Laplace relation for a cloverleaf cross-section (or any shaped cross-section with two or more planes of symmetry). This mathematically derived result was verified by computational finite element analyses. (2) Diameters: CT scan measurements showed a significant difference between this new metric, the Laplace diameter, and the sinus-to-commissure, mid-sinus-to-mid-sinus, and coronal measurements in all four groups (p-value < 0.05). The average Laplace diameter measurements differed significantly from the other measurements in all patient groups. Among the various possible measurements within the aortic root, the diameter of the circumscribing circle, enclosing the cloverleaf, represents the diameter most closely related to wall stress. This diameter is larger than the other measurements, indicating an underestimation of wall stress by prior measurements, and otherwise provides an unbiased, convenient, consistent, physics-based measurement for clinical use. \"Diameter\" applies to circles. Our mathematical derivation of an extension of the law of Laplace, from circular to cloverleaf cross-sectional geometries of the aortic root, has implications for measurement of aortic root \"diameter.\" The suggested method is as follows: (1) the \"center\" of the aortic root is identified by drawing three sinus-to-commissure lines. The intersection of these three lines identifies the \"center\" of the cloverleaf. (2) The largest radius from this center point to any of the sinuses is identified as the \"radius\" of the aortic root. (3) This radius is doubled to give the \"diameter\" of the aortic root. We find that this diameter best corresponds to maximal wall stress in the aortic root. Please note that this diameter defines the smallest circle that completely encloses the cloverleaf shape, touching the depths of all three sinuses."

    "abstract": "Background Differences in the clinical course of heritable thoracic aortic disease based on the disease-causing gene have not been fully evaluated. To clarify the clinical relevance of causative genes in heritable thoracic aortic disease, we assessed the clinical course of patients categorized based on genetic diagnosis. Methods and Results We investigated cardiovascular events and mortality in 518 genetically diagnosed patients in 4 groups: Group 1, <i>FBN1</i> (n=344); Group 2, <i>TGFBR1</i>, <i>TGFBR2</i>, <i>SMAD3</i>, or <i>TGFB2</i> (n=74); Group 3, <i>COL3A1</i> (n=60); and Group 4, <i>ACTA2</i> or <i>MYH11</i> (n=40). The median age at the first cardiovascular event ranged from 30.0 to 35.5 years (<i>P</i>=0.36). Patients with gene variants related to transforming growth factor-β signaling had a significantly higher rate of subsequent events than those with <i>FBN1</i> variants (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.33 [95% CI, 1.60-3.38]; <i>P</i><0.001). Regarding the incidence of aortic dissection, there were no significant differences among the 4 groups in male patients (36.3%, 34.3%, 21.4%, and 54.2%, respectively; <i>P</i>=0.06). Female patients with <i>COL3A1</i> variants had a significantly lower incidence than female patients in the other 3 groups (34.2%, 59.0%, 3.1%, and 43.8%, respectively; <i>P</i><0.001). Conclusions Gene variants related to transforming growth factor-β signaling are associated with a higher incidence of subsequent cardiovascular events than <i>FBN1</i> variants. <i>COL3A1</i> variants might be related to a lower incidence of aortic dissection than other gene variants in women only. Identifying the genetic background of patients with heritable thoracic aortic disease is important for determining appropriate treatment."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1). A small portion of them is copy number variations (CNVs), which can occur through recombination-based, replication-based mechanisms or retrotransposition. Not many have been characterized precisely in MFS. A female patient with suspected Marfan syndrome was referred for genetic testing at our institute. After systematic sequencing of FBN1, TGFBR1, and TGFBR2 genes, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was applied. Long-range PCR, subsequent Sanger sequencing with designed primers, and preliminary in silico analysis were applied for the precise characterization of the breakpoints. Primary analysis displayed a de novo large deletion affecting exons 46 and 47 in the FBN1 gene, which resulted in the loss of the 31st and 32<sup>nd</sup> calcium-binding EGFlike domains. Further examination of the breakpoints showed a 4916 nucleotide long deletion localized in intronic regions. Surprisingly a 'TG' dinucleotide insertion was detected at the junction. We hypothesize that the CNV formation was generated by a rare event based on the known microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR). An increasing number of CNVs are associated with Mendelian diseases and other traits. Approximately 2-7% of the cases in MFS are caused by CNVs. Up to date, hardly any model was proposed to demonstrate the formation of these genomic rearrangements in the FBN1 gene. Hereby, with the help of previous models and breakpoint analysis, we presented a potential mechanism (based on MMBIR) in the formation of this large deletion."

    "abstract": "To improve our limited understanding of the pathogenesis of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) that leads to acute aortic dissection, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed to profile disease-relevant transcriptomic changes of aortic cell populations in a well-characterized mouse model of the most commonly diagnosed form of Marfan syndrome (MFS). As result, 2 discrete subpopulations of aortic cells (SMC3 and EC4) were identified only in the aorta of Fbn1mgR/mgR mice. SMC3 cells highly express genes related to extracellular matrix formation and nitric oxide signaling, whereas the EC4 transcriptional profile is enriched in smooth muscle cell (SMC), fibroblast, and immune cell-related genes. Trajectory analysis predicted close phenotypic modulation between SMC3 and EC4, which were therefore analyzed together as a discrete MFS-modulated (MFSmod) subpopulation. In situ hybridization of diagnostic transcripts located MFSmod cells at the intima of Fbn1mgR/mgR aortas. Reference-based data set integration revealed transcriptomic similarity between MFSmod- and SMC-derived cell clusters modulated in human TAA. Consistent with the angiotensin II type I receptor (At1r) contribution to TAA development, MFSmod cells were absent in the aorta of Fbn1mgR/mgR mice treated with the At1r antagonist losartan. Altogether, our findings indicate that a discrete dynamic alteration of aortic cell identity is associated with dissecting TAA in MFS mice and increased risk of aortic dissection in MFS patients."

At autopsy, there was dissection of an aneurysmally-dilated thoracic aorta with 400 mls of fluid and clotted blood in the pericardial sac. There were no features of Marfan syndrome or other connective tissue disorders. Histology revealed thinning of the aortic wall with fragmentation of elastic fibers and no inflammation. Vessels elsewhere were normal. This case demonstrates a rare complication of pregnancy that may not present until after delivery with unexpected collapse and sudden death. Predisposing factors include an increased cardiac output, reduction in systemic vascular resistance, an increase in left ventricular muscle mass, and alterations in serum progesterone and estrogen levels which may cause structural changes to the aortic wall. The possibility of syndromic and familial connective tissue disorders should also be considered."

This study is the first to demonstrate reduced PA and PF in children with HCTD. PF was moderately positively correlated with PA and negatively correlated with pain intensity and fatigue. Reduced cardiovascular endurance, muscle strength, and deconditioning, combined with disorder-specific cardiovascular and musculoskeletal features, are hypothesized to be causal.

Twenty-one eyes of 15 patients (10 males and five females) with a mean age of 24.47 ± 19.14 years were included. Mean best-corrected visual acuity was improved from 1.17 ± 0.55 logMAR to 0.64 ± 0.71 logMAR at the final follow-up visit (<i>P</i> < 0.001). The mean intraocular pressure did not change significantly (<i>P</i> = 0.971).

One eye developed rhegmatogenous retinal detachment 2 months after surgery. Pars plana lensectomy and iris-claw Artisan IOL implantation seem to be a useful, impressive, and safe procedure with a low rate of complications in Marfan patients with moderate-to-severe crystalline lens subluxation. Visual acuity was significantly improved with acceptable anatomical and refractive outcomes."

Although a drug-drug interaction have been reported between FLCZ and warfarin, the effects of the timing of their administration on this interaction have not yet been investigated. A female patient in her 30s with Marfan syndrome had undergone the Bentall procedure with a mechanical valve and total arch replacement for acute aortic dissection Stanford A type and rupture of the ascending aorta. Warfarin was administered to prevent thromboembolism. She was hospitalized 1 year ago for graft infection caused by Candida albicans, and treatment with FLCZ was initiated. She received FLCZ 200 mg once a day in the morning and warfarin 1.75 mg once a day in the evening, and the PT-INR remained stable at approximately 2.0 and within the therapeutic range. However, 42 days after changing the timing of administration of warfarin from evening to morning, the PT-INR was prolonged by approximately 3-fold to 6.25. The PT-INR then decreased to the previous level by changing the timing of administration of warfarin from morning to evening. The timing of administration of FLCZ and warfarin may affect the magnitude of drug-drug interaction."

Real-time PCR and Western blot assay showed that, compared to their wild-type, both mRNAs and proteins of PAX3 and FBN1 mutants reduced in HKE293T cells. Together, our study identified two disease-causing variants in a same Chinese family with WS and MFS, and confirmed their damaged effects on their genes' expression. Therefore, those findings expand the mutation spectrum of PAX3 and provide a new perspective for the potential therapy."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome, caused by mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1, leads to thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs). Phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and ECM (extracellular matrix) remodeling are characteristic of both nonsyndromic and Marfan aneurysms. The ECM protein FN (fibronectin) is elevated in the tunica media of TAAs and amplifies inflammatory signaling in endothelial and SMCs through its main receptor, integrin α5β1. We investigated the role of integrin α5-specific signals in Marfan mice in which the cytoplasmic domain of integrin α5 was replaced with that of integrin α2 (denoted α5/2 chimera). We crossed α5/2 chimeric mice with <i>Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup></i> mice (mgR model of Marfan syndrome) to evaluate the survival rate and pathogenesis of TAAs among wild-type, α5/2, mgR, and α5/2 mgR mice. Further biochemical and microscopic analysis of porcine and mouse aortic SMCs investigated molecular mechanisms by which FN affects SMCs and subsequent development of TAAs. FN was elevated in the thoracic aortas from Marfan patients, in nonsyndromic aneurysms, and in mgR mice. The α5/2 mutation greatly prolonged survival of Marfan mice, with improved elastic fiber integrity, mechanical properties, SMC density, and SMC contractile gene expression. Furthermore, plating of wild-type SMCs on FN decreased contractile gene expression and activated inflammatory pathways whereas α5/2 SMCs were resistant. These effects correlated with increased NF-kB activation in cultured SMCs and mgR aortas, which was alleviated by the α5/2 mutation or NF-kB inhibition. FN-integrin α5 signaling is a significant driver of TAA in the mgR mouse model. This pathway thus warrants further investigation as a therapeutic target."

However, the molecular mechanism underlying MFS remains poorly understood. The study aimed to explore how the L-type calcium channel (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2) modulates disease progression of MFS and to identify a potential effective target for attenuating MFS. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the calcium signaling pathway gene set was significantly enriched. We demonstrated that FBN1 deficiency exhibited inhibition on both the expression of Cav1.2 and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Then, we examined whether FBN1 mediates Cav1.2 via regulating TGF-β1. Higher levels of TGF-β1 were observed in the serum and aortic tissues from patients with MFS. TGF-β1 modulated Cav1.2 expression in a concentration-dependent manner. We evaluated the role of Cav1.2 in MFS by small interfering RNA and Cav1.2 agonist Bay K8644. The effect of Cav1.2 on cell proliferation was dependent on c-Fos activity. These results demonstrated FBN1 deficiency decreased the expression levels of Cav1.2 via regulation of TGF-β1, and downregulation of Cav1.2 inhibited cell proliferation of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) in MFS patients. These findings suggest that Cav1.2 may be an appealing therapeutic target for MFS."

Replication analysis in 510 case and 911 control subjects from five independent Japanese cohorts identified rs2054564, located in intron 7 of ADAMTS17, as a disease-associated SNP with a genome-wide significance threshold (P = 1.17 × 10<sup>-11</sup>, odds ratio = 1.92). This association was significant even after adjustment of age, sex, and body mass index (P = 7.52 × 10<sup>-11</sup>). A replication study in a Korean cohort, including 123 case and 319 control subjects, also verified the significant association of this SNP with severe lumbar spondylosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that fibrillin-1 (FBN1) and ADAMTS17 were co-expressed in the annulus fibrosus of intervertebral discs (IVDs). ADAMTS17 overexpression in MG63 cells promoted extracellular microfibrils biogenesis, suggesting the potential role of ADAMTS17 in IVD function through interaction with fibrillin fibers. Finally, we provided evidence of FBN1 involvement in IVD function by showing that lumbar IVDs in patients with Marfan syndrome, caused by heterozygous FBN1 gene mutation, were significantly more degenerated.

The prevalence of ciliary body thinning was 22.2% in the MFS group vs 0 in the control group (P < .001); eyes with more severe EL had smaller CMA2000 (P = .050), thinner CMT1000 (P = .022), and shorter CBTmax (P = .015). Patients with microspherophakia (MSP) had even smaller CMA2000 (P = .033) and CMT1000 (P = .044) than those without MSP. The most common subluxation direction was in the superonasal quadrant (n = 25; 39.7%), which probably correlates with the thinnest CMT1000 in the inferotemporal quadrant (P = .005). Patients with MFS and EL had thinner ciliary muscles, shorter ciliary processes, and a higher prevalence of ciliary body thinning, especially those with MSP. Both the extent and direction of subluxation were associated with ciliary body biometry.</ABSTRACT>."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a clinically heterogeneous hereditary connective tissue disorder. Severe cardiovascular manifestations (i.e., aortic aneurysm and dissection) are the most life-threatening complications. Most of the cases are caused by mutations, a minor group of which are copy number variations (CNV), in the FBN1 gene. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification test was performed to detect CNVs in 41 MFS patients not carrying disease-causing mutations in FBN1 gene. Moreover, the association was analyzed between the localization of CNVs, the affected regulatory elements and the cardiovascular phenotypes among all cases known from the literature. A large two-exon deletion (exon 46 and 47) was identified in two related patients, which was associated with a mild form of cardiovascular phenotype. Severe cardiovascular symptoms were found significantly more frequent in patients with FBN1 large deletion compared to our patients with intragenic small scale FBN1 mutation. Bioinformatic data analyses of regulatory elements located within the FBN1 gene revealed an association between the deletion of STAT3 transcription factor-binding site and cardiovascular symptoms in five out of 25 patients. Our study demonstrated that large CNVs are often associated with severe cardiovascular manifestations in MFS and the localization of these CNVs affect the phenotype severity."

    "abstract": "Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is a rare and complex genetic disorder associated with increased aortic growth and aortic disease. The effectiveness of cardiovascular medical therapies aiming to slow down aortic growth has been tested in several trials, particularly beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers, however showing conflicting results. We conducted a systematic review on PubMed (Medline), Cochrane library, Google Scholar, and Biomed Central databases between January and February 2022. We selected relevant articles focusing on patients with MFS treated with beta-blockers, angiotensin receptors blockers, or both, and reporting data on the effect of the drugs on 1) slowing down aortic dilatation; 2) the reduction of aortic complication (aortic dissection, mortality, aortic surgery); and with a 3) follow-up length of at least two years. A total of 16 studies were selected. Beta-blockers remain the mainstay of therapy as they have proven to slow aortic enlargement. Angiotensin receptor blockers are a useful alternative and with proven benefit as an add-on therapy to limit aortic growth. Neither beta-blockers, nor angiotensin receptor blockers have shown meaningful results on clinical aortic endpoints. The current evidence of pharmacological treatment for MFS patients is conflicting due to the lack of large, randomized clinical trials with adequate follow-up studies and homogeneous age grouping. Beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers are the only available treatments to reduce aortic growth. A recently published patient-level meta-analysis confirmed that angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers have a similar effect on reducing the rate of increase of the aortic root Z score, used singularly or as add-on therapy. Considering the current evidence on new features related with MFS (such as mitral annular disjunction - MAD) bearing a potential additional increased arrhythmic risk, it is of paramount importance to establish the role of beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers in clinical endpoints of this population as well."

Lung abnormalities are common in MFS, but their pathogenesis is poorly understood. IL11 (interleukin-11) causes aortic disease in a mouse model of MFS and was studied here in the lung. We examined histological and molecular phenotypes in the lungs of <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice (mouse model of Marfan Syndrome [mMFS]), an established mouse model of MFS. To identify IL11-expressing cells, we used immunohistochemistry on lungs of 4- and 16-week-old <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1041G/+</sup>:<i>Il11</i><sup>EGFP/+</sup> reporter mice. We studied the effects of IL11 inhibition by RT-qPCR, immunoblots and histopathology in lungs from genetic or pharmacologic models: (1) 16-week-old IL11 receptor (IL11RA) knockout mMFS mice (<i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1041G/+</sup>:<i>Il11ra1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice) and (2) in mMFS mice administered IgG control or interleukin-11 receptor antibodies twice weekly from 4 to 24 weeks of age. mMFS lungs showed progressive loss and enlargement of distal airspaces associated with increased proinflammatory and profibrotic gene expression as well as matrix metalloproteinases 2, 9, and 12. IL11 was increased in mMFS lungs and localized to smooth muscle and endothelial cells in young mMFS mice in the <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1041G/+</sup>:<i>Il11</i><sup>EGFP/+</sup> reporter strain and in fibroblasts, in older mice. In mMFS mice, genetic (<i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1041G/+</sup>:<i>Il11ra1</i><sup>-/-</sup>) or pharmacologic (anti-interleukin-11 receptor) inhibition of IL11 signaling reduced lung emphysema, fibrosis, and inflammation. This protective effect was associated with reduced pathogenic ERK1/2 signaling and lower metalloproteinase 2, 9, and 12 expression. IL11 causes lung disease in mMFS. This reveals a shared IL11-driven disease mechanism in lung and aorta in MFS and suggests inhibition of IL11 signaling as a holistic approach for treating multiorgan morbidity in MFS."

We present a unique case of aortic root aneurysm and challenging infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a short and angulated neck. We performed simultaneous repair using the Bentall procedure and ascending aortobiiliac bypass. Endovascular obliteration of the AAA neck and bilateral common iliac arteries was also performed. The perioperative process was uneventful. Normal functioning of the mechanical valve and complete thrombosis of the AAA sac were confirmed on follow-up computed tomography and echocardiography. This report suggests that combined ascending aortobiiliac bypass and endovascular obliteration with the Bentall procedure for dual aortic aneurysm is a useful surgical strategy for patients with Marfan syndrome. Life-long follow-up and medication ought to be mandatory to prevent incomplete exclusion and bypass occlusion."

The unresolved SLS tumors (13.1%) comprised tumors with only a single somatic (7.3%) or no somatic (5.8%) MMR gene mutations. A tumor-focused testing approach reclassified 86.9% of SLS into Lynch syndrome, sporadic dMMR or MMR-proficient cases.

A total of 595 AAD patients other than Marfan syndrome receiving TAA surgery since March 2013 to March 2022 were included. Among them, 276 received unilateral cerebral perfusion (via right axillary artery, RCP) and 319 for bilateral cerebral perfusion (BCP). The primary outcome was neurologic injury rate. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, serum inflammation response (high sensitivity C reaction protein, hs-CRP; Interleukin-6, IL-6; cold-inducible RNA binding protein, CIRBP) and neuroprotection (RNA-binding motif 3, RBM3) indexes.

    "title": "Age-dependent phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells in the normal ascending aorta.",
    "abstract": "Ascending aortic aneurysms are associated with pre-existing conditions, including connective tissue disorders (i.e., Marfan syndrome) and bicuspid aortic valves. The underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. Even less is known regarding ascending aortic aneurysms in individuals with normal (i.e., tricuspid) aortic valves (TAV), and without known aneurysm-associated disorders. Regardless of etiology, the risk of aortic complications increases with biological age. Phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is a feature of ascending aortic aneurysms, whereby contractile SMCs are replaced with synthetic SMCs that are capable of degrading the aortic wall. We asked whether age itself causes dysfunctional SMC phenotype modulation, independent of aortic dilatation or pre-existing aneurysm-associated diseases. Non-dilated ascending aortic samples were obtained intra-operatively from 40 patients undergoing aortic valve surgery (range: 20-82 years old, mean: 59.1 ± 15.2). Patients with known genetic diseases or aortic valve malformations were excluded. Tissue was divided, and a portion was formalin-fixed and immunolabeled for alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA), a contractile SMC protein, and markers of synthetic (vimentin) or senescent (p16/p21) SMCs. Another fragment was used for SMC isolation (<i>n</i> = 10). Cultured SMCs were fixed at cell passage 2 and stained for phenotype markers, or were cultured indefinitely to determine replicative capacity. In whole tissue, ASMA decreased (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.47, <i>P</i> < 0.0001), while vimentin increased (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.33, <i>P</i> = 0.02) with age. In cultured SMCs, ASMA decreased (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.35, <i>P</i> = 0.03) and vimentin increased (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.25, <i>P</i> = 0.04) with age. p16 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.34, <i>P</i> = 0.02) and p21 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.29, <i>P</i> = 0.007) also increased with age in SMCs. Furthermore, the replicative capacity of SMCs from older patients was decreased compared to that of younger patients (<i>P</i> = 0.03). By investigating non-dilated aortic samples from individuals with normal TAVs, we found that age itself has a negative impact on SMCs in the ascending aortic wall, whereby SMCs switched from the contractile phenotype to maladaptive synthetic or senescent states with increased age. Therefore, based on our findings, modification of SMC phenotype should be studied as a therapeutic consideration against aneurysms in the future, regardless of etiology."

    "abstract": "An aberrant subclavian artery (ASA) (or lusoria) is the most common congenital anomaly of the aortic arch (0.5%-2.2%; female-to-male ratio 2:1 to 3:1). ASA can become aneurysmal and result in dissection, involving Kommerell's diverticulum when present and the aorta. Data of its significance in genetic arteriopathies are not available. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and complications of ASA in gene-positive and -negative nonatherosclerotic arteriopathies. The series includes 1,418 consecutive patients with gene-positive (n = 854) and gene-negative arteriopathies (n = 564) diagnosed as part of institutional work-up for nonatherosclerotic syndromic and nonsyndromic arteriopathies. Comprehensive evaluation includes genetic counseling, next-generation sequencing multigene testing, cardiovascular and multidisciplinary assessment, and whole-body computed tomography angiography. ASA was found in 34 of 1,418 cases (2.4%), with a similar prevalence in gene-positive (n = 21 of 854, 2.5%) and gene-negative (n = 13 of 564, 2.3%) arteriopathies. Of the former 21 patients, 14 had Marfan syndrome, 5 had Loeys-Dietz syndrome, 1 had type-IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and 1 had periventricular heterotopia type 1. ASA did not segregate with genetic defects. Dissection occurred in 5 of 21 patients with genetic arteriopathies (23.8%; 2 Marfan syndrome and 3 Loeys-Dietz syndrome), all with associated Kommerell's diverticulum. No dissections occurred in gene-negative patients. At baseline, none of the 5 patients with ASA dissection fulfilled criteria for elective repair according to guidelines. The risk of complications of ASA is higher in patients with genetic arteriopathies and is difficult to predict. In these diseases, imaging of the supra-aortic trunks should enter baseline investigations. Determination of precise indications for repair can prevent unexpected acute events such as those described."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection and rupture (collectively termed \"sudden aortic death\") are commonly encountered by forensic pathologists, with an estimated incidence at autopsy between 0.6% and 7.7%. Despite this, there is no standard of practice for the evaluation of sudden aortic death at autopsy.Recent studies have shown 20% of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection (TAAD) have an identifiable genetic syndrome, and 19% will have an affected first-degree relative. The past 2 decades have seen identification of new culprit genes and syndromes, which can have subtle or nonexistent external phenotypes. A high index of suspicion is warranted to identify possible hereditary TAAD (H-TAAD), allowing family members to obtain screening to avoid catastrophic vascular events. Forensic pathologists need broad knowledge of the spectrum of H-TAAD and awareness of the relative significance of hypertension, pregnancy, substance use, and microscopic changes of aortic architecture.This article reviews the common subtypes of H-TAAD, including Marfan syndrome, vascular Ehlers-Danlos, Loeys-Dietz, and familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection. Recommendations for the evaluation of sudden aortic death at autopsy are presented, including (1) performance of a complete autopsy, (2) documentation of aortic circumference and valve morphology, (3) notifying family of the need for screening, and (4) preservation of a sample for potential genetic testing."

    "abstract": "Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common condition affecting 2-3% of the general population, and the most complex form of valve pathology, with a complication rate up to 10-15% per year in advanced stages. Complications include mitral regurgitation which can lead to heart failure and atrial fibrillation, but also life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia and cardiovascular death. Sudden death has been recently brought to the forefront of MVP disease, increasing the complexity of management and suggesting that MVP condition is not properly understood. MVP can occur as part of syndromic conditions such as Marfan syndrome, but the most common form is non-syndromic, isolated or familial. Although a specific X-linked form of MVP was initially identified, autosomal dominant inheritance appears to be the primary mode of transmission. MVP can be stratified into myxomatous degeneration (Barlow), fibroelastic deficiency, and Filamin A-related MVP. While FED is still considered a degenerative disease associated with aging, myxomatous MVP and FlnA-MVP are recognized as familial pathologies. Deciphering genetic defects associated to MVP is still a work in progress; although <i>FLNA</i>, <i>DCHS1</i>, and <i>DZIP1</i> have been identified as causative genes in myxomatous forms of MVP thanks to familial approaches, they explain only a small proportion of MVP. In addition, genome-wide association studies have revealed the important role of common variants in the development of MVP, in agreement with the high prevalence of this condition in the population. Furthermore, a potential genetic link between MVP and ventricular arrhythmia or a specific type of cardiomyopathy is considered. Animal models that allow to advance in the genetic and pathophysiological knowledge of MVP, and in particular those that can be easily manipulated to express a genetic defect identified in humans are detailed. Corroborated by genetic data and animal models, the main pathophysiological pathways of MVP are briefly addressed. Finally, genetic counseling is considered in the context of MVP."

    "abstract": "Arterial aneurysms are life-threatening but usually asymptomatic before requiring hospitalization. Oculomics of retinal vascular features (RVFs) extracted from retinal fundus images can reflect systemic vascular properties and therefore were hypothesized to provide valuable information on detecting the risk of aneurysms. By integrating oculomics with genomics, this study aimed to (i) identify predictive RVFs as imaging biomarkers for aneurysms and (ii) evaluate the value of these RVFs in supporting early detection of aneurysms in the context of predictive, preventive and personalized medicine (PPPM). This study involved 51,597 UK Biobank participants who had retinal images available to extract oculomics of RVFs. Phenome-wide association analyses (PheWASs) were conducted to identify RVFs associated with the genetic risks of the main types of aneurysms, including abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), thoracic aneurysm (TAA), intracranial aneurysm (ICA) and Marfan syndrome (MFS). An aneurysm-RVF model was then developed to predict future aneurysms. The performance of the model was assessed in both derivation and validation cohorts and was compared with other models employing clinical risk factors. An RVF risk score was derived from our aneurysm-RVF model to identify patients with an increased risk of aneurysms. PheWAS identified a total of 32 RVFs that were significantly associated with the genetic risks of aneurysms. Of these, the number of vessels in the optic disc ('ntreeA') was associated with both AAA (<i>β</i> = -0.36, <i>P</i> = 6.75e-10) and ICA (<i>β</i> = -0.11, <i>P</i> = 5.51e-06). In addition, the mean angles between each artery branch ('curveangle_mean_a') were commonly associated with 4 MFS genes (<i>FBN1</i>: <i>β</i> = -0.10, <i>P</i> = 1.63e-12; <i>COL16A1</i>: <i>β</i> = -0.07, <i>P</i> = 3.14e-09; <i>LOC105373592</i>: <i>β</i> = -0.06, <i>P</i> = 1.89e-05; <i>C8orf81/LOC441376</i>: <i>β</i> = 0.07, <i>P</i> = 1.02e-05). The developed aneurysm-RVF model showed good discrimination ability in predicting the risks of aneurysms. In the derivation cohort, the <i>C</i>-index of the aneurysm-RVF model was 0.809 [95% CI: 0.780-0.838], which was similar to the clinical risk model (0.806 [0.778-0.834]) but higher than the baseline model (0.739 [0.733-0.746]). Similar performance was observed in the validation cohort, with a <i>C</i>-index of 0.798 (0.727-0.869) for the aneurysm-RVF model, 0.795 (0.718-0.871) for the clinical risk model and 0.719 (0.620-0.816) for the baseline model. An aneurysm risk score was derived from the aneurysm-RVF model for each study participant. The individuals in the upper tertile of the aneurysm risk score had a significantly higher risk of aneurysm compared to those in the lower tertile (hazard ratio = 17.8 [6.5-48.8], <i>P</i> = 1.02e-05). We identified a significant association between certain RVFs and the risk of aneurysms and revealed the impressive capability of using RVFs to predict the future risk of aneurysms by a PPPM approach. Our finds have great potential to support not only the predictive diagnosis of aneurysms but also a preventive and more personalized screening plan which may benefit both patients and the healthcare system.

RT-PCR and bulk RNA sequencing of RNA harvested from fibroblasts explanted from the affected proband revealed an insertion of a pseudoexon between exons 13 and 14 of the FBN1 transcript, predicted to lead to nonsense mediated decay (NMD). Treating the fibroblasts with an NMD inhibitor, cycloheximide, greatly improved the detection of the pseudoexon-containing transcript. Family members with the FBN1 variant had later onset aortic events and fewer MFS systemic features than typical for individuals with haploinsufficiency of FBN1. Variable penetrance of the phenotype and negative genetic testing in MFS families should raise the possibility of deep intronic FBN1 variants and the need for additional molecular studies."

Both patient groups showed a thinner intima (<i>p</i> < 0.0005), a lower expression of contractile VSMCs (<i>p</i> < 0.05), more elastic fiber thinning (<i>p</i> < 0.001), lack of inflammation (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and a decreased progerin expression (<i>p</i> < 0.05) as compared to the TAV. Other features of cardiovascular ageing differed between the BAV and MFS. Dilated BAV patients demonstrated less medial degeneration (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), VSMC nuclei loss (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), apoptosis of the vessel wall (<i>p</i> < 0.03), and elastic fiber fragmentation and disorganization (<i>p</i> < 0.001), as compared to the MFS and dilated TAV. This study showed important similarities in the pathogenesis of thoracic aortic aneurysms in BAV and MFS. These common mechanisms can be further investigated to personalize treatment strategies in non-syndromic and syndromic conditions."

    "title": "The Role of Genetic Testing in Patients with Heritable Thoracic Aortic Diseases.",
    "abstract": "Heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD) is a term used to define a large group of disorders characterized by the occurrence of aortic events, mainly represented by aneurysm or dissection. These events generally involve the ascending aorta, although the involvement of other districts of the aorta or peripheral vessels may occur. HTAD can be classified as non-syndromic if the disorder is limited to the aorta, and syndromic when associated with extra-aortic features. About 20-25% of patients with non-syndromic HTAD exhibit a family history of aortic disease. Thus, a careful clinical evaluation of the proband and the first-degree family members is required to differentiate familial and sporadic cases. Genetic testing is essential since it allows confirmation of the etiological diagnosis of HTAD (particularly in patients with a significant family history) and may guide family screening. In addition, genetic diagnosis significantly impacts patients' management since the different conditions significantly differ with respect to natural history and treatment strategies. The prognosis in all HTADs is determined by the progressive dilation of the aorta, potentially leading to acute aortic events, such as dissection or rupture. Moreover, the prognosis varies according to the underlying genetic mutations. This review aims to describe the clinical characteristics and natural history of the most common HTADs, with particular emphasis on the role of genetic testing in risk stratification and management."

    "abstract": "Fluoroquinolone use can be associated with an increased risk of aortic aneurysm (AA) or aortic dissection (AD). The US Food and Drug Administration recently warned against fluoroquinolone use for high-risk patients, such as those with Marfan syndrome. However, the association between fluoroquinolone use and AA/AD risk was unknown in these high-risk patients and therefore it was studied in this work. Data were collected from a national database between 2000 and 2017 for 550 patients with AA/AD and any congenital aortic disease (mean age 41.5 years; 415 with Marfan syndrome). A case cross-over study was conducted to compare the risk of aortic events (AA/AD) associated with fluoroquinolone and amoxicillin use between the hazard period (from -60 days to -1 day) and a randomly selected reference period (-180 to -121 days; -240 to -181 days; and -300 to -241 days). Compared to the reference period without fluoroquinolone use, fluoroquinolone use during the hazard period was not associated with a greater risk of AA/AD (1.09% vs. 1.09%; odds ratio [OR] 1.000; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32-3.10), AA (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.11-3.99), or AD (OR 1.33; 95% CI 0.30-5.96) in patients with congenital aortic disease or Marfan syndrome. This lack of association was maintained in subgroup analysis, including Marfan syndrome or not, age (≤50 vs. >50 years) and sex. Fluoroquinolone use was not associated with an increased risk of AA/AD in patients with congenital aortic disease, including Marfan syndrome. More evidence is required for a fluoroquinolone pharmacovigilance plan in these patients."

    "abstract": "The proper functioning of any protein depends on its three dimensional conformation which is achieved by the accurate folding mechanism. Keeping away from the exposed stress conditions leads to cooperative unfolding and sometimes partial folding, forming the structures like protofibrils, fibrils, aggregates, oligomers, etc. leading to several neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, Cystic fibrosis, Huntington, Marfan syndrome, and also cancers in some cases, too. Hydration of proteins is necessary, which may be achieved by the presence of organic solutes called osmolytes within the cell. Osmolytes belong to different classes in different organisms and play their role by preferential exclusion of osmolytes and preferential hydration of water molecules and achieves the osmotic balance in the cell otherwise it may cause problems like cellular infection, cell shrinkage leading to apoptosis and cell swelling which is also the major injury to the cell. Osmolyte interacts with protein, nucleic acids, intrinsically disordered proteins by non-covalent forces. Stabilizing osmolytes increases the Gibbs free energy of the unfolded protein and decreases that of folded protein and vice versa with denaturants (urea and guanidinium hydrochloride). The efficacy of each osmolyte with the protein is determined by the calculation of m value which reflects its efficiency with protein. Hence osmolytes can be therapeutically considered and used in drugs."

In this review, we will discuss the current knowledge about the involvement of structural genomic variants and, in particular, copy number variants in the development of thoracic aortic and aortic valve disease. There is a growing interest in the identification of structural variants in aortopathy. Copy number variants identified in thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections, bicuspid aortic valve related aortopathy, Williams-Beuren syndrome and Turner syndrome are discussed in detail. Most recently, the first inversion disrupting FBN1 has been reported as a cause for Marfan syndrome. During the past 15 years, the knowledge on the role of copy number variants as a cause for aortopathy has grown significantly, which is partially due to the development of novel technologies including next-generation sequencing. Although copy number variants are now often investigated on a routine basis in diagnostic laboratories, more complex structural variants such as inversions, which require the use of whole genome sequencing, are still relatively new to the field of thoracic aortic and aortic valve disease."

Between January 2000 and August 2019, 96 patients with mean age 64 years (range, 49.5-71 years) (62.5% (<i>n</i>=60) male) underwent elective descending aortic replacement due to aneurysm (<i>n</i>=60) or chronic dissection (<i>n</i>=36). Marfan syndrome was present in 12 patients (12.5%). In-hospital mortality rate was 3.1% (<i>n</i>= 3. 2 in the aneurysm group, 1 in the dissection group). New-onset renal insufficiency postoperatively with (creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dl) manifested in 10 patients (10.8%). One patient (1%) suffered from stroke, and paraplegia developed in 1 pts (1%). The median follow-up time was 7 years (IQR: 2.5-13 years). The 5- and 10-year survival rates were 70.8% and 50.7% respectively. We did not observe any early or late prosthetic graft infection. The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis identified age (HR: 1.044, 95% CI: 1.009-1.080, <i>p</i>-value: 0.014), diabetes (HR: 2.544, 95% CI: 1.009-6.413, <i>p</i>-value: 0.048), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR: 2.259, 95% CI: 1.044-4.890, <i>p</i>-value: 0.039) as risk factors for late mortality. This study showed that the elective open surgical replacement of the descending aorta can be achieved with excellent outcomes in terms of perioperative mortality and morbidity.

Consecutive retrospective case series. Eyes were evaluated that had modified capsular tension ring and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. The rate of AL growth (RALG) was calculated using AL divided by log10-transformed age. A multivariate linear regression model of RALG was developed after validation. 128 patients with MFS and EL were enrolled with a median follow-up duration of about 3 years. RALG was independent of age between 3 years and 15 years old ( P = .799) and decreased to 0 thereafter ( P = .878). Preoperative AL was associated with RALG in patients under 15 years old ( P = .003). Beta values for the final model of RALG were as below: intercept (-9.794) and preoperative AL (0.664). The postoperative AL was predicted as: postAL = preAL + RALG × log 10 ([postAge + 0.6]/[preAge + 0.6]). The mean prediction error was -0.003 (95% CI, -0.386 to 0.3791) mm and the mean absolute percentage error was 1.93% (95% CI, 0.73% to 3.14%). A Python-based calculator was developed to use the predicted AL in selecting IOL power and setting undercorrection. The AL growth of patients with MFS followed a logarithmic pattern and ceased at about age 15. A prediction model of postoperative AL was established for individual MFS patients between 3 and 15 years old, which could potentially optimize the IOL power selection."

From January 1980 to January 2020, 214 patients with CTD and 645 without CTD underwent primary, elective aortic valve reimplantation operations at Cleveland Clinic. The CTD cohort included 164 (77%) with Marfan, 23 (11%) with Loeys-Dietz, and 7 (3.3%) with Ehlers-Danlos CTD. We accounted for differing patient characteristics between the groups by propensity score matching to compare outcomes, yielding 96 matched pairs. Longitudinal echocardiographic measures were compared using nonlinear mixed effects models. In the CTD cohort, there were no operative mortalities (30-day or in-hospital), 1 (0.47%) stroke, and 1 (0.47%) early in-hospital reoperation for valve dysfunction. Ten-year prevalence of no aortic regurgitation was 86%, mild 11%, and moderate 3%. Ten-year freedom from reoperation was 97%. In propensity matched cohorts, there were no significant differences in in-hospital outcomes, longitudinal aortic regurgitation and mean gradient, risk of reoperation on the aortic valve, or risk of late death. Aortic valve reimplantation is a durable operation in patients with CTD and root aneurysms. These patients do not experience early degeneration of their reimplanted aortic valves."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe genotype-phenotype associations and novel insights into genetic characteristics in a trio-based cohort of inherited eye diseases (IEDs). To determine the etiological role of de novo mutations (DNMs) and genetic profile in IEDs, we retrospectively reviewed a large cohort of proband-parent trios of Chinese origin. The patients underwent a detailed examination and was clinically diagnosed by an ophthalmologist. Panel-based targeted exome sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from blood samples, containing coding regions of 792 IED-causative genes and their flanking exons. All participants underwent genetic testing. All proband-parent trios were divided into 22 subgroups, the overall diagnostic yield was 48.67% (605/1243), ranging from 4% to 94.44% for each of the subgroups. A total of 108 IED-causative genes were identified, with the top 24 genes explaining 67% of the 605 genetically solved trios. The genetic etiology of 6.76% (84/1243) of the trio was attributed to disease-causative DNMs, and the top 3 subgroups with the highest incidence of DNM were aniridia (n = 40%), Marfan syndrome/ectopia lentis (n = 38.78%), and retinoblastoma (n = 37.04%). The top 10 genes have a diagnostic yield of DNM greater than 3.5% in their subgroups, including PAX6 (40.00%), FBN1 (38.78%), RB1 (37.04%), CRX (10.34%), CHM (9.09%), WFS1 (8.00%), RP1L1 (5.88%), RS1 (5.26%), PCDH15 (4.00%), and ABCA4 (3.51%). Additionally, the incidence of DNM in offspring showed a trend of correlation with paternal age at reproduction, but not statistically significant with paternal (P = 0.154) and maternal (P = 0.959) age at reproduction. Trios-based genetic analysis has high accuracy and validity. Our study helps to quantify the burden of the full spectrum IED caused by each gene, offers novel potential for elucidating etiology, and plays a crucial role in genetic counseling and patient management."

Patients with Marfan syndrome, a bicuspid aortic valve or a thoracic aortic aneurysm have an increased risk to develop a TAAD. These predisposing conditions are characterized by a histologically thin intimal layer and hardly any atherosclerosis. Little is known about the susceptibility for atherosclerosis in patients with a type A aortic dissection. We aim to systematically describe atherosclerotic lesions in TAAD patients. A total of 51 patients with a TAAD (mean age 62.5 ± 10.8 years, 49% females) and 17 control patients (mean age 63 ± 5.5 years, 53% females) were included in this study. Cardiovascular risk factors were assessed clinically. All sections were stained with Movat pentachrome and hematoxylin eosin. Plaque morphology was classified according to the modified AHA classification scheme proposed by Virmani et al. In the TAAD group thirty-seven percent were overweight (BMI > 25). Diabetes and peripheral arterial disease were not present in any of the patients. Fifty-nine percent of the patients had a history of hypertension. The intima in TAAD patients was significantly thinner as compared to the control group (mean thickness 143 ± 126.5 μm versus 193 ± 132 μm, <i>p</i> < 0.023). Seven TAAD patients had a normal intima without any form of adaptive or pathological thickening. Twenty-three TAAD patients demonstrated adaptive intimal thickening.

In the control group the majority of the patients exhibited progressive atherosclerotic lesions: three pathologic intimal thickening, two early fibroatheroma, six late fibroatheroma, one healed rupture and two fibrotic calcified plaque. This study shows that TAAD patients hardly exhibit any form of progressive atherosclerosis. The majority of TAAD patients showcase non-progressive intimal lesions, whereas the control group mostly demonstrated progressive intimal atherosclerotic lesions.

The fibrillin-1 protein encoded by the FBN1 gene is an essential component of the lens zonules. Mutations in FBN1 are the leading causes of congenital EL and Marfan syndrome. Owing to the complexity and individual heterogeneity of FBN1 gene mutations, the correlation between FBN1 mutation characteristics and various clinical phenotypes remains unclear. This study describes the clinical characteristics and identifies possible causative genes in eight families with Marfan syndrome or isolated EL using Sanger and whole-exome sequencing. Eight FBN1 mutations were identified in these families, of which three (c.5065G > C, c.1600 T > A, and c.2210G > C) are reported for the first time. Based on in silico analyses, we hypothesized that these mutations may be pathogenic by affecting the fibrillin-1 protein structure and function. These findings expand the number of known mutations involved in EL and provide a reference for the research on their genotype and phenotype associations."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a rare connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in FBN1. Patients with MFS notably suffer from aortic aneurysm and dissection. Despite considerable effort, animal models have proven to be poorly predictive for therapeutic intervention in human aortic disease. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells can be differentiated into vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and recapitulate major features of MFS. We have screened 1,022 small molecules in our in vitro model, exploiting the highly proteolytic nature of MFS VSMCs, and identified 36 effective compounds. Further analysis identified GSK3β as a recurring target in the compound screen. GSK3β inhibition/knockdown did not ameliorate the proliferation defect in MFS-VSMCs but improved MFS-VSMC proteolysis and apoptosis and partially rescued fibrillin-1 deposition. To conclude, we have identified GSK3β as a novel target for MFS, forming the foundation for future work in MFS and other aortic diseases."

    "title": "Outcomes for Treatment of Capsulolabral Adhesions With a Capsular Spacer During Revision Hip Arthroscopy.",
    "abstract": "The presence of adhesions is a common source of pain and dysfunction after hip arthroscopic surgery and an indication for revision surgery. The placement of a capsular spacer in the capsulolabral recess after lysis of adhesions has been developed to treat and prevent the recurrence of adhesions. To evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and survivorship at a minimum of 2 years after revision hip arthroscopic surgery with capsular spacer placement for capsular adhesions. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Between January 2013 and June 2018, a total of 95 patients (99 hips) aged ≥18 years underwent revision hip arthroscopic surgery for the treatment of capsular adhesions with the placement of a capsular spacer. Overall, 53 patients (56 hips) met the inclusion criteria and had a minimum 2-year follow-up, forming the cohort of this study. Exclusion criteria included confounding metabolic bone diseases (eg, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, Marfan syndrome), labral deficiency, or advanced osteoarthritis (Tönnis grade 2 or 3). Preoperative and postoperative outcome scores (modified Harris Hip Score [mHHS], Hip Outcome Score-Activities of Daily Living [HOS-ADL], Hip Outcome Score-Sport-Specific Subscale [HOS-SSS], 12-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-12], and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC]) were collected and compared in addition to the revision rate, conversion to total hip arthroplasty, and patient satisfaction. The mean age of the cohort was 32 ± 11 years, with 32 female hips (57%) and a median number of previous hip arthroscopic procedures of 1 (range, 1-5). The arthroplasty- and revision-free survivorship rate at 2 years was 91%. Overall, 5 patients (6 hips; 11%) underwent revision surgery at a mean of 2.4 ± 1.4 years after capsular spacer placement, with symptomatic capsular defects being the most common finding. There were 4 patients (7%) who converted to total hip arthroplasty. For hips not requiring subsequent surgery (n = 46), there was a significant improvement in outcome scores except for the SF-12 Mental Component Summary, with rates of achieving the minimal clinically important difference of 70%, 70%, and 65% for the mHHS, HOS-ADL, and HOS-SSS, respectively. Capsular spacers, as part of a systematic approach including lysis of adhesions with early and consistent postoperative physical therapy including circumduction exercises, resulted in improved PROs as well as high arthroplasty- and revision-free survivorship (91%) at a minimum 2-year follow-up. Capsular spacers should be considered in revision hip arthroscopic procedures when an adequate labral volume remains but adhesions continue to be a concern."

    "abstract": "Homocystinuria (HCU) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder usually diagnosed in childhood. It is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme that converts homocysteine to cystathionine. The accumulation of homocysteine leads to abnormalities in the ocular, skeletal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems. HCU shares several clinical features with Marfan syndrome; however, respiratory system involvement in HCU is uncommon and rarely reported. Bronchiectasis has been previously reported in a few cases of HCU, and it was attributed mainly to fibrillin deficiency. This case describes a young girl diagnosed with classical HCU since childhood who presented with a chronic productive cough and was initially misdiagnosed as bronchial Asthma. However, upon further evaluation, she was eventually diagnosed with tracheobronchomegaly (TBM), or Mounier-Kuhn Syndrome, and bronchiectasis based on the computed tomography (CT) scan of chest findings. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of TBM and bronchiectasis in HCU. We believe that fibrillin degeneration may be the key to understanding this unusual association in HCU."

We performed a propensity score (PS)-matched comparison of PEARS and VSRR for syndromic root aneurysm. Patients in the PEARS 200 Database and Aortic Valve Insufficiency and ascending aorta Aneurysm InternATiOnal Registry (undergoing VSRR) with connective tissue disease operated electively for root aneurysm <60 mm with aortic regurgitation (AR) <1/4 were included. Using a PS analysis, 80 patients in each cohort were matched. Survival, freedom from reintervention and from AR ≥2/4 were estimated using a Kaplan-Meier analysis. Median follow-up was 25 and 55 months for 159 PEARS and 142 VSRR patients. Seven (4.4%) patients undergoing PEARS required an intervention for coronary injury or impingement, resulting in one death (0.6%). After VSRR, there were no early deaths, 10 (7%) reinterventions for bleeding and 1 coronary intervention. Survival for matched cohorts at 5 years was similar (PEARS 98% vs VSRR 99%, p=0.99). There was no difference in freedom from valve or ascending aortic/arch reintervention between matched groups. Freedom from AR ≥2/4 at 5 years in the matched cohorts was 97% for PEARS vs 92% for VSRR (p=0.55). There were no type A dissections. VSRR and PEARS offer favourable mid-term survival, freedom from reintervention and preservation of valve function. Both treatments deserve their place in the surgical repertoire, depending on a patient's disease stage. This study is limited by its retrospective nature and different follow-ups in both cohorts."

    "title": "Fibrillin-1 and asprosin, novel players in metabolic syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Fibrillin-1 is a major component of the extracellular microfibrils, where it interacts with other extracellular matrix proteins to provide elasticity to connective tissues, and regulates the bioavailability of TGFβ family members. A peptide consisting of the C-terminal 140 amino acids of fibrillin-1 has recently been identified as a glucogenic hormone, secreted from adipose tissue during fasting and targeting the liver to release glucose. This fragment, called asprosin, also signals in the hypothalamus to stimulate appetite. Asprosin levels are correlated with many of the pathologies indicative of metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance and obesity. Previous studies and reviews have addressed the therapeutic potential of asprosin as a target in obesity, diabetes and related conditions without considering mechanisms underlying the relationship between generation of asprosin and expression of the much larger fibrillin-1 protein. Profibrillin-1 undergoes obligatory cleavage at the cell surface as part of its assembly into microfibrils, producing the asprosin peptide as well as mature fibrillin-1. Patterns of FBN1 mRNA expression are inconsistent with the necessity for regulated release of asprosin. The asprosin peptide may be protected from degradation in adipose tissue. We present evidence for an alternative possibility, that asprosin mRNA is generated independently from an internal promoter within the 3' end of the FBN1 gene, which would allow for regulation independent of fibrillin-synthesis and is more economical of cellular resources. The discovery of asprosin opened exciting possibilities for treatment of metabolic syndrome related conditions, but there is much to be understood before such therapies could be introduced into the clinic."

    "abstract": "Identification of ocular manifestations in patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) can have a large impact on the outcome and treatment of pediatric patients. Due to the common co-incidence of ocular manifestations and SNHL in children, both ophthalmologic and hearing loss screening and routine examinations must be conducted to minimize adverse outcomes and worsening of pathology. Early evaluation and diagnosis is imperative for intervention and further development of the patient. Co-incidence requires a thorough evaluation that includes a comprehensive history, examination, and diagnostic testing. In this article, a literature review was conducted to analyze the presentations of various diseases and syndromes, such as Alport Syndrome, Waardenburg Syndrome, Norrie Disease, Usher Disease, Stickler Syndrome, Marfan Syndrome, Congenital Rubella, and Hereditary Optic Neuropathies. We divided the various ocular pathologies into anterior and posterior segment presentations and associated systemic findings for better understanding. Additionally, this review aims to include an update on the management of patients with both ocular and hearing loss manifestations."

    "abstract": "Recent reports suggest that self-reported snoring, which is a feature of obstructive sleep apnea, is associated with aortic enlargement in Marfan syndrome (MFS). Objective assessment of snoring although lacking, could provide a rational for OSA screening in MFS patients. Our goal in this study was to examine the association between objective measurements of snoring with OSA and aortic size in persons with MFS. Consecutive persons with MFS who reported snoring were recruited at Johns Hopkins, completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and underwent overnight polysomnography during which inspiratory sound was captured. We measured breath-by-breath peak decibel levels and snoring was defined as flow limitation with sound ≥ 40 dB(A). OSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea-index (AHI) ≥ 15 or AHI: 5-15 and ESS > 10. Participants' aortic data were collated to ascertain aortic root diameter. Regression models were used to determine the relationship of snoring breath% with OSA and aortic root diameter. In our cohort (M|F:13|16, Age: 37.0 ± 15.5 years, Aortic diameter; 38.9 ± 4.8 mm), a 1-unit increase in snoring breath percentage increased the odds of having OSA by 5% in both the unadjusted (OR = 1.05, <i>p</i> = 0.040) model, and a model adjusted for age and sex (OR = 1.05, <i>p</i> = 0.048). Similarly, a 10-unit increase in snoring breath percentage was associated with a 1 mm increase in contemporaneous aortic-root-diameter in both unadjusted (<i>β</i> = 0.09, <i>p</i> = 0.007), and adjusted (<i>β</i> = 0.08, <i>p</i> = 0.023) models. Objective snoring assessment could provide a means for identifying persons with MFS who need sleep studies, who may also be at risk for more severe aortic disease."

    "abstract": "In approximately 20% of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms or dissections a heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD) is suspected. Several monogenic connective tissue diseases imply high risk of aortic disease, including both non-syndromic and syndromic forms. There are some studies assessing inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling in patients with non-hereditary aortic disease, but such studies in patients with hereditary diseases are scarce. To quantify markers of extracellular matrix (ECM) and inflammation in patients with vascular connective tissue diseases versus healthy controls. Patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS, <i>n</i> = 12), Marfan syndrome (MFS, <i>n</i> = 11), and familial thoracic aortic aneurysm 6 (FTAA6, <i>n</i> = 9), i.e., actin alpha 2 (ACTA2) pathogenic variants, were recruited. Exome or genome sequencing was performed for genetic diagnosis. Several markers of inflammation and ECM remodeling were measured in plasma by enzyme immunoassays. Flow cytometry of T-cell subpopulations was performed on a subgroup of patients. For comparison, blood samples were drawn from 14 healthy controls. (i) All groups of HTAD patients had increased levels matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) as compared with healthy controls, also in adjusted analyses, reflecting altered ECM remodeling. (ii) LDS patients had increased levels of pentraxin 3 (PTX3), reflecting systemic inflammation. (iii) LDS patients have increased levels of soluble CD25, a marker of T-cell activation. Our data suggest that upregulated MMP-9, a matrix degrading enzyme, is a common feature of several subgroups of HTAD. In addition, LDS patients have increased levels of PTX3 reflecting systemic and in particular vascular inflammation."

    "abstract": "Aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection can have a major impact on the life expectancy of Marfan syndrome (MFS) or Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) patients. Although obesity can influence the development of aortic complications, evidence on whether obesity influences the development of aortic aneurysm or dissection in MFS and LDS is limited. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between aortic size and body composition, assessed by modern bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in MFS/LDS-patients. In this exploratory cross-sectional study in MFS or LDS patients, enrolled between June 2020 and May 2022, 34 patients received modern BIA and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n=32) or computed tomography (CT) imaging (n=2) of the entire aorta. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. Fifty-one patients (66% female; mean age: 37.7±11.7; range, 17-68 years) with MFS or LDS were enrolled; 34 patients, 27 with MFS and 7 with LDS, underwent aortic MRI or CT scanning. The mean aortic length was 503.7±58.7 mm, and the mean thoracic aortic length and abdominal aortic length were 351.5±52.4 and 152.2±27.4 mm, respectively. The aortic bulb and the ascending aorta were measured only in the non-surgically repaired patients. Fifteen MFS (88.2%) and two LDS (40.0%) patients had an aortic aneurysm. In these, the aortic bulb tended to be larger in MFS than in LDS patients [42.6×41.9×41.2 <i>vs.</i> 37.8×37.4×36.8 mm; P=0.07 (-1.1; 9.1); P=0.07 (-1.2; 8.4); P=0.07 (-1.5; 7.9)]. BIA revealed mean body fat levels of 31.6%±8.7% (range, 9.5-53.5%), indicating that 18 patients (52.9%) were obese. There was a significant correlation between body fat content and thoracic aortic length (R=-0.377; P=0.02), muscle mass and total aortic length (R=0.359; P=0.03), thoracic aortic length (R=0.399; P=0.02), extracellular mass (ECM), and total aortic length (R=0.354; P=0.04), and connective tissue and aortic diameters at the aortic arch (R=0.511; P=0.002), aortic isthmus (R=0.565; P<0.001), and abdominal aorta (R=0.486; P=0.004). Older age was correlated with wider aortic arch, isthmus, and abdominal aorta. Male patients had a longer aorta. While a slender habitus is commonly known for MFS and LDS patients, our data show that many MFS and LDS patients (especially female) do not fit this phenotypic characteristic and are obese, which is associated with a more severe aortic phenotype. This topic should be included in the clinical assessment of affected MFS and LDS patients, in addition to measurement of the aortic diameters. Physicians should systematically screen MFS and LDS patients for obesity, educate them about the potential risk of resulting aortic complications, and encourage them to adopt a healthy lifestyle, that includes (mild) exercise and a balanced diet."

    "abstract": "Collagen, the most abundant human protein, is a significant component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in tissues and organs like skin, bone, ligaments, and tendons. Collagen secretion is a complex, multistage process involving many molecules. A protein playing one of the main functions in this process is TANGO1 encoded by MIA3 gene. In the hypermobile type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), one of the most common collagenopathies with no known genetic background, disrupted secretion of many molecules (including collagen) was observed. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the MIA3 gene role in hEDS patients. One hundred patients with clinically diagnosed hEDS and negative next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing for connective tissue disorder (e.g. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, osteogenesis imperfect (OI), Marfan syndrome, and others) were tested for molecular changes in the MIA3 gene. Among the 100 tested patients, 14 single structural changes in the MIA3 gene were detected. Thirteen were missense benign or likely benign, while 1 variant (c.567dup, p.Leu1880ThrfsTer6) was truncating the TANGO1 protein. We suppose that the presence of truncating variant (c.5637dup) in the MIA3 gene and disrupted secretion of connective tissue protein may be one of the pathogenic mechanisms of clinical symptoms present in the tested patient, but these findings require a more comprehensive multidimensional investigation."

This study was designed to analyze our center's experience with open surgical thoracoabdominal aortic replacement in Marfan patients. This was a retrospective study with prospective follow-up. Between January 1995 and September 2021, a total of 648 patients underwent thoracoabdominal aortic replacement at our center. Of these, 60 had Marfan syndrome and were included in this study. The mean age was 39.5 ± 10.7 years, and 36 (60%) were male. Ten (17%) had aortic aneurysm, 4 (7%) acute/subacute dissection, and 46 (77%) chronic dissection. Patients presented with the following extent of aortic disease according to the Crawford classification: I-17 (28%), II-18 (30%), III-22 (37%), IV-2 (3%), and V-1 (2%). The mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 173.9 ± 84.7 minutes. Four (7%) patients required stent graft extraction. Postoperatively, 5 (8%) patients required rethoracotomy and 6 (10%) tracheostomy. One (1.7%) patient had permanent paraplegia and 2 (3%) permanent paraparesis. Two (3%) patients had stroke. One (1.7%) patient was discharged with dialysis. The 30-day mortality was 3% (n = 2). Median follow-up time was 21.5 (range, 9.4-33.6) years. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rate was 87%, 80%, and 68%, respectively. There were 16 aortic reinterventions in 9 patients during follow-up. Thoracoabdominal aortic replacement remains a complex procedure but can be done extremely safely in Marfan patients. Perioperative mortality rates are very low, and the long-term outcomes are enduring. Because endovascular aortic repair is not recommended for patients with connective tissue disease, open surgery remains an important cornerstone of therapy."

Medical records of 54 eyes (30 patients) of the pediatric age group with systemic comorbidities who had undergone cataract surgery in a tertiary-care center were reviewed. The following parameters were recorded: systemic comorbidity; toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, HIV (TORCH) profile, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), strabismus, nystagmus, and cataract morphology. Thirty patients with a mean age of 55 months (9 months-14 years) were included. On average, every child was seen by three physicians, and the mean duration between the first visit to a physician and presentation to our center was 2.23 ± 0.67 years. The various causes for delay in referral include multiple referrals due to a lack of general anesthesia services in 78% of cases, a long waiting list at the referral hospital in 35% of cases, and a lack of awareness at the primary-care physician level in 50% of cases. The mean BSCVA at presentation was 1.4 logMAR (0.3 to 3 logMAR). The most common cataract morphology was that of zonular cataract (31.48%; 17/54). Strabismus and abnormal eye movements were observed in 27.7% (15/54) and 33.3% (18/54) of eyes, respectively. Various systemic associations were periventricular leukomalacia (12/30), Down's syndrome (6/30), seizure disorder (6/30), cardiac valvular anomalies (6/30), Marfan's syndrome (4/30), hypothyroidism (4/30), rubella (3/20), cytomegalovirus (3/20), cerebral palsy (2/30), nephrotic syndrome (2/30), Type 1 diabetes mellitus (1/30), microcephaly (1/30), cryptogenic West syndrome (1/30), congenital rubella syndrome (1/30), and Tourette syndrome (1/30). The mean postoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) at 2-year follow-up improved to 1.0 logMAR (0 to 3 logMAR). No postoperative complications were reported at the final follow-up. Around 70% of the parents reported improvement in their child's psychomotor skills. Intellectually impaired pediatric patients with cataract should be operated upon whenever there is a presence of infrastructure, and unnecessary delay in surgery should be avoided by referring the patient to higher centers. Even though objective improvement in visual acuity was suboptimal, there was definitely an improvement in the psychomotor skills of the patients."

Aortic reimplantation is the most used technique to spare the valve, allowing simultaneously aortic root replacement and aortic annular stabilization. The reimplantation into a graft with sinuses guarantees an optimal anatomic and functional reconstruction with established good results at 15 years. The aim of this study is to report the world longest follow-up (up to 20 years) of aortic valve reimplantation using the Valsalva graft. From February 2000 to December 2021, 265 consecutive patients with aortic root aneurysm received aortic valve reimplantation using the Valsalva graft. From 2018, leaflet plication with the routine use of calliper was performed. For each patient, we performed both intraoperative and post-procedural transoesophageal echocardiography. All patients were followed with clinical assessment and echocardiography. The mean duration of follow-up was 85 ± 63 months. The study cohort had a median age of 55 ± 18 and 87.2% were male. The aortic root aneurysm was associated to bicuspid aortic valve in 18.9% of patients and to Marfan syndrome in 10.6% of cases. 55.9% had an aortic regurgitation ≥ 2+. Overall survival at 15 was 87.6 ± 3.4. Freedom from cardiac death was stable at 99.6 ± 0.4 at 5, 10 and 15 years. Freedom from recurrent AR ≥3+ and freedom from reoperation remained stable at 10 and 15 years at 92.2 ± 2.1 and 95.9 ± 1.6, respectively. There was a minimal incidence of infective endocarditis (0.8%), thromboembolism (2.2%) and haemorrhage (2.0%). Six out of 7 patients requiring reoperation had surgery in the first period of our experience (last in 2004). Early suboptimal results had a negative effect on residual aortic regurgitation. Moreover, we hypothesized that the routine use of calliper may have contributed to a further improvement of the outcome, even if these data need to be confirmed by a longer follow-up. The first long-term follow-up after aortic valve reimplantation using the Valsalva graft demonstrated excellent results. These long-term results gradually improved with learning curve, remaining stable during the second decade of observation. The systematic use of calliper may have contributed to a further improvement of the outcome."

This modified EC phenotype was most prominent in the ascending aorta and occurred before aortic dilatation. To reverse EC morphology, we performed treatment with resveratrol. This restored EC blood flow alignment, junctional linearity, phospho-eNOS expression, and improved the structural integrity of the internal elastic lamina of Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice. In conclusion, these experiments identify the involvement of ECs and underlying internal elastic lamina in MFS aortic pathology, which could act as potential target for future MFS pharmacotherapies."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the characteristics and associated factors of choroidal thickness (ChT) and choriocapillaris flow deficit percentage (CC FD%) in children with Marfan syndrome (MFS). This is a cross-sectional study. The ChT of the subfoveal area and other areas 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 mm away from the fovea were assessed. The CC FD% of quadrant and circular regions with diameters of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mm were assessed with 3×3 mm macular choriocapillaris images. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and cardiac function factor such as Z score were measured to analyse the associations with ChT and CC FD%. 51 MFS children and 50 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Compared with the healthy controls, the ChT in the MFS group was thinner in the subfoveal area, temporal 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mm (all p<0.001). The CC FD% was higher in circle 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mm (all p<0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that CC FD% in the circle 2.5 mm when the Z score ≥2 was associated with BCVA (<i>β</i>=9.08 (95% CI 3.96 to 14.20); p=0.005) and Z score (<i>β</i>=4.19 (95% CI 1.28 to 12.00); p=0.012). Thinner ChT and a higher CC FD% were observed in children with MFS, and an increased CC FD% in circle 2.5 mm was significantly associated with worse BCVA and cardiac function. These findings may help identify future visual impairment and early cardiac events in MFS children."

    "abstract": "Low basal nitric oxide (NO) production is associated with a dysfunctional endothelium and vascular diseases. We have shown that some angiotensin II (AngII) receptor type 1 (AT1R) blockers (ARBs), a group of clinic-approved blood pressure (BP)-lowering medications, are also capable of activating endothelial function acutely and chronically, both ex vivo and in vivo, in pleiotropic, AngII-independent fashions, which suggested that endothelial function enhancement with ARBs may be independent of their well-documented BP lowering properties. Herein, we attempt to identify the most potent ARB at activating endothelial function when administered at sub-BP-lowering doses and determine its anti-aortic root remodeling properties in a model of Marfan syndrome (MFS). Amongst the 8 clinically available ARBs tested, only telmisartan and azilsartan induced significant (70% and 49%, respectively) NO-dependent inhibition of aortic contractility when administered for 4 weeks at sub-BP lowering, EC<sub>5</sub> doses. Low-dose telmisartan (0.47 mg/kg) attenuated MFS-associated aortic root widening, medial thickening, and elastic fiber fragmentation to the same degree as high-dose telmisartan (10 mg/kg) despite wide differences in BP lowering between the two doses. Our study suggests that telmisartan is the most potent ARB at promoting increased endothelial function at low sub-BP doses and that it retained major aortic root widening inhibition activities. ARBs may enhance endothelial function independently from BP-lowering pathways, which could lead to new therapeutic approaches."

    "title": "Combined Bentall and Modified Ravitch Procedures: A Case Report and Systematic Review of the Evidence.",
    "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Marfan syndrome (MS) is a genetic disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance that affects the connective tissue and consequently many organ systems. The cardiovascular manifestations of MS are notorious and include aortic root dilatation or acute aortic dissection, which can cause morbidity and early mortality. However, surgical treatment of aortic pathology may be complicated by musculoskeletal deformity of the chest wall, as in pectus excavatum. In this regard, single-stage combined Bentall and Ravitch surgery is an extreme rarity that has also been scarcely reported in the literature. <i>Patients and Methods</i>: We present the medical history and single-stage Bentall and modified Ravitch surgical treatment of an 18-year-old male MS patient with symptomatic and severe pectus excavatum (PEX) in conjunction with a pear-shaped aortic root aneurysm. To discuss our case in the context of a synopsis of similar published cases, we present a systematic review of combined Bentall surgical aortic aneurysm repair and Ravitch correction of PEX. <i>Results</i>: A total of four studies (one case series and three case reports) and a case from our institution describing a single-stage combined Bentall and Ravitch operation were included. Patients were 22 ± 5.9 years of age (median = 22.5 years) and predominantly male (60%). All cases reported a midline vertical skin incision over the sternum. The most common surgical approach was midsternotomy (80%). In all cases metal struts were used to reinforce the corrected chest wall. Postoperative mortality was zero. <i>Conclusions</i>: Single-stage combined Bentall and Ravitch surgery is an underutilized surgical approach. Its use in MS patients with concomitant PEX and ascending aortic aneurysm that require surgical treatment warrants further investigation. Midsternotomy seems to be a viable access route that provides sufficient exposure in the single-stage surgical setting. Although operative time is long, the intraoperative and postoperative risks appear to be low and manageable."

We searched the Stanford Research Repository tool to identify patients with the diagnosis of high myopia who were seen by a single provider at Byers Eye Institute at Stanford from January 2019 to March 2022. We performed a chart review and included eyes that had high myopia and ocular biometric measurements at any time point after January 2019. We divided our cohort into 5 different groups: (1) isolated high myopia (IHM) (control group); (2) retinopathy of prematurity (ROP); (3) familial exudative vitreoretinopathy; (4) Marfan syndrome; and (5) Stickler syndrome. Biometric measurements. A total of 246 patients (432 eyes) were included as follows: 202 patients (359 eyes) in the IHM group, 17 patients (27 eyes) in the ROP group, 7 patients (12 eyes) in the familial exudative vitreoretinopathy group, 8 patients (14 eyes) in the Marfan group, and 12 patients (20 eyes) in the Stickler group. The ROP group showed significantly shorter axial lengths, shallower anterior chambers, and thicker lenses compared with the IHM group. The Marfan group showed significantly flatter corneas and thicker lenses compared with the IHM group. The Stickler group showed significantly longer axial lengths compared with the IHM group. High myopia is associated with variable biometric measurements according to underlying ocular or genetic conditions. Retinopathy of prematurity-associated high myopia is primarily lenticular, while Stickler syndrome-associated high myopia is axial. Marfan syndrome-associated high myopia is derived from both axial and lenticular mechanisms."

    "abstract": "The primary aim was to gain insight into the growth of the aortic root in children and young adults with Marfan syndrome (MFS). Furthermore, we aimed to identify a clinical profile of patients with MFS who require an aortic root replacement at a young age with specific interest in age, sex, height and fibrillin-1 (<i>FBN1</i>) genotype. Aortic root dimensions of 97 patients with MFS between 0 year and 20 years and 30 controls were serially assessed with echocardiography. Trends were analysed using a linear mixed-effect model. Additionally, including only patients with MFS, we allowed trends to differ by sex, aortic root replacement and type of <i>FBN1</i> mutation. Average aortic root dilatation in patients with MFS became more pronounced after the age of 8 years. In the MFS cohort, male patients had a significantly greater aortic root diameter than female patients, which was in close relationship with patient height. There was no difference in aortic root growth between children with dominant negative (DN) or haploinsufficient <i>FBN1</i> mutations. However, DN-<i>FBN1</i> variants resulting in loss of cysteine content were associated with a more severe phenotype. Eleven children needed an aortic root replacement. Compared with patients with MFS without aortic root surgery, these children had a significantly larger aortic root diameter from an early age. This study provides clinically useful longitudinal growth charts on aortic root growth in children and young adults with MFS. Children requiring prophylactic aortic root replacement during childhood can be identified at a young age. Our growth charts can help clinicians in decision making with regard to follow-up and prophylactic therapy. Loss of cysteine content in the <i>FBN1</i> protein was associated with larger aortic root dimensions."

However, unlike Marfan, retinal detachment (RD) is rarely reported, and screening protocols do not currently feature ophthalmic assessment or RD counseling. We report a 5-generation family affected by LDS, where RD occurred in six eyes of four individuals. The proband was an 84-year-old male recently diagnosed with type-V LDS (TGFβ3 pathogenic variant c.899G>A, p.(Arg300Gln)). Further investigation was undertaken into the family's medical history. The proband experienced bilateral rhegmatogenous RD at age 60, requiring emergency surgical repair. Other notable ophthalmic features include unusual keratometry, abnormal biometry, and severe hayfever requiring long-term sodium cromoglycate treatment. The proband's sister, father, and uncle had also experienced RDs, all prior to LDS diagnosis. This series demonstrates that RD risk may be significant in LDS, and on occasion the presenting clinical feature. We suggest ophthalmic examination should be added to the initial assessment LDS patients, and patients informed of the early warning symptoms of retinal detachment. As in Marfan syndrome, LDS patients may exhibit cornea plana and abnormal corneal topography, producing atypical biometry. They may also present with allergic conjunctivitis, and awareness of these signs might facilitate earlier diagnosis."

Descriptive observational design with cross-sectional data collection procedure. A single Italian MFS-specific specialised and reference centre in Lombardy (Italy) between February and April 2021. 112 adults with MFS. The majority of participants were female (n=64; 57.1%), with a high school diploma (n=52; 46.4%) and active workers (n=66; 58.9%). The mean age was 41.89 years (SD=14.00), and the mean time from diagnosis was 15.18 years (SD=11.91). Descriptive statistics described PTSD, which was the primary outcome, as well as depression, anxiety and insomnia, which were the secondary outcomes. Four linear regression models described the predictors of PTSD total score and its three domains: avoidance, intrusion and hyperarousal. One out of 10 patients with MFS had mild psychological symptoms regarding depression, anxiety and insomnia, and scores of PTSD that indicated clinical worries about the mental health status. The presence of PTSD was mainly predicted by anxiety (β=0.647; p<0.001), being older, taking psychoactive medication and being unemployed. Depression, anxiety and insomnia should be monitored in patients with MFS in order to minimise PTSD insurgence. Specific psychosocial interventions should be developed and tested for this population and adopted in clinical practice, given the relevance of mental health outcomes during the pandemic."

Athletes with ASHR > 1.05 had higher ARD (2.99 cm) than athletes with ASHR ≤ 1.05 (2.85 cm). Weak correlations were noted between ASHR, ARD, and SBP. Multivariate analysis showed that BSA, male sex, and participation in swimming were predictors of ARD. ASHR was not predictive of ARD in regression analysis. These findings showed a tendency towards higher ARD in athletes with ASHR >1.05 but this observation was not statistically significant in multivariate analysis."

    "abstract": "Heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD) are rare pathologies associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissection, which can be syndromic or non-syndromic. They may result from genetic defects. Associated genes identified to date are classified into those encoding components of the (a) extracellular matrix (b) TGFβ pathway and (c) smooth muscle contractile mechanism. Timely diagnosis allows for prompt aortic surveillance and prophylactic surgery, hence improving life expectancy and reducing maternal complications as well as providing reassurance to family members when a diagnosis is ruled out. This document is an expert opinion reflecting strategies put forward by medical experts and patient representatives involved in the HTAD Rare Disease Working Group of VASCERN. It aims to provide a patient pathway that improves patient care by diminishing time to diagnosis, facilitating the establishment of a correct diagnosis using molecular genetics when possible, excluding the diagnosis in unaffected persons through appropriate family screening and avoiding overuse of resources. It is being recommended that patients are referred to an expert centre for further evaluation if they meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) thoracic aortic dissection (<70 years if hypertensive; all ages if non-hypertensive), (2) thoracic aortic aneurysm (all adults with Z score >3.5 or 2.5-3.5 if non-hypertensive or hypertensive and <60 years; all children with Z score >3), (3) family history of HTAD with/without a pathogenic variant in a gene linked to HTAD, (4) ectopia lentis without other obvious explanation and (5) a systemic score of >5 in adults and >3 in children. Aortic imaging primarily relies on transthoracic echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography as needed. Genetic testing should be considered in those with a high suspicion of underlying genetic aortopathy. Though panels vary among centers, for patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection or systemic features these should include genes with a definitive or strong association to HTAD. Genetic cascade screening and serial aortic imaging should be considered for family screening and follow-up. In conclusion, the implementation of these strategies should help standardise the diagnostic work-up and follow-up of patients with suspected HTAD and the screening of their relatives."

    "abstract": "This article describes the author's experience using Swanson Care Theory in the provision of nursing care to a 20-year-old man, an exchange student from Hong Kong, following his initial diagnosis with Marfan's syndrome. This patient required emergency aortic root replacement surgery due to type A aortic dissection. Immediately after learning of his illness, the patient was faced with making a major surgical decision. The absence of relatives and friends close by to assist him made him unable to decide whether to agree to the operation. Because of the importance of evaluating the physical and mental needs of the case, which would affect his prognosis, the author conducted a four-facet physical, psychological, social, and spiritual assessment of the patient from April 13-18, 2020. The results confirmed the presence of significant health problems, including \"body image disturbance\" and \"anxiety\". The author applied the five processes of Swanson's caring theory in caring for this patient. The process of \"Knowing\" and \"Being with\" helped, through active companionship and care, establish a trusting relationship, elucidate the client's inner thoughts on the disease, evaluate the client's needs, and accept the negative emotions. The process of \"Doing for\" and \"Enabling\" were employed to serve as a bridge for family communication to help both parties achieve consensus and to encourage effective problem-facing, provide timely assistance, promote self-adjustment, and reduce psychological shock, unease, and anxiety. Health education was implemented to increase the patient's disease and postoperative-care knowledge and promote self-care abilities to facilitate his acceptance of the current situation and active participation in treatment. Finally, the process of \"Maintaining belief\" was used to elicit positive feedback through actual situations. Patients with conditions similar to this patient were introduced to share their experiences and provide empathy to provide our patient with the motivation necessary to maintain positive progress. Based on this experience, it is recommended that critical caregivers strengthen their caring ability to improve their quality of care. This experience is may be referenced by clinical workers."

    "abstract": "Background Stiffer aortas are associated with a faster rate of aortic root (AoR) dilation and higher risk of aortic dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome. We have previously shown that mild aerobic exercise reduces aortic stiffness and rate of AoR dilation in a Marfan mouse model. In this study, we investigated if these results could be translated to pediatric patients with Marfan syndrome. Methods and Results We enrolled 24 patients with Marfan syndrome aged 8 to 19 years to participate in a 6-month physical activity intervention, excluding those with ventricular dysfunction or prior history of aortic surgery. We instructed patients to take 10 000 steps per day, tracked by an activity tracker. At baseline and 6 months, we measured AoR dimension, arterial stiffness, endothelial function, physical activity indices, inflammatory biomarkers, and coping scores. Controls consisted of 15 age-matched patients with Marfan syndrome. Twenty-four patients with Marfan syndrome (median age, 14.4 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 12.2-16.8], 14 male patients) were enrolled. Baseline assessment demonstrated that the majority of these patients were sedentary and had abnormal arterial health. Twenty-two patients completed the intervention and took an average of 7709±2177 steps per day (median, 7627 [IQR, 6344-9671]). Patients wore their Garmin trackers at a median of 92.8% (IQR, 84%-97%) of their intervention days. AoR <i>Z</i> score in the intervention group had a significantly lower rate of change per year compared with the controls (rate of change, -0.24 versus +0.008; <i>P</i>=0.01). Conclusions In this clinical intervention in pediatric patients with Marfan syndrome, we demonstrated that a simple physical activity intervention was feasible in this population and has the potential to decrease the AoR dilation rate.

Temporary postoperative ocular hypertension was reported in 3 patients (7.9%) (3 eyes), and 2 patients (5.4%) (2 eyes) developed persistent ocular hypertension. There were no cases of postoperative retinal detachment. The main reason for EL was MFS. Surgery improved visual acuity, and postoperative ocular hypertension was the most common complication, whereas retinal detachment was not observed."

Herein, we report a case of a 25-year-old female diagnosed with ATAAD accompanied by undeveloped secondary sexual characteristics. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed that her AD involved the ascending and abdominal aorta. She had undergone thoracic endovascular aortic stent graft implantation in a local hospital due to acute Stanford type B aortic dissection at age 19. No uterus or ovaries were found on CTA and transabdominal ultrasonography. Sex hormone detection revealed a low estrogen level. G-banded karyotyping analyses revealed a normal 46,XX karyotype. Finally, her abnormalities in the reproductive system were diagnosed as MRKH syndrome and 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) in the patient found an SNP variant of <i>ACTA2</i> c.773G>A and <i>MYH11</i> c.5081A>G. <i>MYH11</i> c.5081A>G was also found in her mother and younger brother.

The reverse transcription analysis of <i>FBN1</i> revealed that the intron 43 sequence from positions c.5297-1516 to c.5297-1 was retained at the coding sequence as a consequence of the c.5225-3C>G variant enhancing a cryptic splice acceptor site (c.5297-1518_5297-1517AG) in intron 43. The retained sequence of the part of intron 43 caused the same effect as insertion mutation (NM_000138.5:c.5297_c.5298ins5297-1516_5297-1), resulting in a frameshift mutation resulting in p.Ile1767Trpfs*3. The patient underwent an urgent modified Bentall operation with a 29 mm mechanical valve for annuloaortic ectasia and severe aortic valve regurgitation. This report emphasizes the need for functional investigations into the diagnostic workflows of certain diseases or gene panels with suspected high rates of intronic variants and potential pathogenic effects. Hence, further descriptions of individuals with intronic variants causing alternative splicing expected to have pathogenic effects at different transcript levels are crucial for improving our understanding."

    "title": "Outcomes of Iris-Claw IOL Implantation in Patients with Marfan's Syndrome in Jordan.",
    "abstract": "The management of ocular complications of Marfan's syndrome, especially ectopia lentis, is challenging. In this study, we present the effectiveness and the safety of iris-claw intraocular lens (IOL) implantation along with lensectomy for those patients. Also, we compare the practice of implanting these IOLs either in the anterior chamber of retropupillary. Retrospectively, we included all patients with Marfan's syndrome who underwent lensectomy with iris-claw IOL implantation as a result of ectopia lentis. The patients were categorized into two groups: anterior chamber iris claw IOL and retropupillary iris-claw IOL. The clinical and demographic data, the visual outcome and postoperative complications were compared. Eighteen eyes of 10 patients were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 19.1 years. Six patients were males. The iris-claw IOL was implanted anteriorly in 13 eyes. The visual outcome was comparable between both groups and most patients achieved improvement in the visual acuity. In addition, the postoperative complications developed similarly in both groups. However, all cases of IOL disenclavation (6 cases) developed in the anterior group. It is revealed that the age of the patient was the most significant factor affecting the occurrence of IOL disenclavation. Iris-claw IOL (either anteriorly or retropupillary) is an effective and relatively safe method in treating ectopia lentis in patients with Marfan's syndrome. In younger patients, anterior iris-claw IOL is safer than retropupillary iris-claw IOL as the risk of disenclavation is higher in younger patients."

    "abstract": "Many genetic testing methodologies are biased towards picking up structural variants (SVs) that alter copy number. Copy-neutral rearrangements such as inversions are therefore likely to suffer from underascertainment. In this study, manual review prompted by a virtual multidisciplinary team meeting and subsequent bioinformatic prioritisation of data from the 100K Genomes Project was performed across 43 genes linked to well-characterised skeletal disorders. Ten individuals from three independent families were found to harbour diagnostic inversions. In two families, inverted segments of 1.2/14.8 Mb unequivocally disrupted <i>GLI3</i> and segregated with skeletal features consistent with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome. For one family, phenotypic blending was due to the opposing breakpoint lying ~45 kb from <i>HOXA13</i> In the third family, long suspected to have Marfan syndrome, a 2.0 Mb inversion disrupting <i>FBN1</i> was identified. These findings resolved lengthy diagnostic odysseys of 9-20 years and highlight the importance of direct interaction between clinicians and data-analysts. These exemplars of a rare mutational class inform future SV prioritisation strategies within the NHS Genomic Medicine Service and similar genome sequencing initiatives. In over 30 years since these two disease-gene associations were identified, large inversions have yet to be described and so our results extend the mutational spectra linked to these conditions."

We report a case of a patient with Marfan syndrome who underwent the David operation and mitral annuloplasty.

    "title": "Ravitch Surgery or Dynamic Compression Bracing for Pectus Carinatum: A Retrospective Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "Pectus carinatum is a pediatric condition that can be treated by dynamic compression system (DCS) bracing or surgery. Several publications on DCS bracing or surgery are available; however, they do not compare both treatments. Over a 10-year period, 738 patients with pectus carinatum were treated at the Amsterdam Pectus Center (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). This study describes this 10-year experience and the results of both treatments. Of the 631 patients who underwent DCS bracing treatment, 553 finished treatment, and 78 patients are still under treatment. A total of 73.8% (n = 408) of these patients finished treatment successfully, 13.6% (n = 75) experienced treatment failure, and 12.7% (n = 70) were lost to follow-up. The success rate decreased with an increasing pressure of initial compression (84.2%-67.3%). Marfan syndrome and Poland syndrome were associated with unfavorable results. Ravitch surgery was performed in 105 patients, with a success rate of 92.4%. Complications occurred in 32.4% of patients, and 6.7% of patients had complications for which surgery was needed. No relationship was found between osteotomy or sternal fixation and outcomes or complications. The Abramson procedure was performed in 2 patients. DCS bracing should be the treatment of choice in patients with pectus carinatum because of its noninvasiveness, good results, and lower complication rate compared with surgery. Besides pressure of initial correction, motivation is an important factor influencing outcomes, and compliance remains a major challenge in treating pectus carinatum using DCS bracing. Bracing patients before their growth spurt should be discouraged. Patients with a higher pressure of initial compression (>8.0-8.5 psi) and Marfan syndrome or Poland syndrome have poorer outcomes. In those patients, surgery may be considered."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder involving multiple organs. The most severe complications include aortic root dilatation and dissection. In the present report, we provide an uncommon case of acute aortic Stanford type A dissection (AADA) repair with severe scoliosis in an MFS patient and it is even more rare for such surgical treatment to be successfully completed along with holistic management that enables the patient to recover successfully. We offer a reference for future surgical therapy since the specific surgical treatment methods in this case have not been reported in the literature. A 40-year-old Chinese female with MFS was rushed to our surgical clinic due to the sudden onset of intense chest pain. Physical examination revealed a diastolic murmur at the aortic valve area, increased arm and pectus carinatum deformity, severe scoliosis, acromicria, arachnodactyly, and planovalgus foot. Subsequently, AADA was discovered through computed tomography scan. In addition, echocardiogram revealed moderate aortic regurgitation and hydropericardium in small amount. Based on revised Ghent criteria, the patient was diagnosed with MFS complicated with aortic dissection. Emergency surgery was successfully performed for repair of the patient's aortic dissection and the diseased aortic valve. Postoperatively, the patient presented with a degree of respiratory insufficiency. However, the respiratory function was not greatly impaired, with good early intervention, such as taking deep breaths and coughing fully, active sputum suction, effective analgesia, ambulation and treadmill exercise. The patient finally recovered completely and was discharged 3 weeks later. We reported on a patient with severe scoliosis who successfully underwent surgical repair of AADA. Our report shows that the application of standard median sternotomy for repairing AADA offers the feasibility of implementation, on the basis of effectively solving various practical problems in the surgery brought about by scoliosis. It has been thoroughly assessed and addressed how the postoperative condition of such patients affects subsequent respiratory function and postoperative recovery. This report further provides a successful clinical reference for the implementation of this type of surgery and the postoperative management of respiratory function."

Additionally, we aimed to investigate the effect of FBN1 variant type (haploinsufficiency [HI]/dominant negative [DN]) on growth, and compare MFS-related height increase across populations. Height and weight data of individuals with MFS aged 0-21 years were retrospectively collected. Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) was used for growth chart modeling. To investigate genotype-phenotype relationships, FBN1 variant type was included as an independent variable in height-for-age and BMI-for-age models. MFS-related height increase was compared with that of previous MFS growth studies from the United States, Korea, and France. Height and weight data of 389 individuals with MFS were included (210 males). Height-for-age, BMI-for-age, and weight-for-height charts reflected the tall and slender MFS habitus throughout childhood. Mean increase in height of individuals with MFS compared with the general Dutch population was significantly lower than in the other three MFS populations compared to their reference populations. FBN1-HI variants were associated with taller height in both sexes, and decreased BMI in females (p-values <0.05). This Dutch MFS growth study broadens the notion that genetic background and MFS variant type (HI/DN) influence tall and slender stature in MFS."

    "abstract": "Beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) administration is a chemically induced model for preclinical aortic pathologies research. Angiotensin II (AngII) has been widely used to promotes aortic dissections in mice. Here, we provide insight on a modified aortic dissection model in rats. The effect of smooth muscle cell (SMC) relaxation with vasodilators is studied in this model. Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided in 4 groups: control, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN, 30 mg/kg/day) in the drinking water, BAPN (0.02%) in the food, BAPN + ISDN (same doses). Thoracic and abdominal aortic diameters were evaluated through transthoracic ultrasound echography. After 6 weeks, all rats were infused with AngII (1 mg/kg/day) subcutaneously. Survival and type of aortic events were numbered. Histological and histochemical analyses of aorta were performed. Initial telesystolic ascending aorta diameters were equal in all groups and became significantly larger in the BAPN + ISDN group compared to the BAPN group (control: 3.37 ± 0.17 mm, ISDN: 3.49 ± 0.16 mm, BAPN: 3.53 ± 0.13 mm, BAPN + ISDN: 3.61 ± 0.16 mm, analysis of variance p < 0.0001). BAPN followed by AngII infusion showed a significant lower survival rate (p = 0.029) and produced a large panel of aortic events. Association of ISDN and BAPN significantly reduces survival (p = 0.001) and provides more aortic events compared to BAPN alone (p = 0.031). In both BAPN-treated groups, orcein staining revealed split and dissected elastic fibers in the media, alcian blue staining showed mucoid degeneration of the aortic wall, and Perls-diaminobenzidine staining revealed an accumulation of Fe2+. SMC relaxation with ISDN increases aortic dilatation, worsens aortic prognosis, and reproduces human histological findings in a low-dose BAPN/AngII-induced aortic dissection model in rats."

    "abstract": "Rare cardiovascular diseases (RCDs) have low incidence but major clinical impact. RCDs' classification includes Class I-systemic circulation, Class II-pulmonary circulation, Class III-cardiomyopathies, Class IV-congenital cardiovascular diseases (CVD), Class V-cardiac tumors and CVD in malignancy, Class VI-cardiac arrhythmogenic disorders, Class VII-CVD in pregnancy, Class VIII-unclassified rare CVD. Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is useful in the diagnosis/management of RCDs, as it performs angiography, function, perfusion, and tissue characterization in the same examination. Edema expressed as a high signal in STIRT2 or increased T2 mapping is common in acute/active inflammatory states. Diffuse subendocardial fibrosis, expressed as diffuse late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), is characteristic of microvascular disease as in systemic sclerosis, small vessel vasculitis, cardiac amyloidosis, and metabolic disorders. Replacement fibrosis, expressed as LGE, in the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle (LV) is typical of neuromuscular disorders. Patchy LGE with concurrent edema is typical of myocarditis, irrespective of the cause. Cardiac hypertrophy is characteristic in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and Anderson-Fabry Disease (AFD), but LGE is located in the IVS, subendocardium and lateral wall in HCM, CA and AFD, respectively. Native T1 mapping is increased in HCM and CA and reduced in AFD. Magnetic resonance angiography provides information on aortopathies, such as Marfan, Turner syndrome and Takayasu vasculitis. LGE in the right ventricle is the typical finding of ARVC, but it may involve LV, leading to the diagnosis of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Tissue changes in RCDs may be detected only through parametric imaging indices."

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence indicates that redox stress participates in MFS aortopathy, though its mechanistic contribution is little known. We reported elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and NADPH oxidase NOX4 upregulation in MFS patients and mouse aortae. Here we address the contribution of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), which catabolizes purines into uric acid and ROS in MFS aortopathy. In aortic samples from MFS patients, XOR protein expression, revealed by immunohistochemistry, increased in both the tunicae intima and media of the dilated zone. In MFS mice (Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup>), aortic XOR mRNA transcripts and enzymatic activity of the oxidase form (XO) were augmented in the aorta of 3-month-old mice but not in older animals. The administration of the XOR inhibitor allopurinol (ALO) halted the progression of aortic root aneurysm in MFS mice. ALO administrated before the onset of the aneurysm prevented its subsequent development. ALO also inhibited MFS-associated endothelial dysfunction as well as elastic fiber fragmentation, nuclear translocation of pNRF2 and increased 3'-nitrotyrosine levels, and collagen maturation remodeling, all occurring in the tunica media. ALO reduced the MFS-associated large aortic production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and NOX4 and MMP2 transcriptional overexpression. Allopurinol interferes in aortic aneurysm progression acting as a potent antioxidant. This study strengthens the concept that redox stress is an important determinant of aortic aneurysm formation and progression in MFS and warrants the evaluation of ALO therapy in MFS patients."

Consecutive C2-sacrum PSF patients operated on by 4 surgeons at a single-center from 2015-2020 were reviewed. Demographics, comorbidities, indications, surgical history, and radiographic parameters were collected. 23 patients underwent C2-sacrum PSF. 13 (57%) were male, and 21 (91.3%) were adults. Mean age at time of first spine surgery was 44 years (range 5-71) and 53 years (range 14-72) at the time of C2-sacrum PSF. Six patients (26%) had osteoporosis, and 6 patients (26%) had neurologic comorbidities-including Parkinson's disease (4), cerebral palsy (1), and Brown Sequard syndrome (1). Four (17%) had connective tissue disease. Two patients underwent C2-sacrum PSF as an index procedure: (1) 67M with myelomatous fractures and 124° of cervicothoracic kyphosis; (2) 28F with severe Marfan syndrome with 140° thoracic scoliosis and 130° thoracic kyphosis.

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a rare inherited disorder of the connective tissue with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance which happens as a result of a mutation in the fibrillin-1 (<i>FBN1</i>) gene located on chromosome 15q21.1. This mutation results in the defective formation of microfibrils and increased levels of active transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta), leading to defective connective tissue synthesis. These changes affect various parts of the body but most notably affected are the heart, eyes, and the musculoskeletal system. The standard presenting features of a person suffering from MFS are tall stature with a large arm span, kyphosis, congenital dislocation of the lens (ectopia lentis) and cardiovascular manifestations. The 2010 modified Ghent criteria are used to diagnose MFS on the basis of parameters such as cardiovascular, eye, and musculoskeletal disorders. The cardiovascular manifestations in a patient with MFS are the leading causes of mortality. The most common and dreaded complication is an aortic aneurysm and subsequent dissection. Cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia are also potential killers in such patients. This article aims to look at the various cardiac complications mentioned above and gain an understanding of their pathogenesis, incidence, and outcome. It also includes a brief overview of the rare complication post-Bentall graft infection, and its cause, diagnosis, and management. Various articles by several different authors from around the world were searched for information regarding the pathogenesis, incidence, and outcomes of these patients and are referenced below."

Whilst Marfan syndrome (MFS) is well-known, the clinical presentation and prognosis of more newly described genetic syndromes is less familiar to clinicians. There is a particular lack of knowledge regarding clinical outcomes for non-syndromal heritable aortic disease. This study investigated the presentation, clinical course and survival of patients with syndromal [Loeys-Dietz, aneurysm-osteoarthritis, and aneurysm-cerebral arteriopathy (<i>ACTA2</i>) syndrome] and non-syndromal heritable aortic disease in comparison to MFS. The study group includes 536 individuals (283 Marfan, 176 non-syndromal heritable aortopathy, 36 aneurysm-osteoarthritis, 32 Loeys-Dietz, and 9 <i>ACTA2</i> aneurysm) enrolled in a longitudinal clinical follow-up between 1990 and 2022. Age at diagnosis differed between groups: Marfan = 22.0 ± 16.6; Loeys-Dietz = 29.6 ± 21.5; aneurysm-osteoarthritis = 36.4 ± 18.8; <i>ACTA2</i> aneurysm = 43.4 ± 18.6; non-syndromal heritable aortopathy = 47.2 ± 16.6 years (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Aortic dissection was the presenting event in 8% individuals with Marfan compared to 27% with non-syndromal heritable aortopathy and 34% with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Mean follow-up duration for the group was 16.4 years (range 0.2-30 years) and 74 individuals died during follow-up (Marfan = 52, Loeys-Dietz = 6, aneurysm-osteoarthritis = 4, ACTA2 aneurysm = 1, heritable non-syndromal aortopathy = 11). At 10 years follow-up, actuarial mean survivals were: aneurysm-osteoarthritis = 77.5 ± 10.4%; Loeys-Dietz = 90.0 ± 6.8%; Marfan = 94.6 ± 1.4%; heritable non-syndromal aortopathy = 95.9 ± 2.1% (NS). There were 60 aortic dissections (24 Type A, 36 Type B) during follow-up. At 10 years, survival free of dissection was comparable between groups: aneurysm-osteoarthritis = 90.7 ± 6.4%; Loeys-Dietz = 94.4 ± 5.4%; Marfan = 96.1 ± 1.2%; heritable non-syndromal aortopathy = 93.9 ± 2.3%, with similar findings at 20 years. Prophylactic aortic surgery was a first event during follow-up for 196 individuals (ACTA2 aneurysm = 3; aneurysm-osteoarthritis = 10; Loeys-Dietz = 19; Marfan = 119; heritable non-syndromal aortopathy = 45). A second surgical intervention was required in 45 individuals and a third intervention in 21 individuals. At 10 years follow-up, survival free of surgery differed between groups: aneurysm-osteoarthritis = 68.5 ± 10.1%; Loeys-Dietz = 40.8 ± 11.2%; Marfan = 75.5 ± 2.7%; heritable non-syndromal aortopathy = 63.8 ± 4.7% (<i>p</i> < 0.001). At 20 years follow-up mean survival free of surgery was: aneurysm-osteoarthritis = 26.6 ± 14.7%; Loeys-Dietz = 9.1 ± 8.2%; Marfan = 57.2 ± 3.4%; heritable non-syndromal aortopathy = 41.6 ± 8.2% (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Diagnosis of newer syndromic and non-syndromal heritable aortopathies is delayed compared to MFS, with associated complications of presentation with aortic dissection. Survival of individuals enrolled in follow-up surveillance is comparable between different genetic aortopathies, however aortic dissections still occur and need for surgical intervention is high."

    "title": "Relationship between phenotypic features in Loeys-Dietz syndrome and the presence of intracranial aneurysms.",
    "abstract": "Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by aneurysms of the aorta, aortic branches, and intracranial arteries; skeletal and cutaneous abnormalities; and craniofacial malformations. Previous authors have reported that higher craniofacial severity index (CFI) scores, which indicate more severe craniofacial abnormalities, correlate with the severity of aortic aneurysm pathology. However, the association between syndromic features and the formation of intracranial aneurysms in LDS patients has yet to be determined. In this study, the authors evaluate the incidence of phenotypic abnormalities, craniofacial features, and Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) in a large LDS cohort and explore possible risk factors for the development of intracranial aneurysms. This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients with LDS who had been seen at the Marfan Syndrome and Aortopathy Center at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis in 2010-2022. Medical records were reviewed to obtain demographic, clinical, and radiographic data. The prevalence of craniofacial, skeletal, and cutaneous pathologies was determined. Bivariate logistic regression was performed to identify possible risk factors for the formation of an intracranial aneurysm. Eighty-one patients with complete medical records and intracranial vascular imaging were included in the analysis, and 18 patients (22.2%) had at least 1 intracranial aneurysm. Patients frequently demonstrated the thin or translucent skin, doughy skin texture, hypertelorism, uvular abnormalities, and joint hypermobility typical of LDS. CM-I was common, occurring in 7.4% of the patients. Importantly, the patients with intracranial aneurysms were more likely to have CM-I (22.2%) than those without intracranial aneurysms (3.2%). The mean CFI score in the cohort with available data was 1.81, with higher means in the patients with the TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 disease-causing variants (2.05 and 3.30, respectively) and lower in the patients with the SMAD3, TGFB2, or TGFB3 pathogenic variants (CFI < 1). No significant CFI difference was observed in patients with or without intracranial aneurysms (2.06 vs 1.74, p = 0.61). CM-I, and not the CFI, is significantly associated with the presence of intracranial aneurysms in patients with LDS. Surveillance for intracranial aneurysms is essential in all patients with LDS and should not be limited to those with severe phenotypes. Long-term monitoring studies will be necessary to determine whether a correlation between craniofacial abnormalities and adverse outcomes from intracranial aneurysms (growth, intervention, or rupture) exists."

Whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing were performed to identify the pathogenic mutation. The transcriptional consequence of the splice-altering mutation was analyzed via minigene assays and reverse-transcription PCR. We identified a novel pathogenic mutation (c.8051+1G>C) in the splice site of exon 64 of the FBN1 gene in an MFS-pedigree. This mutation was confirmed to cause two different truncated transcripts (entire exon 64 skipping; partial exon 64 exclusion). We also systematically summarized previously reported transcriptional studies of pathogenic splice-altering mutations in the FBN1 gene to investigate the clinical and transcriptional consequences. In conclusion, we reported for the first time that a splice-altering mutation in the FBN1 gene leads to two abnormal transcripts simultaneously."

    "abstract": "Fibrillin-1 is an extracellular matrix protein that assembles into microfibrils that provide critical functions in large blood vessels and other tissues. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene are associated with cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal abnormalities in Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin-1 is a component of the wall of large arteries but has been poorly described in other vessels. We examined the microvasculature in the retina using wild type mice and two models of Marfan syndrome, <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1041G/+</sup> and <i>Fbn1</i><sup>mgR/mgR</sup>. In the mouse retina, fibrillin-1 was detected around arterioles, in close contact with the basement membrane, where it colocalized with MAGP1. Both a mutation in fibrillin-1 or fibrillin-1 underexpression characteristically altered the microvasculature. In <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1041G/+</sup> and <i>Fbn1</i><sup>mgR/mgR</sup> mice, arterioles were enlarged with reduced MAGP1 deposition and focal loss of smooth muscle cell coverage. Losartan, which prevents aortic enlargement in <i>Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup></i> mice, prevented smooth muscle cell loss and vessel leakiness when administrated in a preventive mode. Moreover, losartan also partially rescued the defects in a curative mode. Thus, fibrillin-1/MAGP1 performs essential functions in arteriolar integrity and mutant fibrillin-1-induced defects can be prevented or partially rescued pharmacologically. These new findings could have implications for people with Marfan syndrome."

    "title": "The Impact of Oxidative Stress on Pediatrics Syndromes.",
    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a condition determined by an imbalance between antioxidant and oxidative factors. Oxidative stress can have serious consequences on our organism. Indeed, it causes both necrosis and cell apoptosis, determining cellular aging, increased carcinogenesis, vascular stiffening, increased autoimmune diseases, and muscle decay. In the context of pediatric syndromes, oxidative stress could play a role in the first order. In fact, our review of the literature showed that in some pathologies, such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, oxidative stress related to the intake of ethanol during pregnancy is a main etiological factor determining the associated clinical syndrome. On the contrary, in Williams syndrome, Down syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Gaucher syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, autistic spectrum disorder, Fanconi's anemia, and primitive immunodeficiencies, the increase in oxidative stress is directly associated with the genetic alterations that cause the same pathologies. Although further studies are needed to better understand the relationship between oxidative stress and pediatric diseases, a better knowledge of this crucial issue encourages future therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder causing aortic aneurysm formation. Currently, only prophylactic aortic surgery and blood pressure-lowering drugs are available to reduce the risk of aortic rupture. Upon whole genome sequencing of a Marfan family, we identified a complement gene C1R variant (p.Ser152Leu), which is associated with severe aortic patients. Therefore, we assessed the role of complement activation in MFS aortic tissue. Expression of various complement genes and proteins was detected in human and murine MFS aneurysm tissue, which prompted us to study complement inhibition in MFS mice. Treatment of the Fbn1C1041G/+ MFS mice with human plasma-derived C1-esterase inhibitor Cetor® resulted in reduced complement deposition, decreased macrophage influx in the aorta, and lower circulating TNFα levels. However, in line with previous anti-inflammatory treatments, complement inhibition did not change the aortic dilatation rate in this MFS mouse model. Thus, while complement factors/component 3 activation were detected in human/murine MFS aorta, Cetor® had no effect on aortic dilatation in MFS mice, indicating that complement inhibition is not a suitable treatment strategy in MFS."

    "title": "Current controversies in aortic valve-preserving surgery.",
    "abstract": "The clinical outcome of severe aortic regurgitation (AR) remains suboptimal, but surgery has been shown to have survival benefit over medical therapy. Postoperative survival is inferior in patients with reduced left ventricular function, and therefore early surgical intervention is recommended. Aortic valvuloplasty (AVP) is an attractive option to avoid the major drawbacks of prosthetic valves but has not been widely adopted. The etiology of AR is classified functionally into three groups: normal leaflet motion (type I), cusp prolapse (type II), and restriction (type III). Type I with dilatation of the sinus of Valsalva (type Ib) can be repaired by aortic valve reimplantation or aortic root remodeling with similar valve stability. Type I with dilatation of the aortic annulus (type Ic) can be managed by annuloplasty. Type II can be corrected by plication or resuspension techniques. Pericardial patch is necessary in AVP for type Id (perforation/fenestration) and type III but is associated with risk of recurrence. Bicuspid aortic valve is classified according to commissure angle: symmetrical, asymmetrical, and very asymmetrical. Tricuspidization is recommended for repair of very asymmetrical valves to avoid postoperative stenosis. Recent progress has achieved similar reoperation rates between bicuspid and tricuspid aortic valve repair. For Marfan syndrome, valve-sparing root replacement is advantageous compared to Bentall operation regarding late survival, thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events, and endocarditis. Similar findings have been reported in acute aortic dissection. Both remodeling and reimplantation procedures provide similar favorable outcomes in these settings. Recent advances in AVP are summarized by quantitative assessment of cusp configuration (effective height and geometric height), graft size decision, use of template to cut the graft, and videoscopic assessment of post-repair cusp configuration. Due to these advances, AVP shows superior results to replacement surgery. Further concrete evidence with larger case volumes and longer observation periods are necessary to popularize AVP."

    "abstract": "To compare the accuracy and precision of 3D-Dixon and 2D-SSFP MR-imaging for assessment of aortic diameter in Marfan patients. This prospective single-center study investigated respiratory-gated 3D-Dixon and breath-hold 2D-SSFP non-contrast MR-imaging at 3 T in 47 Marfan patients (36.0 ± 13.2 years, 28♀,19♂). Two radiologists performed individual diameter measurements at five levels of the thoracic aorta and evaluated image quality on a four-grade scale (1 = poor, 4 = excellent) and artifacts (1 = severe, 4 = none). Aortic root diameters acquired by echocardiography served as a reference standard. Intraclass correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman analyses, F-test, t-test, and regression analyses were used to assess agreement between observers and methods. Greatest aortic diameters were observed at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva (SOV) for 3D-Dixon (38.2 ± 6.8 mm) and 2D-SSFP (38.3 ± 7.1 mm) (p = 0.53). Intra- and interobserver correlation of diameter measurements was excellent at all aortic levels for both 3D-Dixon (r = 0.94-0.99 and r = 0.94-0.98) and 2D-SSFP (r = 0.96-1.00 and r = 0.95-0.99). 3D-Dixon-derived and 2D-SSFP-derived diameter measurements at the level of the SOV revealed a strong correlation with echocardiographic measurements (r = 0.92, p < 0.001 and r = 0.93, p < 0.001, respectively). The estimated mean image quality at the level of SOV was higher for 2D-SSFP compared to that for 3D-Dixon (3.3 (95%-CI: 3.1-3.5) vs. 2.9 (95%-CI: 2.7-3.1)) (p < 0.001). Imaging artifacts were less at all aortic levels for 3D-Dixon compared to 2D-SSFP (3.4-3.8 vs. 2.8-3.1) (all p < 0.002). Respiratory-gated 3D-Dixon and breath-hold 2D-SSFP MR-imaging provide accurate and precise aortic diameter measurements. We recommend 3D-Dixon imaging for monitoring of aortic diameter in Marfan patients due to fewer imaging artifacts and the possibility of orthogonal multiplanar reformations of the aortic root. • Respiratory-gated 3D-Dixon and breath-hold 2D-SSFP imaging provide accurate and precise aortic diameter measurements in patients suffering from Marfan syndrome. • Imaging artifacts are stronger in 2D-SFFP imaging than in 3D-Dixon imaging. • We recommend 3D-Dixon imaging for monitoring of aortic diameter in Marfan patients due to fewer imaging artifacts and the possibility of orthogonal multiplanar reformations."

    "abstract": "It is difficult to assess the risk for aortic dissection beyond the aortic root in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS). To aid risk assessment in these patients, we investigated aortic flow and wall shear stress (WSS) by 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with MFS and compared the results with healthy volunteers. We hypothesized that MFS patients with a high-risk profile for aortic dissection would show abnormal hemodynamics in aortic regions associated with aortic dissection. MFS patients (n = 55) and healthy subjects (n = 25), matched for age and sex, prospectively underwent 4D flow MRI. 4D flow maps were constructed to detect elevated (defined as higher than the three-dimensional 95 % confidence interval) and deviant directed (defined as vector angle differences higher than 120°) WSS in MFS patients as compared to the controls. Univariate and multivariate associations with risk factors for aortic dissection in MFS patients were assessed. The maximum incidence for elevated WSS was 20 % (CI 9 %-31 %) and found in the ascending aorta. The maximum for deviant directed WSS was 39 % (CI 26 %-52 %) and found in the inner descending aorta. Significantly more male patients had deviant directed WSS in the inner proximal descending aorta (63 % vs 24 %, p = 0.014). Multivariate analysis showed that deviant directed WSS was associated with male sex (p = 0.019), and a haplo-insufficient FBN1 mutation type (p = 0.040). In 60 % of MFS patients with a previous aortic root replacement surgery, abnormal hemodynamics were found in the ascending aorta. No significant differences between hemodynamics were found in the descending aorta between operated and non-operated patients. Deviant directed WSS in the proximal descending aorta is associated with known risk factors for aortic dissection in MFS patients, namely male sex and a haploinsufficient FBN1 mutation type."

Heart failure patients are known to be at higher risk of morbidity and mortality in this case. Yet, few data exist concerning COVID-19 among patients with a left ventricular assistance device, and even less among those with a total artificial heart (TAH). A 27-year-old man with Marfan syndrome underwent prophylactic ascending aorta replacement. Shortly after surgery completion, he developed refractory cardiogenic shock with biventricular dysfunction leading to veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) implantation. In the context of no appropriate eligible donor during the following 10 days while waiting on the heart transplantation list, the patient was scheduled for a TAH as a bridge to transplantation. Meanwhile, he developed an acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to SARS-CoV-2. The patient was successfully treated with corticosteroids, prone positioning and mechanical ventilation, and heart transplantation occurred 5 weeks after COVID-19 onset. Here, we report the first case of a patient presenting with COVID-19 infection following TAH implantation in a bridge to transplantation. We highlight that (i) cardiogenic shock patients simultaneously infected by COVID-19 should be treated instantly with all-time available technology to ensure best outcomes, including TAH and prone positioning, (ii) heart transplantation safety 5 weeks after COVID-19 onset."

The molecular mechanism of naringenin was further investigated via <i>in vitro</i> studies, such as bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), atomic force microscope and radioligand receptor binding assay. Six-week-old <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1039G/+</sup> mice were fed with naringenin for 20 weeks. Compared with the control group, naringenin significantly suppressed the aortic expansion [<i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1039G/+</sup> <i>vs.</i> <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1039G/+</sup>+naringenin: (2.49±0.47) mm, <i>n=</i>18 <i>vs.</i> (1.87±0.19) mm, <i>n=</i>22, <i>P</i> < 0.05], the degradation of elastin, and the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9 in the ascending aorta of <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1039G/+</sup> mice.

To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, we examined the effects of naringenin on angiotensin Ⅱ type 1 receptor (AT1) signaling and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling respectively, which were the dominant signaling pathways contributing to aortopathy in Marfan syndrome as previously reported. The results showed that naringenin decreased angiotensin Ⅱ (Ang Ⅱ)-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular regulating kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in HEK293A cell overexpressing AT1 receptor. Moreover, naringenin inhibited Ang Ⅱ-induced calcium mobilization and uclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) signaling. The internalization of AT1 receptor and its binding to β-arrestin-2 with Ang Ⅱ induction were also suppressed by naringenin. As evidenced by atomic force microscope and radioligand receptor binding assay, naringenin inhibited Ang Ⅱ binding to AT1 receptor. In terms of TGF-β signaling, we found that feeding the mice with naringenin decreased the phosphorylation of Smad2 and ERK1/2 as well as the expression of TGF-β downstream genes. Besides, the serum level of TGF-β was also decreased by naringenin in the <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1039G/+</sup> mice. Furthermore, we detected the effect of naringenin on platelet, a rich source of TGF-β, both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. And we found that naringenin markedly decreased the TGF-β level by inhibiting the activation of platelet. Our study showed that naringenin has a protective effect on thoracic aortic aneurysm formation in Marfan syndrome by suppressing both AT1 and TGF-β signaling."

Data regarding patient characteristics, perioperative and late outcomes were extracted. Twelve studies were identified including 120 patients. The mean age was 40.2 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.8-43.6). 40.4% (95% CI: 10.8-70.0) of cases were performed emergently. 76.2% (95% CI: 64.6-87.8) of patients had a history of previous aortic surgery.

From November 2005 to February 2022, a total of 560 robotic vascular procedures were performed, of which 70 were orphan operations, corresponding to 12.5%. The most common was robotic decompression of the coeliac trunk (18 times) in Dunbar syndrome, followed by robotic repair of type II endoleak after stent graft implantation (15 times) and robotic repair of splenic artery aneurysm (11 times). Less common were isolated pelvic artery aneurysm surgery (8 times), aortic thromboenderectomy and abdominal aortic patch repair (8 times) and hybrid surgery (6 times). Completely unique are renal artery reconstruction (2 times), operation of internal mammary artery aneurysm (1 time) in a patient with Marfan syndrome and paracaval biopsy (1 time) in a cancer patient. In 3 cases (4.2%) the operation had to be converted to open surgery. Twice in the management of splenic artery aneurysm due to flat adhesions in the abdominal cavity and once in the endoleak operation, when due to the very fragile wall of the dilated and pulsating abdominal aortic aneurysm sac, we considered manipulation with robotic instruments to be highly risky. There was zero mortality in this cohort; one patient had to undergo laparoscopic diaphragm repair for diaphragmatic hernia at another institution after deliberation of the coeliac trunk and in one case open surgery was needed for persistent endoleak. The use of the robotic system can be beneficial also in less frequent procedures, offering the patients all the advantages of robotic surgery. However, the need of extensive experience in robotic surgery should be emphasized because these operations are rare and perfect anatomical knowledge of the area is necessary."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disorder leading to medial aortic degeneration and life-limiting dissections. To date, there is no causal prevention or therapy. Rapamycin is a potent and selective inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein kinase, regulating cell growth and metabolism. The mgR/mgR mice represent an accepted MFS model for studying aortic pathologies to understand the underlying molecular pathomechanisms. This study investigated whether rapamycin inhibits the development of thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections in mgR/mgR mice. Isolated primary aortic smooth muscle cells (mAoSMCs) from mgR/mgR mice were used for in vitro studies. Two mg kg/BW rapamycin was injected intraperitoneally daily for two weeks, beginning at 7-8 weeks of age. Mice were sacrificed 30 days post-treatment. Histopathological and immunofluorescence analyses were performed using adequate tissue specimens and techniques. Animal survival was evaluated accompanied by periodic echocardiographic examinations of the aorta. The protein level of the phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (p-RPS6), a downstream target of mTOR, was significantly increased in the aortic tissue of mgR/mgR mice. In mAoSMCs isolated from these animals, expression of mTOR, p-RPS6, tumour necrosis factor α, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 was significantly suppressed by rapamycin, demonstrating its anti-inflammatory capacity. Short-term rapamycin treatment of Marfan mice was associated with delayed aneurysm formation, medial aortic elastolysis and improved survival. Short-term rapamycin-mediated mTOR inhibition significantly reduces aortic aneurysm formation and thus increases survival in mgR/mgR mice. Our results may offer the first causal treatment option to prevent aortic complications in MFS patients."

Herein, we describe 16 patients whose ascending aortas were operatively excised because of what clinically was believed to be acute aortic dissection. Of the 16 patients, 14 had aortic intimal-medial tears without dissection and the other 2 had acute medial dissection of the aorta adjacent to a healed aortic intimal-medial tear without dissection.

At least 9 of the 16 patients, however, had had aortas similar to those seen in the Marfan syndrome (forme fruste variety). Although the 8 surgeons who operated on these 16 patients described the intimal-medial tears as \"aortic dissection\", only 2 had acute dissection adjacent to a healed intimal-medial tear without dissection. In conclusion, although the aortic intimal-medial tear is the initiator of aortic dissection, some patients with intimal-medial tears have no accompanying dissection."

Meanwhile, <i>FBN1</i> variants are also detected in a spectrum of connective tissue disorders collectively termed as 'type I fibrillinopathies'. A multitude of <i>FBN1</i> variants is reported and most of them are unique in each pedigree. Although MFS is being considered a monogenic disorder, it is speculated that the allelic heterogeneity of <i>FBN1</i> variants contributes to various manifestations, distinct prognoses, and differential responses to the therapies in affected patients. Significant progress in the genotype-phenotype correlations of MFS have emerged in the last 20 years, though, some of the associations were still in debate. This review aims to update the recent advances in the genotype-phenotype correlations of MFS and related fibrillinopathies. The molecular bases and pathological mechanisms are summarized for better support of the observed correlations. Other factors contributing to the phenotype heterogeneity and future research directions were also discussed. Dissecting the genotype-phenotype correlation of <i>FBN1</i> variants and related disorders will provide valuable information in risk stratification, prognosis, and choice of therapy."

    "title": "Effects of Rapamycin on the Expression of Redox Enzymes in Aortic Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells from Marfan Syndrome Mice.",
    "abstract": "Activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been implicated in an increasing number of diseases, including Marfan syndrome (MFS), an inherited connective tissue disorder. mTOR-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation has also been suggested to play a role in aortic aneurysm formation in MFS patients. This study aimed to characterize the effects of mTOR inhibition by rapamycin on key redox enzymes and NADPH oxidases (NOX) in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells of a murine MFS model. Therefore, the influence of 5 and 20 nmol/L rapamycin solved in 0.1% (vol/vol) DMSO on glutathione peroxidases 1 (Gpx1) and 4 (Gpx4), superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2), and catalase (Cat) mRNA and protein expression was investigated in isolated murine aortic smooth muscle cells. Rapamycin inhibited the mRNA expression of all redox enzymes by 30-50%, except Gpx1. In the same cells, the mRNA expression of the transcription factor NFE2-related factor-2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, key factors against oxidative stress, and controlling redox gene expression were also inhibited to a comparable extent under these conditions. In addition, Nox1 but not Nox4 mRNA expression was significantly inhibited by up to 40%. DMSO alone increased nearly 2-fold the redox enzyme protein expression, which was reduced considerably to basal levels by rapamycin. Proteasomal inhibition by bortezomib could not reverse the observed decrease of GPx protein content. The rapamycin-mediated decrease in GPx protein abundance was reflected in a reduced total GPx enzymatic activity. Higher rapamycin concentrations did not further decrease but led to a renewed increase in enzymatic activity despite low GPx protein concentrations. Baseline ROS formation was slightly inhibited at 13% with 5 nmol/L rapamycin and returned to baseline levels with the higher 20 nmol/L rapamycin concentration. In conclusion, this study further characterized the mechanism of action of rapamycin. It provided an insight into how rapamycin interferes with the regulation of redox homeostasis essential for ROS-dependent signaling that does not incur cellular damage."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an inherited connective tissue disorder. Pectus excavatum (PEX) is common in MFS. The purpose was to evaluate the association of PEX with cardiovascular manifestations of MFS, biventricular size and function. <b>Methods:</b> MFS adults undergoing cardiac MRI were retrospectively evaluated. Exclusion criteria were incomplete cardiac MRI, significant artifacts, co-existent ischaemic or congenital heart disease. Haller Index (HI) ≥3.25 classified patients as PEX positive (PEX+) and PEX negative (PEX-). Cardiac MRI analysis included assessment of mitral valve prolapse (MVP), mitral annular disjunction (MAD), biventricular volumetry and aortic dimensions. <b>Results:</b> 212 MFS patients were included, 76 PEX+ and 136 PEX- (HI 8.3 ± 15.2 vs 2.3 ± 0.5, <i>P</i> < .001). PEX+ were younger (33.4 ± 12.0 vs 38.1 ± 14.3 years, <i>P</i> = .02) and similar in sex distribution (55% vs 63% male, <i>P</i> = .26) compared to PEX-. MVP and MAD were more frequent in PEX+ vs PEX- (43/76 [57%] vs 37/136 [27%], <i>P</i> < .001; 44/76 [58%] vs 50/136[37%], <i>P</i> = .003, respectively). PEX+ had higher right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (RVEDVi 92 ± 17mL/m2 vs 84 ± 22mL/m2, <i>P</i> = .04; RVESVi 44 ± 10 mL/m2 vs 39 ± 14 mL/m2, <i>P</i> = .02), lower RV ejection fraction (RVEF 52 ± 5% vs 55 ± 6%, <i>P</i> = .01) compared to PEX-. Left ventricular (LV) volumes, LVEF and aortic dimensions were similar. <b>Conclusion:</b> MFS adults with PEX have higher frequency of cardiac manifestations including MV abnormalities, increased RV volumes and lower RVEF compared to those without PEX. Awareness of this association is important for all radiologists who interpret aortic CT or MRI, where HI can be easily measured. PEX in MFS may suggest more severe disease expression necessitating careful screening for MV abnormalities and outcomes surveillance."

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that the proliferation and early differentiation of myoblasts are impaired in Marfan syndrome (MFS) mice during muscle regeneration. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated muscle regeneration in MFS mouse models by analyzing the influence of the fibrotic niche on satellite cell function. In vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro experiments were performed. In addition, we evaluated the effect of the pharmacological inhibition of fibrosis using Ang-(1-7) on regenerating skeletal muscles of MFS mice. The skeletal muscle of MFS mice shows an increased accumulation of collagen fibers (81.2%), number of fibroblasts (157.1%), and Smad2/3 signaling (110.5%), as well as an aberrant number of fibro-adipogenic progenitor cells in response to injury compared with wild-type mice. There was an increased number of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophages (3.6- and 3.1-fold, respectively) in regenerating muscles of wild-type mice, but not in the regenerating muscles of MFS mice. Our data show that proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells are altered (p ≤ 0.05) in MFS mice. Myoblast transplantation assay revealed that the regenerating muscles from MFS mice have reduced satellite cell self-renewal capacity (74.7%). In addition, we found that treatment with Ang-(1-7) reduces fibrosis (71.6%) and ameliorates satellite cell dysfunction (p ≤ 0.05) and muscle contractile function (p ≤ 0.05) in MFS mice. The fibrotic niche, caused by Fbn1 mutations, reduces the myogenic potential of satellite cells, affecting structural and functional muscle regeneration. In addition, the fibrosis inhibitor Ang-(1-7) partially counteracts satellite cell abnormalities and restores myofiber size and contractile force in regenerating muscles."

    "abstract": "Open surgical repair (OSR) of descending and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms carries risks of mortality and major complications. Patients with connective tissue disorders (CTD) are younger and require safe, efficient treatment with long-term durability. This study provides current outcome data to help inform treatment decisions. All OSRs of descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (DTAA) or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) from January 2011 to July 2021 were included in a retrospective cohort study. Primary outcome measures were early and follow-up mortality and reintervention. Secondary outcome measures were major complications. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate reintervention-free survival. A total of 26 OSRs (7 DTAA, 19 TAAA) were performed in 23 patients: 20 (77%) Marfan and 6 (23%) Loeys-Dietz syndrome; median age 43 years. Aortic dissection was present in 100% and 3/26 (12%) were urgent. Early mortality was 1/26 (3.8%). No patient suffered spinal cord ischemia, stroke, vocal cord paralysis, or re-exploration for bleeding. The transient respiratory failure occurred in 19% (5/26) and transient renal replacement therapy in 15% (4/26). Renal function normalized in all patients within 3 months. During follow-up (median 4.6, range 0-11 years) there were no deaths and only one re-intervention on a previously operated aortic segment, resulting in 92% reintervention-free survival at 5 years. In dedicated units, open surgical DTAA and TAAA repair in patients with CTD can be performed with a very low risk of death, severe complications and, late re-intervention. For CTD patients with reasonable risk, OSR should remain the first line of treatment."

Phenotypically, individuals with FXS also present with distinct physical features including, elongated face, prominent ears, pectus excavatum, macroorchidism, and joint laxity, which suggests connective tissue dysplasia. In addition to mitral valve prolapse, aortic dilatation has been identified within individuals with FXS. Abnormal elastin fiber networks have been found in the skin, valves, and aorta in individual cases. Aortic dilatation has been described in other connective tissue disorders, particularly Marfan syndrome. However, while aortic aneurysms are characteristic of Marfan syndrome, no similar cases have been reported in FXS patients to date. This case report details the presentation of two patients with FXS and aortic aneurysm. Our two cases highlight the risks of aortic pathology in FXS, and the need for monitoring in asymptomatic patients with significant aortic dilatation."

In this retrospective study, we used the Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium, a multicenter United States-based registry of pediatric cardiac interventions, to describe the long-term outcomes of patients who underwent their first surgery for connective tissue-related cardiovascular conditions aged <21 years. Between 1982 and 2003, a total of 103 patients were enrolled who underwent cardiac surgery for a connective tissue-related cardiovascular disorder, including 3 severe infantile cases operated on within the first year of life. Most patients underwent aortic site surgery (n = 85) as a composite graft (n = 50), valve-sparing (n = 33), or other aortic surgery (n = 2). The remaining patients underwent atrioventricular valve surgery (mitral 17, tricuspid 1). Of the 99 patients surviving to discharge, 80 (including the 3 infantile) had adequate identifiers for tracking long-term outcomes through 2019 through linkage with the National Death Index and the Organ Procurement. Over a median period of 19.5 years (interquartile range 16.0 to 23.1), 29 deaths and 1 transplant occurred in the noninfantile group, whereas all 3 infantile patients died before the age of 4 years. The postdischarge survival for the noninfantile group was 92.2%, 68.2%, and 56.7% at 10, 20, and 25 years, respectively. Cardiovascular-related pathology contributed to all deaths in the infantile and 89% (n = 27) of deaths for the noninfantile cases after hospital discharge. The significant late attrition from cardiovascular causes emphasizes the need for close monitoring and ongoing management in this population."

    "abstract": "Neonatal Marfan syndrome (nMFS), the most severe form of Marfan syndrome, is a rare condition that presents a clinical and treatment challenge. nMFS has high infant mortality related to progressive valvular dysfunction. Valve replacement in this setting improves long-term prognosis but carries high morbidity and mortality. Thus, sharing clinical experience in treating such patients is valuable. A 2 year old with nMFS underwent tricuspid valve annuloplasty and prosthetic mitral valve replacement. Postoperative management was complicated by pulmonary hypertension, cardiogenic shock, and arrythmias. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) helped overcome these challenges but posed a high risk for prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT). Despite decompression of the left atrium (LA) with an LA vent, the left ventricle (LV) was distended because of aortic regurgitation and no native cardiac output. We lowered the ECMO flow under echocardiographic guidance; used inodilators and pacing to encourage transmitral flow and reduce LV afterload. The patient completed a successful 6-day ECMO run with good end-organ perfusion. At last follow up, she was 6 years old, enjoying school, home-ventilated through the tracheostomy, and mobilizing with walking aids/wheelchair. Valve replacement can improve life quality and expectancy for patients with nMFS. Lowering ECMO flow under echocardiography guidance till the aortic valve is seen to open; coupled with inodilators, pacing and adequate anticoagulation can be a safe way to deliver VA-ECMO for cardiogenic shock after prosthetic valve replacement. Further research is needed to show if this strategy prevents prosthetic valve thrombosis and provides sufficient haemodynamic support and myocardial rest."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissues caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene which can result in widespread systemic involvement. Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a related autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue with widespread systemic involvement which has phenotypic overlap with MFS. LDS is caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in six different genes, the most common of which involve transforming growth factor beta-receptor 1 or 2. While LDS is commonly associated with craniofacial manifestations, MFS is not typically characterized by craniosynostosis. We present a 7-month-old female patient with MFS and metopic craniosynostosis with an unusual clinical presentation who underwent cranial vault reconstruction with fronto-orbital advancement and anterior cranial vault remodeling. Her course was complicated by impaired wound healing after surgery, requiring return to the operating room. Phenotypic overlap between genetic disorders can confound clinical diagnosis as illustrated in this case. Genetic testing can be highly valuable in the diagnosis of clinically variable disorders. Patients with MFS who undergo cranial surgery may be at increased risk for wound healing complications."

From December 2007 to January 2022, all patients with BAVs who underwent aortic root replacement using Tirone's procedure were included. This study based on department database information for retrospective and follow-up data. Among 51 adults undergoing aortic root replacement using Tirone's procedure, the mean age was 47.4 ± 12.5 years, and most were men (92.2%). Three presented with a dysmorphic syndrome and one had Marfan's syndrome. All patients were alive at 30 days, and as of January 2022, 45 were alive, two were lost to follow-up, and there were four noncardiac deaths. Two patients had infectious endocarditis and needed a Bentall's procedure. One patient had a double biologic valve replacement in the context of severe mitral insufficiency with moderate aortic stenosis at 4.5 years postprocedure. Echocardiographic follow-up showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63 ± 7% (n = 36), V<sub>max</sub> 2 ± 0.6 m/s (n = 17), and a mean gradient of 9.4 ± 5.4 mmHg (n = 27).

    "title": "[Genetic of thoracic aorta aneurysm].",
    "abstract": "The thoracic aortic aneurysm corresponds to the dilation of the ascending part of the aorta, which can lead to a dissection (TAAD for Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection) or aortic rupture. The etiologies are diverse, but in approximately 20% of cases a genetic origin is found. About thirty genes are reported to be responsible for the development of TAAD. The majority of these genes encode for proteins involved in the extracellular matrix, the contraction of smooth muscle cells or the growth factor TGF-β signaling pathway. Identifying the pathogenic variant responsible for the aortic disease becomes essential to make a definitive diagnosis, to guide and to personalize the treatment of the patients but also to screen relatives at risk. The availability and access to genetic testing have improved considerably with the development of new sequencing techniques (NGS for Next Generation Sequencing) and the use of gene panels. This review summarizes the main genes associated with TAAD as well as the current diagnostic strategy."

    "abstract": "Patients with Marfan syndrome and related disorders are at risk for aortic dissection and aortic rupture and therefore require appropriate monitoring. Computed tomography (CT) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) are routinely used for initial diagnosis and follow-up. The purpose of this study is to compare whole-heart CT and TTE aortic measurement for initial work-up, 2-year follow-up, and detection of progressive aortic enlargement. This retrospective study included 95 patients diagnosed with Marfan syndrome or a related disorder. All patients underwent initial work-up including aortic diameter measurement using both electrocardiography-triggered whole-heart CT and TTE. Forty-two of these patients did not undergo aortic repair after initial work-up and were monitored by follow-up imaging within 2 years. Differences between the two methods for measuring aortic diameters were compared using Bland-Altman plots. The acceptable clinical limit of agreement (acLOA) for initial work-up, follow-up, and progression within 2 years was predefined as &lt; ± 2 mm. Bland-Altman analysis revealed a small bias of 0.2 mm with wide limits of agreement (LOA) from + 6.3 to - 5.9 mm for the aortic sinus and a relevant bias of - 1.6 mm with wide LOA from + 5.6 to - 8.9 mm for the ascending aorta. Follow-up imaging yielded a small bias of 0.5 mm with a wide LOA from + 6.7 to - 5.8 mm for the aortic sinus and a relevant bias of 1.1 mm with wide LOA from + 8.1 to - 10.2 mm for the ascending aorta. Progressive aortic enlargement at follow-up was detected in 57% of patients using CT and 40% of patients using TTE. Measurement differences outside the acLOA were most frequently observed for the ascending aorta. Whole-heart CT and TTE measurements show good correlation, but the frequency of measurement differences outside the acLOA is high. TTE systematically overestimates aortic diameters. Therefore, whole-heart CT may be preferred for aortic monitoring of patients with Marfan syndrome and related disorders. TTE remains an indispensable imaging tool that provides additional information not available with CT."

Sanger sequencing was used to verify the mutation sites in the pedigree. The results showed that FBN1 missense mutation was c.6806 T>C in exon 56, resulting in isoleucine being replaced by threonine (p. Ile2269Thr). This mutation has not been reported in Chinese Han population. The occurrence of the mutations strongly correlated with the phenotypes of the patients.

The peri-operative mortality currently estimated to be less than 0.3%. The first recipient remains alive and well after 18 years. The use of PEARS as an adjunct to the Ross operation to support the pulmonary autograft is being explored in several centres. The operation requires proctoring and adherence to a strict operative protocol and with those precautions excellent results are attained.

However, in some individuals, MFS also causes sleep apnea. If sleep apnea predicts cardiovascular death, a new target for predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM) may emerge for those individuals with MFS who have sleep apnea. This is an investigator-initiated study with long-term follow-up data of 105 individuals with MFS. All individuals were screened for sleep apnea regardless of symptoms. Cardiovascular death served as a primary endpoint, and aortic events as a secondary outcome. Sleep apnea with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 5/h was observed in 21.0% (22/105) with mild sleep apnea in 13% (14/105) and moderate to severe sleep apnea in 7.6% (8/105). After a median follow-up of 7.76 years (interquartile range: 6.84, 8.41), 10% (10/105) had died, with cardiovascular cause of death in 80% (8/10). After adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI), the AHI score emerged as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular death (hazard ratio 1.712, 95% confidence interval [1.061-2.761], <i>p</i> = 0.0276). The secondary outcome of aortic events occurred in 33% (35/105). There was no effect of the AHI score on aortic events after adjusting for age and BMI (hazard ratio 0.965, 95% confidence interval [0.617-1.509]), possibly due to a high number of patients with prior aortic surgery. Sleep apnea is emerging as an independent predictor of cardiovascular death in MFS. It seems mandatory to screen all individuals with MFS for sleep apnea and to include these individuals, with both MFS and sleep apnea, in further studies to evaluate the impact of preventive measures with regard to cardiovascular death.

Though genetic testing has recently been increasingly emphasized in diagnosing MFS, it is not currently a mandatory component of the Ghent Nosology. We present the case of a nine-year-old male who presented with joint hypermobility of the shoulders, knees, and thumbs, and a family history of joint hypermobility in his 15-year-old brother. Genetic testing ruled out MFS, and the patient subsequently underwent testing for EDS, which further ruled out classical and hypermobile EDS.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of fatigue, anxiety, and symptoms of depression in MFS patients, and to assess the degree to which sociodemographic and clinical variables are associated with fatigue and psychological aspects. The prevalence of fatigue, anxiety, and symptoms of depression were assessed in two cohorts of MFS patients and compared with healthy controls. The checklist individual strength (CIS), and hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) questionnaires were utilized. Medical status was assessed (family history of MFS, aortic root dilatation >40 mm, previous aortic surgery, aortic dissection, chronic pain, skeletal involvement, and scoliosis). Severe fatigue was experienced by 37% of the total MFS cohort (n = 155). MFS patients scored significantly higher on the CIS questionnaire, concerning severe fatigue, as compared with the general Dutch population (p < 0.0001). There were no differences in HADS anxiety or depression scores. In older MFS patients, with a more severe cardiovascular phenotype, chronic pain, and a higher unemployment rate, significantly more symptoms of depression were observed, when compared with the general population (p = 0.027) or compared with younger MFS patients (p = 0.026). Multivariate analysis, showed that anxiety was associated with chronic pain (p = 0.022) and symptoms of depression with unemployment (p = 0.024). MFS patients report significantly more severe fatigue as compared with the general population. Since the cause of fatigue is unclear, more research may be needed. Psychological intervention, for example, cognitive behavioral therapy, may contribute to a reduction in psychological symptoms."

The aim of our study was to investigate contemporary midterm outcomes of isolated thoracic aortic replacement in patients with CTD versus degenerative pathology in a large institutional cohort. All patients undergoing isolated open thoracic aortic replacement at a single academic center from 2005 to 2020 were included. Patients were classified as having CTD or not having CTD based on documented genetic mutations associated with congenital aortopathy. In-hospital and midterm outcomes, including mortality, paraplegia, development of new arterial pathology on surveillance imaging, and the need for future operations, were compared between groups using descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Overall, 62 patients were included with a median follow-up of 58 months (range, 19-81 months) (59 months for those with CTD vs 51.5 months for those without CTD). CTD was present in 18 patients (29%), with 16 having Marfan syndrome (77.8%). Patients with CTD were younger than patients without CTD (45.8 years vs 60.9 years) and had lower rates of smoking (5.6% vs 56.8%) and hypertension (97.7% vs 72.2%; all P < .01). Patients with CTD were more likely to have a dissection component at the time of repair compared with patients without CTD (100% vs 59.1%) and underwent repair at smaller aortic diameters (5.9 cm vs 6.6 cm; both P < .05). There were no differences in in-hospital outcomes between the two groups, including mortality (4.5% vs 5.6%) and paraplegia (2.3% vs 0%; both P > .05). At 5 years, patients with CTD were more likely to have developed aneurysmal changes distal to their thoracic repair (88.9% vs 47.7%) and extra-aortic arterial aneurysms (41.2% vs 2.3%; both P < .05). However, on survival analysis, there were no differences in freedom from additional vascular procedures (hazard ratio,1.76; P = .333) or, specifically, additional aortic procedures (hazard ratio, 1.81; P = .380) between the two groups. There was only one anastomotic complication identified on longitudinal follow-up, which occurred in a patient without CTD 8 years after the index operation. Although carrying significant operative risks and the potential for morbidity, open thoracic aortic replacement represents a well-tolerated, durable treatment option for patients with congenitally mediated thoracic aortic disease. Because both patients with and without CTD who required thoracic aortic replacement often need future aortic intervention, vigilant surveillance is warranted. Equivalent intervention rates between the two groups suggest remodeling of the CTD aorta is almost universally characterized by initial postrepair dilation, but the majority of these changes successfully stabilize and do not progress to higher rates of intervention."

    "title": "Angiotensin receptor blockers and β blockers in Marfan syndrome: an individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised trials.",
    "abstract": "Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and β blockers are widely used in the treatment of Marfan syndrome to try to reduce the rate of progressive aortic root enlargement characteristic of this condition, but their separate and joint effects are uncertain. We aimed to determine these effects in a collaborative individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised trials of these treatments. In this meta-analysis, we identified relevant trials of patients with Marfan syndrome by systematically searching MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL from database inception to Nov 2, 2021. Trials were eligible if they involved a randomised comparison of an ARB versus control or an ARB versus β blocker. We used individual patient data from patients with no prior aortic surgery to estimate the effects of: ARB versus control (placebo or open control); ARB versus β blocker; and indirectly, β blocker versus control. The primary endpoint was the annual rate of change of body surface area-adjusted aortic root dimension Z score, measured at the sinuses of Valsalva. We identified ten potentially eligible trials including 1836 patients from our search, from which seven trials and 1442 patients were eligible for inclusion in our main analyses. Four trials involving 676 eligible participants compared ARB with control. During a median follow-up of 3 years, allocation to ARB approximately halved the annual rate of change in the aortic root Z score (mean annual increase 0·07 [SE 0·02] ARB vs 0·13 [SE 0·02] control; absolute difference -0·07 [95% CI -0·12 to -0·01]; p=0·012). Prespecified secondary subgroup analyses showed that the effects of ARB were particularly large in those with pathogenic variants in fibrillin-1, compared with those without such variants (heterogeneity p=0·0050), and there was no evidence to suggest that the effect of ARB varied with β-blocker use (heterogeneity p=0·54). Three trials involving 766 eligible participants compared ARBs with β blockers. During a median follow-up of 3 years, the annual change in the aortic root Z score was similar in the two groups (annual increase -0·08 [SE 0·03] in ARB groups vs -0·11 [SE 0·02] in β-blocker groups; absolute difference 0·03 [95% CI -0·05 to 0·10]; p=0·48). Thus, indirectly, the difference in the annual change in the aortic root Z score between β blockers and control was -0·09 (95% CI -0·18 to 0·00; p=0·042). In people with Marfan syndrome and no previous aortic surgery, ARBs reduced the rate of increase of the aortic root Z score by about one half, including among those taking a β blocker. The effects of β blockers were similar to those of ARBs. Assuming additivity, combination therapy with both ARBs and β blockers from the time of diagnosis would provide even greater reductions in the rate of aortic enlargement than either treatment alone, which, if maintained over a number of years, would be expected to lead to a delay in the need for aortic surgery.

    "abstract": "A man in his 50s presented to the eye emergency department on three separate occasions complaining of blurred vision and discomfort in the left eye. He had a history of Marfan syndrome and had undergone bilateral 20-gauge (G) pars plana vitrectomy and lensectomy 20 years prior for ectopia lentis. On examination he had epithelial corneal oedema, raised intraocular pressure >40 mm Hg and conjunctival chemosis, which later appeared as a bleb-like conjunctival elevation. Acute treatment with oral acetazolamide and topical ocular hypotensive agents produced a marked reduction in intraocular pressure to 2-4 mm Hg. A presumed diagnosis of a leaking scleral wound was made. He underwent scleral exploration under general anaesthesia and a leaking sclerotomy was uncovered. The defect was repaired successfully using a scleral patch graft. Late dehiscence of a sclerotomy has been reported rarely in patients with Marfan syndrome. This is the first reported case to present atypically with intermittent episodes of raised intraocular pressure rather than with hypotony."

    "title": "Case report: Biochemical and clinical phenotypes caused by cysteine substitutions in the epidermal growth factor-like domains of fibrillin-1.",
    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue, is primarily caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene, which encodes the protein fibrillin-1. The protein is composed of epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) domains, transforming growth factor beta-binding protein-like (TB) domains, and hybrid (Hyb) domains and is an important component of elastin-related microfibrils in elastic fiber tissue. In this study, we report a cysteine to tyrosine substitution in two different domains of fibrillin-1, both of which cause Marfan syndrome with ocular abnormalities, in two families. Using protease degradation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses, we explored the different effects of substitution of cysteine by tyrosine in an EGF-like and a calcium-binding (cb) EGF-like domain on protein stability. The results showed that cysteine mutations in the EGF domain are more likely to result in altered proteolytic sensitivity and thermostability than those in the cbEGF domain. Furthermore, cysteine mutations can lead to new enzymatic sites exposure or hidden canonical cleavage sites. These results indicate the differential clinical phenotypes and molecular pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome caused by cysteine mutations in different fibrillin-1 domains. These results strongly suggest that failure to form disulfide bonds and abnormal proteolysis of fibrillin-1 caused by cysteine mutations may be an important factor underlying the pathogenesis of diseases caused by fibrillin-1 mutations, such as Marfan syndrome."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MS) most often shows as thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) or aortic dissection, but it may also involve other vascular territories. This study aimed to identify those extrathoracic vascular manifestations most frequently associated with MS. A systematic review of the literature with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria was carried out. The following databases were included: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Health Sciences Literature (CINHAL); Spanish database MEDESY Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). A total of 10,008 articles were identified, leaving 155 for the first stage of data analysis (total incidence of aneurysms) and 83 for the second (descriptive data analysis). Overall, 518 aneurysms were identified: 149 in the head and neck, 94 in the extremities, and 275 in the aortic, iliac, and visceral sectors. Mostly, they were simultaneously discovered during studies of the TAA. In the abdominal aorta, the presentation with rupture in 11 of 32 patients stands out. Resection and bypass were the most frequently used methods for repair in the treated cases. Although its frequency in the general population is unknown, this systematic review suggests that extrathoracic aneurysmal arterial involvement in the MS may be more frequent than expected. We believe screening for aneurysms in other vascular sectors may be advisable, especially in patients with MS and TAA."

    "abstract": "Pathogenic variants in 11 genes predispose individuals to heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD), but limited data are available to stratify the risk for aortic events associated with these genes. This study sought to compare the risk of first aortic event, specifically thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery or an aortic dissection, among 7 HTAD genes and variant types within each gene. A retrospective cohort of probands and relatives with rare variants in 7 genes for HTAD (n = 1,028) was assessed for the risk of first aortic events based on the gene altered, pathogenic variant type, sex, proband status, and location of recruitment. Significant differences in aortic event risk were identified among the smooth muscle contraction genes (ACTA2, MYLK, and PRKG1; P = 0.002) and among the genes for Loeys-Dietz syndrome, which encode proteins in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β pathway (SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFBR1, and TGFBR2;P < 0.0001). Cumulative incidence of type A aortic dissection was higher than elective aneurysm surgery in patients with variants in ACTA2, MYLK, PRKG1, and SMAD3; in contrast, patients with TGFBR2 variants had lower cumulative incidence of type A aortic dissection than elective aneurysm surgery. Cumulative incidence of type B aortic dissection was higher for ACTA2, PRKG1, and TGFBR2 than other genes. After adjusting for proband status, sex, and recruitment location, specific variants in ACTA2 and TGFBR2 were associated with substantially higher risk of aortic event with childhood onset. Gene- and variant-specific data on aortic events in individuals with HTAD support personalized aortic surveillance and clinical management."

    "abstract": "Aortic root (AoR) size remains an imperfect predictor of rate of aortic dilation in Marfan syndrome (MFS). Indicators of vascular phenotype such as aortic stiffness have been proposed as additional predictors. In this study we assessed the rate of AoR dilation and stiffness in adult patients with MFS. We performed a retrospective chart review. We included adult patients with MFS (aged 20-40 years) with at least 2 local echocardiograms 6 months apart (no aortic surgery in-between). A blinded observer analyzed the echocardiograms. AoR dilation rate and stiffness were calculated. Thirty-two patients (53% women; median age, 21.1; interquartile range [IQR], 19-24 years at first echocardiogram) were included. AoR dilation rate in the entire cohort was 0 to 8 mm/year (median, 0.465; IQR, 0.23-1.45 mm/year). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that baseline AoR stiffness was associated with AoR dilation rate (β = 0.0004; <i>P</i> < .001 for elastic modulus), whereas baseline age and baseline AoR dimension were not. Eighteen of these 32 patients (56%) eventually had AoR surgery (Sx) and 14 did not have surgery (NSx). At baseline, Sx and NSx patients were similar in age. AoR dimension was larger (Sx, 4.27 cm; IQR, 4.05-4.49 cm vs NSx, 3.73 cm; IQR, 3.37-4.09 cm; <i>P</i> = .011) and AoR stiffness was higher in Sx patients (beta stiffness index: median, 23.2; IQR, 17.8-28.6 vs median, 15.6; IQR, 11.6-19.7; <i>P</i> = .024). AoR dilation rate was greater in Sx patients, independent of baseline AoR dimension (1.63 ± 0.41 mm/year vs 0.38 ± 0.08 mm/year; <i>P</i> = .01). Our results showed that AoR dilation rate varies among adult patients with MFS and is associated with baseline AoR stiffness, measured by echocardiography. Further studies are warranted to determine how aortic stiffness can be implemented clinically to refine management in patients with MFS."

    "abstract": "Background Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder affecting multiple systems, particularly the cardiovascular system. The leading causes of death in MFS are aortopathies and valvular disease. We wanted to identify the frequency of arrhythmia and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, length of hospital stay, health care-associated costs (HAC), and in-hospital mortality in patients with MFS. Methods and Results The National Inpatient Sample database from 2005 to 2014 was queried using <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification</i> (<i>ICD-9-CM</i>) codes for MFS and arrhythmias. Patients were classified into subgroups: supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia (VT), atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and without any type of arrhythmia. Data about length of stay, HAC, and in-hospital mortality were also abstracted from National Inpatient Sample database. Adjusted HAC was calculated as multiplying HAC and cost-to-charge ratio; 12 079 MFS hospitalizations were identified; 1893 patients (15.7%) had an arrhythmia; and 4.9% of the patients had postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Median values of length of stay and adjusted HAC in VT group were the highest among the groups (VT: 6 days, $18 975.8; supraventricular tachycardia: 4 days, $11 906.6; atrial flutter: 4 days, $11 274.5; atrial fibrillation: 5 days, $10431.4; without any type of arrhythmia: 4 days, $8336.6; both <i>P</i>=0.0001). VT group had highest in-patient mortality (VT: 5.3%, atrial fibrillation: 4.1%, without any type of arrhythmia: 2.1%, atrial flutter: 1.7%, supraventricular tachycardia: 0%; <i>P</i><0.0001) even after adjustment for potential confounders (without any type of arrhythmia versus VT; odds ratio [95% CI]: 3.18 [1.62-6.24], <i>P</i>=0.001). Conclusions Arrhythmias and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in MFS were high and associated with increased length of stay, HAC, and in-hospital mortality especially in patients with VT."

    "abstract": "Fibulin-3 (F3 or EFEMP1) is a disulfide-rich, secreted glycoprotein necessary for maintaining extracellular matrix (ECM) and connective tissue integrity. Three studies have identified distinct autosomal recessive F3 mutations in individuals with Marfan Syndrome-like phenotypes. Herein, we characterize how one of these mutations, c.163T>C; p.Cys55Arg (C55R), disrupts F3 secretion, quaternary structure, and function by forming unique extracellular disulfide-linked homodimers. Dual cysteine mutants suggest that the C55R-induced disulfide species forms because of the new availability of Cys70 on adjacent F3 monomers. Surprisingly, mutation of single cysteines located near Cys55 (i.e., Cys29, Cys42, Cys48, Cys61, Cys70, Cys159, and Cys171) also produced similar extracellular disulfide-linked dimers, suggesting that this is not a phenomenon isolated to the C55R mutant. To assess C55R functionality, F3 knockout (KO) retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells were generated, followed by reintroduction of wild-type (WT) or C55R F3. F3 KO cells produced lower levels of the ECM remodeling enzyme, matrix metalloproteinase 2, and reduced formation of collagen VI ECM filaments, both of which were partially rescued by WT F3 overexpression. However, C55R F3 was unable to compensate for these same ECM-related defects. Our results highlight the unique behavior of particular cysteine mutations in F3 and uncover potential routes to restore C55R F3 loss-of-function."

    "abstract": "The Japanese Network of Cardiovascular Departments for Adult Congenital Heart Disease (JNCVD-ACHD) was founded in 2011 for the lifelong care of adult patients with congenital heart disease (ACHD patients). This network maintains the first Japanese ACHD registry. From 2011 to 2019, the JNCVD-ACHD registered 54 institutions providing specialized care for ACHD patients in 32 of the 47 prefectures in Japan. The registry collected data on the disease profile for 24,048 patients from 50 institutions and the patient characteristics for 9743 patients from 24 institutions. The most common ACHDs were atrial septal defect (20.5 %), ventricular septal defect (20.5 %), tetralogy of Fallot (12.9 %), and univentricular heart (UVH)/single ventricle (SV; 6.6 %). ACHD patients without biventricular repair accounted for 37.0 % of the population. Also examined were the serious anatomical and/or pathophysiological disorders such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (3.0 %) including Eisenmenger syndrome (1.2 %), systemic right ventricle under biventricular circulation (sRV-2VC; 2.8 %), and Fontan physiology (6.0 %). The sRV-2VC cases comprised congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries without anatomical repair (61.9 %) and transposition of the great arteries with atrial switching surgery (38.1 %). The primary etiology (86.4 %) for Fontan physiology was UVH/SV. In addition, developmental/chromosomal/genetic disorders were heterotaxy syndromes (asplenia, 0.9 %; polysplenia, 0.7 %), trisomy 21 (4.0 %), 22q11.2 deletion (0.9 %), Turner syndrome (0.2 %), and Marfan syndrome (1.1 %). Although the specific management of ACHD has systematically progressed in Japan, this approach is still evolving. For ideal ACHD care, the prospective goals for the JNCVD-ACHD are to create local networks and provide a resource for multicenter clinical trials to support evidence-based practice."

The suspending CTR was clipped to anterior capsule to support it, which was secured to the sclera with a double-flange polypropylene suture. Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), tilt, and decentration of the intraocular lens (IOL) and postoperative complications were evaluated. All 16 patients were successfully implanted with suspended CTR and IOL after femtosecond laser assisted surgery. Visual acuity improved significantly after surgery (<i>p</i> < 0.01). At 1 month, 3 months and 6 months postoperatively, the tilt of the IOL was 2.70 ± 0.934, 2.65 ± 0.897, and 2.66 ± 0.781, and the decentration of the IOL was 0.30 ± 0.770, 0.30 ± 0.682, and 0.29 ± 0.737; both had no statistically significant difference between the three groups. After the operation, 4 patients had hyphema and 2 patients experienced a temporary postoperative IOP increase. Only one flange was exposed one month after operation and recovered right after secondary adjustment. Femtosecond laser combined with double-flange polypropylene suture CTR suspension was effective in fixing the lens capsule to the scleral wall in cases of subluxation of lens seen in Marfan syndrome during our short-term observation. The long-term efficacy of this operation needs further observation and follow-up."

ICD codes were used to select those with a type A aortic dissection or aneurysm. There was a total of 19,567 cases, giving the estimated incidence of MFS and EDS of 18 and 22.4 per 100k people, respectively. After inclusion criteria, there were 2553 MF and 180 EDS patients. There was no statistical difference in mortality between the MFS and EDS cohorts (4.6% vs. 2.8%, p = .26). EDS patients were more likely to undergo a TEVAR procedure (2.8% vs. 1.0%, p = .03). MF patients were more likely to have a complication of acute kidney injury (p = .02). EDS patients were more likely older (50 vs. 42, p < .001) and female (47% vs. 33%, p < .001). MFS patients were more likely to have a type A aortic dissection (44% vs. 31%, p < .001). The majority (89%) of patients were treated at urban teaching hospitals. On univariable logistic regression, aortic dissection was a predictor for mortality (odds ratio 7.31, p < .001). The type of connective tissue disease was not a significant predictor. National level estimates show low mortality for patients with MF or ED presenting to the hospital with aortic dissection or aneurysm. The differences in age and gender can guide surveillance for these patient populations, leading to more elective admissions and reduced hospital mortality."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS1) is an autosomal dominant condition causing aortopathy including fatal aortic dissection. This study aimed to perform clinical PGT-M in a family with a history of MFS1 for two generations. A family with two members affected by MFS1 approached the hospital for PGT-M. The couple decided to join the project following extensive counselling and informed consent was obtained. The mutation contributory to MFS1 was identified using whole-exome sequencing (WES). A novel PGT-M protocol using multiplex fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing was developed and tested. Ten blastocysts were subjected to PGT-M in two clinical PGT cycles. Mini-sequencing revealed four normal and six affected embryos. Microsatellite-based linkage analysis confirmed mutation analysis results in all samples. The embryos diagnosed as normal (non-MFS1) were chosen for transfer. A pregnancy was obtained in the third embryo transfer. Invasive prenatal diagnosis confirmed the normal genotype of the baby. This study demonstrated comprehensive management using the application of clinical-based diagnosis, WES for mutation identification within the MFS1 gene, mini-sequencing for embryo selection and microsatellite-based linkage analysis for backup of PGT-M results and contamination detection to assist couples in having a healthy child when there was a family history of Marfan syndrome.Impact Statement<b>What is already known on this subject?</b> Marfan syndrome (MFS1, OMIM#154700) is an autosomal dominant condition causing aortopathy including fatal aortic dissection. Pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) is an alternative to traditional invasive prenatal diagnosis (PND) giving the couples the chance of starting pregnancy with the confidence that the baby will be unaffected. Most of the previous PGT reports employed microsatellite-based linkage analysis. A few PGT studies used sequencing, mini-sequencing and mutation analysis; however, the details of the techniques were not described.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> Single-cell PCR protocol using multiplex fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing was developed and validated. Two clinical PGTs cycles for Marfan syndrome were performed. A healthy baby was resulted. The details of multiplex fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing protocols are described in this study so that the procedures can be reproduced.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> Embryo selection can help the family suffering from Marfan syndrome for two generations to start a pregnancy with confidence that their child will be unaffected. This study also shows the use of a mini-sequencing protocol for PGT, which can be a universal protocol for other mutations by changing the PCR primers and mini-sequencing primers."

To the best of our knowledge, type A aortic dissection due to endocrine diseases has been rarely reported. Here, we present a case of acute type A aortic dissection due to primary aldosteronism in a young man with adrenal adenoma. Total arch replacement was successfully performed. Postoperative imaging and endocrine evaluation revealed an adrenal adenoma. This study highlights the importance of considering primary aldosteronism as a potential etiology of acute aortic dissection in young adults. Generally, direct or indirect causes of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) are highly diversified. We tend to suspect the familial aortic diseases such as Marfan syndrome when patients with ATAAD are young adults. By contrast, it is useful to know that endocrine diseases such as primary aldosteronism with functional adenoma can be risk factors of ATAAD in young adults."

Notably however, the risk of periodontal disease in MFS patients affected by an aortic aneurysm or dissection has not yet been clarified. We investigated the periodontal condition in the following three groups: MFS patients diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm or dissection with a planned aortic surgery (MFS surgery), MFS patients who had already undergone aortic surgery (MFS post-surgery) and healthy control patients (Healthy). The periodontal condition of all of these patients was evaluated at their first visit, reassessed again at two-month after the first visit, and evaluated again at a six-month follow-up after the reassessment. A total of 14 participants, 3 MFS surgery patients, 4 MFS post-surgery patients and 7 healthy control volunteers were examined. Saliva examinations revealed no significant differences between any of the groups at the first visit, reassessment, or follow-up. Interestingly, the MFS surgery cases showed a higher BOP and PISA at the first visit and follow-up compared with the other groups. In contrast, the MFS surgery patients showed an improvement in their LVDd and EF values, both markers of cardiac function, at the reassessment and follow-up compared with the first visit. MFS associated with an aortic aneurysm or dissection leads to a higher risk of periodontal disease, indicating the need for more frequent oral hygiene maintenance in these patients. In addition, MFS patients who undergo frequent professional cleaning of their teeth show a lower onset of cardiovascular disease, suggesting that professional oral hygiene in these cases contributes to a healthier condition."

P/LP variants were present in 34 participants. The average penetrance across genes was 59%, ranging from 86% for FBN1 variants to 25% for SMAD3. Of 16 participants in whom results were returned, 1-year outcomes occurred in 63%. A new diagnosis was made in 44% of the participants, 56% were referred to a specialist, a new test was ordered in 44%, surveillance was initiated in 31%, and a new medication was started in 31%. Penetrance of P/LP variants in arteriopathy-related genes, identified in a large, targeted sequencing study, was variable and overall lower than that reported in clinical cohorts. Meaningful outcomes within the first year were noted in 63% of participants who received results."

    "abstract": "<b>Purpose:</b> To describe a patient with Marfan syndrome and crystalline lens luxation who developed phacolytic glaucoma with polychromatic crystals in the anterior chamber and vitreous. <b>Methods:</b> We present a retrospective case report. <b>Results:</b> A 58-year-old man with Marfan syndrome and crystalline lens luxation since childhood presented with 2 days of pain in the left eye. The visual acuity was 20/30 OS with an aphakic contact lens, and the intraocular pressure (IOP) was 31 mm Hg. Polychromatic crystals were evident in the anterior chamber and vitreous. The retina was attached. Despite medical treatment, the IOP remained elevated; therefore, a pars plana vitrectomy and lensectomy were performed. At the last follow-up, the IOP was normal and the retina remained attached. <b>Conclusions:</b> Phacolytic glaucoma can be seen in eyes with a subluxated or luxated mature or hypermature lens. In these rare cases, iridescent crystals can be observed in the aqueous and vitreous. Vitrectomy with lensectomy is the definitive treatment."

    "abstract": "Traboulsi syndrome, otherwise known as facial dysmorphism, lens dislocation, anterior-segment abnormalities and spontaneous filtering blebs, is an autosomal recessive condition associated with characteristic ocular features including dislocated crystalline lenses, anterior segment abnormalities and in some individuals, non-traumatic conjunctival cysts. There is a distinctive facial appearance which includes flattened malar region with convex nasal ridge. Alterations in the aspartate beta-hydroxylase (ASPH) gene are known to be the cause of the condition. We report seven further individuals from six unrelated families with characteristic ocular and facial features. Five individuals had aortic root dilatation, with childhood onset in some, and one undergoing aortic root repair aged 47 years for severe aortic regurgitation and aortic root dilatation. Interestingly, inguinal hernias were commonly reported. Although some skeletal features were seen, these were not consistent. One of the patients had mild deficiency of factor VII on clotting studies. The ASPH protein hydroxylates specific asparagine- and aspartate-residues in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-domain containing proteins including coagulation factors and associated genes including FBN1. We propose this as an explanation for the overlap in clinical features with Marfan syndrome and conclude that Traboulsi syndrome is an important differential diagnosis. We strongly recommend echocardiography surveillance for patients with Traboulsi syndrome."

    "title": "Chest wall deformities and their possible associations with different genetic syndromes.",
    "abstract": "Our primary objective was to identify discrete and syndromic cases of Pectus excavatum (PE) and Pectus carinatum (PC). We also intended to highlight the significance of further genetic exploration in clinically suspected syndromic cases of PC and PE. Pectus excavatum (PE) and Pectus carinatum (PC) are the most common morphological chest wall deformities. Although various hypotheses have been put forth, the pathogenesis of both entities is largely unknown. Clinicians often refer such cases for further genetic evaluation to exclude an associated underlying connective tissue disorder or a syndrome. Additionally, a detailed anamnesis with focused family history and thorough dysmorphological physical examination was done. PE and PC are considered isolated abnormalities if there is the absence of features of other syndromes, eliminating the need for further genetic evaluations. It is believed that the pattern of inheritance of these non-syndromic isolated PE and PC cases with positive family history could be multifactorial in nature. The recurrence risk of such isolated cases is thought to be low. Further diagnostic studies are indicated as PE and PC could be a part of a syndrome. Among the many syndromes, the most common monogenic syndromes associated with PE and PC are Marfan's and Noonan's. After obtaining the consent, we compiled a database of the patients who presented with chest wall deformities during the period 2017-2019. We selected 70 cases with PC and PE deformities to identify the discrete and syndromic PC and PE cases. During the study, we perused the cytogenetic and/or molecular analyses, that had been conducted to confirm the clinically suspected syndromic cases. We also scrutinized for the presence of PC and PE cases that are associated with the rare syndrome (s). Various genetic abnormalities were identified in 28 (40%) of the 70 cases that had been diagnosed with chest wall abnormalities. Along with PE and PC, other thoracic wall abnormalities were also identified, such as the broad chest, bell-shaped thorax, and elongated or enlarged thorax. One case of a rare genetic disorder of Morquio syndrome associated with PC was also identified. Novel (previously unpublished) genomic variants are reported here. It is important to delve deeper when encountering cases of PE and PC by conducting a further genetic exploration of such cases to identify syndromic associations that cause other structural and functional disorders, diagnosis of which might be missed during the early developmental period. Early identification of such disorders may help us correcting the defects, slowing the progression of disease processes, and preparing better to deal with the potential outcome."

    "abstract": "Root reimplantation has been the favoured approach for patients with heritable aortic disorder requiring valve-sparring root replacement. In the past few years, root remodelling with annuloplasty has emerged as an alternative to root reimplantation in the general population. The aim of this study was to examine the late outcomes of patients with heritable aortic disorder undergoing valve-sparring root replacement and compare different techniques. Using the AVIATOR registry (Aortic Valve Insufficiency and ascending aorta Aneurysm InternATiOnal Registry), data were collected from 5 North American and European centres. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the technique of valve-sparing used (root reimplantation, root remodelling with ring annuloplasty, root remodelling with suture annuloplasty and root remodelling alone). The primary endpoints were freedom from aortic regurgitation (AR) ≥2 and freedom from reintervention on the aortic valve. Secondary endpoints were survival and changes in annular dimensions over time. A total of 237 patients were included in the study (reimplantation = 100, remodelling + ring annuloplasty = 76, remodelling + suture annuloplasty = 34, remodelling alone = 27). The majority of patients had Marfan syndrome (83%). Preoperative AR ≥2 was present in 41% of the patients. Operative mortality was 0.4% (n = 1). No differences were found between techniques in terms of postoperative AR ≥2 (P = 0.58), reintervention (P = 0.52) and survival (P = 0.59). Changes in aortic annulus dimension were significantly different at 10 years (P < 0.05), a difference that started to emerge 4 years after surgery. Overall, valve-sparring root replacement is a safe and durable procedure in patients with heritable aortic disorder. Nevertheless, root remodelling alone is associated with late annular dilatation. The addition of an annuloplasty, however, results in similar freedom from AR, reintervention, survival and changes in annulus size compared to reimplantation."

Demographic, operative and clinical data were reviewed, and the preoperative, postoperative, and latest follow-up radiographic parameters were compared. Twelve patients were identified (2 males, 10 females) with an average age at surgery of 14.4 ± 2.6 years. Comorbidities were found in 84.6%. Most patients (90.9%) presented with a right thoracic curve. The average preoperative Cobb angle was 75.6 ± 15.5 degrees. Posterior instrumented spinal fusion was performed in all patients (1 hook/pedicular screw and 11 pedicle screws only). The average follow-up period was 6.8 ± 3.1 years. The mean postoperative Cobb angle after surgery and at the final follow-up was 33.4 ± 18.0 degrees and 35.5 ± 18.4 degrees, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference among the preoperative and postoperative Cobb angles (p < 0.001), but no significant difference among the sagittal angles. Two perioperative complications including superficial wound infection and broken rods were observed. Posterior scoliosis correction and instrumented spinal fusion resulted in a satisfactory outcome in MF patients. Perioperative complications are not uncommon; however, no neurological complication or spinal decompensation was observed in this study. IV."

The diagnosis relies on clinical presentation and family history to guide genetic testing with next-generation sequencing (NGS) for identification of gene variants in HCTDs. NGS was performed on a cohort of 100 consecutive, unrelated patients referred for a connective tissue disorder at Fulgent Genetics, an accredited commercial laboratory. One hundred seventeen gene variants were found in 76 patients with 10 recognized pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants seen in nine patients. The remaining variants were grouped as unknown clinical significance with 36 meeting three out of four pathogenicity criteria, or potentially pathogenic, as defined in our study in 33 patients. They were judged as potentially pathogenic for clinical care and management with disease surveillance based on the specific gene and phenotypic presentation. Gene variants in collagen-related proteins were the most frequent with ZNF469 and ADAMTSL2 variants most often identified. Joint hypermobility was the most frequent clinical finding. Variants were found in 76% of patients who had distinct clinical features of a HCTD. The data were stratified to provide insight into frequency and types of variants, their classification, and clinical manifestations."

    "abstract": "The Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) trial showed similar efficacy of β-blockers (BB) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) for aortic root dilation in Marfan syndrome, but the impact on prescription practices is unknown. We hypothesized BB and ARB prescriptions would increase after the trial results were published (2014). Prescription data (2007-2016) were obtained from outpatient encounters (IBM Marketscan) for Marfan syndrome patients (6 months-25 years old). Excluding 2014 as a washout period, we analyzed two intervals: 2007-2013 and 2015-2016. Medication categories included BB, ARB, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), combination (BB/ARB and/or BB/ACEI), and no drug. Interrupted time-series analysis assessed immediate level change after publication and change in slope for the trend pre- and post-publication. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals from logistic regressions and generalized estimating equation methods accounted for correlation of prescriptions within patients. In 1499 patients (age 14.1 ± 6.1 years, 59% female) seen 2007-2013, BB trended lower [OR 0.91 (0.89, 0.93), p < 0.001] and ARB trended higher [OR 1.12 (1.07, 1.18), p < 0.001], while combination, ACEI, and no drug remained stable. This trend persisted, but was not significant, for BB [OR 0.54 (0.27, 1.08), p = 0.37] and ARB [OR 1.91 (0.55, 6.69), p = 0.31] in 2015-2016. Combination, ACEI, and no drug remained similar. In short term follow-up, changes in prescription practices following publication of the PHN trial were not statistically significant. This may be due to a change seen prior to publication with early adoption of ARBs that was maintained after confirmation of their effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Scoliosis is one of the symptoms manifested by patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS). Deformity of the thoracic cavity due to severe scoliosis may cause difficulty during cardiac surgery in terms of the surgical approach and instrument manipulation; however, only a few reports have been available regarding the surgical case of MFS with severe scoliosis. Here, we report a case of combined aortic valve replacement and left atrial appendage closure in a patient with MFS who had severe scoliosis using lower hemisternotomy. A 62-year-old female with MFS was referred to our hospital after being diagnosed with severe aortic regurgitation and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a history of cerebral thromboembolism. The aortic valve showed severe insufficiency due to cusp prolapse, whereas the aortic root was moderately dilated (42 mm). Echocardiography revealed severe regurgitation with reduced left ventricular ejection function (32%) and massive left ventricular diastolic dimension (88 mm). Moreover, combined aortic valve replacement and left atrial appendage closure was indicated. However, the patient had chest deformity due to severe scoliosis. Thus, conventional full sternotomy or thoracotomy was considered an inappropriate surgical approach. Lower hemisternotomy was selected on the basis of three-dimensional reconstruction imaging of the aorta, left atrial appendage, sternum, and rib. Sternal elevation and rib retraction with the costal arch folded back provided enough surgical field for the combined procedures to be safely conducted. The postoperative course was uneventful, except for predicted prolonged mechanical ventilation with the assistance of intraaortic balloon pumping. Thereafter, the patient has been free from any cardiac and cerebrovascular event. Lower hemisternotomy can be useful for combined cardiac surgery in MFS with severe scoliosis."

    "abstract": "The main challenge in diagnosing and managing thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAA/D) is represented by the early detection of a disease that is both deadly and \"elusive\", as it generally grows asymptomatically prior to rupture, leading to death in the majority of cases. Gender differences exist in aortic dissection in terms of incidence and treatment options. Efforts have been made to identify biomarkers that may help in early diagnosis and in detecting those patients at a higher risk of developing life-threatening complications. As soon as the hereditability of the TAA/D was demonstrated, several genetic factors were found to be associated with both the syndromic and non-syndromic forms of the disease, and they currently play a role in patient diagnosis/prognosis and management-guidance purposes. Likewise, circulating biomarker could represent a valuable resource in assisting the diagnosis, and several studies have attempted to identify specific molecules that may help with risk stratification outside the emergency department. Even if promising, those data lack specificity/sensitivity, and, in most cases, they need more testing before entering the \"clinical arena\". This review summarizes the state of the art of the laboratory in TAA/D diagnostics, with particular reference to the current and future role of molecular-genetic testing."

Patients enrolled in the International E-vita Open Registry (IEOR) who underwent FET procedure between January 2001 and February 2020 meeting Ghent criteria for MFS were included in the study. Early and midterm results were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative, postoperative and follow-up computed tomography angiography scans were analysed. We analyzed 37 patients [mean age 38 ± 11 years, 65% men]. Acute or chronic aortic dissection was present in 35 (95%) patients (14 and 21 patients respectively). Two (5%) patients had an aneurysm without dissection. Malperfusion syndrome was present in 4 patients. Twenty-nine (78%) patients had history of aortic surgical interventions. The 30-day and in-hospital mortality amounted to 8 and 14% respectively. False lumen exclusion was present in 73% in stented segment in last postoperative CT. The overall 5-year survival was 71% and freedom from reintervention downstream was 58% at 5 years. Of the nine patients who required reintervention for distal aortic disease, one patient died. FET operation for patients with MFS can be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity. In long-term follow-up no reinterventions on the aortic arch were required.

Subjects were separated into SAS positive (SAS<sup>+</sup>) and SAS negative (SAS<sup>-</sup>) cohorts, based on the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) and the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI). We next analyzed variables between the SAS<sup>+</sup> and SAS<sup>-</sup> groups. 155, out of 198 AAD patients, were enlisted for this study. SAS<sup>+</sup> patients exhibited higher rates of pneumonia (p < 0.001), heart failure (HF, p = 0.038), acute kidney injury (AKI, p = 0.001), ventilation time (p = 0.009), and hospitalization duration (p < 0.001). According to subsequent follow-ups, the unstented aorta false lumen dilatation (FLD) rate increased markedly, with increasing degree of SAS (p < 0.001, according to AHI and ODI). The SAS<sup>+</sup> patients exhibited worse cumulative survival rate (p = 0.025). The significant risk factors (RF) for poor survival were: severe (p = 0.002) or moderate SAS (p = 0.008), prolonged ventilation time (p = 0.018), AKI (p = 0.015), HF New York Heart Association (NYHA) IV (p = 0.005) or III (p = 0.015), pneumonia (p = 0.005), Marfan syndrome (p = 0.010), systolic blood pressure (BP) upon arrival (p = 0.009), and BMI ≥ 30 (p = 0.004).

Symptoms may lead to diminished quality of life (QoL) in individuals with MFS compared with healthy individuals. Currently, there is little evidence regarding the impact of MFS on swallowing and QoL. This study examined perceptions of swallowing difficulties and QoL among persons with MFS. A total of 356 participants (1% response rate) with a self-reported diagnosis of MFS provided medication regime and completed a Quality-of-Life Index and a modified version of the SWAL-QOL used to assess 8 QOL concepts related to swallowing: burden, duration, desire, food choice, fear, mental health, social concerns, and fatigue. Dysphagia symptoms were reported by 62% (N = 356) of the participants. Analyses assessing correlations between responses to SWAL-QOL questions, QoL scores, and reported medications were conducted. Further, responses on the SWAL-QOL predicted QoL satisfaction, even after controlling for medications. Findings revealed that greater swallowing difficulty affects QoL satisfaction and overall QoL, but not QoL importance. Further, specific medications were associated with differences in swallowing difficulty as well as QoL satisfaction. The findings of the current study suggest that individuals with MFS may experience specific swallowing difficulties which impact QoL. Specific classes of drugs may also be associated with reported swallowing QoL and QoL satisfaction in MFS. These findings have implications for clinicians who work with individuals with MFS."

Thirteen years later, an aortic aneurysm with chronic aortic dissection was diagnosed, and partial aortic arch replacement was performed. Twenty years after the first procedure, a 73-mm left coronary button aneurysm was observed. Due to dense adhesions from repeated surgeries, we approached the aneurysm through the artificial graft lumen, and the coronary artery was successfully reconstructed using Piehler's technique. When performing aortic root surgery for Marfan syndrome, the risk of coronary artery button aneurysm formation should be considered.

Increased incidence of complications of surgery in such situations is expected to be more likely than in surgery for a single aneurysm, particularly in the absence of intraoperative guidance with adjuncts. We report a case of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm, a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm, and a right pericallosal aneurysm in a 70-year-old man. All 3 aneurysms were clipped through a single-stage approach without the aid of any adjuncts such as micro-Doppler ultrasonography, indocyanine green videoangiography, or intraoperative digital subtraction angiography. We carried out a literature review for past publications on similar reports. The patient made a complete postoperative recovery and sustained no neurologic deficits. Out of 388 publications from the literature search, only 1 case report described clipping of 2 tandem aneurysms in a 60-year-old woman without mentioning any intraoperative adjuncts. This case illustrates that multiple aneurysms can actually be safely operated with adequate planning in the absence of these adjuncts, especially in resource-poor regions. This is particularly crucial in Africa and most low-and-middle-income countries, where such facilities and equipment are not common."

Disparate responses to disease-causing <i>Fbn1</i> variants by these lineages are proposed to promote focal aortic root aneurysm formation in Marfan syndrome (MFS), but lineage-stratified SMC analysis in vivo is lacking. We generated SHF lineage-traced MFS mice and performed integrated multiomic (single-cell RNA and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing) analysis stratified by embryological origin. SMC subtypes were spatially identified via RNA in situ hybridization. Response to <i>TWIST1</i> overexpression was determined via lentiviral transduction in human aortic SMCs. Lineage stratification enabled nuanced characterization of aortic root cells. We identified heightened SHF-derived SMC heterogeneity including a subset of <i>Tnnt2</i> (cardiac troponin T)-expressing cells distinguished by altered proteoglycan expression. MFS aneurysm-associated SMC phenotypic modulation was identified in both SHF-traced and nontraced (neural crest-derived) SMCs; however, transcriptomic responses were distinct between lineages. SHF-derived modulated SMCs overexpressed collagen synthetic genes and small leucine-rich proteoglycans while nontraced SMCs activated chondrogenic genes. These modulated SMCs clustered focally in the aneurysmal aortic root at the region of SHF/neural crest lineage overlap. Integrated RNA-assay for transposase-accessible chromatin analysis identified enriched <i>Twist1</i> and <i>Smad2/3/4</i> complex binding motifs in SHF-derived modulated SMCs. TWIST1 overexpression promoted collagen and <i>SLRP</i> gene expression in vitro, suggesting TWIST1 may drive SHF-enriched collagen synthesis in MFS aneurysm. SMCs derived from both SHF and neural crest lineages undergo phenotypic modulation in MFS aneurysm but are defined by subtly distinct transcriptional responses. Enhanced TWIST1 transcription factor activity may contribute to enriched collagen synthetic pathways SHF-derived SMCs in MFS."

A 24-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome presented with polyuria, recurrent urinary tract infections, and renal injury for 3 months along with a globose abdomen, with a palpable mass in the middle and lower third of the abdomen that was massive on percussion. MRI showed an ASM consisting of two cystic lesions measuring 15.4 × 14.3 × 15.8 and 6.7 × 6.1 × 5.9 cm, respectively, compressing the distal third of the right ureter and causing a hydroureteronephrosis. Drainage and ligature of the cystic lesion were performed. The urinary outcome was excellent, with full recovery after surgery. ASM should be suspected in all abdominal masses with progressive symptoms in the setting of Marfan syndrome.

    "abstract": "There is currently insufficient evidence of correlation between on-admission serum uric acid and in-hospital mortality of patients with acute type A aortic dissection. Thus, this study analysed the relation between serum uric acid and in-hospital deaths in patients with acute type A aortic dissection. A total of 1048 patients with acute type A aortic dissection participated in this study between January 2010 and December 2018. The independent variable was on-admission serum uric acid, whilst the dependent variable was in-hospital deaths. The covariates of the study included patient age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, Marfan syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, chronic renal insufficiency, stroke, atherosclerosis, time to presentation, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, aortic diameter, aortic regurgitation, abdominal vessel involvement, arch vessel involvement, ejection fraction value, laboratory parameters, symptom, coronary malperfusion, mesenteric malperfusion, cerebral malperfusion, hypotension/shock, cardiac tamponade and operation status. The mean age of the sample was 50.17 ± 11.47 years, with approximately 24.24% of the participants being female. After analysis, it was found that the admission serum uric acid of patients with acute type A aortic dissection was positively correlated with in-hospital death (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06). Subsequently, a non-linear relationship was determined between admission serum uric acid (point 260 µmol/L) and in-hospital mortality for patients with acute type A aortic dissection. The effect sizes and confidence intervals of the right (serum uric acid > 260 µmol/L) and left (serum uric acid ≤ 260 µmol/L) aspects of the inflection point were 1.04 (1.02-1.05) and 1.00 (0.99-1.02), respectively. Furthermore, subgroup analysis indicated a stable relationship between serum uric acid and in-hospital mortality, whilst an insignificant difference was found for the interactions between different subgroups. Overall, a non-linear correlation was determined between admission serum uric acid and in-hospital mortality of patients with acute type A aortic dissection. When serum uric acid > 260 µmol/L, it showed a positive correlation with in-hospital mortality."

    "title": "Improved Outcomes of Reimplantation vs Remodeling in Marfan Syndrome: A Propensity-Matched Study.",
    "abstract": "Valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) has excellent outcomes when performed in experienced centers in well-selected patients. It is suggested that reimplantation of the aortic valve may have better durability than remodeling in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS), although long-term comparative data are limited. Between 1988 and 2018, 194 patients with MFS underwent VSRR at our institution. From these, we derived a propensity-matched cohort of 68 patients (44 who underwent reimplantation and 24 who had remodeling). Early outcomes included death and perioperative complications. Late outcomes were survival, probability of aortic insufficiency, and reintervention up to 20 years of follow-up. Median follow-up was 17.8 years (interquartile range, 12.0-20.6 years) for the entire matched cohort. Baseline variables were similar between reimplantation and remodeling patients after matching: age (39 ± 12 vs 40 ± 13 years, P = .75) and male sex (28 [64%] vs 15 [63%], P = 1.0). Similar 20-year survival was observed after reimplantation compared with remodeling (82% vs 72%, P = .20), whereas the probability of developing greater than mild aortic insufficiency at 20 years was increased after remodeling (5.8% vs 13%, P = .013). More patients underwent reoperation on the aortic valve after a remodeling procedure than after reimplantation of the aortic valve (18% vs 0%, P = .018). VSRR provides excellent long-term survival and freedom from valve-related complications outcomes in patients with MFS. Reimplantation of the aortic valve was associated with a lower risk of aortic valve reoperation and aortic insufficiency than the remodeling procedure after 2 decades of follow-up."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder of the fibrous connective tissue caused by pathogenic mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. Neonatal Marfan syndrome is a rare type of Marfan syndrome that is genotypically and phenotypically different from classical Marfan syndrome and has a poor prognosis. Most patients with neonatal Marfan syndrome die during infancy due to severe and rapidly progressive cardiovascular disorders. Here, we present a case of an 11-year-old girl with neonatal Marfan syndrome due to a novel missense mutation in exon 27 of the fibrillin-1 gene. Her condition was critical due to progressive mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Mitral valve replacement, performed at the age of 6 months, improved her critical condition. Our case suggests that early mitral valve replacement may lead to better outcomes in patients with neonatal Marfan syndrome."

We therefore report on a rare occurrence of coarctation of the aorta with arterial tortuosity syndrome in a teenage female who initially presented with severe resistant hypertension, providing additional literature to aid in the differential diagnosis of COA with ATS. Cinematic rendering delivered a markedly enhanced view of the condition, allowing for greater accuracy in the diagnosis."

Objectives: to analyze the main clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients with Takayasu arteritis (TA), Marfan syndrome (MS) and similar conditions that were treated with cardiothoracic surgery and peripheral endovascular intervention. Retrospective and descriptive cohort study that included patients of any age and gender with TA (as per the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology and EULAR/PRINTO), MS (according to Ghent criteria), and similar conditions who underwent cardiothoracic surgery or peripheral endovascular intervention. Data were collected from electronic charts. A total of 77 patients with TA and 135 patients with MS and similar conditions were included. The frequency of surgical or interventional requirements in patients with TA and MS/similar conditions was 77/364 (21.2%) and 135/300 (45%), respectively; such patients were followed for a median of 6 [2-12] and 3.29 (0.42-6.62) years, with (maximum follow-up range of 47 and 21.37 years, respectively). Aneurysms were present in 11 (14.3%) and 66 (48.9%) in patients with TA and MS/similar conditions, respectively. Aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve damage occurred in 8 (10.4%) patients, 4 (5.2%) patients and 1 (1.3%) patient with TA, respectively; corresponding frequencies in patients with MS/similar conditions were 98 (72.6%), 50 (37.0%) and 20 (14.8%). We identified that 20% of patients with TA died after 5.08 years (95% CI: 0.23-25.42 years) and 20 % of the patients with MS and other similar conditions died after 7.52 years (95% CI: 1.10-9.02 years). The frequency of surgical intervention was low in this study. Long-term prognosis is good if surgery is performed in a timely manner. Epidemiological studies provide relevant information for public health decisions related to the management of orphan rheumatological diseases."

There were differences in cell subclusters and function between hypertension and Marfan patients. The cells also had different differentiations. Cellchat identified cell ligand-receptor interactions that were associated with hypertension and Marfan-induced AD involving SMC, fibroblast, mo-macrophages, and T-cell subsets. This study revealed the heterogeneity of cellular components and gene changes in hypertension and Marfan-induced AD. Through functional analysis and the changes in intercellular communication, the possible mechanisms of different causes of AD were explained from a new perspective, so we can better understand the occurrence and development of diseases."

The subdural hematoma characteristics, possible etiologies, and treatment, as well as the patient outcomes, were analyzed. A retrospective examination was made of pediatric patients with subdural hematoma who were operated on at Ümraniye Training and Research Hospital. Patients with a history of trauma were excluded. Data on patient sex, age, bleeding location, type of hematoma based on computed tomography imaging, surgical treatment, presenting symptoms, presence of comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale, thrombocyte counts, and international normalized ratio values were recorded. Of the 19 patients included in the study, 4 were female and 15 were male. Their ages ranged between 0 and 15 (mean = 5.84) years. In 57.8% of the patients, comorbidities, including acute myeloid leukemia, a history of shunt operation, epilepsy, mucopolysaccharidosis, known subdural effusion, autism, coagulopathy, ventricular septal defect/tetralogy of Fallot, cerebrospinal fluid leakage after baclofen pump administration, Marfan's syndrome, and late neonatal sepsis were present, while 21% had arachnoid cysts and 21% had no reported comorbidities. This study suggests that, in pediatric patients with subdural hematoma with an amount of bleeding requiring surgical management, any underlying comorbidities should be investigated regardless of the presence of a history of trauma. While investigating systemic diseases, special attention should be paid to the presence of arachnoid cysts or disruption in cerebrospinal fluid dynamics along with a history of hematologic diseases."

The corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), severity of lens subluxation, type of surgery, intra-operative and post-operative complication, and specular count were recorded. Seventy-eight eyes of 57 cases with a mean age at surgery of 14.73 years were analyzed. Intra-lenticular lens aspiration was the most common (n-62/78; 79.5%) surgical procedure followed by lens aspiration, intra-capsular cataract extraction, phaco-aspiration, and pars-plana lensectomy. Simultaneous intra-ocular lens (IOL) implantation was performed in 46.2% (n-32/78) of the eyes. The mean CDVA improved from 0.85 ± 0.55 logMAR to 0.44 ± 0.29 logMAR at 6 weeks follow-up. The post-operative CDVA was significantly better in the pseudo-phakic group compared to the aphakic group (p-0.02). The patient's age at the time of surgery and the degree of subluxation did not impact the final visual outcome. Intra-operative complication included vitreous hemorrhage (n-1) and lens matter drop (n-1). Post-operative complications were noted in 26.9% of the eyes (n-21/78) with a higher complication rate in the pseudo-phakic group (p-0.00). A second intervention was required in 7.7% of the eyes (n-6/78). Age and degree of subluxation at the time of surgery do not influence the final visual outcome in cases of ectopia lentis undergoing lens extraction surgery. IOL implantation results in better visual outcomes but is associated with a high complication rate."

However, the majority of patients (60-80%) with Marfan syndrome have some degree of aortic root dilation or thoracic aortic aneurysm that can lead to aortic dissection and rupture, which has long been recognised as the leading cause of death in Marfan syndrome. The funnel breast (pectus excavatum), often seen in patients with Marfan syndrome, radically complicates the access during aortic root or arch interventions, forcing cardiosurgery practitioners to seek alternative approaches. We present a series of clinical observations of two patients with Marfan syndrome and aneurysm of the aortic root and ascending aorta. A left-sided thoracotomy provides the possibility of successful implementation of extensive surgical interventions, decreasing the risks of intra-operative damage to the cardiac structures adjacent to the sternum in this complex cohort of patients."

Patients with MFS also exhibit alterations in adipose tissues, which in some individuals leads to lipodystrophy, whereas in others to obesity. We have recently demonstrated that fibrillin-1 regulates adipose tissue homeostasis. Here, we examined how fibrillin-1 abnormality affects metabolic adaptation to different diets. We used two MFS mouse models: hypomorph <i>Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup></i> mice and <i>Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup></i> mice with a fibrillin-1 missense mutation. When <i>Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup></i> mice were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 wk, male mice were heavier than littermate controls (LCs), whereas female mice gained less weight compared with LCs. Female <i>Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup></i> mice on an HFD for 24 wk were similarly protected from weight gain. Male <i>Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup></i> mice on an HFD demonstrated higher insulin levels, insulin intolerance, circulating levels of cholesterol, and high-density lipoproteins. Moreover, male HFD-fed <i>Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup></i> mice showed a higher liver weight and a fatty liver phenotype, which was reduced to LC levels after orchiectomy. Phosphorylation of protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (<i>Srebp1</i>) in livers of HFD-fed male <i>Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup></i> mice were elevated. In conclusion, the data demonstrate that male mice of both the MFS models are susceptible to HFD-induced obesity and diabetes. Moreover, male <i>Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup></i> mice develop a fatty liver phenotype, likely mediated by a baseline increased endoplasmic reticulum stress.

    "abstract": "In Marfan syndrome (MFS), dilation, dissection, and rupture of the aorta occur. Inflammation can be involved in the pathogenicity of aortic defects and can thus be a therapeutic target for MFS. Previously, we showed that the formulation of methotrexate (MTX) associated with lipid nanoparticles (LDE) has potent anti-inflammatory effects without toxicity. To investigate whether LDEMTX treatment can prevent the development of aortic lesions in the MFS murine model. MgΔloxPneo MFS (<i>n</i> = 40) and wild-type (WT, <i>n</i> = 60) mice were allocated to 6 groups weekly injected with IP solutions of: (1) only LDE; (2) commercial MTX; (3) LDEMTX (dose = 1mg/kg) between 3rd and 6th months of life. After 12 weeks of treatments, animals were examined by echocardiography and euthanatized for morphometric and molecular studies. MFS mice treated with LDEMTX showed narrower lumens in the aortic arch, as well as in the ascending and descending aorta. LDEMTX reduced fibrosis and the number of dissections in MFS but not the number of elastic fiber disruptions. In MFS mice, LDEMTX treatment lowered protein expression of pro-inflammatory factors macrophages (CD68), T-lymphocytes (CD3), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), apoptotic factor cleaved-caspase 3, and type 1 collagen and lowered the protein expression of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), extracellular signal-regulated kinases ½ (ERK1/2), and SMAD3. Protein expression of CD68 and CD3 had a positive correlation with an area of aortic lumen (<i>r</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.36; <i>p</i> < 0.001), suggesting the importance of inflammation in the causative mechanisms of aortic dilation. Enhanced adenosine availability by LDEMTX was suggested by higher aortic expression of an anti-adenosine A2a receptor (A2a) and lower adenosine deaminase expression. Commercial MTX had negligible effects. LDEMTX prevented the development of MFS-associated aortic defects and can thus be a candidate for testing in clinical studies."

In three patients, dermal connective tissue was examined by electron microscopy. DNA from all four patients was studied by whole-exome sequencing and copy number variation (CNV) analysis. The collagen fibers of dermal biopsies were pathologic in all three analyzed patients. One patient carried a CNV disrupting the <i>COL3A1</i> and <i>COL5A2</i> genes (vascular or hypermobility type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), and another patient a CNV in <i>MYH11</i> (familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections). The third patient carried a missense substitution in <i>COL5A2</i>. Three patients showed morphologic alterations of the dermal connective tissue, and two patients carried pathogenic variants in genes associated with arterial connective tissue dysfunction. The findings suggest that genetic testing should be recommended after recurrent arterial dissections, independently of apparent phenotypical signs of connective tissue disorders."

Cardinal features of MFS include ectopia lentis (EL), musculoskeletal features and aortic root aneurysm and dissection. Although dissection of the ascending aorta is the main cause of mortality in MFS, the clinical course differs considerably in age of onset and severity, even among individuals who share the same causative variant, suggesting the existence of additional genetic variants that modify the severity of the cardiovascular phenotype in MFS. We recruited MFS patients and classified them into severe (<i>n</i> = 8) or mild aortic phenotype (<i>n</i> = 14) according to age of presentation of the first aorta-related incident. We used Exome Sequencing to identify the genetic variants associated with the severity of aortic manifestations and we performed linkage analysis where suitable. We found five genes associated with severe aortic phenotype and three genes that could be protective for this phenotype in MFS. These genes regulate components of the extracellular matrix, TGFβ pathway and other signaling pathways that are involved in the maintenance of the ECM or angiogenesis. Further studies will be required to understand the functional effect of these variants and explore novel, personalized risk management and, potentially, therapies for these patients."

Mild aortic root enlargement may be also observed in athletes and is considered as a normal adaptation to regular exercise training. On the other hand, high-intensity physical activity in individuals with a particular genetic substrate, such as those carrying gene variants associated with Marfan syndrome or other inherited aortopathies, can favor an excessive aortic enlargement and trigger an acute aortic dissection. The evaluation of the aortic valve and aortic root diameters, as well as the detection of a disease-causing mutation for inherited aortic disease, should be followed by a tailored decision about sport eligibility. In addition, the risk of aortic complications associated with sport in patients with genetic aortic disease is poorly characterized and is often difficult to stratify for each individual athlete. This review aims to describe the relationship between regular physical activity and aortic dilation, focusing on patients with bicuspid aortic valve and inherited aortic disease, and discuss the implications in terms of aortic disease progression and sport participation."

    "abstract": "Biochemical and biophysical factors need consideration when modelling in vivo cellular behaviour using in vitro cell culture systems. One underappreciated factor is the high concentration of macromolecules present in vivo, which is typically not simulated under standard cell culture conditions. This disparity is especially relevant when studying biochemical processes that govern extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, which may be altered due to dilution of secreted macromolecules by the relatively large volumes of culture medium required for cell maintenance in vitro. Macromolecular crowding (MMC) utilises the addition of inert macromolecules to cell culture medium to mimic such high concentration environments found in vivo. The present study induced MMC using the sucrose polymer Ficoll and examined whether fibrillin-1 deposition by human lung fibroblasts could be augmented. Fibrillin-1 forms extracellular microfibrils, which are versatile scaffolds required for elastic fibre formation, deposition of other ECM proteins and growth factor regulation. Pathogenic variants in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome, where ECM deposition of fibrillin-1 can be compromised. Using immunocytochemistry, significantly enhanced fibrillin-1 deposition was observed when lung fibroblasts were cultured under MMC conditions. MMC also augmented fibrillin-1 deposition in Marfan syndrome patient-derived skin fibroblasts in a cell line- and likely FBN1 variant-specific manner. The ability of MMC to increase fibrillin-1 deposition suggested potential applications for tissue-engineering approaches, e.g. to generate tendon or vascular tissues, where fibrillin-1 microfibrils and elastic fibres are key determinants of their biomechanical properties. Moreover, it suggested the potency of MMC to better mimic in vivo ECM environments in cell culture studies."

A 9-year-old girl diagnosed with Marfan syndrome visited a strabismus clinic for treatment of esotropia. Both eyes were aphakic and had 60 prism diopter esotropia at distance and 55 prism diopter esotropia at near. There were no corneal, conjunctival, or scleral abnormalities. Six millimeters of recession was performed on both medial rectus muscles via an inferonasal fornix approach under general anesthesia. 5 days after surgery, a dark gray protruding lesion was observed on the upper nasal side of the left eye. Intraocular ultrasonography showed no bleeding, retinal detachment, or other abnormal findings. Computed tomography showed a conical protrusion of the scleral wall which was diagnosed as intercalary staphyloma. To reduce risk of progression of the staphyloma in the left eye and to reduce risk of development of a new staphyloma, intraocular pressure lowering eye drops were administered. We just observed it without any intervention except the intraocular pressures lowering eye drops. It remained stable for 12 months. Clinicians need to be alert to the possibility of this serious complication in Marfan syndrome patients after minor surgical trauma, which can occur during uneventful strabismus surgery."

Although it often presents as an incidental finding on imaging, SOVA is associated with the risk of serious complications, including rupture. A possible connection between the conditions might be the FGFR2 gene mutation in Apert syndrome and the influence of a mutation in fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) on heart development. Here we report a case of acute heart failure secondary to rupture of SOVA into the right atrium in a patient with Apert syndrome. A 47-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of Apert syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis presented with shortness of breath, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and progressive bilateral lower extremity edema for 2 weeks. She was diagnosed with acute right heart failure due to ruptured SOVA. The patient underwent surgical repair of the ruptured SOVA. Unfortunately, her postoperative course was complicated by a stroke leading to brain death. Ruptured SOVA is a quite rare but serious condition that can cause life-threatening complications. In this case, SOVA occurred in a patient with Apert syndrome. The case may suggest that these two conditions may be related through the FGFR2 gene mutation associated with Apert syndrome and the related growth factor FGF2 involved in heart development."

Asprosin is encoded by the penultimate 2 exons (65 and 66) of the fibrillin 1 (<i>FBN1</i>) gene. Profibrillin 1 is the unprocessed protein product of <i>FBN1</i> and undergoes a proteolytic cleavage by furin enzyme to produce mature fibrillin 1 and asprosin. The main organ responsible for the asprosin production seems to be white adipose tissue. Asprosin promotes hepatic glucose release in the liver and appetite stimulation in the hypothalamus through activation of the cAMP signaling circuitry through interacting with its G protein-coupled receptor, called OR4M1. Increasing mass of evidence suggests that asprosin is involved in the development and progression of various clinical conditions including diabetes, obesity, cardiomyopathy, cancer, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. It regulates various cellular and physiological processes such as appetite stimulation, glucose release, insulin secretion, apoptotic cell death, and inflammatory response. In this review, we discuss the current literature on asprosin and try to shed light on the yet undiscovered functions of asprosin.

While anthropometric routine parameters are not very suitable, the modern Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) seems superior for the acquisition of reliable noninvasive assessment of body composition of patients. The aim of the study was to assess the body composition of patients with MFS/LDS by BIA in order to detect occult obesity, which may be a risk marker for aortic or vascular complications. In this exploratory cross-sectional study, 50 patients (66% female; mean age: 37.7 <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo>±</mo></math> 11.7 [range: 17-64] years) with a molecular genetic (n = 45; 90%) or clinical (n = 5; 10%) proven diagnosis of MFS or LDS were enrolled between June 2020 and February 2022. All BIA-measurements were performed with the Multifrequence-Impedance-Analyzer Nutriguard-MS (Data Input, Poecking, Germany). The MFS/LDS collective was significantly different from an age-, sex-, and BMI-adjusted control in terms of body fat, percent cellularity, body cell mass, extra cellular mass/body cell mass index, and phase angle (all <i>p</i> <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo><</mo></math> 0.05). The mean BIA-measured bodyfat was 31.7 <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo>±</mo></math> 8.7% [range: 9.5-53.5%], while the mean calculated BMI of the included patients was 23.0 <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo>±</mo></math> 4.8 kg/ <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msup><mi>m</mi> <mn>2</mn></msup> </math> [range: 15.2-41.9 kg/ <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msup><mi>m</mi> <mn>2</mn></msup> </math> ]. Therefore, using the obesity cut-off values for the body fat percentage of 25% in men and 35% in women, the BIA classifies as many as 28 patients (56.0%) as obese. In contrast only 12 patients (24.0%) were pre-obese, respectively 3 (6.0%) obese by BMI. The significant difference (<i>p</i> <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo><</mo></math> 0.001) had an accordance of 42.7%. Overall, 15 patients (13 MFS; 2 LDS) had previous aortic surgery (n = 14) and/or interventional treatment (n = 2) for aortic complications (aneurysm, aortic dissection). 11 out of these 15 (73.3%) were currently classified as obese by BIA. The fact that many patients with MFS or LDS are obese is widely unknown, although obesity may be associated with impaired vascular endothelial function and an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Also, in patients with MFS/LDS, BIA allows a reliable assessment of the body composition beyond the normal anthropometric parameters, such as BMI. In the future, BIA-data possibly may be of particular importance for the assessment of the vascular risk of MFS/LDS patients, besides the aortic diameters."

    "title": "Pleiotropic activation of endothelial function by angiotensin II receptor blockers is crucial to their protective anti-vascular remodeling effects.",
    "abstract": "There are no therapeutics that directly enhance chronic endothelial nitric oxide (NO) release, which is typically associated with vascular homeostasis. In contrast, angiotensin II (AngII) receptor type 1 (AT1R) blockers (ARBs) can attenuate AngII-mediated oxidative stress, which often leads to increased endothelial NO bioavailability. Herein, we investigate the potential presence of direct, AngII/AT1R-independent ARB class effects on endothelial NO release and how this may result in enhanced aortic wall homeostasis and endothelial NO-specific transcriptome changes. Treatment of mice with four different ARBs induced sustained, long-term inhibition of vascular contractility by up to 82% at 16 weeks and 63% at 2 weeks, an effect reversed by L-NAME and absent in endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) KO mice or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril-treated animals. In absence of AngII or in tissues with blunted AT1R expression or incubated with an AT2R blocker, telmisartan reduced vascular tone, supporting AngII/AT1R-independent pleiotropism. Finally, telmisartan was able to inhibit aging- and Marfan syndrome (MFS)-associated aortic root widening in NO-sensitive, BP-independent fashions, and correct aberrant TGF-β signaling. RNAseq analyses of aortic tissues identified early eNOS-specific transcriptome reprogramming of the aortic wall in response to telmisartan. This study suggests that ARBs are capable of major class effects on vasodilatory NO release in fashions that may not involve blockade of the AngII/AT1R pathway. Broader prophylactic use of ARBs along with identification of non-AngII/AT1R pathways activated by telmisartan should be investigated."

    "abstract": "Periodontitis is an inflammatory condition caused by a bacterial plaque and characterized by progressive destruction of the tooth-supporting apparatus. Patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) exhibit a connective tissue disorder, which can also affect oral soft and hard tissue. Thus, the aims of this cross-sectional study were to assess the association between periodontitis and MFS and secondly, to compare periodontal parameters and prevalence of disease with a control group (CG) without MFS. 152 patients (MFS = 76, CG = 76) were recruited to evaluate the following periodontal parameters: probing depth, gingival margin, clinical attachment level, plaque index, and bleeding on probing. The 2017 World Workshop guideline was followed for the diagnosis of the periodontal status. A multivariate analysis was performed using a multinomial logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, and smoking. The level of significance required was <i>p</i> < 0.05. Patients with MFS did not show a higher prevalence of periodontitis compared to the CG. However, patients with MFS did have higher values in probing depth, gingival recession, clinical attachment level, and plaque index compared to the CG patients (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In conclusion, although similar prevalence of periodontitis was found among the studied groups, MFS patients showed worse periodontal parameters."

    "title": "Endovascular and Hybrid Repair in Patients with Heritable Thoracic Aortic Disease.",
    "abstract": "In individuals with heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD), endovascular repair for treatment of aortic aneurysm and dissection may be lifesaving, but is associated with increased risk of failure of endovascular repair and adverse outcomes. This study reports our experience with early and late outcomes of endovascular aortic and branch vessel repair in patients with HTAD. A retrospective case series was performed by chart review of individuals with HTAD followed at Washington University School of Medicine/Barnes-Jewish Hospital who underwent endovascular aortic and/or branch vessel repair. Clinical features, imaging characteristics, and short- and long-term outcomes were collected. Twenty-nine patients with HTAD (20 male; mean age 45 ± 13 years) underwent 37 endovascular procedures between 2006 and 2020 with mean follow up of 54 ± 41 months. Seven patients underwent two or more separate endovascular procedures. Each procedure was considered separate for data collection and analysis. Underlying conditions included Marfan syndrome (n = 16 procedures), Loeys-Dietz syndrome (n = 14 procedures), vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (n = 3 procedures), and nonsyndromic HTAD (n = 4 procedures). Twenty patients (69%) had prior open surgical aortic repair. Indications for endovascular aortic repair (n = 31) included urgent repairs of acute complications of aortic dissection (n = 10) or aneurysm rupture (n = 3), and elective aortic repair (n = 18; 10 chronic dissections and eight chronic aneurysms). Six patients underwent elective endovascular repair of six branch vessel aneurysms or dissections. Six patients underwent hybrid open surgical and endovascular repair. Of the 37 procedures, 25 (68%) proximal landing zones were in the native aorta or branch vessel, 11 (30%) were in a surgical graft or elephant trunk and one was in a previously placed endograft. Thirty-six (97%) procedures were technically successful, and none required emergency surgical conversion. Two patients died: one from sepsis and one from presumed late pseudoaneurysm rupture, for a 5% per-procedure mortality rate. Two procedures were complicated by stroke and one patient developed paraparesis. Of the 31 aortic procedures, seven aortic endografts (23%) developed a stent-induced new entry (SINE) discovered with imaging at 20 ± 15 days post-procedure. Seven endografts (23%) developed a Type I endoleak and eight (26%) developed a Type II endoleak. No Type III endoleaks were seen. Within 30 days, two endografts (of 37, 5%) required reintervention. After 30 days, fifteen additional endografts (of 37, 41%) required reintervention. Two patients (of 6, 33%) who underwent hybrid repair required reintervention. This study is the largest single-center case series examining outcomes of HTAD patients following endovascular repair. Urgent and elective endovascular repairs in patients with HTAD can manage acute and chronic complications of aortic aneurysm and dissection with relatively low risk. However, risk of early and late endoleaks and SINE is high. Close post-procedural surveillance is required, and many individuals will require additional interventions. Hybrid repair shows promise and requires further investigation."

    "abstract": "Background: Despite extensive knowledge about the quality of life of people suffering from rare diseases, data on patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) are scarce and inconsistent. Hence, the problem of assessing the quality of life (QOL) and its relationship with the assessment of which ailments are the most burdensome for these patients is still open. Aim: Comparison of the quality of life of patients with MFS and determination as to which of the reported complaints in patients with MFS are related to the QOL of patients. Methods: The study included 35 patients with MFS and 35 healthy controls, matched for gender and age. In the study, the questionnaire of quality of life assessment SF-36 was used to assess the level of health-related quality of life, as well as an interview of the most severe symptoms reported by patients with MFS. Results: The level of the physical dimension of the QOL (p < 0.001) and limiting of roles due to physical health (p = 0.002), as well as the level of general index of the QOL (p < 0.001), were statistically significantly lower in MFS patients when compared to controls. People from both studied groups do not vary in the scope of pain, vitality, social functioning, limiting the roles due to emotional problems, and state of mind but also in the mental dimension of the health-related quality of life (HRQL). Additionally, there has been a correlation between HRQL and the subjective assessment of the effects of orthopedic, ophthalmic, and cardiological problems in life, as well as lower exercise tolerance in the evaluation of people with MFS and QOL in most areas. Conclusions: Patients with MFS present a reduced QOL in the areas of physical functioning, limiting roles due to physical health, general feeling of general health, the physical dimension of the HRQL, and the general index of the QOL; in these areas, they require careful evaluation, as well as medical and psychosocial assistance."

    "abstract": "We sought to find a bedside prognosis prediction model based on clinical and image parameters to determine the in-hospital outcomes of acute aortic dissection (AAD) in the emergency department. Patients who presented with AAD from January 2010 to December 2019 were retrospectively recruited in our derivation cohort. Then we prospectively collected patients with AAD from January 2020 to December 2021 as the validation cohort. We collected the demographics, medical history, treatment options, and in-hospital outcomes. All enrolled patients underwent computed tomography angiography. The image data were systematically reviewed for anatomic criteria in a retrospective fashion by three professional radiologists. A series of radiological parameters, including the extent of dissection, the site of the intimal tear, entry tear diameter, aortic diameter at each level, maximum false lumen diameter, and presence of pericardial effusion were collected. Of the 449 patients in the derivation cohort, 345 (76.8%) were male, the mean age was 61 years, and 298 (66.4%) had a history of hypertension. Surgical repair was performed in 327 (72.8%) cases in the derivation cohort, and the overall crude in-hospital mortality of AAD was 10.9%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that predictors of in-hospital mortality in AAD included age, Marfan syndrome, type A aortic dissection, surgical repair, and maximum false lumen diameter. A final prognostic model incorporating these five predictors showed good calibration and discrimination in the derivation and validation cohorts. As for type A aortic dissection, 3-level type A aortic dissection clinical prognosis score (3ADPS) including 5 clinical and image variables scored from -2 to 5 was established: (1) moderate risk of death if 3ADPS is <0; (2) high risk of death if 3ADPS is 1-2; (3) very high risk of death if 3ADPS is more than 3. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curves in the validation cohorts was 0.833 (95% CI, 0.700-0.967). Age, Marfan syndrome, type A aortic dissection, surgical repair, and maximum false lumen diameter can significantly affect the in-hospital outcomes of AAD. And 3ADPS contributes to the prediction of in-hospital prognosis of type A aortic dissection rapidly and effectively. As multivariable risk prediction tools, the risk models were readily available for emergency doctors to predict in-hospital mortality of patients with AAD in extreme clinical risk."

    "abstract": "Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene are responsible for the autosomal dominant form of geleophysic dysplasia (GD), which is characterized by short stature and extremities, thick skin and cardiovascular disease. All known FBN1 mutations in patients with GD are localized within the region encoding the transforming growth factor-β binding protein-like 5 (TB5) domain of this protein. Herein, we generated a knock-in mouse model, Fbn1Y1698C by introducing the p.Tyr1696Cys mutation from a patient with GD into the TB5 domain of murine Fbn1 to elucidate the specific role of this domain in endochondral ossification. We found that both Fbn1Y1698C/+ and Fbn1Y1698C/Y1698C mice exhibited a reduced stature reminiscent of the human GD phenotype. The Fbn1 point mutation introduced in these mice affected the growth plate formation owing to abnormal chondrocyte differentiation such that mutant chondrocytes failed to establish a dense microfibrillar network composed of FBN1. This original Fbn1 mutant mouse model offers new insight into the pathogenic events underlying GD. Our findings suggest that the etiology of GD involves the dysregulation of the extracellular matrix composed of an abnormal FBN1 microfibril network impacting the differentiation of the chondrocytes."

    "title": "The Role of Transforming Growth Factor-β Signaling in Myxomatous Mitral Valve Degeneration.",
    "abstract": "Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) due to myxomatous degeneration is one of the most important chronic degenerative cardiovascular diseases in people and dogs. It is a common cause of heart failure leading to significant morbidity and mortality in both species. Human MVP is usually classified into primary or non-syndromic, including Barlow's Disease (BD), fibro-elastic deficiency (FED) and Filamin-A mutation, and secondary or syndromic forms (typically familial), such as Marfan syndrome (MFS), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Despite different etiologies the diseased valves share pathological features consistent with myxomatous degeneration. To reflect this common pathology the condition is often called myxomatous mitral valve degeneration (disease) (MMVD) and this term is universally used to describe the analogous condition in the dog. MMVD in both species is characterized by leaflet thickening and deformity, disorganized extracellular matrix, increased transformation of the quiescent valve interstitial cell (qVICs) to an activated state (aVICs), also known as activated myofibroblasts. Significant alterations in these cellular activities contribute to the initiation and progression of MMVD due to the increased expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily cytokines and the dysregulation of the TGF-β signaling pathways. Further understanding the molecular mechanisms of MMVD is needed to identify pharmacological manipulation strategies of the signaling pathway that might regulate VIC differentiation and so control the disease onset and development. This review briefly summarizes current understanding of the histopathology, cellular activities, molecular mechanisms and pathogenesis of MMVD in dogs and humans, and in more detail reviews the evidence for the role of TGF-β."

From 1993 to 2019, 677 patients (median age, 56.0 years; range, 42-65) underwent the David-I procedure with a straight tube graft. A total of 24 different surgeons performed these operations. Marfan syndrome was present in 111 patients (16.4%), and bicuspid aortic valve was present in 71 patients (10.5%). Aortic root aneurysm was present in 544 patients (80.4%), and acute dissection was present in 133 patients (19.6%). Ministernotomy was used in 57 patients (8.4%). Additional cusp plasty was performed in 84 patients (12.4%). Concomitant procedures were coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 122, 18.0%), mitral valve surgery (n = 34, 5%), proximal arch replacement (n = 125, 18.4%), subtotal arch replacement (n = 43, 6.4%), and total arch replacement (n = 102, 15.1%). Overall in-hospital mortality was 4.0% (n = 27), and perioperative stroke occurred in 26 patients (3.8%). Postoperative echocardiography showed aortic insufficiency less than I° in 600 of 623 (96.3%). The 1-, 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year survivals were 97%, 92%, 79%, 68%, and 50%, respectively. The rates for freedom from aortic valve-related reoperation at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years were 97%, 92%, 87%, 84%, and 80%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified age (odds ratio, 0.974; 95% confidence interval, 0.957-0.992; P = .004), senior surgeon (odds ratio, 0.546; 95% confidence interval, 0.305-0.979; P = .042), and residual postoperative aortic insufficiency (odds ratio, 4.864; 95% confidence interval, 1.124-21.052; P = .034) as independent risk factors for aortic valve-related reoperation. The aortic valve-sparing David-I procedure can be performed with very low perioperative morbidity and mortality. The short- and long-term results are excellent. The straight tube graft does not lead to increased leaflet erosion. This procedure is reproducible by multiple surgeons."

An anomalous origin of the right coronary artery (RCA) from the left sinus of Valsalva adds complexity during aortic root surgery. We present a case of a 37-year-old male patient with Marfan syndrome who had an RCA anomaly and a 4.5-cm true aneurysm of the common coronary button 14 years after a previous Bentall procedure. A redo Bentall operation and hemi-arch replacement were successfully performed. The anomalous origin of the RCA from the left sinus of Valsalva was safely divided and anastomosed as separate coronary buttons to the prosthetic composite valve graft. To prevent coronary button aneurysms after aortic root surgery in Marfan patients, the coronary buttons and the corresponding side holes on the prosthetic graft must be reduced to the maximum possible extent."

The purpose of this study was to compare age distribution and probability of elective surgery for proximal aortic aneurysm, any dissection surgery, and cardiovascular mortality among aortopathy etiologies. The GenTAC study had a retrospective/prospective design. Participants with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) with aneurysm (n = 879), Marfan syndrome (MFS) (n = 861), nonsyndromic heritable thoracic aortic disease (nsHTAD) (n = 378), Turner syndrome (TS) (n = 298), vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) (n = 149), and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) (n = 121) were analyzed. The 25% probability of elective proximal aortic aneurysm surgery was 30 years for LDS (95% CI: 18-37 years), followed by MFS (34 years; 95% CI: 32-36 years), nsHTAD (52 years; 95% CI: 48-56 years), and BAV (55 years; 95% CI: 53-58 years). Any dissection surgery 25% probability was highest in LDS (38 years; 95% CI: 33-53 years) followed by MFS (51 years; 95% CI: 46-57 years) and nsHTAD (54 years; 95% CI: 51-61 years). BAV experienced the largest relative frequency of elective surgery to any dissection surgery (254/33 = 7.7), compared with MFS (273/112 = 2.4), LDS (35/16 = 2.2), or nsHTAD (82/76 = 1.1). With MFS as the reference population, risk of any dissection surgery or cardiovascular mortality was lowest in BAV patients (HR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.08-0.18; HR: 0.13; 95%: CI: 0.06-0.27, respectively). The greatest risk of mortality was seen in patients with vEDS. Marfan and LDS cohorts demonstrate age and event profiles congruent with the current understanding of syndromic aortopathies. BAV events weigh toward elective replacement with relatively few dissection surgeries. Nonsyndromic HTAD patients experience near equal probability of dissection vs prophylactic surgery, possibly because of failure of early diagnosis."

A total of 24 patients diagnosed with CEL from January 2019 to November 2019 were enrolled in this study, and their clinical data were collected and genome-wide deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from peripheral venous blood. Targeted gene capture technology was used to obtain 188 exons of lens abnormality-related genes, which were sequenced using a high-throughput method. The mutation sites were determined through data analysis and verified by the Sanger method. According to the data from previous studies, the association between the genotype and clinical phenotype was analysed. Of the 24 patients, 23 had mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene, and 20 were diagnosed with Marfan syndrome. The 23 cases of FBN1 mutations were all heterozygous mutations, including 17 missense mutations, 3 splicing variants, 2 exon deletion mutations, 1 codon mutation, and 9 new mutations. A total of 17 mutations were located in the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor domain, including 16 mutations that contained missense mutations of cysteine. In addition, a heterozygous mutation of the gap junction protein alpha 8 (GJA8) gene was detected in one patient. In this study, we identified 23 FBN1 gene mutations and 1 GJA8 gene mutation in 24 patients with CEL. Of these, 9 new FBN1 mutations and 14 known mutations were found. The results expanded the mutation spectrum of the FBN1 gene, suggesting that FBN1 mutation may be the main cause of CEL in Chinese patients."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) in Marfan syndrome, caused by fibrillin-1 mutations, are characterized by elevated cytokines and fragmentated elastic laminae in the aortic wall. This study explored whether and how specific fibrillin-1-regulated miRNAs mediate inflammatory cytokine expression and elastic laminae degradation in TAA. miRNA expression profiling at early and late TAA stages using a severe Marfan mouse model (Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup>) revealed a spectrum of differentially regulated miRNAs. Bioinformatic analyses predicted the involvement of these miRNAs in inflammatory and extracellular matrix-related pathways. We demonstrate that upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases is a common characteristic of mouse and human TAA tissues. miR-122, the most downregulated miRNA in the aortae of 10-week-old Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> mice, post-transcriptionally upregulated CCL2, IL-1β and MMP12. Similar data were obtained at 70 weeks of age using Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice. Deficient fibrillin-1-smooth muscle cell interaction suppressed miR-122 levels. The marker for tissue hypoxia HIF-1α was upregulated in the aortic wall of Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> mice, and miR-122 was reduced under hypoxic conditions in cell and organ cultures. Reduced miR-122 was partially rescued by HIF-1α inhibitors, digoxin and 2-methoxyestradiol in aortic smooth muscle cells. Digoxin-treated Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> mice demonstrated elevated miR-122 and suppressed CCL2 and MMP12 levels in the ascending aortae, with reduced elastin fragmentation and aortic dilation. In summary, this study demonstrates that miR-122 in the aortic wall inhibits inflammatory responses and matrix remodeling, which is suppressed by deficient fibrillin-1-cell interaction and hypoxia in TAA."

    "abstract": "Prior computational and imaging studies described changes in flow patterns for patients with Marfan syndrome, but studies are lacking for related populations. This pilot study addresses this void by characterizing wall shear stress (WSS) indices for patients with Loeys-Dietz and undifferentiated connective tissue diseases. Using aortic valve-based velocity profiles from magnetic resonance imaging as input to patient-specific fluid structure interaction (FSI) models, we determined local flow patterns throughout the aorta for four patients with various connective tissue diseases (Loeys-Dietz with the native aorta, connective tissue disease of unclear etiology with native aorta in female and male patients, and an untreated patient with Marfan syndrome, as well as twin patients with Marfan syndrome who underwent valve-sparing root replacement). FSI simulations used physiological boundary conditions and material properties to replicate available measurements. Time-averaged WSS (TAWSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI) results are presented with localized comparison to age- and gender-matched control participants. Ascending aortic dimensions were greater in almost all patients with connective tissue diseases relative to their respective control. Differences in TAWSS and OSI were driven by local morphological differences and cardiac output. For example, the model for one twin had a more pronounced proximal descending aorta in the vicinity of the ductus ligamentum that impacted WSS indices relative to the other. We are optimistic that the results of this study can serve as a foundation for larger future studies on the connective tissue disorders presented in this article."

The baseline mean aortic root diameter (ARD) at the Valsalva sinus was 42.4 ± 10.3 mm, with 15% of patients having moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation and seven patients with acute aortic syndrome. The Bentall procedure was the most commonly performed surgical technique, and five patients required re-operation. Of the 17 pregnancies, 29% developed fetal complications; however, there was no maternal morbidity or mortality. A total of ten deaths occurred at a mean age of 52 years. Patients with an ARD ≤ 45 mm had a significantly lower all-cause mortality rate than patients with 45 < ARD ≤ 50 mm or with ARD > 50 mm (P = 0.004 and P < 0.001, respectively). Heart failure symptoms were associated with a worse outcome (P = 0.041), while the presence of extracardiac involvement had a protective effect (P < 0.001). MFS-related aortopathy is associated with high morbidity rates. In the overall population, an ARD > 45 mm at the time of diagnosis was associated with higher mortality during follow-up."

    "abstract": "Recent developments in reproductive biology have enabled the generation of genetically engineered pigs as models for inherited human diseases. Although a variety of such models for monogenic diseases are currently available, reproduction of human diseases caused by haploinsufficiency remains a major challenge. The present study compares the phenotypes of mouse and pig models of Marfan syndrome (MFS), with a special focus on the expressivity and penetrance of associated symptoms. Furthermore, investigation of the gene regulation mechanisms associated with haploinsufficiency will be of immense utility in developing faithful MFS pig models."

    "title": "Endovascular Repair in Patients with Marfan Syndrome: Concerns Amid Controversy.",
    "abstract": "Endovascular aortic repair is widely used to treat patients with degenerative aneurysms or aortic dissection within the distal aorta. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is generally associated with fewer short-term complications than open surgical repair, which is particularly important for older patients with significant comorbid conditions. However, for patients with Marfan syndrome, a heritable thoracic aortic disease associated with aortic dilatation, dissection, and rupture, the utility of endovascular aortic repair remains questionable. Marfan patients have friable aortic tissue and are typically treated at a relatively young age with few comorbidities; they therefore have less operative risk and need a durable solution. Furthermore, those who need distal aortic repair tend to have chronic aortic dissection. Although TEVAR is generally superior to open surgery with regard to short-term complications, it is less durable, and TEVAR reintervention rates are highest in patients with chronic aortic dissection. Thus, Marfan patients seeking definitive aortic repair are often better served by open repair. Nonetheless, TEVAR may be useful in patients with Marfan syndrome as a bridge to open repair or as treatment for late complications of previous open repair."

We present a case of a 15-year-old boy who was sent to the ophthalmologist for the checkup of the primary disease-hypercalciuria and gigantism for the first time at the age of 5.5 years. After the ophthalmological examination (low myopia <-3.0 diopters, ectopic lens with defects in the nasal lens zonules detected by ultrasound biomicroscopy) and owing to gigantism, suspecting of MFS, we referred the patient for further diagnosis, treatment, and follow-ups. The child's excessive growth pointed to the presence of gigantism in the very beginning. A duly identified problem of MFS in our patient at an early age contributed to the correct diagnosis and prevention of the development of amblyopia in the child."

Fifty-three eyes of 33 consecutive patients with subluxated lenses secondary to MFS were studied. Eighteen patients with MFS (30 eyes) received two-point fixation of the Sensar (16 patients, 26 eyes) or CZ70BD (2 patients, 4 eyes) IOL, and 15 patients with MFS (23 eyes) received four-point fixation of the Akreos Adapt IOL. Preoperative and postoperative ophthalmologic examinations were performed. A primary outcome measure of postoperative complication was studied. The mean preoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the two-point group was 0.68 ± 0.38 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), and it improved to 0.30 ± 0.32 logMAR at the final follow-up (p < 0.05). The mean preoperative BCVA in the four-point group was 0.68 ± 0.45 logMAR, and it improved to 0.28 ± 0.28 logMAR at the final follow-up (p < 0.05). The BCVA results did not differ significantly between groups. The intraocular pressure was increased at the final follow-up in the two-point group (p < 0.05). Transscleral two-point fixation of IOL has relatively high incidences of pupillary capture of the IOL. The closed continuous-loop transscleral four-point fixation of the Akreos Adapt foldable IOL is more suitable than two-point fixation of a two-haptic IOL in treating subluxated lenses due to MFS."

    "abstract": "Aortic diseases arising in Marfan Syndrome (MFS), such as in aneurysms and dissections of the thoracic aorta, are related to genetic alterations in the FBN1 gene. Databases, such as Universal Mutations-FBN1, ClinVar and The Human Gene Mutation, contain more than a thousand FBN1 mutations associated with MFS. The FBN1 gene, which encodes fibrillin-1, is responsible for the integral production of different protein domains. Possible genetic changes may lead to a weakening of blood vessels, leading to the development of aortopathies. In this study, we present the association of a novel FBN1 variant with MFS. The proband is a man who presented ascending aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) at 42-yr-old, which was surgically treated. Clinical investigations were performed in all family members enrolled in the study. Marfan signs were observed in the proband, daughters and granddaughter. Direct sequencing of the FBN1 gene in the proband identified a novel truncation variant p.(Glu2019Ter) and a cascade screening were done. The variant was classified as pathogenic and causal for MFS according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria and revised Ghent nosology for MFS diagnosis, respectively. Proband's daughter and granddaughter harbor the variant, however without aortic alteration. This work reports for the first time a patient with the FBN1-p.(Glu2019Ter) variant and its association with MFS/TAAD."

A 13-year-old teenager diagnosed with Marfan syndrome had thoracic scoliosis and pectus excavatum. Thoracic scoliosis was convex to the right, and a right ventricular inflow tract stenosis was observed due to compression induced by the depressed sternum. The patient underwent T3-L4 posterior spinal fusion surgery for scoliosis. Deterioration of hemodynamics was observed when the patient was placed in the prone position or when the thoracic spine was corrected to the left front. Postoperative computed tomography examination showed that the mediastinal space was narrowed due to the corrected thoracic spine. Special attention should be paid in the following cases: (1) severe pectus excavatum, (2) right ventricular inflow tract compression due to depressed sternum on the left side, (3) correction of the thoracic spine on the left front, (4) long-term surgery, and (5) risk of massive bleeding. In some cases, pectus excavatum surgery should be prioritized."

    "abstract": "A disproportionate tall stature is the most evident manifestation in Marfan syndrome (MFS), a multisystem condition caused by mutations in the extracellular protein and TGFβ modulator, fibrillin-1. Unlike cardiovascular manifestations, there has been little effort devoted to unravel the molecular mechanism responsible for long bone overgrowth in MFS. By combining the Cre-LoxP recombination system with metatarsal bone cultures, here we identify the outer layer of the perichondrium as the tissue responsible for long bone overgrowth in MFS mice. Analyses of differentially expressed genes in the fibrillin-1-deficient perichondrium predicted that loss of TGFβ signaling may influence chondrogenesis in the neighboring epiphyseal growth plate (GP). Immunohistochemistry revealed that fibrillin-1 deficiency in the outer perichondrium is associated with decreased accumulation of latent TGFβ-binding proteins (LTBPs)-3 and -4, and reduced levels of phosphorylated (activated) Smad2. Consistent with these findings, mutant metatarsal bones grown in vitro were longer and released less TGFβ than the wild-type counterparts. Moreover, addition of recombinant TGFβ1 normalized linear growth of mutant metatarsal bones. We conclude that longitudinal bone overgrowth in MFS is accounted for by diminished sequestration of LTBP-3 and LTBP-4 into the fibrillin-1-deficient matrix of the outer perichondrium, which results in less TGFβ signaling locally and improper GP differentiation distally."

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis aimed to compare Marfan syndrome (MFS) patients with non-MFS populations based on orofacial health status to combine publicly available scientific information while also improving the validity of primary study findings. A comprehensive search was performed in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Medline, and Web of Science, for articles published between 1 January 2000 and 17 February 2022. PRISMA guidelines were followed to carry out this systematic review. We used the PECO system to classify people with MFS based on whether or not they had distinctive oral health characteristics compared to the non-MFS population. The following are some examples of how PECO is used: P denotes someone who has MFS; E stands for a medical or genetic assessment of MFS; C stands for people who do not have MFS; and O stands for the orofacial characteristics of MFS. Using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale, independent reviewers assessed the articles' methodological quality and extracted data. Four case-control studies were analyzed for meta-analysis. Due to the wide range of variability, we were only able to include data from at least three previous studies. There was a statistically significant difference in bleeding on probing and pocket depth between MFS and non-MFS subjects. MFS patients are more prone to periodontal tissue inflammation due to the activity of FBN1 and MMPs. Early orthodontic treatment is beneficial for the correction of a narrow upper jaw and a high palate, as well as a skeletal class II with retrognathism of the lower jaw and crowding of teeth."

    "abstract": "Elastin is present in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of connective tissues, and its mechanical properties are well documented. In Marfan syndrome, however, the inability to properly code for the protein fibrillin-1 prematurely leads to the degradation and loss of elastin fiber integrity in the ECM. In this study, the role of elastin in the ECM of the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve was investigated by examining the biomechanical behavior of porcine leaflets before and after the application of the enzyme elastase. Five loading protocols were applied to the leaflet specimens in two groups (elastase-treated and control samples). The mechanical response following elastase application yielded a significantly stiffer material in both the radial and circumferential directions. At a physiological level of stress (85 kPa), the elastase group had an average strain of 26.21% and 6.32% in the radial and circumferential directions, respectively, at baseline prior to elastase application. Following elastase treatment, the average strain was 5.28% and 0.97% in the radial and circumferential directions, respectively. No statistically significant change was found in the control group following sham treatment with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Two-photon microscopy images confirmed that after the removal of elastin, the collagen fibers displayed a loss of undulation. With a significant reduction in radial compliance, the ability to withstand physiological loads may be compromised. As such, an extracellular matrix that is structurally deficient in elastin may hinder normal tricuspid valve function."

However, the true prevalence and long-term outcomes of this disease process remain largely unknown. We performed a retrospective analysis of all adult patients with confirmed MFS followed at Stanford Health Care. Those with significant valvular regurgitation, coronary artery disease, or previous cardiac surgery were excluded. LV systolic dysfunction was defined as a LV ejection fraction (LVEF) <55% on transthoracic echocardiography. A total of 753 patients with confirmed MFS were followed up over a median duration of 8 years (interquartile range 4 to 13). Of those, 241 patients (53% women, 71% White) met inclusion criteria and comprised the study cohort. LV systolic dysfunction was present in 30 patients (12%), with a median age of onset of 25 years (interquartile range 19 to 37), median EF of 52% (interquartile range 48 to 54), and evidence of clinical heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class ≥II) in 10% of patients. LV systolic dysfunction was more common in patients with larger aortic root diameters (≥4.0 cm: Odds ratio = 4.5, 95% confidence interval = 1.2 to 17.1) but was not associated with other cardiovascular manifestations of MFS or traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. In conclusion, apart from significant valvular pathology, LV systolic dysfunction was prevalent in MFS from a young age, suggestive of a primary cardiomyopathy. LV dysfunction was typically mild and subclinical and occurred more commonly in patients with more pronounced aortopathies."

The latter may be due to the underlying genotype and/or secondary to aortic stiffening (vascular-ventricular interaction). The aim of this study was to characterize arterial and cardiac function in MFS using a multimodal approach. <b>Methods:</b> Prospective observational study of MFS patients and healthy controls. Methods included echocardiography, ascending aortic distensibility, common carotid intima media thickness [cIMT], parameters of wave reflection, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity [cfPWV]), reactive hyperemia index [RHI], and biomarker analysis (Olink, CVII panel). <b>Results:</b> We included 20 patients with MFS and 67 controls. Ascending aortic distensibility, cIMT and RHI were decreased, while all parameters of arterial wave reflection, stiffness and BNP levels were increased in the MFS group. Both systolic and diastolic function were impaired relative to controls. Within the MFS group, no significant correlation between arterial and cardiac function was identified. However, cfPWV correlated significantly with indexed left ventricular mass and volume in MFS. Bran natriuretic peptide (BNP) was the only biomarker significantly elevated in MFS following correction for age and sex. <b>Conclusions:</b> MFS patients have generally increased aortic stiffness, endothelial dysfunction and BNP levels while cIMT is decreased, supporting that the mechanism of general stiffening is different from acquired vascular disease. CfPWV is associated with cardiac size, blood pressure and BNP in MFS patients. These may be early markers of disease progression that are suitable for monitoring pharmacological treatment effects in MFS patients."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an infrequent presentation of acute myocardial infarction in young women and denotes the non-atherosclerotic separation of the coronary artery wall. Precipitating causes include fibromuscular dysplasia, postpartum hormonal changes, multiparity, connective tissue diseases like Marfan syndrome, autoimmune conditions, and hormonal therapy. It is often underdiagnosed due to a low index of suspicion based on age and gender bias as well as knowledge about different angiographic variants in SCAD. Intracoronary imaging with optical coherence tomography (OCT) or intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is used for patients where coronary angiography fails to secure a diagnosis to increase the diagnostic yield. The mainstay of stable SCAD is conservative management. However, there are no definitive guidelines due to limited clinical experience. Treatment involving percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), fibrinolytic therapy, and mechanical hemodynamic support should be individualized depending upon clinical presentation, type, and extent of dissection, hemodynamic instability, critical anatomy involvement, and the extent of ischemic myocardium. We are presenting a case of a young female who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) that progressed to ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A coronary angiogram showed a tortuous left anterior descending artery (LAD) with a distal 100% occlusion due to SCAD. PCI was attempted but the guidewire could not be navigated intraluminally past the occlusion. CABG was not pursued due to the distal location of the occlusion and lack of visualization of the distal vessel. Our case provides a useful learning opportunity for physicians who may come across similar clinical presentations. In patients with high-risk features of SCAD who are deemed inoperable, timely and appropriate medical management may be a useful alternative for PCI/CABG and the recurrence rates of SCAD are very low."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder that canonically affects the ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular system, in which aortic tear and rupture is the leading cause of death for MFS patients. Genetically, MFS is primarily associated with fibrillin-1 (FBN1) pathogenic variants. However, the disease-causing variant in approximately 10% of patients cannot be identified, partly due to some cryptic mutations that may be missed using routine exonic sequencing, such as non-coding intronic variants that affects the RNA splicing process. We present a 32-year female with typical MFS systemic presentation that reached to a clinical diagnosis according to the revised Ghent nosology. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) but the report failed to identify known causal variants when analyzing the exonic sequence. However, further investigation on the exon/intron boundaries of the WES report revealed a candidate intronic variant of the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene (c.248-3 C>G) that predicted to affect the RNA splicing process. We conducted minigene splicing analyses and demonstrated that the c.248-3 C>G variant abolished the canonical splicing site of intron 3, leading to activation of two cryptic splicing sites and causing insertion (c.248-1_248-2insAG and c.248-1_248-282ins). Our study not only characterizes an intronic variant to the mutational spectrum of the FBN1 gene in MFS and its aberrant effect on splicing, but highlights the importance to not neglect the exon/intron boundaries when reporting and assessing WES results. We point out the need of conducting functional analysis to verify the pathogenicity of intronic mutation, and the opportunity to re-consider the standard diagnostic approaches in cases of clinically diagnosed MFS with normal or variant of unknown significance genetic results."

Only patients with Marfan syndrome were included. For analysis, patients were divided by sex. Female patients were further divided into 2 subgroups: with versus without children. Aortic events were defined as Stanford type A aortic dissection (TAAD) or type B aortic dissection (TBAD) or any aortic intervention. A population of 183 Marfan patients was analysed for the purpose of this study. One hundred four (57%) were male and 79 (43%) were female patients. Thirty-seven (47%) of the 79 female patients had at least 1 child. Male patients had a significantly higher probability of experiencing an aortic event (P = 0.015) compared to female patients. However, there was no increased probability for recurrent events in male patients compared to female patients (P = 0.063). Follow-up revealed no sex and gender differences in the occurrence of Stanford TAAD or TBAD between male and female patients (P = 0.324/P = 0.534). While 11% of women with children suffered from peripartum aortic events, 24% experienced Stanford TAAD unrelated to pregnancy. Male patients have a higher risk of aortic events than female patients. The majority of women were not aware of their Marfan syndrome diagnosis before conceiving. One out of 10 women suffered from peripartum Stanford TAAD or TBAD. Twice as many female patients with children suffered from aortic dissection unrelated to childbirth. There were no sex and gender differences affecting mortality in Marfan patients."

    "abstract": "Fibrillin-1 is an extracellular glycoprotein present throughout the body. Mutations in fibrillin-1 cause a wide spectrum of type I fibrillinopathies, including Marfan syndrome characterized by clinical manifestations in adipose tissues, among others. This study addresses the hypothesis that fibrillin-1 regulates adipocyte development and plays a vital role in adipose tissue homeostasis. We employed two mouse models - Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> (20-25% of normal fibrillin-1) and Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> (missense mutation in fibrillin-1) to examine the role of fibrillin-1 in adipose tissue development and homeostasis. Fibrillin-1 was detected around mature adipocytes in both mouse and human white adipose tissues. As expected, Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> mice displayed a significant reduction of fibrillin-1 in white adipose tissue, and no change was observed for Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice, each compared to their respective littermates. Male Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> mice had more white and brown adipose tissues, whereas female Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> and both male and female Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> showed no difference compared to their respective wild-type littermates. Consistent with this data, male Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> mice displayed hyperinsulinemia and an insulin resistance phenotype with higher levels of cholesterol and high-density lipoproteins in the serum. Fibrillin-1 deficiency in male Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> mice also promoted adipogenic gene expression and led to hypertrophic expansion of mature adipocytes. To further elucidate the fibrillin-1-dependent adipogenic mechanisms in cell culture, we used primary bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) from Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup>, Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> and wild-type mice. Increased lipid content, adipogenic differentiation and pAKT levels were observed when MSCs from both male and female Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> mice were differentiated. Furthermore, a recombinant fragment spanning the C-terminal half of fibrillin-1 significantly reduced adipocyte differentiation i) by binding to MSCs and inhibiting adipogenic commitment, and ii) by sequestering insulin, together suppressing the AKT signaling pathway. This fibrillin-1 fragment also rescued enhanced adipogenic differentiation of MSCs derived from Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> mice. Overall, this study shows that altered adipose tissue homeostasis observed in fibrillin-1 deficient mice depends on the type of fibrillin-1 deficiency and the biological sex, and it shows that fibrillin-1 is a negative regulator of adipogenesis."

Symptoms may lead to diminished quality of life (QoL) in individuals with MFS compared with healthy individuals. Currently, there is little evidence regarding the impact of MFS on voicing and QoL. This study examined perceptions of voicing difficulties and QoL among persons with MFS. A total of 356 participants with a self-reported diagnosis of MFS completed the Quality-of-Life Index (QLI) and voice handicap index-10 (VHI-10) and provided medication regime. Some degree of voice handicap was reported by a majority of participants. Analyses assessing correlations between responses to the VHI-10, QLI scores, and reported medications were conducted. Specific medications and responses on the VHI-10 were significantly associated with QLI scores. Multiple regression analyses revealed that a summed VHI-10 score was the strongest predictor of QLI satisfaction, QLI importance, and overall QLI. The findings of the current study suggest that individuals with MFS may experience self-perceived phonatory dysfunction which impact QoL. Specific classes of drugs may also be associated with reported voice handicap and QoL satisfaction in MFS. These findings have implications for physicians and clinicians who work with individuals with MFS."

German Registry for Acute Aortic Dissection collected the data of 56 centres between July 2006 and June 2015. A total of 3382 patients undergoing operations for AADA were included and divided into 3 groups according to aortic root procedure types: supracommissural replacement (SCR), conduit replacement (CR) and valve sparing root replacement (VSRR). Patients in SCR (2425, 71.7%) were significantly older than CR (681, 20.1%) and VSRR (276, 8.2%) (63.4 vs 57.5 vs 54.2 years; P < 0.001), more female (38.9% vs 32.0% vs 26.1%; P < 0.001) and presented with less aortic regurgitation (26.3% vs 57.1% vs 56.5%; P < 0.001). VSRR presented with slightly less multiple organ malperfusion (11.6% vs 12.0% vs 10.9%; P = 0.045) and were more often diagnosed for Marfan syndrome (2.4% vs 5.1% vs 9.1%; P < 0.001).

    "abstract": "We report a case of huge aortic root aneurysm 19 years after aortic valve replacement. A 58-year-old woman was referred to us for aortic root dilatation. She underwent aortic valve replacement with mechanical valve due to severe aortic regurgitation of tricuspid aortic valve 19 years ago. We performed graft replacement of aortic root preserving prior mechanical prosthetic valve. Histological examination of aneurysm showed myxomatous change in medial layer. Aortic root dilatation after aortic valve replacement is caused by bicuspid valve, aortic dissection, Marfan syndrome, tissue disorder disease, aortitis, and dilated Valsalva sinus at the time of prior operation. It is important to follow-up a patient for root dilatation after aortic valve replacement."

    "abstract": "Marfan Syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease with multiple ocular abnormalities including ectopia lentis and a high incidence of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). The management of RRD may be challenging in cases of aphakic patients with Marfan. To report on the management of four cases of simultaneous RRD and aphakia with vitrectomy, silicone oil tamponade, and retropupillary iris-claw intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in patients with Marfan that have been operated at the Jules-Gonin Eye Hospital between 2019 and 2020. Ages at presentation were 20, 30, 32, and 31 years, respectively. All patients had a history of extraction of a dislocated lens. None of the patients had a previous posterior vitrectomy. Two patients had records of previous measurements for IOL calculation by optical biometry (IOL Master, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany) about 1 year prior to the RRD development. In two cases, measurements for IOL calculation by optical biometry were based on the contralateral eye. All patients underwent 23 G vitrectomy, peripheral iridotomy, and retropupillary iris-claw IOL. No intraoperative complications were encountered. All patients had silicone oil tamponade, one of which required heavy silicone oil. Silicone oil was removed 3 months following primary surgery. Minimum follow-up was 1 year. The single surgery anatomic success rate was 100%. All patients had visual acuity of at least 0.8 at the last follow-up (1.25, 1.0, 0.8, and 0.8 respectively). The targeted refractive results were accurately achieved in all four cases postoperatively. One patient presented ocular hypertension 2 weeks after surgery due to presumed steroid response and was managed conservatively. None of the patients had silicone oil migration into the anterior chamber. Retropupillary iris-claw IOL implantation in cases of RRD and aphakia creates a barrier to tamponades from the posterior segment, effectively preventing them from entering the anterior segment of the eye. Therefore, the management of aphakia and retinal detachment with simultaneous vitrectomy and a retropupillary iris-claw IOL may be a successful strategy in reducing postoperative complications in patients with Marfan syndrome."

    "title": "Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm in connective tissue disorder patients.",
    "abstract": "Connective tissue disorders (CTDs) are a group of genetically triggered diseases in which the primary defect involves collagen and elastin protein assembly with potential vascular degenerations such as thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) and dissection. These most commonly include Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection. Open surgical repair represents the standard approach in this specific group of patients. Extensive aortic replacements are generally performed in order to reduce long-term complications caused by the progressive dilatation of the remnant aortic segments. In the last decades, endovascular interventions have emerged as a valid alternative in patients affected by degenerative TAAA. However, in patients with CTD, this approach presents higher rates of reinterventions and postoperative complications with a disputable long-term durability, and it is nowadays performed for very selective indications such as severe comorbidities and urgent/emergent settings. Despite a deeper knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in CTD, improvements in medical therapy, and a multidisciplinary approach fully involved in the management of these usually frailer patients, this specific group still represents a challenge. Further dedicated studies addressing mid-term and long-term outcomes in this selected population are needed."

    "abstract": "Aortopathies associated to Marfan syndrome (MFS) are important causes of maternal death during pregnancy. We present a 27-year-old and 24-week pregnant MFS woman who arrived to the emergency department with increasing abdominal pain; an obstetric ultrasound showed an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA), a multislice computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed and demonstrated a 7.3 centimeter (cm) infrarenal AAA without evidence of dissection. A multidisciplinary committee determined that an open repair would lead to a significantly high maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality. Although endovascular repair (EVAR) in MFS patients remains controversial, an urgent bridge therapy was considered to be the best option. She was transferred to the angiography suite for EVAR to prevent AAA rupture and ensure a satisfactory pregnancy. The patient and fetus presented no complications during the procedure and were discharged 3 days later. She continued her pregnancy without eventualities and an elective C-section was performed on week 36. A CTA imaging at 12 months revealed type 1A and 3 endoleaks, we decided to perform endograft explant and a definitive open repair, there were no complications during the procedure, the patient is currently asymptomatic. Our case illustrates a complex decision and management that successfully avoid morbidity and mortality of a MFS mother and her product; additionally, this experience reinforces the need for lifelong and close surveillance in these patients."

We evaluated the utility of aortic root cross-sectional area/height index (CSA/Ht) on echocardiogram among pMFS patients as a risk stratification and surgical triage metric. Genotype or phenotype positive pMFS patients aged 25 years or younger seen at our center from 2001 to 2020 were identified. Time-related transition to surgery was modeled using parametric methods. Predictive utility of CSA/Ht compared with aortic root diameter (ARd) and root Z score (ARz) were modeled using nonlinear multivariable parametric and nonparametric longitudinal regression models. Seventy-nine patients (43% female) presented at median age of 5.8 years (15th-85th percentile, 0.75-17 years) with median follow-up of 4.4 years (range, 0-18.5 years). Baseline echocardiography data were: CSA/Ht, 3.9 ± 1.4 cm<sup>2</sup>/m; ARd, 2.4 ± 0.89 cm; and ARz, 2.4 ± 1.7. CSA/Ht tracked ARd better compared with ARz (r = 0.91 vs 0.24). Eighteen patients underwent surgery. Surgical procedures included at least 2 components in 17 (aortic, mitral, tricuspid, aortic root, and arch procedures) and isolated mitral valve procedures in 1 patient. Time-related transition to surgery showed a prominent early phase to 1 year post presentation, followed by a slowly increasing late phase. CSA/Ht had a more linear correlation versus ARz during periods of rapid somatic growth in surgical patients. Surgical repair occurred at CSA/Ht between 5 and 7 cm<sup>2</sup>/m. CSA/Ht tracked ARd well over time. CSA/Ht between 5 and 7 cm<sup>2</sup>/m might be a promising metric for surgical triage in pMFS patients. CSA/Ht surgical threshold values in pMFS patients occurred at lower than current accepted \"surgical\" threshold values for CSA/Ht in adult Marfan syndrome patients."

We aimed to interpret root operation strategies in the German Registry for Acute Aortic Dissection (GERAADA) cohort. GERAADA collected the data of 56 centers between July 2006 and June 2015. A total of 3382 patients undergoing operations for AADA were included and divided into three groups according to aortic root procedure types: supracommissural replacement (SCR), conduit replacement (CR) and valve sparing root replacement (VSRR). Patients in SCR (2425, 71.7%) were significantly older than CR (681, 20.1%) and VSRR (276, 8.2%) (63.4 vs 57.5 vs 54.2 yrs; p < 0.001), more female (38.9 vs 32.0 vs 26.1%; p < 0.001) and presented with less aortic regurgitation (26.3 vs 57.1 vs 56.5%; p < 0.001). VSRR presented with slightly less multiple organ malperfusion (11.6 vs 12.0 vs 10.9%; p = 0.045) and were more often diagnosed for Marfan syndrome (2.4 vs 5.1 vs 9.1%; p < 0.001). Thirty-day mortality was lower for VSRR (11.6%) compared to SCR (16.1%) and CR (19.8%; p = 0.010). Despite longer procedural times multivariable regression showed no influence of total arch replacement for VSRR on mortality compared to CR (OR 0.264; 95% CI, 0.033-2.117; p = 0.21). SCR remains the procedure of choice in elderly and compromised patients. Extended root preservation techniques may be applied even in combination with extended aortic arch surgery for selected patients for AADA with promising early outcomes."

WES revealed a novel, small, 0.76 Mb microdeletion in 15q21.1, which cosegregated with the disease phenotype in the family and led to the haploinsufficiency of the fibrillin 1 (<i>FBN1</i>) gene, which is associated with MFS.

While institutional series have sought to define the role of early intervention, large-scale analysis is lacking. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of initial strategy on recurrence and resource utilization in a nationally representative cohort. Patients (10-20 years) admitted for first-time pneumothorax were identified using the 2010-2019 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Based on the initial management strategy, patients were classified as nonoperative management, chest tube drainage only, and operative intervention. Multivariable regression was used to evaluate the impact of approach on outcomes of interest. The primary outcome was recurrence within 90 days, while length of stay and hospitalization costs were secondarily considered. Of an estimated 20,887 patients, 35.5% were classified as nonoperative management, 35.2% as chest tube drainage only, and 29.2% as operative intervention. Compared to others, the operative intervention cohort more frequently had Marfan syndrome and emphysematous blebs. After adjustment, patients initially managed operatively experienced lower odds of recurrence (adjusted odds ratio: 0.48, 95% confidence interval: 0.36-0.64), while chest tube drainage only had increased risk (adjusted odds ratio: 1.93, 95% confidence interval: 1.59-2.34) with nonoperative management as reference. Incremental 90-day length of stay was greater in operative intervention (β: +2.4 days, 95% confidence interval: 1.8-3.0) compared to nonoperative management, but 90-day costs were similar. Initial operative management for first-time pneumothorax appears to reduce risk of recurrence while demonstrating similar total costs. Due to high recurrence rates associated with conservative approaches, initial surgical intervention may be considered in this patient population."

    "title": "Arrhythmia and impaired myocardial function in heritable thoracic aortic disease: An international retrospective cohort study.",
    "abstract": "Heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD), typically entailing aortic complications, can be caused by pathogenic variants or likely pathogenic variants (PV/LPVs) in several genes, including fibrillin1 (FBN1), Actin Alpha2 (ACTA2) and genes encoding components of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling pathway. In addition to aortic complications, non-aortic cardiac disease such as impaired myocardial function and/or arrhythmia have been increasingly reported, mainly in Marfan syndrome with underlying FBN1 PV/LPVs and are acknowledged as additional causes of morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of these manifestations in the various HTAD entities is largely unknown. This international multicentre retrospective study collected data on patients with HTAD presenting non-aortic cardiac disease. A total of 9 centers from 7 different countries participated. Patients 12 years or older carrying a PV/LPV in one of the following genes: FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, TGFB2, TGFB3, SMAD3 and ACTA2 were screened. Non-aortic cardiac disease included impaired myocardial function and/or arrhythmia. Impaired myocardial function was defined as (a)symptomatic reduced ejection fraction (EF<50%). Arrhythmias included atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter (AFL), ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF) and (aborted) sudden cardiac death (presumed arrhythmogenic) (SCD). Medical records of 3219 patients with HTAD were screened (2761, 385 and 73 carrying a PV/LPV in FBN1, in a TGF-β signaling gene and in ACTA2 respectively). Non-aortic cardiac disease was reported 142 times in 101 patients (3.1%) (age 37 [range 12-77] years, 39% female): 88 patients carrying an FBN1 PV/LPV and 13 carrying a PV/LPV in one of the TGF-β signaling genes. Neither impaired myocardial function nor arrhythmia was reported in screened patients carrying a PV/LPV in ACTA2. Among the 142 reported non-aortic cardiac diseases, 68 (48%) were impaired myocardial function, 47 (33%) were AF/AFL and 27 (19%) were VT/VF/SCD. Among the patients with non-aortic cardiac disease, prior cardiac surgery was noted in 80% and severe valvular disease (valvular surgery or severe valvular regurgitation) in 58%, while 18% of the patients developed non-aortic cardiac disease in the absence of any of the latter. In patients with HTAD, arrhythmia and impaired myocardial function was reported in patients with PV/LPVs in FBN1 and in the TGF-β signaling genes and not in patients harboring PV/LPVs in ACTA2. Though infrequent, non-aortic cardiac disease should be acknowledged as potentially severe, also occurring in young patients with no underlying significant valvular or aortic disease."

On the basis of an extensive literature review and the responses from a survey distributed among providers with expertise in the diagnosis and management of eoMFS, we developed an age-based, diagnostic scoring system encompassing 10 features common to eoMFS (9 clinical + 1 laboratory) and divided them into cardiac, systemic, and FBN1 (on the basis of the location of the pathogenic FBN1 variant) scores. In total, 77 individuals with eoMFS (13 newly reported) and 49 individuals diagnosed with classical Marfan syndrome during early childhood were used to validate the criteria. Median cardiac (8 vs 0, P < .001), systemic (11 vs 3, P < .001), FBN1 (5 vs 0, P < .001), and total (23 vs 4, P < .001) scores were significantly higher in individuals with eoMFS than in those without. A proposed clinical score (cardiac + systemic) cutoff of ≥14 points showed excellent sensitivity (100%), specificity (92%), and reliability (correctly classified = 94%). Distinct from classical Marfan syndrome in phenotype and morbidity, eoMFS can be diagnosed clinically using an objective scoring system encompassing the typical physical features and cardiac disease manifestations. Although genetic testing can be suggestive of eoMFS, genetic testing alone is insufficient for diagnosis."

Whereas the musculoskeletal features of Marfan syndrome involve tall stature, arachnodactyly, joint hypermobility, and muscle hypoplasia, acromelic dysplasia patients present with short stature, brachydactyly, stiff joints, and hypermuscularity. Similarly, pathogenic variants in the fibrillin-2 gene (FBN2) cause either a Marfanoid congenital contractural arachnodactyly or a FBN2-related acromelic dysplasia that most prominently presents with brachydactyly. The phenotypic and molecular resemblances between both the FBN1 and FBN2-related disorders suggest that reciprocal pathomechanistic lessons can be learned. In this review, we provide an updated overview and comparison of the phenotypic and mutational spectra of both the \"tall\" and \"short\" fibrillinopathies. The future parallel functional study of both FBN1/2-related disorders will reveal new insights into how pathogenic fibrillin variants differently affect the fibrillin microfibril network and/or growth factor homeostasis in clinically opposite syndromes. This knowledge may eventually be translated into new therapeutic approaches by targeting or modulating the fibrillin microfibril network and/or the signaling pathways under its control."

This technique uses a 5-0 polypropylene monofilament to create two flanges with a thermocautery, for fixation of a capsular tension segment to the sclera to fix the subluxated capsular bag. This technique was implemented in 17 eyes requiring intraocular lens implantation in a setting of zonular dialysis due to trauma, Marfan syndrome, microspherophakia, idiopathic disease, and post-phacoemulsification status. Follow-up of the patients occurred at 18 months. Best-corrected visual acuity improved significantly from 0.85 to 0.39 (logMAR), whereas the spherical and cylindrical refractive errors and intraocular pressure remained stable from preoperation. No suture photodegradation or pseudophacodonesis were detected. The double-flanged 5-0 polypropylene suture transscleral bag fixation technique has shown favorable long-term outcomes in terms of bag intraocular lens/complex fixation and stability. In eyes with zonular weakness or dialysis, this technique appears to be a safe and knotless option for cataract surgery."

Immunostaining confirmed elevated Spp1 in adventitial fibroblasts, and Spp1 might regulate fibroblast and smooth muscle cell (SMC) communication primarily through Itga8/Itgb1. Then, we observed Spp1 reduced contractile genes Acta2 and Tagln expression in SMCs and increased collagen expression in fibroblasts, which might contribute to TAA development. Finally, we also found elevated SPP1 plasma level was associated with an increased risk of TAA in patients. Therefore, SPP1 may serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target for TAA."

    "abstract": "Synchronous aortic dissection (AD) with involvement of pre-existing infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are fortunately rare. Extension of the dissection flap to involve the aneurysm is particularly dangerous with pressurization of the false lumen within a diseased aortic wall. The aim of this article is to present a unique case of an acute AD with extension to involve a large AAA in a patient with an underlying connective tissue disorder. A 24-year-old male Marfan syndrome patient with prior type A dissection repair presented with a descending thoracic AD and a separate 7.0-cm infrarenal AAA. He was initially medically managed but developed acute extension of the dissection flap to involve the large aneurysm. The patient was initially treated with open infrarenal aortic replacement under left atrialfemoral artery bypass. Three years later, he developed degeneration of the residual aorta and underwent a two-stage hybrid repair. He underwent an additional stent graft for a distal anastomotic leak. At 5 years of follow-up, there was positive aneurysm remodeling and sac regression. This case illustrates the challenges in treating a patient with synchronous aortic processes. False lumen pressurization of a large aneurysm wall is fortunately rare but can be lethal. Prompt intervention is required but the presence of an underlying connective tissue disorder may limit endovascular treatment options. Careful case planning is mandatory and multiple interventions should be anticipated."

Patients with heritable thoracic aortic disease were included in the study. A total of 157 patients with aortic root aneurysm with the diagnosis of heritable thoracic aortic disease received the David procedure. Marfan syndrome was found in 143 (91.1%) patients, Loeys-Dietz in 13 and Ehler-Danlos in 1 patient. The median age was 35.0 (IQR: 17.5) years and the median ascending aorta diameter in the Valsalva sinuses was 48 mm (IQR: 4). A Valsalva graft was used in 8 patients; the David V technique was performed in the rest of the cases. The median follow-up time was 7.3 years [standard deviation: 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 6.12-8.05]. Only 2 patients died during the follow-up period. The overall survival was 99% (95% CI: 95%; 99%); 98% (95% CI: 92%; 99%); and 98% (95% CI: 92%; 99%) at 5, 10 and 15 years. Freedom from significant aortic regurgitation (AR> II), reintervention and postoperative type-B dissection was 90% (95% CI: 77%; 95%), 96% (95% CI: 91%; 99%) and 87% (95% CI: 68%; 95%) at 15 years, respectively. No differences were found in any outcome between Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. No statistically significant differences in survival were found when we compared expected gender- and age-specific population survival values. The David operation is an excellent option for the treatment of patients with heritable thoracic aortic disease and dilatated aortic root.

There was no statistically significant difference in major perioperative morbidity or 30-day mortality (0% VSARR vs. 1.4% VRARR; p = 0.316). Overall survival was significantly higher (p = 0.025) in the VSARR group versus the VRARR group (8-year estimates 100% vs. 88.9%, respectively), while freedom from valve reoperation was similar (p = 0.97, 8-year estimates 90.9% vs. 96.7%, respectively). Freedom from > moderate-severe AR was not significantly different (p = 0.08, 8-year estimates 90.0% VSARR group vs. 100% VRARR), but mean valve gradients at last follow-up were better in the VSARR group (5.9 vs. 13.2 mmHg, p < 0.001). VSARR is a safe operation in patients with aortic root aneurysm and nonstenotic aortic valves in the hands of experienced surgeons. Freedom from reoperation is similar and the mode of aortic valve failure differs between the two groups."

    "title": "Mechanism of Disease: Recessive ADAMTSL4 Mutations and Craniosynostosis with Ectopia Lentis.",
    "abstract": "Craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of the calvarial bones, has numerous etiologies. Among them, several involve mutations in genes related to the TGFb signaling pathway, a critical molecular mediator of human development. These TGFb pathway-associated craniosynostosis syndromes include Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) and Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS). LDS and SGS have many similarities common to fibrillinopathies, specifically Marfan syndrome (MFS), which is caused by mutations in FBN1. Historically discriminating features of MFS from LDS and SGS are (1) the presence of ectopia lentis (the subluxation/dislocation of the ocular lens) and (2) the absence of craniosynostosis. Curiously, several instances of a seemingly novel syndrome involving only craniosynostosis and ectopia lentis have recently been reported to be caused by recessive mutations in ADAMTSL4, a poorly characterized gene as of yet. Here, we report on two new cases of craniosynostosis with ectopia lentis, each harboring recessive mutations in ADAMTSL4. We also discuss a proposed mechanism for the relationship between ADAMTSL4, FBN1, and TGFb pathway-related syndromes."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant multisystem connective tissue disorder with increased risk of aortopathy with a high risk of subsequent life-threatening aortic dissection. Diagnosing this condition is reliant on recognizing clinical features and genetic testing for confirming diagnosis, using the revised Ghent criteria. We identified a 49-year-old patient who presented with dyspnoea, with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and a previously unreported variant in the fibrillin-1 gene (<i>FBN1</i>), designated c.7016G>C. Prior to identifying the new gene variant, this patient did not meet the revised Ghent criteria for MFS diagnosis. We present clinical and molecular evidence supporting the likely pathogenic nature of this variant, leading to earlier therapy and intervention. The discovery of a new pathogenic gene will expand the current aortopathy and MFS database and may lead to more informed clinical management decisions for the timing and nature of interventions."

    "title": "Marfan syndrome and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients have similar 90-day postoperative outcomes and 5-year reoperation rates after spinal deformity surgery.",
    "abstract": "Outcomes after spinal deformity surgery in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) are poorly characterized given the rarity of the condition. Updated analyses from nationally representative samples, and comparison to outcomes after more commonly performed procedures for conditions such as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) could help define the relative risks. Using the 2010-2020 PearlDiver administrative databases, patients who underwent posterior spinal fusion for > 7 segments were extracted. MFS patients were matched 1:4 to AIS patients based on age, sex, and Elixhauer comorbidity index (ECI). Ninety-day outcomes and 5-year reoperation rates were compared. Significance was set at p < 0.05. In total, 206 MFS patients were matched to 825 AIS patients. After adjusting for age, sex, and ECI, multivariate odds ratios (OR) for 90-day any, serious, and minor adverse events, as well as readmissions, were not significantly different for those with MFS compared to those with AIS (p > 0.05 for each). Five-year reoperation rates were also not significantly different (13.1% for the MFS cohort and 13.0% for the AIS cohort (no difference by log-rank, p = 0.9). While deformity surgery is much less commonly performed for MFS than AIS, it is not uncommonly considered for patients with this condition. Despite some known technical challenges for MFS deformity surgery, the current study leveraged a large, national database to find that 90-day adverse events and 5-year reoperations were not different for matched MFS and AIS patients undergoing deformity surgery. For select patients, these findings should be useful for surgical planning and patient counseling."

    "title": "Modified Bentall procedure: A 15-year single-center clinical experience.",
    "abstract": "Bentall procedure is a standard technique for complete aortic root replacement but a huge challenge is postoperative bleeding. Many modifications have been proposed and the \"button technique\" is commonly used. With a 15-year experience, this study was to evaluate outcomes of this modified Bentall procedure. A retrospective study was performed with all patients who underwent the Bentall procedure with a button technique between 2005 and 2020. Commercially available composite grafts were used in 38 patients and self-assembled composite graft was used in 74 patients. Safety outcome was postoperative complications and long-term outcomes included overall and reoperation-free survivals. Among 112 patients, the mean age was 46.3 years and 69.6% were men. Indications for the Bentall procedure were ascending aortic aneurysm and valve regurgitation (59.8%), aortic dissection (19.6%), Marfan syndrome (17%), and endocarditis (3.6%). Three patients (2.7%) died in hospital. During a median follow-up period of 42 months, 11 patients died and 7 patients required reoperation. Overall survival and reoperation-free survival were 86.1% and 83.4% at 5 years and 86.1% and 72.6% at 10 years, respectively. The Bentall procedure with a button technique is safe and effective for aortic root replacement. Further investigations are required to improve the feasibility and effectiveness of the procedure."

    "title": "Non-Dissecting Distal Aortic and Peripheral Arterial Aneurysms in Patients With Marfan Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "In Marfan syndrome (MFS), an aortic or peripheral arterial dilatation is usually the consequence of aortic dissection. Non-dissecting distal aortic and peripheral aneurysms (DAPA) are barely described. We sought to determine the incidence and prognostic impact of non-dissecting DAPA, requiring a surgical repair in a large population of patients with MFS. The patients referred to the French MFS reference center were included in a prospective database, and the patients treated for a non-dissecting DAPA between 2013 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The first-line therapy was open surgery. The patients unfit for open repair or experiencing life-threatening complications underwent endovascular repair. Among 1,575 patients with MFS, 19 (1.2%) were operated for 25 non-dissecting DAPA. The mean age was 42.4 ± 11.5 years. Non-dissecting DAPA involved the subclavian or axillary artery (<i>n</i> = 12), the descending or thoracoabdominal aorta (<i>n</i> = 6), the abdominal aorta andiliac arteries (<i>n</i> = 6), and the popliteal artery (<i>n</i> = 1). Open and endovascular repairs were performed in 22 and three cases, respectively. After a median follow-up of 54.2 months, no local recurrence was noticed and no secondary procedure was performed. Eight patients presented a new aortic event, including two aortic dissections and seven new aortic surgeries. Compared to the overall MFS population, the non-dissecting DAPA group presented a significantly higher risk of an aortic event (100 vs. 28%, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), a higher risk of aortic dissection (53 vs. 8%, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), and a higher rate of pejorative genetic mutations (68 vs. 40%, <i>p</i> = 0.011). Among the patients with MFS, the diagnosis of non-dissecting DAPA is infrequent but is associated with a significant adverse outcome, thus, advocating for a specific follow-up."

    "title": "Aortic dissection in the first trimester; is it a dead end? A narrative review of recent articles.",
    "abstract": "Acute-type aortic dissection (AD) during pregnancy is considered a rare and potentially fatal complication for both mother and fetus. Although the definite treatment for an acute-type AD is considered to be open-heart surgery, the decision to perform such a surgery during pregnancy requires a multidisciplinary approach and carries significant risks. In the present review of the literature, we have discussed various challenges in the management of acute-type AD during pregnancy, including therapeutic approaches, choosing the preferred imaging modalities, surgical techniques, and medication challenges. We have also reported an 8-week pregnant woman with Marfan syndrome who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with acute AD. The patient underwent a Bentall operation and was discharged in good condition with her fetus alive. The medical team's various decisions during preoperative, operative, and postoperative treatments were discussed. Type A AD is considered infrequent in the second and third trimester of pregnancy and rare in the first trimester. Performing a CMR study without contrast in stable patients can help evaluate the extension of the flap. Urgent surgery in the hands of a skilled surgeon may prove lifesaving for the mother while maximizing the likelihood of preserving the fetus."

    "title": "Current trends in minimally invasive valve-sparing aortic root replacement-Best available evidence.",
    "abstract": "Valve-sparing aortic root replacement such as the reimplantation (David) procedure is becoming increasingly popular. Despite the fact that the procedure is technically more complex, long-term studies demonstrated that excellent clinical outcomes in selected patients with durable repair are achievable. Benefits of minimal access cardiac surgery have stimulated enthusiasm in the use of this access for valve-sparing aortic root replacement. We have reviewed available literature on the topic of valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David procedure) via minimally invasive access through upper hemisternotomy in an attempt to assess current trends and to recognize potential advantages of this technique. Patient selection and preoperative work-up play important role in performing minimally invasive David procedure safely. Surgical technique corresponds to the standard David procedure, with a few exceptions related to the minimal access, and is performed via upper ministernotomy. Evidence from nonrandomized observational and comparative studies demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes of minimally invasive David procedure in selected patients with comparable perioperative mortality and outcomes to the conventional technique. To date, David procedure with a minimal access technique has been performed in carefully selected patients. We believe it could be particularly beneficial to provide younger patients (Marfan syndrome and bicuspid aortic valve) with minimally invasive David procedure as it can allow faster recovery with improved cosmesis with excellent outcomes. A decision to perform minimally invasive David procedure should be individualized to each patient and based on the experience of the team. Further large prospective randomized studies with long-term follow-up are still needed to confirm durability of minimal access technique."

    "abstract": "Skeletal deformity is characterized by an abnormal anatomical structure of bone and cartilage. In our previous studies, we have found that a substantial proportion of patients with skeletal deformity could be explained by monogenic disorders. More recently, complex phenotypes caused by more than one genetic defect (i.e., dual molecular diagnosis) have also been reported in skeletal deformities and may complicate the diagnostic odyssey of patients. In this study, we report the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of patients with dual molecular diagnosis and variable skeletal deformities. From 1108 patients who underwent exome sequencing, we identified eight probands with dual molecular diagnosis and variable skeletal deformities. All eight patients had dual diagnosis consisting of two autosomal dominant diseases. A total of 16 variants in 12 genes were identified, 5 of which were of de novo origin. Patients with dual molecular diagnosis presented blended phenotypes of two genetic diseases. Mendelian disorders occurred more than once include Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type I (COL1A1, MIM:166200), Neurofibromatosis, Type I (NF1, MIM:162200) and Marfan Syndrome (FBN1, MIM:154700). This study demonstrated the complicated skeletal phenotypes associated with dual molecular diagnosis. Exome sequencing represents a powerful tool to detect such complex conditions."

    "abstract": "Pre-emptive strategies to manage the aortic complications of Marfan syndrome have resulted in improved life expectancy yet, secondary to the variation of phenotypic expression, anticipating the risk and nature of future aortic events is challenging. We examine rates of new aortic events and reinterventions in a Marfan cohort following initial aortic presentation. Retrospective cohort study of Marfan patients with aortic pathology presenting to our institution 1998-2018. Patients were grouped according to index event: aortic dissection or root aneurysm. Patients with aortic dissection were classified according to Debakey criteria. Incidence of new aortic events and frequency of reintervention were analysed. One hundred and twenty-six aortic procedures were performed in 74 Marfan patients with a median follow-up of 7 years. Forty-seven patients had an index event of root aneurysm and 27 had aortic dissection. Following operative intervention in the aneurysm group, 7 patients developed Debakey III dissections raising the overall number of patients who developed dissection within this cohort to 34. Reinterventions were more frequent in the dissection group with full replacement of the native aorta in 5 patients. After operative intervention on the proximal aorta, a proportion will develop distal pathology. A greater focus on factors contributing to future events, such as mapping genotypes to clinical course, may lead the way for targeted operative techniques and surveillance."
