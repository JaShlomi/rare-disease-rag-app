    "title": "The Hidden Burden: Gastrointestinal Involvement in Lysosomal Storage Disorders.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are rare inherited metabolic diseases characterized by defects in lysosomal enzyme function or membrane transport. These defects lead to substrate accumulation and multisystemic manifestations. This review focuses on gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in LSDs, which is a significant but often overlooked aspect of these disorders. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of GI manifestations in several LSDs, including Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, Pompe disease, Niemann-Pick disease type C, mucopolysaccharidoses and Wolman disease. The pathogenesis of GI involvement in LSDs varies and encompasses substrate accumulation in enterocytes, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, mass effects, smooth muscle dysfunction, vasculopathy, neuropathy, inflammation and alterations to the microbiota. Clinical presentations range from non-specific symptoms, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea and malabsorption, to more severe complications, such as protein-losing enteropathy and inflammatory bowel disease. Diagnosis often requires a high level of suspicion, as GI symptoms may precede the diagnosis of the underlying LSD or be misattributed to more common conditions. Management strategies include disease-specific treatments, such as enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy, as well as supportive care and targeted interventions for specific GI complications. This review highlights the importance of recognizing and properly managing GI manifestations in LSDs to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. It also emphasizes the need for further research to develop more effective treatments for life-threatening GI complications associated with these rare genetic disorders."

    "title": "Analysis of the Effect of Demographic Variables on Lysosomal Enzyme Activities in the Missouri Newborn Screening Program.",
    "abstract": "Newborn screening laboratories are increasingly adding lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), such as Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) and Pompe disease, to their screening panels. Without newborn screening, LSDs are frequently diagnosed only after the onset of symptoms; late detection can lead to profound and irreversible organ damage and mortality. While screening of these disorders has accelerated over the past five years, there is little published information regarding the potential correlation of demographic variables (age at sample collection, birthweight, gestational age, gender, etc.) with lysosomal enzyme activity. The Missouri State Public Health Laboratory prospectively screened more than 475,000 newborns for MPS I, Pompe disease, Gaucher disease, and Fabry disease between 15 January 2013 and 15 May 2018. This report investigates trends between several demographic variables and activities of four lysosomal enzymes: α-L-iduronidase (IDUA), acid α-glucosidase (GAA), acid β-glucocerebrosidase (GBA), and acid α-galactosidase (GLA). This information provides a valuable resource to newborn screening laboratories for the implementation of screening for lysosomal storage disorders and the establishment of screening cutoffs."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is an inherited metabolic disorder, caused by acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme deficiency. Late-onset form (LOPD) usually presents with proximal and axial myopathy, followed by progressive respiratory involvement. Since 2006, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been the gold standard treatment. Recently, two ERTs of second generation have been approved. Several studies have demonstrated the benefits of the first generation ERT (FG-ERT), although outcomes are quite variable, and very long-term data are limited. In fact, functional long-term studies are still needed to clearly point out the prolonged efficacy of FG-ERT. We describe a cohort of 49 LOPD patients, providing a very long-term follow-up of motor and pulmonary function of 30 of them treated by FG-ERT (from 2 to 20 years), using 6MWT, FVC, and GSGC score to evaluate patients' responses. 6MWT remained quite stable in the first 4 years of therapy, followed by a slow decline of its value of about 21%. FVC showed an improving trend in the first 4 years, followed by a decline of about 12%. Along the follow-up, GSGC score worsened with an increasing of about 30% of the total score values. Although long-term results evidenced variable therapeutic responses, the general trend is an improvement in motor and respiratory functions during the first 2-4 years of treatment, followed by a variable degree of decline. According to these results, and in line with recent EPOC recommendations, it is strongly suggested to start therapy in symptomatic patients, but also to carefully manage presymptomatic patients to timely supply ERT treatment."

    "abstract": "Absence of functional acid-α-glucosidase (GAA) leads to early-onset Pompe disease with cardiorespiratory and neuromuscular failure. A novel Pompe rat model (Gaa<sup>-/-</sup>) was used to test the hypothesis that neonatal gene therapy with adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) restores cardiorespiratory neuromuscular function across the lifespan. Temporal vein administration of AAV9-DES-GAA or sham (saline) injection was done on post-natal day 1; rats were studied at 6-12 months old. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI) revealed that AAV-GAA treatment normalized diaphragm muscle glycogen as well as glycans. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that impaired cardiac volumes in Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> rats were corrected by AAV-GAA treatment. Biochemical assays showed that AAV treatment increased GAA activity in the heart, diaphragm, quadriceps and spinal cord. Inspiratory tidal volume and minute ventilation were increased in AAV-GAA-treated vs. saline treated Pompe rats. Neurophysiological phrenic nerve recordings and spinal histological evaluation indicated that AAV-GAA treatment drove functional neuronal GAA expression. We conclude that neonatal AAV9-DES-GAA therapy drives sustained, functional GAA expression and improved cardiorespiratory function in the Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> rat model of Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Newborn screening (NBS) is leading to the diagnosis of a large number of children with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), yet many remain asymptomatic until later years. A high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet is recommended for adults with LOPD. Nutrition guidelines are not available for young children. <b>Methods</b>: 37 children with LOPD aged 1-6 years participated. Early diet history, feeding practices, and 24 h dietary intake were collected via questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements, blood creatine kinase (CK), blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine ratio, and urine glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc4) were collected at clinic visits. A subset of 19 children received a clinical feeding assessment (CFA). <b>Results</b>: All patients derived their nutrition orally. Breastfeeding was successfully initiated in 73% of infants. Body weight ranged between 3 and 99% and height ranged from 4 to 97%. A tendency to be overweight and obese was noted in older children with LOPD. A total of 24% of the children who had CFA were diagnosed with dysphagia that was typically mild in severity and rarely affected their ability to eat a normal diet. Limiting added sugar and processed foods was the most widely used dietary practice followed by encouraging protein. Protein intake was three-four times higher than the recommended dietary intake (RDA). A high BUN/creatinine ratio was observed in some children, which may indicate incompatibility with protein intake and need for individualizing the diet. <b>Conclusions</b>: The results of this study provide a framework for developing future nutrition guidelines for children with LOPD by performing an individualized assessment of dietary intake, growth, feeding/swallowing, and laboratory parameters."

    "title": "Successful Pregnancy Outcome in Patient with Pompe Disease Despite Discontinuation of Enzyme Replacement Therapy.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD), is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) gene, resulting in a deficiency of the same enzyme and glycogen buildup in tissues. Late onset PD (LOPD) is characterized by muscle illness, accompanied by diaphragmatic involvement and leading to respiratory insufficiency. Fortunately, the disease progresses slowly, and treatment with enzyme replacement therapy can further delay its development. Pregnancy in women with LOPD requires special caution because musculoskeletal changes and greater physical demands may worsen muscular weakness and endanger both the mother and unborn child. Although several cases of pregnant women with LOPD that continued enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) during pregnancy have been reported, there is still a lack of data regarding teratogenicity and safety of the foetus. We present a case of a 31-year-old pregnant women with a mild form of LOPD who discontinued ERT during whole pregnancy. During the whole pregnancy there were no clinical signs of progression of muscle or pulmonary weakness. With careful monitoring of the patient and foetus, and planned delivery, a healthy baby girl was born. ERT was reintroduced 6 months after delivery with premedication (corticosteroids and antihistamines) for the first application, with no allergic reaction noted. In this patient with well-controlled LOPD, ERT was safely discontinued during pregnancy without disease worsening. The risks of ERT in pregnancy outweighed the potential complications of well-controlled disease. The final decision should be made with an individual approach for each patient by a multidisciplinary team. Pompe disease in pregnancy represents a treatment challenge due to the increased risk of worsening respiratory and muscle function and requires a multidisciplinary approach.Although several case reports reported safe usage of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) during pregnancy, more studies are needed to address the safety for the foetus and overall teratogenicity.In well controlled Pompe disease, ERT can be discontinued during pregnancy with careful foetal and maternal monitoring."

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by acid α-glucosidase deficiency, resulting in progressive skeletal muscle weakness and respiratory failure. We present the case of a 43-year-old African American woman who was admitted to the intensive care unit with acute-on-chronic hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, alteration of consciousness, and progressive weakness. Her recent medical history included respiratory distress and aspiration pneumonia, which had not fully resolved despite supplemental oxygen therapy. On admission, initial evaluations including imaging and laboratory tests did not reveal a diagnosis. Muscle biopsy showed a vacuolar myopathy with excess glycogen suggestive of glycogen storage disease. Enzyme testing was obtained through the dried blood spot testing and was low. Molecular genetic testing identified two pathogenic variants in the <i>GAA</i> gene, confirming the diagnosis of late-onset Pompe disease. This diagnosis enabled the prompt initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alpha. The early initiation of ERT in this patient was pivotal in managing her condition, given the progressive nature of late-onset Pompe disease and the potential for improved outcome when treatment is started early. This case highlights the importance of considering late-onset Pompe disease in adults presenting with unexplained progressive respiratory and neuromuscular symptoms. It also demonstrates the critical role of biochemical and molecular genetic testing, as early intervention can significantly impact treatment outcomes and quality of life."

    "abstract": "To review the clinical trial results and emerging real-world data of two new enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs) for late-onset Pompe disease and to compare these effects in the context of what has been achieved over the last two decades in advancing care for Pompe disease. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of avalglucosidase alfa and cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat have demonstrated that both treatments are at least as efficacious as alglucosidase alfa and possess a comparable safety profile. Several post hoc analyses of the trial data have shown that these newer ERTs result in a greater percentage of patients achieving meaningful improvements and larger reductions in biomarker levels. The first real-world data on switching from alglucosidase alfa to avalglucosidase alfa has shown that the switch is safe and may alter individual disease trajectories. The advent of two next-generation enzyme replacement therapies marks a new era in treating patients diagnosed with Pompe disease. Clinical trials and early real-world data suggest that they may be superior to alglucosidase alfa, the standard of care for the past 20 years, although head-to-head comparisons between all three treatments are lacking. More data will become available over the next 5 years, leading to better guidelines for starting, stopping and switching therapies based on a more personalized assessment of outcomes."

    "abstract": "To evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa in children with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) experiencing clinical decline (cohorts 1 and 2) or suboptimal response (cohort 3) to pre-study alglucosidase alfa. The Mini-COMET clinical trial, a phase 2, open-label, ascending-dose, 3-cohort study, has a 25-week primary analysis period (PAP) and an extension treatment period (ETP). In the PAP, cohorts 1 (n=6) and 2 (n=5) received avalglucosidase alfa 20 or 40 mg/kg every other week (qow), respectively. Cohort 3 received avalglucosidase alfa 40 mg/kg qow (n=5) or alglucosidase alfa (pre-study [>6 months] stable dose: 20 mg/kg qow to 40 mg/kg weekly; n=6). All children completed the PAP and entered the ETP. Children receiving avalglucosidase alfa in the PAP continued the same dose in the ETP. Those receiving alglucosidase alfa in the PAP received avalglucosidase alfa 40 mg/kg qow in the ETP. At baseline, children were 1-12 years old. Interim data (≥97 weeks) are presented from all 22 children, 20 receiving avalglucosidase alfa 40 mg/kg qow and 2 receiving 20 mg/kg qow in the ETP. Among the 6 who received 20 mg/kg qow avalglucosidase alfa in PAP (cohort 1), 4 had their dose increase to 40 mg/kg qow because of further clinical decline in the ETP. No child died or discontinued at data cut-off. PAP and ETP safety profiles were similar; no treatment-related serious or severe treatment-emergent adverse events occurred. Avalglucosidase alfa was well-tolerated, with no increased safety risk or immunogenicity concerns post-treatment switch. Echocardiography revealed persistent left-ventricular mass Z-score normalization. Compared with baseline, biomarkers of Pompe disease burden decreased, and motor function improved or stabilized. Results support the positive clinical impact of long-term avalglucosidase alfa in children with IOPD."

The phenotypic spectrum of this disorder encompasses infantile and late-onset forms, with variable multisystem involvement. Affection of the central nervous system is known to variably present in infantile forms, while the incidence of disease-related alterations in older patients is more debated. PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases were searched for papers regarding brain and spinal cord abnormalities at imaging and pathology, neuropsychological assessment and clinical reports in Pompe disease, without chronological restrictions. The database search identified 609 records, then 282 full-text articles were retrieved for detailed examination. Of these records, 81 were selected, which presented heterogeneity in methodology and overall analyzed small cohorts. Our search highlights the current fragmented evidence presented in the field. It would be advisable to perform a routine CNS assessment at least by imaging and neuropsychological evaluation at the time of diagnosis and as part of a regular follow-up, for IOPD but also for LOPD patients, to better characterize the prevalence and clinical significance of CNS abnormalities and provide a tailored follow-up."

Any improvement in FVC trajectory will delay ventilatory support; however, the change required for patients to perceive a noticeable clinical benefit, the clinically meaningful threshold (CMT), has not been defined in NMDs.ObjectiveTo derive the within-person and between-group CMTs for FVC (% predicted) in patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD).MethodsThis analysis leverages data from the Phase 3 COMET trial (NCT02782741, registered 25 May 2016), which assessed the efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa (AVA) versus alglucosidase alfa (ALG) on upright FVC (% predicted) in LOPD. Anchor- and distribution-based methods were used to estimate the within-person and between-group CMTs for FVC at Weeks 49 and 97.ResultsCOMET enrolled 99 participants aged ≥18 years (52% male; mean age 48.0 years). The within-person CMT for absolute change in FVC expressed as % predicted was estimated as 3.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3, 3.8]. The proportion of patients with a meaningful increase in FVC was higher in the AVA versus ALG group across the CI of the estimated CMT (odds ratios: 2.3-2.6; nominal p-values: 0.026-0.058). The between-group CMT, needed to evaluate differences between treatment groups, was estimated as 2.1% predicted [95% CI 1.1, 3.1].ConclusionsWe identified a narrow range of within-person and between-group CMTs for upright FVC (% predicted) in LOPD. <i>Post hoc</i> application of these thresholds to COMET showed that a greater proportion of patients in the AVA group had clinically meaningful improvement in FVC versus ALG.

    "abstract": "Adults with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) experience lower limb weakness, balance disorders, and recurrent falls. Mechanisms underlying postural control (stability, orientation) and falls in LOPD remain poorly understood. Investigating these aspects is critical to guide care and rehabilitation. This study compared postural control in participants with LOPD to controls, examining postural and muscular factors linked to falls and muscular contributions to postural alterations. This study was a cross-sectional, case-control study. Postural stability and orientation during stationary standing were evaluated using force platforms and 3D motion analysis under 2 visual conditions, while maximal muscle strength was measured with an isokinetic dynamometer. This cross-sectional, case-control study was conducted at a teaching hospital, which was a reference center for neuromuscular disease. This study involved 2 cohorts: participants with LOPD and control participants. Postural stability (center of pressure: COP displacements, lower limb joint range of motion) and orientation (COP mean position, weight distribution, joint positions) parameters were assessed, alongside falls reported over 3 months and maximal lower limb muscles strength. Compared to 20 controls, 18 adults with LOPD showed impaired postural stability, especially medio-laterally with eyes closed (ES = 0.42-0.83), and an anterior shift of the COP without joint orientation changes. Falls were strongly associated with COP mean velocity (eyes open: ρ = 0.73; eyes closed: ρ = 0.74) and with hip abductor (ρ = - 0.77) and extensor strength (ρ = - 0.79). Hip extensor strength was most strongly associated with COP mean velocity (eyes closed: ρ = - 0.72; eyes open: ρ = - 0.69). Adults with LOPD demonstrate impaired postural stability, especially in the medio-lateral plane with eyes closed, and an anteriorized upright orientation. Hip extensor and abductor strength, strongly linked to falls and stability, should be important to target in evaluations and rehabilitation and in studies on new therapies on LOPD."

Some patients with asymptomatic hyperCKemia may have Pompe disease. Aim of this research was analysis of the frequency of LOPD among Serbian patients with unexplained limb-girdle muscle weakness, and/or respiratory muscle weakness, and/or hyperCKemia. Analysis of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) activity was performed using tandem mass spectrometry in a sample of a dry blood spot. In patients who were found to have decreased enzyme activity, DNA was isolated from a dry blood spot and sequencing of the GAA gene was performed. During a 4.5-year period, 138 patients suspected of having LOPD were sent for the analysis. The average age at the time of testing was 44.3 ± 15.7 years, and symptoms duration was 7.3 ± 7.6 years. Mean GAA activity was 4.6 ± 1.9 umol/L/h. Decreased enzyme activity was observed in 10 (7 %) patients. Genetic analysis of the GAA gene was performed in these ten, and four (3 %) were diagnosed with LOPD. In the Serbian cohort of 138 patients with limb-girdle muscle weakness and/or respiratory muscle weakness and/or hyperCKemia, 3 % had genetically confirmed LOPD.

    "title": "Effect of newborn genomic screening for lysosomal storage disorders: a cohort study in China.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) have a relatively high incidence among rare diseases and can lead to severe consequences if not treated promptly. However, many countries and regions have not included these disorders in their newborn screening programs, resulting in missed early detection, underdiagnosis, and delayed treatment. Newborn genomic screening (NBGS) has shown good screening effectiveness for traditional biochemical screening diseases; however, its effectiveness for LSDs has not yet been evaluated in the general newborn population. To evaluate the outcome of NBGS for LSDs, a cohort study was conducted involving newborns recruited from Nanjing Women and Children's Healthcare Hospital in China from March 18, 2022, to September 21, 2023. All participants underwent NBGS of 15 LSDs (18 genes) via dried blood spots, followed by enzyme activity testing for NBGS-positive individuals. The study calculated the incidence and carrier rates for each LSD though NBGS, as well as the positive screening rate, the false positive rate and the positive predictive value of the screening process. Among 22,687 newborns (11,996 males [52.88%]), 1344 (6.0%) were identified as carriers, and 30 (0.13%) were initially positive for LSDs. Of these, 4 were excluded, 15 were diagnosed as LSD-presymptomatic individuals based on enzyme deficiency and pathogenic variants conforming to inheritance patterns, and 11 remain under follow-up. The estimated combined birth incidence of LSDs in Nanjing was 1/1512, primarily including Fabry disease, Krabbe disease, glycogen storage disease type II, Niemann-Pick disease, and mucopolysaccharidosis type II. Rather than directly comparing NBGS and enzyme activity screening, this study evaluated two sequential screening strategies: (1) NBGS-first with reflex enzyme testing and (2) enzyme activity-first with reflex genomic testing. The NBGS-first strategy demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity, with a significantly lower false positive rate and higher positive predictive values compared to the enzyme-first strategy (P < 0.05). This study highlights the potential of NBGS to enhance early detection of presymptomatic LSD individuals, enabling timely interventions and improving newborn health outcomes. Integrating NBGS into routine newborn screening programs could provide an effective and proactive approach for LSD identification and management."

    "abstract": "X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a rare, life-threatening congenital myopathy with multisystem involvement, which often includes the need for invasive ventilator support, gastrostomy tube feeding, and wheelchair use in approximately 80% of patients. The direct and indirect financial impact of extensive supportive care, as reported by caregivers of individuals with XLMTM, and the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of caregivers has not been previously described. Here, we use a survey co-designed by patient advocates to provide objective information on the physical and financial challenges of caregiving for individuals with XLMTM. A real-world web-based survey was conducted in the United States between November 19, 2019, and January 23, 2020. The survey was developed in association with patient advocacy leaders from the XLMTM community, who were also caregivers of individuals with XLMTM. The survey included the EuroQol 5-dimension 5-level HRQoL instrument and visual analog scale, and a cost (direct and indirect medical costs) and healthcare resource questionnaire. The survey was shared among the XLMTM community by patient advocacy organizations. Caregivers who completed the survey and met the eligibility criteria were included. Descriptive statistics were conducted using Microsoft Excel. Twenty-two caregiver respondents agreed to participate. All respondents completed the cost and health resource survey. Productivity loss varied between participants over the prior 12 months. Durable medical equipment expenses comprised most of the direct medical out-of-pocket costs. Non-medical expenditures (e.g. home and vehicle modifications) were higher than direct medical out-of-pocket costs. Twelve of the 22 respondents completed the HRQoL survey. The HRQoL domains most impacted were usual activities, anxiety/depression, and pain/discomfort. Findings from this real-world survey of caregivers for individuals with XLMTM describe the caregiver experience, as well as the multifaceted impact of the disease on caregiver productivity loss, out-of-pocket expenses, and HRQoL. XLMTM comes with financial constraints and substantial impacts on caregivers' physical and mental health. Understanding these gaps is crucial to support the caregivers who provide care for this medically fragile population."

To further assess treatment response and the effect of switching treatment from alg to cipa+mig, we conducted a within-group effect size analysis in ERT-experienced patients. In this post hoc analysis, standardized within-group effect sizes (Cohen's d for correlated measurements from baseline to week 52) were calculated by dividing the mean change from baseline by the corresponding standard deviation for motor function, lung function, and muscle strength outcomes; patient-reported outcomes/quality of life; and biomarker levels (creatine kinase and hexose tetrasaccharide). In PROPEL, 77% of patients received ERT with alg before study entry (median ERT duration 7.4 years). ERT-experienced patients remaining on alg+pbo (n = 30) generally showed within-group worsening (d ≤ -0.2) or stability (-0.2 < d < 0.2) across most outcomes, while those switched to cipa+mig (n = 65) mostly showed improvement (d ≥ 0.2) or stability. Patients remaining on alg+pbo demonstrated statistically significant worsening for several lung function outcomes, biomarker levels, and significant improvement for Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Dyspnea. Patients switched to cipa+mig did not demonstrate significant worsening for any outcomes and showed significant improvements for 6-min walk distance (absolute and % predicted); upper, lower, and overall manual muscle testing; PROMIS-Fatigue; Physician (overall score) and Subject Global Impression of Change (5/8 subdomains); and biomarker levels. ERT-experienced patients with LOPD who switched from alg to cipa+mig treatment achieved improvements or stability in most outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03729362."

    "abstract": "The aim of this scoping review was to examine the literature regarding the use of protein supplements to improve macroscopic muscle properties in a pediatric population in general, and more specifically in children with cerebral palsy. Based on our prospectively registered protocol (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/8DM9G), a systematic literature search was performed in five databases and two clinical registers. Studies were selected by two independent reviewers using predefined selection criteria, and data were summarized using a data extraction form. A broader search on adults with cerebral palsy and the general pediatric population was considered to be relevant due to the limited number of studies conducted in children with cerebral palsy. After deduplication, 5207 records were identified and screened. A total of 18 publications were included in the current review. Two studies were performed in individuals with cerebral palsy, eight in healthy children, two in children with respiratory problems, one in critically ill children, one in children with end-stage liver disease, one in children and adolescents undergoing treatment for a pediatric malignancy, one in children with Pompe disease and two in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The different muscle parameters reported were muscle volume, muscle mass, fat-free mass and fat-free mass index, lean body mass and lean body mass percentage, arm muscle area and muscle cross-sectional area of the arm, thigh and calf. The heterogeneity of the included studies and their moderate quality level made it difficult to draw solid overall conclusions. More research is needed on the use of protein supplements in children with cerebral palsy. However, supplementation with branched-chain amino acids, in particular leucine, might be promising."

    "abstract": "Currently, there are an estimated 8,000 genetic disorders that cumulatively affect approximately 10% of the population. Even among the 5% of patients with genetic disease that have treatment options, these therapeutics rarely address the underlying cause of disease but rather focus on managing or modifying symptoms and typically require recurrent, lifelong therapy. A therapeutic approach to genetic disease that in vivo delivers a functional copy of the aberrant gene is an intuitive solution that has thus far taken 3 decades to reduce to clinical practice, predominantly using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. Among available viral and non-viral gene delivery approaches, AAV vectors remain the most efficient means for in vivo delivery of DNA to the nucleus. AAV vectors now constitute a bone fide novel therapeutic drug class composed of seven US Food and Drug Administration-approved products with over 10-fold more in clinical development for an expanding number of disease indications and an identified list of problems to overcome for widespread clinical application. Here, we review current progress in clinical AAV gene therapy, including for neuromuscular disorders, hemophilia, primary cardiovascular disorders, or disorders with cardiovascular manifestations, lysosomal storage disorders, mucopolysaccharide disorders, primary central nervous systemic disorders, and ocular disorders."

Studies were included based on robust epidemiological methods, the presence of disease definition, and publication within the past 5 years. We identified 1210 abstracts, of which 295 met recency criteria, 30 were deemed relevant, and 11 met all inclusion criteria. Prevalence estimates and GAA enzyme activity cutoff values varied across geographic regions. In NBS studies, the birth prevalence of infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) ranged from 1 in 297,387 in Japan to 1 in 62,186 in Taiwan, and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) ranged from 1 in 82,914 in Taiwan to 1 in 17,133 in Pennsylvania. Data from the French National Pompe Registry (N = 246) showed an increase in diagnosis of LOPD from 2.6/year before 2001 to 10.6/year during 2001-2010 and 12.8/year during 2011-2015. Enzyme cutoffs in dried blood spots varied from < 3% of lymphocyte mean to 2.10 μmol/L/h to ≤ 18% of the daily median. Three studies noted higher prevalence in populations of African descent, and two noted a higher frequency of pseudodeficiency alleles in Asian populations. This scoping review confirmed that prevalence estimates differ for IOPD and LOPD and vary by geographic region, potentially by race and ethnicity. It highlights the need to standardize screening and diagnosis methods, genetic testing protocols, and uniform disease classification between IOPD and LOPD."

    "title": "Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification and Sanger Sequencing: Light and Shade in the Diagnosis of Lysosomal Storage Disorders.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification (MLPA) is a widely used technique for the diagnosis of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). It analyses over 40 DNA sequences in a single reaction, identifying copy number variations and large deletions/insertions in genes. The diagnostic process in LSDs starts with analysis of the missing or reduced enzyme, followed by genetic investigation and, if possible, a search for accumulated substrates. However, while genetic analysis using Sanger sequencing is excellent at detecting small genetic variations such as single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions or deletions, it cannot detect large deletions or insertions. <b>Methods:</b> In the present study, a total of 800 patients with clinical suspicion of Fabry, Gaucher, or Pompe diseases were investigated. An enzyme assay was carried out on each patient, followed by genetic analysis using PCR, Sanger sequencing, and MLPA. <b>Results:</b> Nine patients with deficient or absent enzyme activity had Sanger sequencing results that could not confirm the molecular genetic diagnosis because either no mutation (Fabry) or only one mutation (Gaucher and Pompe) was identified. Subsequent analysis by MLPA identified two males with a hemizygous deletion and two females with a heterozygous deletion for FD. For PD, one female and two males had a heterozygous deletion. For GD, one male had a homozygous deletion and one female had a heterozygous deletion. The remaining patients were analyzed by MLPA with negative results. <b>Conclusions:</b> The results obtained suggest that MLPA should be used in combination with classical sequencing methods to ensure a correct and timely diagnosis of LSDs."

    "title": "GAA replacement improves respiratory muscle, neural, and alveolar pathology in the pompe mouse.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a devastating neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the gene GAA. These mutations result in a deficiency of the enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA), leading to lysosomal glycogen accumulation in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle, motor neurons, and alveolar epithelial cells. Respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, and tracheo-bronchomalacia are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in PD patients. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is currently the only FDA approved treatment for Pompe disease, however, gene therapy with naturally occurring and engineered adeno-associated viral vectors are also widely studied as an alternative treatment. In the present study we directly compared the benefits of existing and novel treatment modalities - ERT, AAV9-GAA, and AAVcc47-GAA, with an emphasis on correction of pathologies related to respiratory function. We find that GAA replacement in early adult mice improves respiration through 9 months of age. This improvement is attributed to glycogen clearance in the tongue, diaphragm, and lungs, which subsequently improved diaphragm neuromuscular junctions and reduced lysosomes within the alveolar epithelia."

    "title": "Skeletal muscle effects of antisense oligonucleotides targeting glycogen synthase 1 in a mouse model of Pompe disease.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a progressive myopathy caused by the aberrant accumulation of glycogen in skeletal and cardiac muscle resulting from the deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Administration of recombinant human GAA as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) works well in alleviating the cardiac manifestations of PD but loses sustained benefit in ameliorating the skeletal muscle pathology. The limited efficacy of ERT in skeletal muscle is partially attributable to its inability to curb the accumulation of new glycogen produced by the muscle enzyme glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1). Substrate reduction therapies aimed at knocking down GYS1 expression represent a promising avenue to improve Pompe myopathy. However, finding specific inhibitors for GYS1 is challenging given the presence of the highly homologous GYS2 in the liver. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are chemically modified oligomers that hybridise to their complementary target RNA to induce their degradation with exquisite specificity. In the present study, we show that ASO-mediated Gys1 knockdown in the Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model of PD led to a robust reduction in glycogen accumulation in skeletal muscle. In addition, combining Gys1 ASO with ERT slightly further reduced glycogen content in muscle, eliminated autophagic buildup and lysosomal dysfunction, and improved motor function in Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our results provide a strong foundation for validation of the use of Gys1 ASO, alone or in combination with ERT, as a therapy for PD. We propose that early administration of Gys1 ASO in combination with ERT may be the key to preventative treatment options in PD. KEY POINTS: Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment in a mouse model of Pompe disease achieves robust knockdown of glycogen synthase (GYS1). ASO treatment reduces glycogen content in skeletal muscle. Combination of ASO and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) further improves motor performance compared to ASO alone in a mouse model of Pompe disease."

    "title": "Role of Biomarkers in Diagnosing Disease, Assessing the Severity and Progression of Disease, and Evaluating the Efficacy of Therapies.",
    "abstract": "This paper reviews biomarkers in lysosomal disease according to their categories and definitions. There are numerous biomarkers in lysosomal diseases. Some are disease or organ-specific, but most are not. Organ-specific biomarkers are especially useful, but most biomarkers help with diagnosis, assessing disease severity, prognosis, and pharmacodynamic response. There are as yet no truly validated biomarkers in lysosomal diseases by the Prentice, Fleming, and DeMets criteria. None so far can serve as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials, or as substitutes for clinically meaningful endpoints that evaluate how patients feel, function, or survive. The US Food and Drug Administration has thus far used surrogate biomarkers to license therapy only for 3 lysosomal diseases-Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, and lysosomal lipase deficiency. The paucity of surrogate biomarkers reflects success in using clinically important endpoints for the licensing of therapies for Pompe disease, mucopolysaccharidosis IVA, VI, and VII, Niemann-Pick type C, and CLN2. In conclusion, biomarkers in lysosomal diseases are best used for diagnosis, patient categorization, pharmacodynamic response, and sometimes for patient prognosis and risk. Thus far, they have been less useful as surrogate biomarkers in pivotal clinical trials."

    "title": "A model to predict the 6-Minute Walk Distance in Pompe disease.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare neuromuscular disorder caused by acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency, leading to glycogen accumulation and progressive striated muscle weakness. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is commonly used to assess functional capacity in neuromuscular diseases but can be challenging for severely affected ambulant patients. This study aimed to develop and validate predictive models for 6MWT performance using simpler, less demanding tests. This retrospective monocentric study included 74 patients with Pompe disease (712 visits) and a mean follow-up of 6.6 ± 3.8 years. Functional assessments included the 6MWT, 10-meter walk test (10mWT) which was specifically used to determine gait speed, timed tests, strength and respiratory measures, and the Motor Function Measure (MFM-32). Linear regression models were developed to predict 6MWT speed, with validation using an 80%-20% training-testing split. The cohort had an equal male-to-female ratio, with a mean age of 54.4 ± 13.5 years. The 10mWT speed showed a strong correlation with 6MWT speed (R = 0.91, p < 0.0001), confirming its potential as a surrogate measure. The most practical predictive model included 10mWT speed, age, sex, height, and weight, achieving an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of 0.86. This model balances simplicity and accuracy, relying on easily measurable parameters suitable for routine clinical use. More complex models, including variables such as the MFM-32 or supine-to-sit time, offered only marginal improvements in accuracy. The 10mWT offers a robust and less exhausting alternative to the 6MWT for assessing walking capacity in Pompe disease, particularly for ambulant patients with severe mobility limitations. Its strong correlation with the 6MWT and ease of implementation support its integration into clinical practice and trials."

Current therapeutics for LOPD do not meet the needs of patients and have largely been developed in mutant animal models lacking <i>Gaa</i> expression, which more closely mimic the less common infantile form of the disease. Here we design and evaluate peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs) to target the causative mutation in <i>GAA</i> and correct pathogenic splicing in muscle tissue.

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a rare genetic disorder that leads to intralysosomal glycogen accumulation because of a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA), which is required to break down glycogen to glucose. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) supplies exogenous GAA to reduce glycogen deposits, thereby improving motor and respiratory functioning. The first approved ERT for PD was the rhGAA alglucosidase alfa. Limitations associated with this treatment led to the development of two other rhGAAs: avalglucosidase alfa and cipaglucosidase alfa. This review describes the limitations of alglucosidase alfa and focuses on the strategies used to overcome these limitations, including the conjugation of multiple synthetic bis-M6P - containing hexasaccharides to sialic acids present on the enzyme, thus enhancing M6PR targeting, enzyme uptake, glycogen clearance, and therapeutic outcomes. Efficacy and safety of avalglucosidase alfa in late-onset and infantile-onset PD are also discussed. A brief overview of the newest ERT, cipaglucosidase alfa, is also provided. While ERT for PD continues to improve with more effective enzymes like avalglucosidase alfa, the future lies in integrated approaches that combine different therapeutic modalities (gene therapy, substrate reduction therapy) and the use of biomarkers to individualize treatment."

The deficient GAA enzyme activity may result in potential life-threatening muscle weakness, thus requiring a rapid diagnosis to initiate therapeutic interventions. In this large retrospective study, we analyzed 30.836 PD suspect samples from 57 countries using a two-step approach utilizing dried blood spots (DBSs): biochemical testing of GAA activity followed by complementary genetic sequencing of <i>GAA</i> in biochemically conspicuous cases. Of these 30.836 samples, 2% (<i>n</i> = 639) were excluded; accordingly, this study consisted of 30.193 cases. Biochemical testing of GAA enzyme activity showed normal values in 28.354 (93.90%) and enzyme activity below the cut-off in 1843 (6.10%) cases. These biochemically suspicious cases were genetically analyzed. We identified 723 Pompe cases with 283 different <i>GAA</i> alterations, and 98 variants have been unpublished so far. The most common variant was the splice variant c.-32-13T>G (IVS1). Looking at the IVS1-genotype, the majority was compound heterozygous (<i>n</i> = 169) and identified in late-onset cases (<i>n</i> = 162). Comparison of early- versus late-onset cases to evaluate whether certain genotypes correlate with the age of onset revealed that homozygosity was predominantly found in infantile (85.65%) and compound heterozygosity in late-onset (76.9%) cases. Analysis of homozygous cases revealed 61% nonsense variants in the early stages and 87% missense variants in the late stages. Mapping of disease-associated (homozygous) missense variants to functional GAA protein domains showed that missense variants were found throughout GAA, but we identified enrichment in the catalytic domain. A strict genotype-phenotype correlation cannot be established; nevertheless, a phenotypic implication of some <i>GAA</i> variants could be drawn (e.g., c.896T>C/p.L299P, c.2015G>A/p.R672Q, and c.-32-13T>G). The combined enzyme activity and genetic testing from DBS cards can reliably identify PD and significantly accelerate diagnosis. We identified new genetic variants that contribute to the spectrum of pathogenic variants of the <i>GAA</i> gene."

    "title": "Bone disease and osteoporosis associated with Pompe disease.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder defined by a mutation in the GAA gene encoding alpha-1,4-glucosidase alpha (acid maltase). Pompe disease encompasses a range of clinical presentations that are broadly characterized as either classic infantile Pompe disease or late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). LOPD is a milder manifestation of the disease that presents after the first year of life and is typically characterized by mild proximal muscle weakness and lack of cardiac involvement compared to the classic infantile form. The mainstay of treatment is enzyme replacement therapy (EnRT). Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) is frequently encountered in LOPD. While bone loss is thought to be due to mechanical unloading secondary to the progressive muscle weakness associated with the disease, there is a lack of tissue-level data in support of this mechanism. We describe a 60-yr-old female with LOPD managed with EnRT who presented with proximal muscle weakness and decreased BMD on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Undecalcified bone histology showed low turnover osteoporosis, and treatment was initiated with romosozumab. Romosozumab specifically may provide a promising osteoporosis therapy for LOPD-associated osteoporosis. As a sclerostin inhibitor, it both inhibits bone resorption and promotes new bone formation. We additionally emphasize that bone biopsy should be considered as a useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of osteoporosis associated with uncommon pathologies, since bone histology provides more specific tissue-level information over clinical and laboratory evaluation as well as substantive guidance for treatment."

Tadalafil, a once-daily PDE5 inhibitor, did not slow loss of ambulation in a phase 3 placebo-controlled trial. This report details the cardiac findings from this study. Patients with DMD (N = 331) aged 7 to 14 years on stable glucocorticoids were randomized to tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg/day, 0.6 mg/kg/day, or placebo. Ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening, and M-mode ventricular dimensions were measured on echocardiograms. 12-lead ECGs were centrally evaluated for heart rate and intervals, and qualitative diagnoses. Vital signs and unsolicited adverse events were collected throughout the study. Cardiac MRI (CMR) was collected in a subset of 27 patients. Z-scores for ventricular dimensions and volumes were calculated based on published age-normative reference values. Treatment differences for change in continuous ECG parameters and vital signs were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Echocardiogram and CMR parameters were analyzed with an ANCOVA model. Tadalafil had no adverse effects on echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) EF or fractional shortening, ECG findings, or vital signs. Mean diastolic LV internal dimension (LVIDd) was increased in the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group versus placebo at Week 24 (+ 0.13 cm, p =.019) and Week 48 (+ 0.18 cm, p =.008), with a similar pattern observed for LV systolic dimensions (LVIDs). Mean LV end diastolic volume (EDV) measured by CMR also increased at Week 48 in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg (+ 13.0 ml, p =.047 vs. placebo) and 0.6 mg/kg (+ 12.0 ml, p =.08 vs. placebo) groups, with numerically smaller increases in LV EDV and commensurate increases in stroke volume and cardiac output. Z-scores for LVIDd and LV EDV were generally below the normal range at baseline and increased toward or within the normal range in the tadalafil groups but not in the placebo group. No adverse effects of tadalafil on cardiovascular function were evident based on adverse events, echocardiograms, ECG, or vital sign measurements through 48 weeks in patients with DMD. The small mean increases in LVID and LV volume observed with tadalafil are consistent with PDE5 inhibitor pharmacology, but their clinical relevance in the context of LV tonic contraction in DMD is unknown and deserve further study.

However, despite these ground-breaking innovations, the importance of a multi-system and rehabilitative approach remains critical, as it addresses the complex systems involved in the disease and optimizes the success of pharmacological treatments. We conducted a narrative review of the current pharmacological treatments approved for Pompe disease, as well as those undergoing clinical trials. We also reviewed international recommendations for managing respiratory, musculoskeletal, and cardiac function specially focusing on the late-onset form. There are no universally agreed guidelines for the multidisciplinary management and many recommendations are based on expert consensus and small interventional studies. Nevertheless, combined approaches involving ERT therapy along with specific rehabilitation and nutritional programs appear to yield beneficial effects. Pompe disease, one of the first neuromuscular diseases to benefit from the approval of disease-modifying therapies, is a paradigm for the importance of an integrated therapeutic-rehabilitative approach."

As a result, the prevalence of PD has increased with early detection, primarily of late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). No clear guidelines exist regarding if and when to initiate enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients identified through a newborn screen (NBS). To help define the natural history and indications for starting ERT, we present the long-term follow-up data of 45 patients identified through NBS from 2016 to 2021. These patients were evaluated at regular intervals through our multi-disciplinary clinic at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) with physical examinations, physical therapy evaluations, muscle biomarkers including creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and hexosaminidase 4 levels (Hex4), as well as cardiac evaluation at certain points in time. We found that newborn screening of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme detected primarily LOPD. One case of infantile-onset PD (IOPD) was detected. Muscle biomarkers in LOPD were elevated at birth and showed a general downward trend over time. NBS GAA levels and initial CK levels helped to differentiate LOPD cases from unaffected infants (carriers, pseudodeficiency alleles), while Hex4 was not a meaningful discriminator. On repeat NBS, there was a significant difference between mean GAA levels for the unaffected vs. compound heterozygote groups and unaffected vs. homozygote groups for the common splice site pathogenic variant (c.-32-13T>G). Echocardiogram and electrocardiogram (EKG) are essentially normal at the first evaluation in LOPD. One LOPD patient was started on ERT at age 4.5 months. Continued data collection on these patients is critical for developing management guidelines, including timing of ERT and improved genotype-phenotype correlation."

    "abstract": "Glycogen is a primary cellular energy store in numerous eukaryotes. Its biosynthesis is a main strategy to cope with forthcoming starvation. During starvation, glycogen is processed in the cytosol or delivered for degradation to animal lysosomes or yeast vacuoles by macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy). However, the mechanism of glycogen autophagy is poorly understood, especially in the heart and skeletal muscles that suffer from the lysosomal glycogen accumulation in Pompe disease. We recently developed the <i>Komagataella phaffii</i> yeast as a simple model to study glycogen autophagy and found that this pathway proceeds non-selectively. However, studies in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> proposed glycogen as a non-preferred cargo of bulk autophagy. In our latest study with new fluorescent reporters for glycogen, we clarified cargo properties of <i>K. phaffii</i> glycogen. Both homologous and heterologous markers of glycogen are delivered to the vacuole and degraded with efficiencies that are independent of glycogen, suggesting that glycogen is a neutral cargo of bulk autophagy. This work provides insights into the evolutionary diversity of glycogen autophagy in yeasts with implications for understanding this process in complex eukaryotes."

The GH31 enzyme MalA from a hyperthermophilic archaeon is explored here as a stable homolog of GAA. MalA is highly expressible, easy to purify, and structurally characterised. The R400H mutant in MalA, corresponding to the pathogenic GAA R600H mutation, revealed here a 1200-fold drop in specificity constant and >8 °C reduction in thermal stability.

    "abstract": "Although Pompe disease (PD) was originally characterized as a metabolic myopathy, there is now emerging evidence of neurological involvement in children and adolescents with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD). Therefore, assessing cognition and detecting cognitive changes in these individuals over time have become important components of their care. The National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHT-CB, Version 2) is a brief, standardized instrument designed to measure cognitive processes in individuals 3-85 years of age. With its availability and ease of administration by a trained provider, the NIHT-CB could potentially be used in a clinical health care setting to help screen/monitor cognition in individuals with PD. This is the first study to report the use of the NIHT-CB in children and adolescents with IOPD and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) and their performance on this instrument in comparison to traditional neuropsychological measures. Fourteen children with IOPD (median age = 10.5, range = 6-19 years) and eight with LOPD (median age = 12.5, range = 7-17 years) were administered the NIHT-CB and a neuropsychological battery by the same psychologist with expertise in PD. On the NIHT-CB and selected neuropsychological measures, nearly all median scores for the IOPD group were lower than those of the LOPD group. However, none of the differences between the IOPD and LOPD groups were statistically significant. Consistent with previous reports, there was a wide range of scores among the IOPD and LOPD participants on both the neuropsychological measures and the NIHT-CB. The lowest median NIHT-CB score for both groups was on the Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test (IOPD = 77.5, LOPD = 84), a measure of executive function and selective attention. Positive, significant relationships were found between the NIHT-CB and neuropsychological measures of overall cognition, reading decoding, and short-term working memory on the Wechsler Intelligence Test scales and the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement subtest for the IOPD group only. Though not a replacement for an established neuropsychological battery, the NIHT-CB could potentially be used as a screening measure to provide a baseline level of cognitive functioning in children and adolescents with IOPD. Observed changes in the NIHT-CB Cognitive Function Composite or selected subtests over time may also signal the need for a more comprehensive neuropsychological battery and/or brain imaging studies as indicated. Longitudinal studies examining the performance of a larger cohort of IOPD and LOPD children and adults at multiple time points are needed."

    "abstract": "C-2 Fluorinated castanospermines have been synthesized from a well-protected aldehyde precursor and evaluated as glycosidase inhibitors in comparison with castanospermine, 1-<i>epi</i>-castanospermine and C-1 fluorinated castanospermines. While C-1 fluorinated castanospermines lose nearly all the glycosidase inhibition shown by castanospermine and 1-<i>epi</i>-castanospermine, C-2 fluorinated derivatives of castanospermine were found to be potent and highly specific α-glucosidase inhibitors; however, the C-2 fluorinated 1-<i>epi</i>-castanospermines showed a sharp decrease in inhibition towards all tested enzymes. Docking calculations attributed the sharp decrease of glycosidase inhibition of C-1 fluorinated castanospermines to the disappearance of hydrogen bonds between the original C-1 hydroxyls and residues Arg-526 and Asp-327. The retained potent and specific α-glucosidase inhibition of C-2 fluorinated castanospermines was achieved by the fluorine-induced reestablishment of the docking mode in the active site; and the sharply decreased inhibition of C-2 fluorinated 1-<i>epi</i>-castanospermines can be attributed to obvious binding distorsion and disappearance of the hydrogen bonding with residues His-600 and Arg-526. Reliability of the docking results was evaluated by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation, which provided necessary calibrations to the calculation results. The interaction modes of fluorine reported herein are different from the \"mimic effect\" of fluorine for hydrogen, offering insights and extending our previous work on fluorinated casuarines. These results would be important for the development of castanospermine-related drug candidates for the treatment of diabetes, viral infections and Pompe disease."

In some cases, early pre-symptomatic treatment is necessary for optimal response, and thus newborn screening is critical.ObjectiveTo review the current status of newborn screening programs for neuromuscular diseases and early diagnosis through genetic testing.MethodsFollowing the PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was performed on PubMed for screening of neuromuscular diseases; the search was conducted on literature available as of 1 May 2024.ResultsIncluded were 77 articles on newborn screening for seven diseases: spinal muscular atrophy (19 studies), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (15), Pompe disease (20), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (14), Krabbe disease (6), metachromatic leukodystrophy (2), and myotonic dystrophy 1 (1). Ten articles on rapid genomic diagnosis were identified.ConclusionSince 2021, newborn screening programs for neuromuscular diseases have been established, notably in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, Pompe disease, and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Even in diseases where treatment is currently not life-changing, such as Krabbe disease, new newborn screening programs continue to be implemented, especially in the USA. The use of genetic diagnostic tests does not yet appear to be widespread or at least not widely reported. As new treatments become available, genomic newborn screening programs will need to be rapidly and broadly implemented."

    "abstract": "In a recent publication by Klein et al., the need for real-world data on rare diseases is highlighted. We strongly support this need, and the collaboration with the patient community to collect data, as promoted in this publication. Our concern, however, is that this paper may be misunderstood as suggesting that the Sanofi-run Rare Disease Registries (RDRs) are sufficient to provide the datasets needed to evaluate current and future therapies. Industry-driven registries focus on their own product(s) and, therefore, do not provide the opportunity to compare products from different companies. Today, multiple companies produce treatments for all diseases included in the RDRs. Each company will have to run its own registry for regulatory purposes. This will lead to data fragmentation, which is prohibitive of truly understanding the effects of the various treatment options for these rare diseases. Therefore, independently funded and owned registries are essential to generate real-world evidence (RWE) unrelated to specific products. We discuss options for this for Pompe disease, including the International Pompe Survey, which has collected patient-reported outcomes independently from industry since 2002. This letter aims to raise awareness of the problem of siloed data and advocate for a new way forward where independent registries provide post-marketing surveillance data."

On arrival, the patient was severely compromised with a reduced Glasgow Coma scale and arterial pCO2 > 14 kPa. She was intubated and taken to the intensive care unit for respiratory support and further investigations.A detailed patient history revealed multiple admissions in the psychiatric sector with anxiety disorder, as well as numerous admissions to the emergency department with progressive tremors, muscle fatigue and dyspnoea, all of which were interpreted as anxiety attacks. Based on this history, we suspected a neurological disorder in our patient. Following extensive neurological investigation and additional genetic studies, the diagnosis of late-onset Pompe's disease was confirmed.Late-onset Pompe's disease can pose a diagnostic challenge due to its multifaceted presentation with non-specific symptoms. Any patient not responding to treatment should urge clinicians to re-evaluate their differential diagnoses."

The aim of this study was to investigate self-reported and parent-reported health related quality of life (HR-QOL) and fatigue in children with Pompe disease. In this cross-sectional study, the validated Child Health Questionnaire and PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale were used to respectively measure (both self-reported and parent-reported) HR-QOL and fatigue in children with Pompe disease. In total, of 24 patients with Pompe disease (and their parents) participated, with a median age of 9.6 years [IQR 7.7-11.9], 14 had classic infantile Pompe disease. Self-reported HR-QOL was comparable with the healthy Dutch population on most domains, and patients with the classic infantile type scored mainly lower on physical functioning. Parents of patients with classic infantile Pompe disease reported a significantly lower HR-QOL of their children on 9 domains and parents of patients with (non-classic) childhood-onset Pompe disease on 5 domains. Self-reported fatigue levels in children with classic infantile Pompe disease were increased for 2 of 3 domains compared with healthy peers, and fatigue in patients with non-classic Pompe disease did not differ. Parents of patients with classic infantile Pompe disease reported greater levels of fatigue in all 3 domains compared with healthy children, whereas parents of children with childhood-onset disease scored greater on the cognitive fatigue domain. Children with Pompe disease report comparable HR-QOL on most domains compared with healthy peers. Contrarily, parent-reported HR-QOL was substantially lower on most domains compared with references values. As expected in relation to disease severity, unfavorable effects on HR-QOL and fatigue were more pronounced in patients with classic infantile Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Access to high-cost drugs for rare diseases poses global challenges, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Pompe Disease (PD) exemplifies these challenges as a case study to analyze Brazil's approach to accessing high-cost therapies. This study aims to characterize access to high-cost drugs for rare diseases in Brazil using PD as a reference and to compare Brazil's approach with global trends in PD treatment. A documentary review on access to PD treatment within Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS) was conducted. This included health technology assessments (HTA) and regulatory decisions from Brazilian and international agencies. Data on the dispensing of alglucosidase alfa from the Brazilian Outpatient Information System (SIA/SUS; Jan 2020-May 2024) were analyzed and compared to previous budget impact estimates. Only alglucosidase alfa is covered by the SUS, and exclusively for Infantile-onset Pompe Disease (IOPD). Projections for vial usage in the SUS were overestimated. Key drivers of access include Ministry of Health policies, HTA recommendations, judiciary decisions, and industry actions. Brazil's access model shows partial alignment with global trends, but significant gaps remain. The study highlights systemic issues that are relevant to other rare diseases, offering insights and lessons for Brazil and other middle-income countries."

    "abstract": "The stabilisation of recombinant glycosidases by exogenous ligands, known as pharmacological chaperones or enzyme stabilisers, has recently garnered great clinical interest. This strategy can prevent enzyme degradation in the blood, reducing required dosages of recombinant enzyme and extending IV injection intervals, thereby reducing side effects, improving patient lifestyles and treatment costs. While this therapeutic approach has been successfully implemented for treating Pompe and Fabry diseases, clinical studies for Gaucher disease using chaperones alone or in combination with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) have been limited, and no small molecule chaperones have yet been approved for this condition. Developing such therapies requires selective and effective reversible GBA1 ligands. Here, we describe the development of a new class of selective macrocyclic peptide GBA1 ligands using random nonstandard peptides integrated discovery (RaPID) technology, and demonstrate their ability to bind and stabilise rhGBA1 in plasma at nanomolar concentrations. These cyclic peptides do not inhibit endogenous GBA1 in cells due to poor cell permeability but can stabilise extracellular rhGBA1 in plasma, presenting significant potential as a combinatorial ERT-pharmacological chaperone therapy for Gaucher disease."

    "abstract": "The involvement of the neocortex in memory processes depends on neuronal plasticity, the ability to restructure inter-neuronal connections, which is essential for learning and long-term memory. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for advancing early diagnosis and treatment of cognitive disorders such as Parkinson's, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. This study explores a neuronal model with expanded populations, using information-theoretic cues to uncover dynamics underlying plasticity. By employing Bandt-Pompe's entropy-complexity (H×C) and Fisher entropy-information (H×F) planes, hidden patterns in neuronal activity are revealed. These methodologies are particularly suitable for analyzing nonlinear dynamics and causal relationships in time series. In addition, the Hénon map is applied to capture nonlinear behaviors, such as neural firing, highlighting the trade-off between stability and unpredictability in neural networks. Our approach integrates local field potential and intracranial electroencephalograms' data in multiple frequency bands, connecting computational models with experimental evidence. By addressing higher-order interactions, such as action potential triplets, this work advances the understanding of synaptic adjustments and their implications for neuronal complexity and cognitive disorders."

    "abstract": "Although alglucosidase alfa (AGL) is the standard treatment for Pompe disease, its efficacy is limited, partially because of its low mannose-6-phosphate content. Avalglucosidase alfa (AVA), a glycoengineered recombinant human acid α-glucosidase, has shown improved receptor-mediated uptake compared with AGL. Herein, we report the long-term efficacy and safety of AVA in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) previously treated with AGL. This retrospective cohort study included 9 patients with IOPD who transitioned from AGL to AVA; these patients were diagnosed and treated after being detected with IOPD via newborn screening. We analyzed the clinical status, biomarker levels (serum creatine kinase and urine glucose tetrasaccharide), and functional assessments before and after AVA treatment of these patients. Statistical analyses were performed using the Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test. Due to inadequate responses, all 9 patients received AGL at dosages exceeding the label recommendations, including one who also had tried cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat before transitioning to AVA. After transitioning to AVA at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every other week for a median duration of 4.9 years, the patients experienced significant reductions in biomarker levels (serum creatine kinase levels decreased by 63% and urine glucose tetrasaccharide levels decreased by 69%). Functional assessments, including pulmonary function and 6-minute walk tests, showed improvement in young patients but remained stable in older patients. Safety analyses revealed manageable infusion-associated reactions. Immune modulation therapy for antidrug antibodies was administered to 1 IOPD patient. The transition from a high dose of AGL to AVA demonstrated sustained improvements in biomarker levels and motor function in patients with IOPD. Early initiation of AVA is crucial for patients with IOPD."

The mechanism of LOPD has been less explored. In this study, we used an integrative analysis of the proteomics and metabolomics of LOPD muscle samples to reveal the potential mechanisms. Proteomic analysis identified 635 upregulated proteins and 89 downregulated proteins in the LOPD group. Similarly, metabolomic analysis revealed 15 upregulated and 143 downregulated metabolites; notably, L-arginine levels were significantly decreased in the LOPD group. Lysosome-related GO terms were significantly upregulated, while GO terms related to neurofilament, cytoskeleton, axon ensheathment, and myelin sheath were significantly downregulated. KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that the lysosome, autophagy, and mTOR pathways were distinctly upregulated. Correlation analysis indicated that CALML3 showed a potential correlation with LOPD severity. Our study highlighted the potential crosstalk among these LOPD-related pathways. Supplementation with L-arginine could represent a promising therapeutic approach for LOPD, and CALML3 could serve as a potential biomarker for LOPD severity. These findings provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of LOPD and suggest avenues for future therapeutic development."

Fifteen adult centres responded to our survey with information on their patients. Nine thousand, six hundred fifty-one patients were included in the final cohort, compared with 6 182 in the previous analysis. There were 394 separate diagnoses. The most common diseases were phenylketonuria (19.6%), mitochondrial disorders (12.3%) and lysosomal storage disorders such as Fabry disease (20.1% of LSD's), Pompe disease (3.1%), and Gaucher disease (2.8%). Among the disorders that can present with acute metabolic decompensation, the urea cycle disorders (4.0%), were most common (ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency 2.6%), followed by maple syrup urine disease (1.1%) and glycogen storage disease type I (0.7%). Patients were frequently diagnosed as adults, particularly those with mitochondrial disease and lysosomal storage disorders. Many patients are only diagnosed in adulthood (> 40%) and the cohort is increasing substantially with 9 651 patients included in the final analysis (34% increase compared to our original paper). Thus reinforcing the need for adult specialists to be trained in this area."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficient activity of acid alpha glucosidase (GAA) enzyme due to mutations in the GAA gene. As a result, undigested glycogen accumulates within lysosomes causing their dysfunction. From a clinical point of view, the disease can be classified in infantile-onset (IO) and late-onset (LO) forms. The common GAA c.-32-13T>G variant, found in 40-70% of LO-PD alleles, is a leaky splicing mutation interfering with the correct GAA exon 2 recognition by the spliceosome leading to the production of non-functional GAA transcripts. In this study, we used modified, GAA-tailored U1 snRNAs to correct the aberrant splicing determined by the c.-32-13T>G and other GAA exon 2-skipping mutations. A set of constructs expressing 5 different engineered U1 snRNAs was generated. A functional splicing assay using a GAA hybrid minigene carrying different variants known to affect GAA exon 2 splicing was used to test the effect of engineered U1 snRNAs on exon 2 inclusion. The effect on endogenously expressed GAA transcript and GAA enzymatic activity was assessed by transfecting patient-derived fibroblasts bearing the common c.-32-13T>G with the best performing modified U1 snRNA. Modified U1-3, U1+1 and U1+6 snRNAs were all able to increase, in a dose-dependent manner, the inclusion of exon 2 within the transcript derived from the GAA minigene harbouring the c.-32-13T>G variant. The U1+1 was the most effective one (2,5 fold increase). Moreover, U1+1 snRNA partially rescued the correct splicing of GAA minigenes harbouring mutations that affect the 3'ss (c.-32-3C>G, c.-32-2A>G) and the 5'ss (c.546G>A, c.546G>C, c.546G>T). Notably, the treatment of patient-derived fibroblasts carrying the c.-32-13T>G mutation with the U1+1 snRNA increased the amount of normal GAA mRNA by 1,8 fold and the GAA enzymatic activity by 70%. we provide the proof-of-concept for the use of modified GAA-tailored U1 snRNAs, designed to potentiate the recognition of the GAA exon 2 5'ss, as therapeutic tools to correct the aberrant transcripts carrying variants that affect exon 2 splicing, including the common c.-32-13T>G variant."

Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of PSMA PET/CT for overall and size-dependent LNI detection in contemporary patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). Within a high-volume center database, we identified 873 patients who underwent PSMA PET/CT for primary staging before RP and PLND between 2016 and 2021. Data for lymph node status on imaging and histology results were analyzed. Of 873 patients, 25% (n = 220) had LNI. Median prostate-specific antigen was 8.3 ng/ml (interquartile range 4.3-14.3). The majority of patients had high-risk (53%) or intermediate-risk disease (45%). In the overall cohort, the per-patient sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy calculated for LNI detection via PSMA PET/CT were 45.5%, 92.6%, 67.6%, 83.4%, and 80.8%, respectively. The median metastatic LN size in the group of 120 patients with false-negative PET/CT results was 2.5 mm. For metastatic LNs ≥5 mm, the sensitivity and NPV increased to 68.8% (+23.3%) and 95.4% (+12.0%), respectively. The main limitation is the lack of central review of PSMA PET/CT scans. PSMA PET/CT is accurate in the staging of pelvic LNs before RP, especially for detection of metastases in LNs with a diameter ≥5 mm."

Nineteen new EQ-5D-5L bolt-ons were developed based on literature review, expert input, and qualitative interviews and focus groups with patients, caregivers, and representatives of patient associations. A nationwide, cross-sectional, web-based survey in China included patients or caregivers of patients with 31 RDs in China (n = 9190). In each RDs, participants completed the EQ-5D-5L and 3 of 20 (1 existing and 19 newly developed) bolt-ons. Ceiling, explanatory power, convergent, divergent, and known-group validity were examined. Among the bolt-ons, itching had the lowest ceiling (6.5%), whereas social relationships had the highest (42.2%). The absolute reduction in the ceiling of the EQ-5D-5L with the addition of any bolt-ons was limited, ranging from 0 (respiratory problems) to 8.3% points (isolation). Dignity and vitality resulted in the largest increase in explained variance in EQ VAS. The isolation, fertility, and visual acuity bolt-ons showed good divergent validity from the EQ-5D-5L items. There was strong convergent validity between SF-12 and conceptually related bolt-ons (eg, physical health composite and muscle problems bolt-on). Various bolt-ons improved the known-groups validity in specific patient groups, eg, Huntington's disease (oral expressions), scleroderma (dexterity), myasthenia gravis (muscle problems), neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis (fatigue), Marfan syndrome (self-image), and Pompe disease (safety). The EQ-5D-5L shows sufficient validity in most RDs, but incorporating relevant, specific bolt-ons could enhance its ability to more comprehensively assess health-related quality of life in these patients."

The vast heterogeneity in clinical manifestations and disease progression is not fully explained; however, a short disease duration and a young age seem to be good predictors of a better response to treatment. For this purpose, we investigated and followed up a cohort of 13 juvenile patients with LOPD from the clinical and therapeutic point of view, mainly pointing out the transition from presymptomatic to symptomatic status. We retrospectively collected clinical, morphological, biochemical and molecular data from 13 juvenile LOPD patients. Motor and respiratory functional data, obtained during annual follow-up visits, were analyzed. The data included serial evaluations of the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, the 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT), the Gait, Stairs, Gower, and Chair (GSGC) score, and seated and supine Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). Muscle Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was also included, although it was not performed in all cases. Currently, patients mean age is 18 years. All patients but one were diagnosed because of an isolated hyperCKemia: the mean age at diagnosis was 6.8 years (range 1-18). The onset of symptoms occurred from 6 months to 12 years after the diagnosis. The mean clinical follow-up duration was 9 years (range 2-18). From the genetic point of view, the most shared mutation was c.32-13T>G, found in twelve patients as compound heterozygosis. Seven patients underwent muscle biopsy, which showed vacuolar myopathy with glycogen accumulation in four of them with unspecific changes in the other three cases. Five patients developed proximal muscle weakness during the follow-up with a mild waddling gait and a positive Gowers manoeuver. Muscle MRI revealed mild hypotrophy of the thighs at the development of symptoms in four out of five cases. Four patients started alglucosidase alfa, and one avalglucosidase alfa. These five patients on Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) showed motor and respiratory stability in the following years. Timely identification of emerging clinical manifestations in presymptomatic LOPD patients, as a result of careful follow-up, is essential to start prompt treatment to modify the disease natural course."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a neuromuscular disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (<i>GAA</i>), which leads to lysosomal glycogen accumulation and progressive development of muscle weakness. Two distinct isoforms have been identified. In the infantile form, the weakness is often severe and leads to motor difficulties from the first few months of life. In adult patients, the progression is slower but can still lead to significant loss of mobility. The current inherent difficulties of the disease lie in both early diagnosis and the use of biomarkers. Given that this is a multifactorial disease, a number of components may exert an influence on the disease process; from the degree of pre-ERT (enzyme replacement therapy) muscle damage to the damaged autophagic system and the different pathways involved. What methodology should be employed to study the complex characteristics of Pompe disease? Our approach relies on the application of genetic and epigenetic knowledge, with a progression from proteomics to transcriptomics. It is also becoming increasingly evident that artificial intelligence is a significant area of interest. The objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive review of the existing literature on the known data and complications associated with the disease in patients with disorders attributed to Pompe disease."

An increase in gut permeability, frequently caused by dysbiosis, allows bacterial endotoxins to enter the bloodstream, activating inflammatory pathways that exacerbate cardiac dysfunction. Recent reports highlight the potential role of microbiome in amyloidogenesis, as certain bacteria produce proteins that accelerate the formation of amyloid fibrils. Concurrently, advancements in amyloidosis treatments have sparked renewed hopes, marking a promising era for managing these kinds of diseases. These findings suggest that the gut-heart axis may be a potential factor in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease like RCM, opening new paths for therapeutic intervention. The aim of this review is to provide a detailed overview of the gut-heart axis, focusing on RCM."

    "title": "Clinical manifestations in Egyptian Pompe disease patients: Molecular variability and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) outcomes.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. This condition leads to muscle weakness, respiratory problems, and heart abnormalities in affected individuals. The aim of the study is to share our experience through cross sectional study of patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) with different genetic variations, resulting in diverse clinical presentations. We evaluated their phenotype, genotype, radiological and laboratory findings including their cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status. Infantile Pompe disease was diagnosed by measurement of the activity of the enzyme alpha-glucosidase. The diagnosis was confirmed by molecular genetic testing using PCR amplification and sequencing of the acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) gene. Routine two-D echocardiography, and multi-parametric ECG-gated cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) were done to patients six months after starting enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). The results of our study revealed different genetic mutations among our patients, different CRIM status and also CMR abnormalities. CMR imaging revealed abnormalities in all cases that underwent the procedure, including myocardial and vascular changes, with feature tracking indicating issues across all parameters and LGE suggesting fibrosis. The patient with a positive immune response had the most severe cardiac abnormalities, despite improvements in muscle weakness and motor skills from ERT. This underscores that delayed diagnosis and ERT can lead to irreversible heart damage from autophagy buildup. Pompe disease has various clinical presentations and results in significant CMR findings, which can be attributed to different genetic mutations. Early initiation of enzyme replacement therapy in infantile-onset Pompe disease is important to maximize its benefits."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a tissue glycogen disorder caused by genetic insufficiency of the GAA enzyme. GAA enzyme replacement therapies for Pompe disease have been limited by poor lysosomal trafficking of the recombinant GAA molecule through the native mannose-6-phosphate-mediated pathway. Here, we describe the successful rational engineering of a chimeric GAA enzyme that utilizes the binding affinity of a modified IGF-II moiety to its native receptor to bypass the mannose-6-phosphate-mediated lysosomal trafficking pathway, conferring a significant increase in cellular uptake of the GAA enzyme. We also demonstrate the ablation of binding between our modified IGF-II tag and two off-target receptors: IGF-I receptor and insulin receptor, as well as preserved enzymatic activity of the chimeric GAA molecule."

    "abstract": "Newborn screening (NBS) presents an opportunity to identify a subset of babies at birth who are at risk for developmental delays and could benefit from a range of developmental services. Potential developmental services in the United States include Part C Early Intervention (EI), private therapies, and school-based services. Using parent-reported outcomes, this study examined the rates at which a sample of children diagnosed with NBS conditions used each developmental service. An online survey of 153 parents representing children with 27 different NBS conditions found that nearly 75% of children (<i>n</i> = 112) used at least one developmental service, with private therapies being the most frequent. Children were referred to EI relatively early and were often eligible because their medical diagnosis automatically qualified them. When examining condition-specific results for children with severe combined immunodeficiencies, congenital hypothyroidism, and Pompe disease, we found variability in rates of use, with high rates overall. Our findings suggest that many children diagnosed with an NBS condition continue to have developmental delays even after they receive appropriate medical care. Future research with more systematic follow-up is needed to understand whether the NBS program facilitates entry into these services and whether more streamlined processes could benefit children and families."

    "abstract": "The efficacy and safety of avalglucosidase alfa for Pompe disease (PD) have been demonstrated in a global Phase 3 trial (COMET) in patients with late-onset PD (LOPD) and a global Phase 2 trial (Mini-COMET) in patients with infantile-onset PD (IOPD). This case series examines the individual results of three Japanese patients enrolled in these trials. Case reports were assembled from data collected in the COMET and Mini-COMET trials. Detailed methods have been reported previously. The primary endpoint of COMET was change from baseline to week 49 in upright forced vital capacity percent (FVC %) predicted. The primary endpoint of Mini-COMET was safety and tolerability of avalglucosidase alfa. In both trials, key secondary endpoints included motor function tests and other qualitative measures of improvement. Changes in biomarkers and anti-drug antibodies were also assessed in both trials. Results for Japanese patients were representative of those from the overall populations in the COMET and Mini-COMET trials. We detail results for one Japanese patient with LOPD enrolled in the COMET trial and two Japanese patients with IOPD enrolled in the Mini-COMET trial. Importantly, avalglucosidase alfa was well tolerated at doses of both 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg in Japanese patients with LOPD and IOPD, respectively. Although the number of patients was small, avalglucosidase alfa provides an efficacy and safety profile in Japanese patients representative of the overall populations from key global clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Alglucosidase alfa for injection is used as an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of Pompe disease. The safety profile of alglucosidase alfa-associated adverse events requires a comprehensive evaluation. In this study, we aimed to identify drug safety alert signals and investigate the real-world safety of alglucosidase alfa to guide clinical decision making and optimize the risk-benefit balance. The adverse event reports from the first quarter of 2006 to the fourth quarter of 2023 were selected by exploring the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. The new and unexpected potential adverse event signals were detected using a disproportionality analysis, including the reporting odds ratio, the proportional reporting ratio, the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Then, the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities was used to systematically classify the results. After analyzing 16,945,027 adverse event reports, a total of 4326 cases of adverse events related to alglucosidase alfa were identified, spanning 27 system organ classes. A total of 359 preferred terms of adverse events for glucosidase alpha were detected. Pyrexia ranked first, followed by pneumonia, dyspnea, respiratory failure, and disease progression according to occurrence frequency. The top three system organ classes were general disorders and administration-site conditions (n = 2466), respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (n = 1749), and infections and infestations (n = 1551). In addition to adverse effects mentioned in the product label, our study also discovered rare but high signal intensity adverse events such as chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis. There are many adverse events associated with the clinical use of alglucosidase alfa, which should be closely monitored in the FAERS database. As the most effective enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe disease, it is crucial to closely monitor these adverse events. Ensuring patient safety while balancing drug effectiveness is particularly important."

    "abstract": "Nemaline myopathy (NM), also known as Nemalinosis, is a rare congenital muscle disease with an incidence of 1 in 50000. It is characterized by nemaline rods in muscle fibers, leading to muscle weakness. We reported a case of NM revealed by cardiac involvement, and we highlighted the challenges in diagnosing this condition as well as its poor prognosis. The patient is a 7.5-month-old infant from a consanguineous marriage, with a history of bronchiolitis and psychomotor retardation. The infant was admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit due to respiratory distress, which necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation. A chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and bilateral bronchial syndrome, while an electrocardiogram showed left ventricle hypertrophy. Emergency echocardiography revealed biventricular hypertrophy. Laboratory tests indicated significant rhabdomyolysis, hepatic cytolysis, microcytic hypochromic anemia, negative troponins, and respiratory acidosis. The enzymatic activity of acid alpha-glucosidase was inconclusive. Genetic analysis for mutations in exon 2 associated with Pompe disease and congenital muscular dystrophy, the most common differential diagnoses, returned negative results. Given the presence of rhabdomyolysis, the emergence of tongue fasciculations, and pronounced axial and peripheral hypotonia, a muscle biopsy was performed. This revealed the presence of nemaline rods, confirming the diagnosis of NM. The patient's condition deteriorated, marked by extubating failure due to severe muscle weakness. The infant passed away after 50 days of hospitalization. This case underscores the severity and complexity of NM revealed by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and prenatal genetic counseling."

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that results in severe progressive proximal muscle weakness. Over time, reductions in muscle strength result in respiratory failure and a loss of ambulation. Delayed diagnosis of LOPD deprives patients of treatments that can enhance quality of life and potentially slow disease progression. The objective of this study is to determine if patients with a nonspecific diagnosis, such as muscle weakness, may be at risk for LOPD using retrospective chart review of patients seen at two centers: an academic center and a community health system. Initial data pulls identified 80,070 patients with one of the ICD-10 codes of interest. Chart review found 551 of these patients also had at least one lab value commonly abnormal in individuals with LOPD and of these 110 scored as \"at-risk\". After removing phenocopies/other confirmed unrelated diagnoses, 46 individuals were contacted either directly or through their healthcare provider for genetic counseling. Three patients had pretest genetic counseling and were tested for decreased levels of acid-α-glucosidase. One patient was found to have deficient acid-α-glucosidase. Additionally, a physician educated through the program ordered LOPD testing for their patient and diagnosed them with LOPD. This study confirms that a symptom-based scoring tool and chart review combined with provider education can identify patients who are at increased likelihood to have a missed LOPD diagnosis."

    "abstract": "The current standard of care for infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD), a severe form of acid α-glucosidase enzyme activity deficiency is: (1) detection by newborn screening, (2) early initiation of intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA), with higher doses of rhGAA increasingly used to improve clinical outcomes, and (3) immune tolerization induction (ITI) using to prevent anti-rhGAA antibody formation, with methotrexate (MTX), rituximab, and IVIG used for patients who are cross-reactive immunologic material negative (CRIM-) and monotherapy with MTX used in patients who are cross-reactive immunologic material positive (CRIM+). A pilot study evaluates a dose-intensive therapy (DIT) using high-dose ERT (40 mg/kg/week) and more frequent exposure to ERT (i.e., 3 times weekly administration) to mitigate anti-rhGAA antibody formation, as an alternative to the standard therapeutic approach for IOPD. In the first patient, DIT resulted in rapid normalization of the following: (1) bi-ventricular hypertrophy, (2) urine HEX-4, (3) CK, (4) liver transaminases. At 7 years of age, the patient continues the DIT regimen. To date, all pediatric developmental milestones have been met on time, anti-rhGAA antibodies have been negative and the patient is able to attend school and maintain normal activities of daily living. Over a 7-year period, DIT for CRIM-positive IOPD was well tolerated in the first patient treated. Excellent clinical outcomes were achieved, and anti-rhGAA antibodies levels were consistently undetectable. Assessments of more patients, that includes patients with CRIM-, as well as CRIM+ IOPD, will determine if this approach consistently achieves improved clinical outcomes and immune tolerization."

The aim of NBS is to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions in newborns as early as possible, before the onset of disease symptoms. Early diagnosis enables timely treatments and improves the quality of life for affected patients. A pilot project for dried blood spot (DBS) NBS of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), including Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPSI, IDUA α-L-iduronidase deficiency), Pompe disease (GAA α-glucosidase acid deficiency), Gaucher disease (GBA β-glucosidase deficiency) and Fabry disease (GLA α-galactosidase deficiency), was conducted using the digital microfluidic (DMF) technique. DBS were analyzed in a multiplexed assays for the enzymatic activities of four lysosomal enzymes (IDUA, GAA, GBA, GLA), and subjects identified as deficient in any of these enzymes were referred to the clinical reference center for diagnosis confirmation. From June 6th, 2022, to May 12th, 2023, a total of 7650 newborns were analyzed and 1 subject affected by Pompe disease was identified together with two additional subjects, suspected of Pompe and Fabry disease respectively, for whom continued follow-up is mandatory to determine the phenotype. The pilot project for DBS NBS of four LSDs in Campania Region validated the effectiveness of DMF method, established enzymatic activity cut-offs, and identified newborns referred to the clinical center for integrated diagnostics, including genetic analyses. The results suggest that this technique can effectively detect potentially affected newborns, who will require further diagnostic confirmation and clinical follow-up. This diagnostic flow chart provides the opportunity to initiate early treatments and improve LSD patients' life span."

This study aimed to investigate the demographic and clinical data of children with CoN and idiopathic neutropenia (IN) in Morocco. We performed a retrospective study of patients with CoN and analyzed the clinical and laboratory findings of patients with CoN and IN diagnosed between 1999 and 2018 in a clinical immunology unit of a large pediatric hospital. We identified 88 patients, 51 with IN and 37 with CoN. Fifty-seven percent were males, and 43% were females, ranging from 1 month to 19 years. The median age at onset was 8 months, and the median at diagnosis was 36 months. Consanguinity was observed in 57% of the cases, and a history of recurrent infections in the siblings was found in 27.3%. The most common infectious complications were ear, nose, and throat (ENT) infections, skin and soft tissue infections, and lung infections. Patients with CoN were classified into seven syndromes: 9 with severe congenital neutropenia, 11 with cyclic neutropenia, 6 with glycogen storage disease type 1b, 5 with poikiloderma with neutropenia, 3 with Griscelli syndrome, 2 with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type II, and 1 with Cohen syndrome. This study provides a comprehensive overview of CoN and IN in a pediatric cohort from Morocco, representing the country's most considerable single-center investigation of these conditions. Our findings highlight the significant burden of CoN, accounting for 5% of IEI in the Moroccan registry, a proportion higher than in some neighboring countries. The study emphasizes the early onset and severity of bacterial infections in CoN patients, underlining the critical need for timely and accurate diagnosis."

The primary endpoint was change in 6-min walk distance (6MWD) from baseline to week 52. During PROPEL, COVID-19 interrupted some planned study visits and assessment windows, leading to delayed visits, make-up assessments for patients who missed ≥ 3 successive infusions before planned assessments at weeks 38 and 52, and some advanced visits (end-of-study/early-termination visits). These were remapped to the respective planned visits. To evaluate if remapping may have overestimated treatment effects, we conducted post hoc analyses using a mixed-effect model for repeated measures based on actual time points of assessments. In this post hoc analysis, estimated mean treatment difference between cipa + mig and alg + pbo for change from baseline to week 52 in 6MWD was 11.7 m (95% confidence interval [CI] - 1.0 to 24.4; p = 0.072). In the original published analyses, between-group difference using last observation carried forward was 13.6 m (95% CI - 2.8 to 29.9; p = 0.071 [p value from separate non-parametric analysis of covariance]).

    "abstract": "As the management of Pompe disease depends on whether an individual has infantile onset Pompe disease (IOPD) or late onset Pompe disease (LOPD), the question of whether the phenotype can be predicted from specific pathogenic variants is becoming increasingly important. We reviewed published cases of Pompe disease in which IOPD versus LOPD and pathogenic GAA variants were assigned for specific individuals. We then compared variant types and locations versus phenotypes. We identified 115 cases, 42 with IOPD and 73 with LOPD. We found that two features of GAA variants can help predict phenotype: (1) presence of a splice variant on at least one allele and (2) location in specific protein domains. These findings help provide prognoses for newborns diagnosed with Pompe disease. Our analysis will also help expecting and prospective parents who pursue genetic testing as they consider therapeutic options that may be beneficial to implement soon after birth."

We report a three-month-old Moroccan female patient presenting with doll-like facies, hepatomegaly, dysmorphic features, and developmental delays.

Genetic testing confirmed a homozygous pathogenic variant in SLC37A4 and a heterozygous variant of uncertain significance in TBX1. Initial management included a lactose-free and galactose-free diet, multivitamin supplementation, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy to address neutropenia. A novel aspect of this case involves hypercalcemia as an unusual finding in GSD-Ib and the co-occurrence of a variant in the TBX1 gene, which is not typically associated with the disease but may contribute to the patient's clinical presentation. These findings add a new dimension to our understanding of GSD-Ib and suggest potential avenues for future research to elucidate these genetic interactions and their impact on clinical outcomes."

People with LOPD report a significantly lower physical, psychological, and social quality of life (QoL) than the general population. <b>Objectives:</b> This study investigated how individuals' self-reported LOPD status (improving, stable, declining) relates to their QoL. Participant experiences such as use of mobility or ventilation aids, caregivers, symptomology, and daily life impacts were also characterized. <b>Methods:</b> A 2-part observational study was conducted online between October and December 2023 using the 36-item short-form tool (SF-36) and a survey. Adults with LOPD (N=41) from Australia, France, Italy, and the Netherlands were recruited. <b>Results:</b> Participants reporting \"declining\" LOPD status (56%) had lower physical functioning SF-36 scores than those reporting as \"stable\" or \"improving.\" Those self-reporting as stable or improving often described an acceptance of declining health in their responses. Physical functioning scores were generally stable in respondents who had been receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for 1-15 years, but those who had received ERT for >15 years had lower scores. Requiring ventilation and mobility aids had additive negative impacts on physical functioning. Difficulty swallowing, speaking, and scoliosis were the most burdensome symptoms reported by those on ERT for >15-25 years. <b>Discussion:</b> These results demonstrate the humanistic burden of LOPD; through declining physical functioning SF-36 scores over increasing time and increased use of aids, and also through factors related to self-reported LOPD status (where declining status was associated with lower scores) and symptomology variances. Taken holistically, these areas are valuable to explore when informing optimized care. Among a largely declining cohort, even those not self-reporting decline often assumed future deterioration, highlighting the need for improved therapies and the potential to initiate or switch ERT based on evolving symptomology and daily life impacts. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results indicate that progressing LOPD leads to loss of QoL in ways that relate to time, use of aids, evolving symptomology, and the patient's own perspective. A holistic approach to assessing the individual can help ensure relevant factors are investigated and held in balance, supporting optimized care."

Over the past few years, new disease-modifying therapies have been developed and made available for treating different neuromuscular disorders. Some of these therapies have remarkable effectiveness, resulting in the prevention and reduction of respiratory complications. For myasthenia gravis (MG), efgartigimod, ravulizumab, rozanolixizumab, and zilucoplan have been Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive generalized MG in the past 2 years. Rozanolixiumab is also approved for treating MG caused by muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies. The new MG therapeutics target the complement system or block the neonatal fragment crystallizable (Fc) receptors (FcRn), leading to significant clinical improvement. For spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), nusinersen (intrathecal route) and risdiplam (oral route) modify the splicing of the <i>SMN2</i> gene, increasing the production of normal survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Onasemnogene abeparvovec is a gene replacement therapy that encodes a functional SMN protein. All SMA medications, particularly onasemnogene abeparvovec, have led to clinically meaningful improvement. For late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), avalglucosidase alfa has shown a greater improvement in respiratory function, ambulation, and functional outcomes in comparison to alglucosidase alfa, and cipaglucosidase alfa combined with miglustat has shown improvement in respiratory and motor function in a cohort of enzyme replacement therapy-experienced LOPD patients. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a challenge. The two most recent FDA-approved medications, namely sodium phenylbutyrate and tofersen, may slow down the disease by a few months in a selected population but do not stop the progression of the disease."

    "abstract": "For years, the treatment of many cardiomyopathies has been solely focused on symptom management. However, cardiomyopathies have a genetic substrate, and directing therapy towards the pathophysiology rather than the epiphenomenon of the disease may be a winning strategy. Gene therapy involves the insertion of genes or the modification of existing ones and their regulatory elements through strategies like gene replacement and gene editing. Recently, gene therapy for cardiac amyloidosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy has received approval, and important clinical trials are currently evaluating gene therapy methods for rare heart diseases like Friedreich's Ataxia, Danon disease, Fabry disease, and Pompe Disease. Furthermore, favorable results have been noted in animal studies receiving gene therapy for hypertrophic, dilated, and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. This review discusses gene therapy methods, ongoing clinical trials, and future goals in this area."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) can be treated with intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). ERT is being administered either in specialized clinics or in the home care setting. Studies indicate that home-based ERT can be considered safe and positively effects patient reported outcomes. Due to the higher level of individual care required by nurses when administering ERT at home, questions arise whether this will result in additional costs for health care systems. Since cost data to the German health care system are currently unavailable, this study aims to assess home care ERT costs of LSD patients. The longitudinal study assessed the direct costs of home-based ERT for patients with LSD diseases Fabry, Pompe, Gaucher, and MPS I from 2019 to 2021 on a patient-by-patient basis by evaluating the healthcare documentation. Costs assessed included ERT drug and further administration equipment, time needed to prepare, administer, and post-process the infusion, and travel expenses of nursing staff. Data from 62 patients was analyzed: of these, 29 (46.8%) with Fabry disease, 19 (30.6%) with Pompe disease, 10 (16.1%) with Gaucher disease, and 4 (6.5%) with MPS I. Patients ranged in age from 3 to 79 (mean 40 years); 42% of patients reported comorbidities (19.4% with hypertension, and 10% with heart disease). Mean total ERT-related costs were €369,047 per year across all patients. Approximately 98.5% of these costs were attributable to the infusion therapy and administration itself (€363,880), and approximately 1.5% were attributable to personnel and travel costs. Patients with Pompe disease incurred the highest average annual costs (€483,907) and patients with Fabry disease the lowest (€264,896). Cost differences among underlying LSDs were due primarily to ERT drug costs; the drug infused for Fabry disease costs about half as much as that for Gaucher or for Pompe disease. Despite MPS I patients requiring about twice as many infusions, significantly lower drug costs for this disease resulted in the second lowest total mean costs of all LSD subtypes analyzed. As total costs are almost entirely driven by infusion-related material, especially the ERT drug, moving ERT into the home environment is not expected to increase costs."

    "title": "Detection of gene variants associated with recessive limb-girdle muscular weakness and Pompe disease in a global cohort of patients through the application of next-generation sequencing analysis.",
    "abstract": "Hereditary myopathies arise due to numerous pathogenic variants occurring in distinct genes, which amount to several hundred. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) constitute a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders involving more than 30 genes. Clinically, LGMD is characterized by limb-girdle muscular weakness (LGMW). Late-onset Pompe disease is an important disorder with a differential diagnosis for LGMD, where next-generation sequencing (NGS) plays a crucial role in accurate and prompt diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity of a 10-gene NGS panel have been previously evaluated for the prevalent forms of recessive LGMD (LGMD-R) and Pompe disease in Latin American patients with LGMW of unknown cause. This project aims to identify the regional relative prevalence of frequent LGMD-R subtypes and Pompe disease in a larger geographic area and to diagnose patients with LGMW by identifying genetic variants of LGMD-R and Pompe disease. This 21-country multicentric analysis enrolled 2,372 patients with LGMW from 2017 to 2018. Sequencing analysis was performed using the Illumina NextSeq 500 system, and variant interpretation was performed according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were seen in 11% of patients (n = 261). Among the positive cases, NGS effectively diagnosed 86.2% and 13.8% of patients with LGMD and Pompe disease, respectively. The most prevalent pathogenic acid α-glucosidase (<i>GAA)</i> variant identified was c.-32-13T > G. The study adds to the knowledge of the relative occurrence of various subtypes of LGMD worldwide. The inclusion of <i>GAA</i> in the NGS panel to investigate patients with LGMW is a powerful diagnostic approach to screen for late-onset Pompe disease."

    "title": "Navigating Pompe Disease Assessment: A Comprehensive Scoping Review.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a rare progressive autosomal recessive disorder resulting from the deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme activity. Due to its multisystemic involvement, PD leads to significant morbidity and impacts patients' quality of life. Despite the availability of approved disease-modifying treatments, the prompt diagnosis and management of PD, which are crucial for patient outcomes, still present several challenges. This scoping review aimed to synthesize the evidence regarding methods for screening, diagnosing, and following up PD. We searched articles in English and Spanish published from 2017 to February 8, 2022, across 11 databases (i.e., Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Epistemonikos, Ingenta Connect, Medline/PubMed, SAGE, SciELO Citation Index, ScienceDirect, Springer Link, Virtual Health Library, and Wiley Online Library). We included primary studies (i.e., case reports, case series, cross-sectional studies, case controls, cohorts, clinical trials, and qualitative studies), reviews, and guidelines that described at least one assessment method for patients with confirmed clinical, genetic, or biochemical PD. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted data from articles, with a third reviewer solving conflicts. We synthesized data with narrative summaries and descriptive statistics. After screening 2,139 titles and abstracts, we included 96 eligible articles. Cross-sectional studies (n = 30) and guidelines (n = 1) were the most and least prevalent designs, respectively. Most studies targeted late-onset PD (LOPD, n = 48) and infantile-onset PD (IOPD, n = 21). Eleven articles described newborn screening programs, highlighting their potential to improve PD prevalence estimations and still limited availability among countries. Overall, 81 articles documented clinical manifestations of PD. Hypotonia (n = 7) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 7) were the most documented for IOPD, while progressive muscle weakness (n = 21) and dyspnea (n = 11) were the most prevalent for LOPD. We found 26 articles reporting biochemical assays, with dried blood spots (DBS) for GAA enzyme deficiency detection being the most cited (n = 19). We also noted a lack of standardization in documenting DBS results. Additionally, 21 articles mentioned genetic studies, with next-generation sequencing emerging as the gold standard for identifying mutated alleles. Functional studies were the most utilized to follow up with patients. However, monitoring strategies for pediatric and adult PD lacked consensus, and only one article assessed patients' quality of life. This review comprehensively evaluated the literature on PD screening, diagnosis, and follow-up methods, identifying prevalent techniques within each assessment category. We emphasized the need for a more standardized approach to reporting biochemical assays, genetic testing, and clinical presentations. Our review also underscored the critical lack of standardization in PD follow-up. Addressing these gaps will enhance the comparability of future research findings and improve the quality of PD-related healthcare. Limitations of this review included restricting eligible languages and publication years to the latest five, the methodological heterogeneity of selected articles, and the lack of individual study bias assessment."

    "title": "Clinical modeling of motor function to predict treatment efficacy and enable in silico treatment comparisons in infantile-onset Pompe disease.",
    "abstract": "Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is a rare, deadly, quickly-progressing degenerative disease. Even with life-sustaining treatment (e.g., alglucosidase alfa [ALGLU]), many patients experience continued motor impairment. The Mini-COMET trial evaluated avalglucosidase alfa (AVAL) versus ALGLU on motor and other outcomes in IOPD. However, treatment groups were imbalanced at baseline and the trial was not powered to directly compare treatments. To supplement this limited data, we developed a modeling and simulation approach to compare AVAL versus ALGLU head-to-head in in silico (i.e., computer-simulated) trials. We first developed a longitudinal clinical model to establish the relationship between changes in motor function and changes in urinary hexose tetrasaccharide (uHex4), an established biomarker in IOPD. This model was based on pooled data from Mini-COMET (n = 21) and COMET trials (n = 100 patients with late-onset Pompe disease, LOPD). We then conducted in silico trials mimicking Mini-COMET. Simulated trials were informed by motor data generated from the clinical model and uHex4 profiles simulated in a quantitative systems pharmacology model. The virtual IOPD population was based on observed Mini-COMET baseline characteristics but engineered to have well-balanced baseline characteristics across treatment cohorts. In silico trials showed that patients with IOPD would have the greatest improvements in motor function with AVAL 40 mg/kg every other week (Q2W), suboptimal improvement with ALGLU 40 mg/kg Q2W, and no improvement with ALGLU 20 mg/kg Q2W. This study provides information on the relative efficacy of IOPD treatments and mitigates the confounding effects of imbalanced treatment cohorts. Our approach could also be applied in other rare diseases."

    "abstract": "α-Glycosidases are carbohydrate-digesting enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of α-1,4-glycopyranoside bonds from oligosaccharides and disaccharides. α-Glucosidase is an important biomarker for the diagnosis of type-II diabetes, Azoospermia and Pompe diseases. Additionally, the mutations in α-galactosidase lead to Fabry disease. Inhibitors targeting these enzymes are prescribed as anti-diabetic medications and as effective chaperones for Fabry disease. Comprehending the function - regulation of α-glycosidases requires accurate quantification methods. In this work, we highlight the design of a simple luminescent 'turn-on' assay for sensing these two α-glycosidases in a supramolecular TbCh hydrogel matrix using 1-α-glycosides as pro-sensitizers. The protocol offers a cost-effective method for selectively sensing α-glycosidases in the detection limit of the subnanomolar range. Importantly, the developed enzyme sensors functioned as a platform for rapid screening of drug molecules based on their inhibition potency. Therefore, the protocol is useful for facilitating the advancement of therapeutics and diagnostics targeting this important class of enzymes."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disease caused by deficient lysosomal glycogen degradation, and includes both late-onset (LOPD) and severe infantile-onset (IOPD) phenotypes. Due to very small patient numbers in IOPD and the high phenotypic heterogeneity observed in this population, a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP)-based \"digital twin\" approach was developed to perform an in silico comparison of the efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa vs. the standard of care, in a virtual population of IOPD patients. A QSP model was developed that represents key elements of Pompe disease pathophysiology, including tissue glycogen accumulation and the elevation of the biomarker urine Hex4 in both LOPD and IOPD patients. In this approach, the QSP model was used to generate digital twins of each IOPD patient enrolled in the avalglucosidase alfa clinical program, considering their respective disease burden, demographics, and treatment history. This virtual cohort supplemented clinical observations by simulating and comparing tissue glycogen and urine Hex4 following avalglucosidase alfa treatment vs. the standard of care. The digital twin analysis supports the interpretation that the enhanced reduction in urine Hex4 observed following avalglucosidase alfa treatment is attributable to greater tissue glycogen clearance. Overall, this study provides mechanism-based insight into avalglucosidase alfa efficacy across the phenotypic spectrum of Pompe disease and demonstrates the value of applying a QSP-based digital twin analysis to support rare disease drug development."

    "abstract": "Genetic neuromuscular disorders affect muscle function and control by the nervous system, presenting significant clinical challenges, particularly during pregnancy. To systematically review the literature on the obstetric outcomes and complications in women with genetic neuromuscular disorders. We searched PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and CINAHL Ultimate from inception till June 2024 using terms like \"pregnancy\", \"genetic neuromuscular disorder\", \"myotonic dystrophy\", \"maternal health\" etc. SELECTION CRITERIA: Pregnant women with genetic neuromuscular disorders. Screening, selection, and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers. A total of 28 studies from 1978 to 2023 examined pregnancy outcomes in women with genetic neuromuscular disorders. The disorders included myotonic dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), and others. Common complications were polyhydramnios, preterm labor, miscarriages, and cesarean sections. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) showed higher neonatal risks than type 2 (DM2). Women with SMA faced exacerbated muscle weakness, while CMT and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy were associated with preterm labor and cesarean deliveries. Pompe disease exacerbated symptoms, and GNE myopathy showed similar pregnancy outcomes to the general population. Non-dystrophic myotonias had higher fetal distress and postpartum complications. Women with genetic neuromuscular disorders face increased pregnancy complications, including preterm labor, cesarean sections, and disease symptom exacerbation. Multidisciplinary care between neurologists and obstetricians is essential in managing these high-risk pregnancies effectively, ensuring better maternal and neonatal outcomes. Further research is needed to develop standardized care protocols and improve clinical management."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is caused by acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency, resulting in lysosomal glycogen accumulation. This disease is characterized by progressive skeletal muscle weakness, respiratory distress, and in the infantile-onset form, cardiomyopathy. The only approved treatment is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with human recombinant GAA. While ERT therapy extends life span, residual symptoms remain, with poor muscle uptake and immunogenicity limiting efficacy. We examined a novel Centyrin protein-short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) conjugate targeting CD71 (transferrin receptor type 1, TfR1) and GYS1, a key enzyme involved in glycogen synthesis. Unlike existing ERTs designed to degrade aberrant glycogen deposits observed in Pompe patients, the CD71 Centyrin:Gys1 siRNA is designed to restore glycogen balance by inhibiting glycogen synthesis. To this end, we administered the CD71 Centyrin:Gys1 siRNA conjugate to the 6<sup>neo</sup>/6<sup>neo</sup> Pompe mouse model. Once bound to TfR1, siRNA-conjugated Centyrin is internalized into cells to facilitate gene knockdown. We found that treatment with this conjugate significantly reduced GYS1 protein expression, glycogen synthase enzymatic activity, and glycogen levels in muscle. In addition, impaired treadmill exercise performance of male Pompe mice was improved. These data suggest that Centyrin-mediated delivery of Gys1 siRNA may be an effective next generation therapy for late-onset Pompe disease or, in combination with ERT, for infantile-onset Pompe disease."

Thirty-seven and eighteen survey participants had %FVC and 6MWT data available, respectively; of the patients whose overall improvement was rated as \"relatively improved,\" %FVC and 6MWT worsened in 71.4% and 66.7%, respectively. The %FVC at the survey registration estimated using a linear mixed model was significantly higher in the shorter group than in the longer group (P = 0.0413). The estimated slope of %FVC was significantly lower in the shorter group than in the longer group (P = 0.0051). These results suggest the importance of early treatment initiation and quantitative evaluation of each symptom."

During their respective trials, these participants received a total of 419 avalglucosidase alfa infusions at home under healthcare professional supervision. They were clinically stable with no history of moderate or severe infusion-associated reactions within at least 12 months prior to starting home infusions. As of February 25, 2022, the 15 participants with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) had received between 2 and 48 home infusions and the 2 participants with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) had received 19 and 20 infusions. Adverse events occurred in 8 (53 %) participants with LOPD and neither of the participants with IOPD. Seven participants with LOPD had a total of 15 non-treatment-related, non-serious adverse events. One participant with LOPD experienced infusion-associated reactions of eyelid edema and flushing during the first home infusion; both were non-serious adverse events classified as grade 1 (mild). Home infusion was later resumed for this participant. Among LOPD participants, event rates for home infusions were comparable to those for clinic infusions: overall adverse events (0.028 vs 0.039 participants with events/infusion, respectively) and adverse events classified as infusion-associated reactions (0.003 vs. 0.006, respectively). No medication errors occurred during home infusion. These data suggest that infusion of avalglucosidase alfa at home is feasible and does not compromise safety for patients who have not experienced an infusion-associated reaction during the preceding 12 months of infusions in a clinical setting. Evaluation of real-world experience with avalglucosidase alfa home infusion in countries where it is already approved is ongoing."

    "abstract": "Chaperone therapy is a new concept of molecular therapeutic approach to protein misfolding diseases, particularly to lysosomal diseases. Initially we started molecular analysis of culture cells, model animals and patients with Fabry disease and G<sub>M1</sub>-gangliosidosis. Some mutant enzyme proteins did not express the catalytic activity because of unstable molecular structure in somatic cells. The small molecule compound (chaperone) corrected misfolding of the unstable mutant protein, resulting in restoration of the enzyme activity (chaperone therapy). This pathological molecular event was studied first in endogenous mutant enzymes. Then a similar molecular interaction was found between the chaperone and the exogenous protein supplied for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in Pompe disease. This new chaperone-ERT combination therapy will become another useful technology in order to expand the application of chaperone therapy to a wide range of lysosomal diseases. Thus, chaperone therapy is expected in future for stabilization and enhancement of exogenously supplied ERT enzymes as well as endogenous mutant enzymes."

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), a rare autosomal recessive multisystemic disorder, substantially impacts patients' day-to-day activities, outcomes, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The PROPEL trial compared cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat (cipa+mig) with alglucosidase alfa plus placebo (alg+pbo) in adult patients with LOPD over 52 weeks and showed improved motor and respiratory function in patients switching treatment from standard-of-care enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to cipa+mig at baseline. This study evaluated the impact of cipa+mig on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including HRQoL in ERT-experienced patients, using data from PROPEL. PROs evaluated included the Subject's Global Impression of Change (SGIC), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function Short Form 20a, PROMIS Fatigue Short Form 8a, Rasch-built Pompe-specific Activity (R-PAct), and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions 5 Response Levels (EQ-5D-5L). The proportions of responders in the cipa+mig arm and the alg+pbo arm were compared via chi-squared or Fisher's exact test (patient-level responder analysis), and least squares (LS) mean differences were calculated for change from baseline at Week 52 of the PRO measures (group-level analysis). At Week 52, patient-level SGIC responder and group-level SGIC analyses favored cipa+mig compared with alg+pbo across all SGIC domains (e.g. 90 vs. 59% responders in the cipa+mig vs. the alg+pbo group for SGIC ability to move around; P = 0.0005; and LS mean difference 0.385; P = 0.02). Similarly, PROMIS Physical Function and Fatigue domains numerically favored cipa+mig in both analyses (e.g. 50 vs. 40% responders in the cipa+mig vs. alg+pbo arm for PROMIS Physical Function; P = 0.37; and LS mean difference 3.1; P = 0.11). R-PAct for both treatment groups was similar in the patient-level responder analysis, but numerically favored alg+pbo in the group-level analysis (35% responders in both arms; P = 0.95; and LS mean difference -0.8; P = 0.48). Self-care, usual activities, and depression/anxiety domains of EQ-5D-5L numerically favored cipa+mig in both analyses (e.g. 20 vs. 12% responders in the cipa+mig vs. alg+pbo arm for EQ-5D-5L self-care; P = 0.54; and LS mean difference -0.108; P = 0.52). Overall, switching treatment from alglucosidase alfa to cipa+mig positively impacted PRO measurements during the double-blind period of PROPEL.

Here, we use saturation transfer (ST) MRI via relayed nuclear Overhauser effects (glycoNOE) to detect abnormal changes in muscle glycogen of a GSD II mouse model. In addition to glycogen, the energy metabolites phosphocreatine (PCr) and creatine (Cr) were studied to assess the muscle disease. Water saturation (Z-spectra) and <sup>1</sup>H MRS were acquired at 9.4 T on the skeletal muscle of healthy control mice and homozygous acid <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <semantics><mrow><mi>α</mi></mrow> <annotation>$$ \\upalpha $$</annotation></semantics> </math> -glucosidase (GAA) knock-out mice (ages of 2-48 weeks). The glycoNOE (-1 ppm), total creatine (tCr)* (+2 ppm, = a × [Cr] + b × [PCr]), and PCr (+2.5 ppm) from Z-spectra and the ratio between tCr and taurine signals (tCr/Tau) from <sup>1</sup>H MRS spectra were quantified by using multi-pool Lorentzian fitting methods. The concentrations of the metabolites were also measured via tissue assays. The postnatal GSD II mice (age <12 weeks) showed a continued accumulation of muscle glycoNOE signal. GlycoNOE in adult GSD II mice (age ≥12 weeks) reached a plateau, at a level above 400% of that in normal mice. PCr, tCr*, and tCr/Tau gradually decreased in GSD II mice during the postnatal stage, then stabilized at levels comparable to adult control, yet PCr in adult GSD II mice was lower than that in controls. This study demonstrates that ST MRI of glycogen can provide in situ non-invasive biomarkers for GSD II disease progression, with the potential to study the progression and treatment response of GSDs."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease, a severe lysosomal storage disorder, is marked by heart problems, muscle weakness, and respiratory difficulties. This study aimed to identify novel markers for infantile-onset Pompe disease by analyzing key genes and immune cells infiltrating affected skeletal muscles, building on existing research linking its progression to the immune cell infiltration. The datasets GSE38680 and GSE159062 were downloaded and differential expression genes (DEGs) were identified. Potential markers were screened using support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression models. To analyze DEGs and immune processes, 22 immune cell types in affected tissues were examined using CIBERSORT. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment in the calcium signaling pathway, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Machine learning identified GPNMB, CALML6 and TRIM7 as key genes. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that the expression levels of the above three genes were closely related to immune cells in our target population under study, including T cells regulatory (Tregs), monocytes, macrophages M0, resting and activated dendritic cells, naive and memory B cells. Overall, our study results may provide new clues for exploring markers related to Pompe disease by highlighting key genes and their relationship with immune infiltration, offering insights into the disease's development. However, previous studies have shown limited evidence of significant immune cell infiltration in muscle biopsies from Pompe patients, and this lack of direct evidence necessitates further investigation and experimental validation in laboratory settings to confirm these associations."

    "abstract": "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the only approved disease-modifying treatment modality for Pompe disease, a rare, inherited metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the acid <i>α</i>-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme that catabolizes lysosomal glycogen. First-generation recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) ERT (alglucosidase alfa) can slow the progressive muscle degeneration characteristic of the disease. Still, most patients experience diminished efficacy over time, possibly because of poor uptake into target tissues. Next-generation ERTs aim to address this problem by increasing bis-phosphorylated high mannose (bis-M6P) <i>N</i>-glycans on rhGAA as these moieties have sufficiently high receptor binding affinity at the resultant low interstitial enzyme concentrations after dosing to drive uptake by the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor on target cells. However, some approaches introduce bis-M6P onto rhGAA via non-natural linkages that cannot be hydrolyzed by natural human enzymes and thus inhibit the endolysosomal glycan trimming necessary for complete enzyme activation after cell uptake. Furthermore, all rhGAA ERTs face potential inactivation during intravenous delivery (and subsequent non-productive clearance) as GAA is an acid hydrolase that is rapidly denatured in the near-neutral pH of the blood. One new therapy, cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat, is hypothesized to address these challenges by combining an enzyme enriched with naturally occurring bis-M6P <i>N</i>-glycans with a small-molecule stabilizer. Here, we investigate this hypothesis by analyzing published and new data related to the mechanism of action of the enzyme and stabilizer molecule. Based on an extensive collection of <i>in vitro</i>, preclinical, and clinical data, we conclude that cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat successfully addresses each of these challenges to offer meaningful advantages in terms of pharmacokinetic exposure, target-cell uptake, endolysosomal processing, and clinical benefit."

    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Pompe disease is a rare metabolic myopathy caused by the lack or deficiency of the lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase, resulting in skeletal muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. The disease varies by onset age and genetic mutations and is categorized into infantile-onset and late-onset Pompe disease. Respiratory muscle weakness may persist regardless enzyme replacement therapy. This systemic review and meta-analysis aim to assess the effect of respiratory muscle training (RMT) on respiratory muscle strength, functional endurance, and pulmonary function in patient with Pompe disease. <b>Methods</b>: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched up until Aug 2024. Studies examining the therapeutic effects of RMT in patients with Pompe disease were included. Outcome measures included the change in maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), six-minute walking test (6MWT), pulmonary function before after RMT, quality of life and adverse events. <b>Results</b>: The meta-analysis consisted of 5 single-arm studies, including 31 patients in total. Regarding inspiratory muscle strength, RMT has significantly improving MIP (8.71 cmH<sub>2</sub>O; 95% CI, 6.23-11.19, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and MEP (12.15 cmH<sub>2</sub>O; 95% CI, 10.55-13.74, <i>p</i> < 0.001) in both types of Pompe disease. However, no significant change regarding 6MWT. No serious adverse events were reported. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our meta-analysis revealed that RMT may increase inspiratory muscle and expiratory muscle strength, but may not have an effect on 6MWT in patients with Pompe disease. RMT has potential to be integrated into the cardioplulmonary rehabilitation for patients with Pompe disease. Further large randomized controlled trials are needed to verify the efficacy and safety of RMT in patients with Pompe disease."

    "title": "Combined miRNA transcriptome and proteome analysis of extracellular vesicles in urine and blood from the Pompe mouse model.",
    "abstract": "Acid α-glucosidase (GAA) is a lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyzes glycogen to glucose. Deficiency of GAA causes Pompe disease (PD), also known as glycogen storage disease type II. The resulting glycogen accumulation causes a spectrum of disease severity ranging from infantile-onset PD to adult-onset PD. Additional non-invasive biomarkers of disease severity are needed to monitor response to therapeutic interventions. We measured protein and miRNA abundance in exosomes from serum and urine from the PD mouse model (B6;129-GaaTm1Rabn/J), wild-type mice, and PD mice treated with a candidate gene therapy. There were significant differences in the abundance of 113 miRNA in serum exosomes from Pompe versus healthy mice. Levels of miR-206, miR-133, miR-1a, miR-486, and other important regulators of muscle development and maintenance were altered in the Pompe samples. The serum and urine exosome proteomes of healthy and Pompe mice also differed broadly. Several of the dysregulated proteins are encoded by genes with potential target sites for affected miRNA. Exosomes derived from urine or serum are a potential source of biomarkers for Pompe Disease. Further study of the differences in the miRNA transcriptome and proteome content of exosomes may yield new insights into disease mechanisms."

    "title": "First-in-Human Evaluation of Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Muscle Glycogen Lowering of a Novel Glycogen Synthase 1 Inhibitor for the Treatment of Pompe Disease.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare glycogen storage disease caused by mutations in the enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA) resulting in pathological accumulation of glycogen in muscle tissues leading to progressive weakness and respiratory dysfunction. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with GAA is currently the sole treatment option for patients with Pompe disease. ERT burdens patients with frequent intravenous infusions while insufficiently halting disease progression due to incomplete ERT skeletal muscle distribution. Glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) has been proposed as a substrate reduction therapy (SRT) target for Pompe disease. Here, we report results from the first-in-human study of the orally available GYS1 inhibitor MZE001 in healthy subjects. In 88 participants, MZE001 was well-tolerated up to a single dose of 480 mg BID and multiple doses of 720 mg BID for 10 days. Noncompartmental analysis determined that the half-life and C<sub>trough</sub> concentrations of MZE001 could provide efficacious exposures with once or twice daily oral dosing. Change from baseline of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) glycogen, which correlated with muscle glycogen levels in preclinical models, was significantly reduced dose-dependently following 10 days of MZE001 treatment in healthy subjects. A muscle biopsy sub-study demonstrated that 10 days of MZE001 (480 mg BID) dosing safely and substantially lowered muscle glycogen stores in healthy adults. This correlated with the PBMC exposure response and supports the use of PBMC glycogen reduction as a surrogate for muscle response, and MZE001 potential for development as the first oral substrate reduction therapy for patients with Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease, also known as Glycogen storage disease type II, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by defects in alpha-glucosidase, resulting in abnormal glycogen accumulation. To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of birth prevalence of Pompe disease, the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for original research articles on the epidemiology of Pompe disease from inception until July 01, 2024. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate global birth prevalence of Pompe disease. The funnel plot was used to describe potential publication bias. Twenty-two studies, screened out of 945 records, were included for data extraction. Studies that fulfilled inclusion criteria involved 15 areas/countries. Global birth prevalence of Pompe disease was 2.0 cases (95% CI: 1.5-2.4) per 100,000 live births. Global birth prevalence of infantile-onset Pompe disease was 1.0 cases (95% CI: 0.5-1.5) per 100,000 live births. Global birth prevalence of late-onset Pompe disease was 2.4 cases (95% CI: 1.8-3.0) per 100,000 live births. The main limitations are that no study was assessed as high-quality and approximately half of the studies were from Europe. Quantitative data on the global epidemiology of Pompe disease could be the fundamental to evaluate the global efforts on building a better world for Pompe disease patients."

    "title": "Pompe disease: Unmet needs and emerging therapies.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a debilitating and life-threatening disease caused by aberrant accumulation of glycogen resulting from reduced acid alpha-glucosidase activity. The first treatment for Pompe disease, the enzyme replacement therapy, Myozyme® (recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase, alglucosidase alfa), is a lifesaving treatment for the most severe form of the disease and provided clinically meaningful benefits to patients with milder phenotypes. Nonetheless, many patients display suboptimal responses or clinical decline following years of alglucosidase alfa treatment. The approval of avalglucosidase alfa (Nexviazyme®) and cipaglucosidase alfa (Pombiliti®) with miglustat (Opfolda®) represents a new generation of enzyme replacement therapies seeking to further improve patient outcomes beyond alglucosidase alfa. However, the emergence of a complicated new phenotype with central nervous system involvement following long-term treatment, coupled with known and anticipated unmet needs of patients receiving enzyme replacement therapy, has prompted development of innovative new treatments. This review provides an overview of the challenges of existing treatments and a summary of emerging therapies currently in preclinical or clinical development for Pompe disease and related lysosomal storage disorders. Key treatments include tissue-targeted enzyme replacement therapy, which seeks to enhance enzyme concentration in target tissues such as the central nervous system; substrate reduction therapy, which reduces intracellular glycogen concentrations via novel mechanisms; and gene therapy, which may restore endogenous production of deficient acid alpha-glucosidase. Each of these proposed treatments shows promise as a future therapeutic option to improve quality of life in Pompe disease by more efficiently treating the underlying cause of disease progression: glycogen accumulation."

    "title": "Significance of early diagnosis and treatment of adult late-onset Pompe disease on the effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy in improving muscle strength and respiratory function: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, is caused by mutations in the acid α-glucosidase gene. Pompe disease is a congenital metabolic disorder that affects all organs, particularly the striated muscle and nerve cells. Diagnosis is typically confirmed through enzyme assays that reveal reduced acid α-glucosidase activity. Enzyme replacement therapy utilizing human α-glucosidase is an available treatment option. Timely diagnosis and treatment in the early stages of the disease significantly impact the effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy in enhancing patient condition. Here, we present a case of a patient with Pompe disease diagnosed 20 years after the onset of clinical symptoms. A 38-year-old Iranian Baloch woman referred to our rheumatology clinic with progressive muscle weakness presents with a complex medical history. On mechanical ventilation for 12 years, she has endured fatigue and limb weakness since the age of 16, exacerbated following an abortion at 19. Despite undergoing corticosteroid and azathioprine therapies, the suspected diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy did not yield improvement. Hospitalization at 23 due to respiratory failure post-pregnancy led to her continued reliance on a ventilator. A dried blood spot test indicated reduced GAA enzyme activity, confirming a diagnosis of Pompe disease through genetic testing. Treatment with myozyme for 2 years demonstrated limited efficacy, as the patient experienced improved breathing but no significant overall improvement in limb-girdle muscular weakness. This case underscores the challenges and complexities involved in diagnosing and managing rare neuromuscular disorders like Pompe disease. Early intervention with enzyme replacement therapy plays a crucial role in halting further muscle loss and disease progression in Pompe disease patients. It is important to note that treatment during advanced stages of the disease may not yield substantial benefits. Nevertheless, enzyme instability and denaturation due to temperature and neutral pH levels, along with limited delivery to disease-relevant tissues, can pose challenges in treatment. However, timely diagnosis of Pompe disease is paramount for its effective management and improved outcomes."

    "abstract": "In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), vascular alterations have been shown to contribute to hypoxia and pulmonary hypertension, but the independent contribution of small vessel abnormalities to mortality remains unclear. We quantified artery and vein dimensions on computed tomography (CT) down to 0.2 mm. Small vessel volumes (<1 mmᴓ) were normalized by body surface area. In 7903 current and former smokers of the COPDGene study (53.2% male) the independent contribution of small artery and small vein volume to all-cause mortality was tested in multivariable Cox models. Additionally, we calculated the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of small arteries and veins in 374 never smokers to create two groups: normal and high small artery or vein volume. We describe clinical, physiological and imaging characteristics of subjects with a high small artery and high small vein volume. Both high small artery and high small vein volumes were independently associated with mortality with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.07 [1.01, 1.14] and 1.34 [1.21, 1.49] per mL/m<sup>2</sup> increase, respectively. In COPDGene, 447 (5.7%) had high small artery volume and 519 (9.1%) subjects had high small vein volume and both had more emphysema, more air trapping and more severe coronary calcium. In smokers, abnormally high volumes in small arteries and veins are both relevant for mortality, which urges investigations into the aetiology of small pulmonary vessels and cardiac function in smokers.

    "abstract": "Children and adolescents with Pompe disease (PD) face chronic and progressive myopathy requiring time-intensive enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Little is known about their perspectives on the disease and its treatment. This study explored their perceptions of disease symptoms and functioning status, and more subjective feelings about the impacts on their lives as part of developing a disease-specific questionnaire. Eleven pediatric patients aged 8-18 years and 26 caregivers from six children's hospitals in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland underwent semi-structured interviews. Data were recorded, transcribed using MAXQDA software, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. A system of meaningful categories was developed. Sixteen main categories were derived across four major thematic areas: perceptions of symptoms and limitations, experiences to do with the biopsychosocial impact of PD, treatment experiences, and general emotional well-being/burden. Participants demonstrated broad heterogeneity in symptom perceptions such as muscle weakness, breathing difficulties, pain, and fatigue. Emotional appraisals of limitations were not directly proportional to their severity, and even comparatively minor impairments were often experienced as highly frustrating, particularly for social reasons. The main psychosocial topics were social exclusion vs. inclusion and experiences to do with having a disease. The main finding regarding treatment was that switching ERT from hospital to home was widely viewed as a huge relief, reducing the impact on daily life and the burden of infusions. Emotional well-being ranged from not burdened to very happy in most children and adolescents, including the most severely affected. This study provided qualitative insights into the perceptions and experiences of pediatric PD patients. Interestingly, biopsychosocial burden was not directly related to disease severity, and tailored psychosocial support could improve health-related quality of life. The present findings ensure the content validity of a novel questionnaire to be tested as a screening tool to identify patients in need of such support."

    "title": "Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Glycogen Storage Disorders (GSDs).",
    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disorders (GSDs) are a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by defects in enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism. Deficiencies in enzymes responsible for glycogen breakdown and synthesis can impair mitochondrial function. For instance, in GSD type II (Pompe disease), acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency leads to lysosomal glycogen accumulation, which secondarily impacts mitochondrial function through dysfunctional mitophagy, which disrupts mitochondrial quality control, generating oxidative stress. In GSD type III (Cori disease), the lack of the debranching enzyme causes glycogen accumulation and affects mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis by disrupting the integrity of muscle fibers. Malfunctional glycogen metabolism can disrupt various cascades, thus causing mitochondrial and cell metabolic dysfunction through various mechanisms. These dysfunctions include altered mitochondrial morphology, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and defective mitophagy. The oxidative burden typical of GSDs compromises mitochondrial integrity and exacerbates the metabolic derangements observed in GSDs. The intertwining of mitochondrial dysfunction and GSDs underscores the complexity of these disorders and has significant clinical implications. GSD patients often present with multisystem manifestations, including hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, and muscle weakness, which can be exacerbated by mitochondrial impairment. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to the progression of GSD-related complications, such as cardiomyopathy and neurocognitive deficits. Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction thus represents a promising therapeutic avenue in GSDs. Potential strategies include antioxidants to mitigate oxidative stress, compounds that enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, and gene therapy to correct the underlying mitochondrial enzyme deficiencies. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of GSDs. Recognizing and addressing this aspect can lead to more comprehensive and effective treatments, improving the quality of life of GSD patients. This review aims to elaborate on the intricate relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and various types of GSDs. The review presents challenges and treatment options for several GSDs."

Neurologic damage is almost always present, and it is usually degenerative. White matter (WM) involvement may be primary or secondary. Diseases with primary WM involvement are leukodystrophies, demyelinating (Krabbe disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy), and hypomyelinating leukodystrophies (free sialic acid storage disease, fucosidosis, and mucolipidosis type IV). LSDs with secondary WM involvement are classified as leukoencephalopathies and include gangliosidosis, mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), ceroid neuronal lipofuscinosis, multiple sulfatase deficiency, alpha-mannosidosis, Pompe disease, and Fabry disease. Neurologic manifestations may overlap among LSDs and include developmental delays, motor, cognitive and speech impairments, seizures, visual failure, ataxia, and extrapyramidal signs. Most of LSDs are typically present in early or late infancy, but juvenile and adult forms also exist and are associated with predominantly neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms. The outcome of these disorders is generally poor and specific treatments (enzyme replacement therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or gene therapy) are only available in a small number of them."

Clinical evidence suggests that enzyme replacement therapy improves health outcomes for adults with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). PROPEL was a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, which evaluated cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat, vs alglucosidase alfa plus placebo in 123 adult patients with LOPD (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03729362). <b>Objectives:</b> To analyze EQ-5D health-related quality of life (HRQoL) utility data from PROPEL. <b>Methods:</b> Multilevel modeling techniques (mixed regression methods) were used to analyze PROPEL EQ-5D-3L estimates and predict utility values for 7 health states previously identified in an economic evaluation for LOPD. In PROPEL, EQ-5D-5L values were assessed at screening and at weeks 12, 26, 38, and 52. EQ-5D-5L utility values were mapped to EQ-5D-3L values using the van Hout algorithm as recommended by the EuroQoL and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence position statement at time of analysis. UK population tariffs were applied for all EQ-5D utility valuations. Utility values were predicted according to 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and percent predicted sitting forced vital capacity. <b>Results:</b> The mixed model predicted that EQ-5D-3L utility values for patients who could walk >75 m with LOPD ranged between 0.55 and 0.67 according to patient 6MWD and respiratory function. In this analysis, patients with a 6MWD ≤75 m, consistent with a health state requiring wheelchair support in the economic analysis, had a predicted utility value of 0.49. There were few patients in PROPEL who could walk ≤75 m at any time point in the study, hence, these utility estimates should be interpreted with caution. EQ-5D-3L utility estimates from PROPEL were consistent with previously reported EQ-5D-3L values in LOPD. <b>Conclusions:</b> Overall, the results from our analysis indicate that important HRQoL losses are associated with reductions in mobility and respiratory function for patients with Pompe disease. The study provides important evidence of HRQoL utility values for patients with advanced LOPD, a population for whom published data are limited."

    "abstract": "Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). It is characterized by severe and progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness with death in the first 2 years of life if left untreated. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase-alfa is lifesaving, but its effectiveness is influenced by the patient's cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status, dose of ERT, and the development of high antibody titers, which can reduce the therapy's efficacy. The inability of CRIM-negative IOPD patients to produce native GAA exposes them to a high risk of development of anti-rhGAA IgG antibody titers, leading to treatment failure. We present the case of CRIM-negative dizygotic twins treated with high-dose alglucosidase-alfa (40 mg/kg/week), initiated at 28 days (Twin A) and 44 days (Twin B). Both twins received immune tolerance induction (ITI) with rituximab, methotrexate, and IVIG to mitigate antibody response. Initial evaluations revealed elevated left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and elevated biomarkers (urine glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc<sub>4</sub>), creatine kinase (CK), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)) in both twins. Following treatment, cardiac function and biomarkers normalized within several months, with a slight delay in Twin B compared to Twin A, likely attributed to the later initiation of ERT. Both twins safely tolerated ITI, achieving immune tolerance with low antibody titers. At 28 months, the twins transitioned to avalglucosidase-alfa (40 mg/kg every other week (EOW)), which was well tolerated without an increase in antibody titers. At 39 months, both twins exhibited normal cardiac function, LVMI, and biomarkers. Motor skills continued to improve, though some kinematic concerns persisted. These cases underscore the importance of early, high-dose ERT combined with ITI in managing CRIM-negative IOPD. While transitioning to avalglucosidase-alfa at 40 mg/kg/EOW was beneficial and well-tolerated in our patients, further studies are needed to confirm its long-term efficacy compared to the high-dose weekly 40 mg/kg alglucosidase-alfa."

Although treatment with recombinant human acid α-glucosidase has dramatically improved survival, recombinant human acid α-glucosidase does not reach the brain, and surviving classic infantile Pompe patients develop progressive cognitive deficits and white matter lesions. We investigated the feasibility of measuring non-invasively glycogen build-up and other metabolic alterations in the brain of classic infantile Pompe patients. Four classic infantile patients (8-16 years old) and 4 age-matched healthy controls were scanned on a 7 T MRI scanner. We used T<sub>2</sub>-weighted MRI to assess the presence of white matter lesions as well as <sup>1</sup>H magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging to obtain the neurochemical profile and its spatial distribution, respectively. All patients had widespread white matter lesions on T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy data from a single volume of interest positioned in the periventricular white matter showed a clear shift in the neurochemical profile, particularly a significant increase in glycogen (result of acid α-glucosidase deficiency) and decrease in <i>N</i>-acetyl-aspartate (marker of neuronal damage) in patients. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging results were in line and showed a widespread accumulation of glycogen and a significant lower level of <i>N</i>-acetyl-aspartate in patients. Our results illustrate the unique potential of <sup>1</sup>H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (imaging) to provide a non-invasive readout of the disease pathology in the brain.

Lipidomic analysis was performed to characterize the serum lipidome in patients with GSDIa, by including age- and sex-matched healthy controls and age-matched hypercholesterolemic controls. Metabolic control and dietary information biochemical markers were obtained from patients with GSDIa. Patients with GSDIa showed higher total serum lysophosphatidylcholine (Fold Change, (FC) 2.2, P < 0.0001), acyl-acyl-phosphatidylcholine (FC 2.1, P < 0.0001), and ceramide (FC 2.4, P < 0.0001) levels and bile acid (FC 0.7, P < 0.001), acylcarnitines (FC 0.7, P < 0.001), and cholesterol esters (FC 1.0, P < 0.001) than those of healthy controls, and higher di- (FC 1.1, P < 0.0001; FC 0.9, P < 0.01) and triacylglycerol (FC 6.3, P < 0.0001; FC 3.9, P < 0.01) levels than those of healthy controls and hypercholesterolemic subjects.

To compare the change in quality of life (QoL) between adults with LOPD receiving under-dose ERT and no ERT, and identify factors associated with the change of QoL. A retrospective matched cohort study was conducted among adult patients with LOPD in a nationwide Pompe registry in China. Eligible participants were those who completed two investigations, and didn't expose to ERT at baseline or before. The treated group were those who used ERT during follow-up; the untreated group received general care. The treated and untreated group were matched with a ratio of 1:2. QoL was assessed by the SF-12 and EQ-5D-5L. The dose of ERT was evaluated by the ratio of actual vials patients used divided by the indicated vials patients should use. The treated patients were further classified into mild and severe under-dose users by the median ratio. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to estimate the average treatment effect in the treated groups and identify factors associated with the changes of QoL scores. The study sample included 5 mild under-dose users, 6 severe under-dose users, and 22 untreated participants. Compared with the untreated group, mild under-dose ERT had no significant effect on the changes of QoL scores. In contrast, severe under-dose ERT was associated with a decline of physical QoL (β = -6.19, p = 0.001), but an increase of overall health state (β = 19.69, p = 0.032). A higher score of physical QoL (β = -0.74, p = 0.001) and overall health state (β = -0.69, p<0.001) at baseline was associated with decline in corresponding scores at follow-up. Being female was a contributor to the worsening of the overall health state (β = -22.79, p = 0.002), while being employed or at school was a predictor of improvement in mental QoL (β = 5.83, p = 0.002). A Pompe-disease specific instrument based on patient experiences is warranted to closely monitor changes in QoL on a routine basis. It is desirable for patients with severe under-dose ERT to discuss with physicians whether to adjust treatment strategies."

Analyses of two networks were conducted: Network A, including only RCTs, and network B, additionally including single-arm OLE and phase I/II studies. <b>Results:</b> Network B (full evidence analysis) showed that cipa+mig was associated with a relative increase in 6MWD (mean difference 28.93 m, 95% credible interval [8.26-50.11 m]; Bayesian probability 99.7%) and FVC (2.88 pp [1.07-4.71 pp]; >99.9%) compared with aval. The comparison between cipa+mig and aval became more favorable for cipa+mig with increasing previous ERT duration for both end points. Analysis of network A showed that cipa+mig was associated with a relative decrease in 6MWD (-10.02 m [-23.62 to 4.00 m]; 91.8%) and FVC (-1.45 pp [-3.01 to 0.07 pp]; 96.8%) compared with aval. <b>Conclusion:</b> Cipa+mig showed a favorable effect versus aval when all available evidence was used in the analysis."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (OMIM #232300), a rare genetic disorder, leads to glycogen buildup in the body due to an enzyme deficiency, particularly harming the heart and muscles. Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) requires urgent treatment to prevent mortality, but the unavailability of these methods often delays diagnosis. Our study aims to streamline IOPD diagnosis in the UAE using electronic health records (EHRs) for faster, more accurate detection and timely treatment initiation. This study utilized electronic health records from the Abu Dhabi Healthcare Company (SEHA) healthcare network in the UAE to develop an expert rule-based screening approach operationalized through a dashboard. The study encompassed six diagnosed IOPD patients and screened 93,365 subjects. Expert rules were formulated to identify potential high-risk IOPD patients based on their age, particular symptoms, and creatine kinase levels. The proposed approach was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The proposed approach accurately identified five true positives, one false negative, and four false positive IOPD cases. The false negative case involved a patient with both Pompe disease and congenital heart disease. The focus on CHD led to the overlooking of Pompe disease, exacerbated by no measurement of creatine kinase. The false positive cases were diagnosed with Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 12-A (SLC25A4 gene), Immunodeficiency-71 (ARPC1B mutation), Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC1 gene mutation leading to frameshift), and Group B Streptococcus meningitis. The proposed approach of integrating expert rules with a dashboard facilitated efficient data visualization and automated patient screening, which aids in the early detection of Pompe disease. Future studies are encouraged to investigate the application of machine learning methodologies to enhance further the precision and efficiency of identifying patients with IOPD."

    "abstract": "Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) comprise a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by defects in glycogen metabolism, leading to abnormal glycogen accumulation in multiple tissues, most notably affecting the liver, skeletal muscle, and heart. Recent findings have uncovered the importance of glycogen metabolism in the brain, sustaining a myriad of physiological functions and linking its perturbation to central nervous system (CNS) pathology. This link resulted in classification of neurological-GSDs (n-GSDs), a group of diseases with shared deficits in neurological glycogen metabolism. The n-GSD patients exhibit a spectrum of clinical presentations with common etiology while requiring tailored therapeutic approaches from the traditional GSDs. Recent research has elucidated the genetic and biochemical mechanisms and pathophysiological basis underlying different n-GSDs. Further, the last decade has witnessed some promising developments in novel therapeutic approaches, including enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), substrate reduction therapy (SRT), small molecule drugs, and gene therapy targeting key aspects of glycogen metabolism in specific n-GSDs. This preclinical progress has generated noticeable success in potentially modifying disease course and improving clinical outcomes in patients. Herein, we provide an overview of current perspectives on n-GSDs, emphasizing recent advances in understanding their molecular basis, therapeutic developments, underscore key challenges and the need to deepen our understanding of n-GSDs pathogenesis to develop better therapeutic strategies that could offer improved treatment and sustainable benefits to the patients."

    "abstract": "Studying a patient with Pompe disease (PD) is like opening Pandora's box. The specialist is faced with numerous clinical features similar to those of several diseases, and very often the symptoms are well hidden and none is associated with this rare disease. In recent years, scientific interest in this disease has been growing more and more, but still no symptom is recognized as key to a correct diagnosis of it, nor is there any specific disease marker to date. New diagnostic/therapeutic proposals on disease allow for the diffusion of knowledge of this pathology for timely diagnosis of the patient. Due to unawareness and difficulty in diagnosis, many adults with PD are diagnosed with great delay. In this article, we report and discuss current knowledge of PD and provide new data from work conducted on a cohort of 2934 Italian subjects recruited in recent years. A genetic analysis of the <i>GAA</i> gene was performed on patients with significant clinical signs and pathological enzyme activity to define the genetic profile of subjects. This identified 39 symptomatic PD subjects with low acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme activity and the presence of two causative mutations in <i>GAA</i> gene regions. Furthermore, 22 subjects with genetic variants of uncertain significance (GVUS) were identified."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a rare autosomal recessive glycogen storage disorder that causes proximal muscle weakness and loss of respiratory function. While enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the only effective treatment, biomarkers for disease monitoring are scarce. Following ex vivo biomarker validation in phantom studies, we apply multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), a laser- and ultrasound-based non-invasive imaging approach, in a clinical trial (NCT05083806) to image the biceps muscles of 10 late-onset PD (LOPD) patients and 10 matched healthy controls. MSOT is compared with muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, spirometry, muscle testing and quality of life scores. Next, results are validated in an independent LOPD patient cohort from a second clinical site. Our study demonstrates that MSOT enables imaging of subcellular disease pathology with increases in glycogen/water, collagen and lipid signals, providing higher sensitivity in detecting muscle degeneration than current methods. This translational approach suggests implementation in the complex care of these rare disease patients."

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is caused by a genetic deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), leading to progressive limb-girdle weakness and respiratory impairment. The insidious onset of non-specific early symptoms often prohibits timely diagnosis. This study aimed to validate the high-risk screening criteria for LOPD in the Chinese population. A total of 726 patients were included, including 96 patients under 14 years of age. Dried blood spots (DBS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were employed to evaluate serum GAA activity. Forty-four patients exhibited a decreased GAA activity, 16 (2.2%) of which were confirmed as LOPD by genetic testing. Three previously unreported GAA mutations were also identified. The median diagnostic delay was shortened to 3 years, which excelled the previous retrospective studies. At diagnosis, most patients exhibited impaired respiratory function and/or limb-girdle weakness. Elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels were more frequently observed in patients who manifested before age 16. Overall, high-risk screening is a feasible and efficient method to identify LOPD patients at an early stage. Patients over 1 year of age with either weakness in axial and/or proximal limb muscles, or unexplained respiratory distress shall be subject to GAA enzymatic test, while CK levels above 2 times the upper normal limit shall be an additional criterion for patients under 16. This modified high-risk screening criteria for LOPD requires further validation in larger Chinese cohorts."

Clinical data of 5 children with infantile-type glycogen storage disease type II due to the acidic α-glucosidase (GAA) gene variants diagnosed and treated at Hebei Provincial Children's Hospital from January 2018 to April 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Among the 5 cases, 1 was female and 4 were male, and the age at first diagnosis was from 2 months to 7 months. The first symptoms of all 5 cases showed progressive muscle weakness, hypotonia, and motor developmental backwardness, and all of them had abnormally elevated creatine kinase, and the echocardiograms suggested different degrees of myocardial hypertrophy, with ejection fractions ranging from 44% to 67%. Analysis of GAA gene variations: all 5 cases were compound heterozygous, and a total of 12 variant loci were detected, of which c.2024_2026delACA, c.2853G > A, c.1124G > T, c.574G > A, c.2509C > T, and c.2013G > A were new mutations that had not been reported. All 5 children died before 1 year of age, and the age of death ranged from 7 months to 11.5 months, with a mean survival time of 9.8 months. Peripheral blood GAA gene testing and alpha-glucosidase enzyme activity testing is an effective method for diagnosing this disease."

This study aimed to validate the R-PAct for use in other countries. Four other language versions (German, French, Italian, and Spanish) of the R-PAct were created and distributed among Pompe patients (≥16 years old) in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and Switzerland and pooled with data of newly diagnosed patients from Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the USA, and the UK and the original validation cohort (n = 186). The psychometric properties of the scale were assessed by exploratory factor analysis and Rasch analysis. Data for 520 patients were eligible for analysis. Exploratory factor analysis suggested that the items separated into two domains: Activities of Daily Living and Mobility. Both domains independently displayed adequate Rasch model measurement properties, following the removal of one item (\"Are you able to practice a sport?\") from the Mobility domain, and can be added together to form a \"higher order\" factor as well. Differential item functioning (DIF)-by-language assessment indicated DIF for several items; however, the impact of accounting for DIF was negligible. We recalibrated the nomogram (raw score interval-level transformation) for the updated 17-item R-PAct scale. The minimal detectable change value was 13.85 for the overall R-PAct. After removing one item, the modified-R-PAct scale is a valid disease-specific patient-reported outcome measure for patients with Pompe disease across multiple countries."

Semi-structured interviews were conducted from October to December 2022 with 10 mothers of school-age children diagnosed with Pompe disease, which were identified through the Taiwan Pompe Disease Association. Colaizzi's phenomenological method was employed for data analysis. The study identified five themes in the caregiving experiences of mothers: 1. unwavering parenting beliefs; 2. child-centric approach; 3. focus on peer relationships and coping strategies; 4. integration of learning, treatment, and rehabilitation; and 5. embracing and navigating life's challenges. Mothers balanced education, treatment, and rehabilitation for their children with Pompe disease, offering perspectives into the caregiving experience. This study highlights the complex experiences of mothers caring for children with Pompe disease, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive support. Insights into the perspectives of mothers can aid health-care professionals in understanding the challenges faced by families with children diagnosed with Pompe disease and can enable the development of strategies for providing comprehensive psychological support to improve mental health outcomes for these children and their families. Increased awareness among health-care professionals and in the society leads to an informed and empathetic approach to addressing the unique challenges faced by children with Pompe disease and their families."

    "title": "Role of glycogen metabolism in <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> virulence.",
    "abstract": "Glycogen plays a vital role as an energy reserve in various bacterial and fungal species. <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> possesses a glycogen metabolism operon that contains genes for both glycogen synthesis and utilization. In our investigation, we focused on understanding the significance of glycogen metabolism in the physiology and pathogenesis of <i>C. difficile</i>. To explore this, we engineered a <i>C. difficile</i> JIR8094 strain lacking glycogen synthesis capability by introducing a group II intron into the <i>glgC</i> gene, the operon's first component. Quantification of intracellular glycogen levels validated the impact of this modification. Interestingly, the mutant strain exhibited a 1.5-fold increase in toxin production compared with the parental strain, without significant changes in the sporulation rate. Our analysis also revealed that wild-type <i>C. difficile</i> spores contained glycogen, whereas spores from the mutant strain lacking stored glycogen showed increased sensitivity to physical and chemical treatments and had a shorter storage life. By suppressing <i>glgP</i> expression, the gene coding for glycogen-phosphorylase, via CRISPRi, we demonstrated that glycogen accumulation but not the utilization is needed for spore resilience in <i>C. difficile</i>. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed a significantly lower core/cortex ratio in <i>glgC</i> mutant strain spores. In hamster challenge experiments, both the parental and <i>glgC</i> mutant strains colonized hosts similarly; however, the mutant strain failed to induce infection relapse after antibiotic treatment cessation. These findings highlight the importance of glycogen metabolism in <i>C. difficile</i> spore resilience and suggest its role in disease relapse.IMPORTANCEThis study on the role of glycogen metabolism in <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> highlights its critical involvement in the pathogen's energy management, its pathogenicity, and its resilience. Our results also revealed that glycogen presence in spores is pivotal for their structural integrity and resistance to adverse conditions, which is essential for their longevity and infectivity. Importantly, the inability of the mutant strain to cause infection relapse in hamsters post-antibiotic treatment pinpoints a potential target for therapeutic interventions, highlighting the importance of glycogen in disease dynamics. This research thus significantly advances our understanding of <i>C. difficile</i> physiology and pathogenesis, offering new avenues for combating its persistence and recurrence."

A systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines was performed. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used for searching terms related to LSDs and gene-silencing strategies and tools. Fabry, Gaucher, and Pompe diseases and mucopolysaccharidoses I and III are the only LSDs for which gSRT has been studied, siRNA and lipid nanoparticles being the silencing strategy and the delivery system most frequently employed, respectively. Only in one recently published study was CRISPR/Cas9 applied to treat Fabry disease. Specific tissue targeting, availability of relevant cell and animal LSD models, and the rare disease condition are the main challenges with gSRT for the treatment of these diseases. Out of the 11 studies identified, only two gSRT studies were evaluated in animal models. Nucleic acid therapies are expanding the clinical tools and therapies currently available for LSDs. Recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9 technology and the growing impact of nanotechnology are expected to boost the clinical translation of gSRT in the near future, and not only for LSDs."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). This enzyme is responsible for breaking down glycogen, leading to the abnormal accumulation of glycogen, which results in progressive muscle weakness and metabolic dysregulation. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that the small molecule inhibition of glycogen synthase I (GYS1) may reduce muscle glycogen content and improve metabolic dysregulation in a mouse model of Pompe disease. To address this hypothesis, we studied four groups of male mice: a control group of wild-type (WT) B6129SF1/J mice fed either regular chow or a GYS1 inhibitor (MZ-101) diet (WT-GYS1), and Pompe model mice B6;129-Gaatm1Rabn/J fed either regular chow (GAA-KO) or MZ-101 diet (GAA-GYS1) for 7 days. Our findings revealed that GAA-KO mice exhibited abnormal glycogen accumulation in the gastrocnemius, heart, and diaphragm. In contrast, inhibiting GYS1 reduced glycogen levels in all tissues compared with GAA-KO mice. Furthermore, GAA-KO mice displayed reduced spontaneous activity during the dark cycle compared with WT mice, whereas GYS1 inhibition counteracted this effect. Compared with GAA-KO mice, GAA-GYS1 mice exhibited improved glucose tolerance and whole body insulin sensitivity. These improvements in insulin sensitivity could be attributed to increased AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in the gastrocnemius of WT-GYS1 and GAA-GYS1 mice. Additionally, the GYS1 inhibitor led to a reduction in the phosphorylation of GS<sup>S641</sup> and the LC3 autophagy marker. Together, our results suggest that targeting GYS1 could serve as a potential strategy for treating glycogen storage disorders and metabolic dysregulation.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> We investigated the effects of small molecule inhibition of glycogen synthase I (GYS1) on glucose metabolism in a mouse model of Pompe disease. GYS1 inhibition reduces abnormal glycogen accumulation and molecular biomarkers associated with Pompe disease while also improving glucose intolerance. Our results collectively demonstrate that the GYS1 inhibitor represents a novel approach to substrate reduction therapy for Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is due to mutations in the <i>GAA</i> gene leading to profound deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme α-1,4-glucosidase. The disease is characterized by severe hypotonia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, macroglossia, and liver enlargement with onset in the first months of life. In the late-onset form (LOPD), muscle signs predominate with a clinical picture resembling muscle dystrophies. Enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa (rhGAA) has been available since 2006 and patients treated with the enzyme show improved outcomes. Nevertheless, there is evidence that some patients have a suboptimal response or, after an initial improvement, reach a plateau with stabilization of the clinical picture. Thus, a new enzyme formulation, avalglucosidase alfa (neoGAA), with a higher degree of mannosylation, was developed. We conducted a multicenter survey that collected data on four patients with IOPD, aged 6 to 16 years, who were switched to neoGAA thanks to a compassionate use program, after being treated for an average of 11.5 years with rhGAA. Follow-up data, including biochemical parameters and clinical features, were analyzed to determine clinical outcomes and the safety profile after a mean of 9 months. Patients with IOPD who were treated with neoGAA showed a positive change in biomarker levels. Moreover, the clinical picture revealed improved motor performance and cardiac parameters in patients who previously responded poorly. This study highlights the improved efficacy of neoGAA, as a next generation enzyme replacement therapy, in 4 Italian patients with IOPD. Several clinical parameters showed a positive response to the new formulation suggesting that, if used at diagnosis, neoGAA may result in better outcomes for patients with IOPD."

Alglucosidase alfa has been a lifesaving treatment for patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease and radically improved daily life for patients with late-onset Pompe disease; however, long-term experience with alglucosidase alfa unraveled key unmet needs in these populations. Despite treatment, Pompe disease continues to progress, especially from a skeletal muscle perspective, resulting in a multitude of functional limitations. Strong collaboration between the scientific and patient communities led to increased awareness of Pompe disease, a better understanding of disease pathophysiology, knowledge of the clinical course of the disease as patients surpassed the first decade of life, and the strengths and limitations of enzyme replacement therapy. Taken together, these advancements spurred the need for development of a next generation of enzyme replacement therapy and provided a framework for progress toward other novel treatments.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy and limitations of ERT in advanced LOPD patients. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical courses of patients with advanced LOPD (two juvenile-onset and five adult-onset patients) who were treated with recombinant human alglucosidase alfa to examine improvements achieved with and limitations of ERT until their death or when switching to avalglucosidase alfa occurred. All patients were non-ambulant and ventilator dependent. The duration of follow-up ranged from 3.7 to 15.0 years (median 9.0 years). All patients reported improvements in their lives during the first two or three years of ERT. Vital capacity was clearly improved in patients with relatively spared respiratory function, although it deteriorated after respiratory complications such as pneumothorax. Pinch and grip power tended to be preserved during the treatment period. Muscle CT revealed progression of atrophy and fatty replacement predominantly in the proximal limb muscles without improvement after ERT. Four patients died due to aspergillosis, respiratory failure, ileus, and sudden death of unknown cause. Our findings demonstrate that patients undergoing ERT show certain improvements, even in the advanced stage of Pompe disease. Respiratory complications are lethal even during ERT, and early diagnosis and induction of therapy are critical. Muscle wasting progressed more severely in the proximal limbs, even after ERT."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a neuromuscular disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), hydrolyzing glycogen to glucose. Pathological glycogen storage, the hallmark of the disease, disrupts the metabolism and function of various cell types, especially muscle cells, leading to cardiac, motor, and respiratory dysfunctions. The spectrum of Pompe disease manifestations spans two main forms: classical infantile-onset (IOPD) and late-onset (LOPD). IOPD, caused by almost complete GAA deficiency, presents at birth and leads to premature death by the age of 2 years without treatment. LOPD, less severe due to partial GAA activity, appears in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood with muscle weakness and respiratory problems. Since 2006, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been approved for Pompe disease, offering clinical benefits but not a cure. However, advances in early diagnosis through newborn screening, recognizing disease manifestations, and developing improved treatments are set to enhance Pompe disease care. This article reviews recent progress in ERT and ongoing translational research, including the approval of second-generation ERTs, a clinical trial of in utero ERT, and preclinical development of gene and substrate reduction therapies. Notably, gene therapy using intravenous delivery of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors is in phase I/II clinical trials for both LOPD and IOPD. Promising data from LOPD trials indicate that most participants met the criteria to discontinue ERT several months after gene therapy. The advantages and challenges of this approach are discussed. Overall, significant progress is being made towards curative therapies for Pompe disease. While several challenges remain, emerging data are promising and suggest the potential for a once-in-a-lifetime treatment."

We reviewed 100 adult LOPD patients followed in 17 hospitals in France included in the French national Pompe disease registry. The Swallowing Quality of Life Questionnaire and the Sydney Swallow Questionnaire were completed by patients, and a specialist carried out a medical examination focused on swallowing and assigned a Salassa score to each patient. Respiratory and motor functions were also recorded. Subgroup analysis compared patients with and without swallowing difficulties based on Salassa score. Thirty-two percent of patients presented with swallowing difficulties, often mild but sometimes severe enough to require percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (1%). Daily dysphagia was reported for 20% of our patients and aspirations for 18%; 9.5% were unable to eat away from home. Macroglossia was described in 18% of our patients, and 11% had lingual atrophy. Only 15% of patients presenting with swallowing disorders were followed by a speech therapist. Swallowing difficulties were significantly associated with macroglossia (p = 0.015), longer duration of illness (p = 0.032), and a lower body mass index (p = 0.047). Swallowing difficulties in LOPD are common and have significant functional impact. Increased awareness by physicians of these symptoms with systematic examination of the tongue and questions about swallowing can lead to appropriate multidisciplinary care with a speech therapist and dietitian if needed."

Glycogen storage diseases are a set of disorders that arise from improper glycogen metabolism. Glycogen storage disease II, known as Pompe disease, is caused by a genetic mutation that leads to increased glycogen storage in cells and tissues, resulting in progressive muscle atrophy and respiratory decline for patients. One approach for treating Pompe disease is to reduce glycogen levels by interfering with the glycogen synthesis pathway through glycogen synthase inhibitors. To facilitate the study of glycogen synthase inhibitors in biological samples, such as cultured cells, a high-throughput approach for measuring cellular glycogen was developed. A bioluminescent glycogen detection assay was automated and used to measure the glycogen content in cells grown in 384-well plates. The assay successfully quantified reduced glycogen stores in cells treated with a series of glycogen synthase 1 inhibitors, validating the utility of the assay for drug screening efforts and demonstrating its value for therapy development and glycogen metabolism research."

    "title": "Autophagy of Glycogen Is Non-Selective in <i>Komagataella phaffii</i>.",
    "abstract": "Glycogen is an important reserve polysaccharide from bacteria to human. It is organized in glycogen granules that also contain several proteins involved in their metabolism. Glycogen granules can be mobilized in mammalian lysosomes and yeast vacuoles. They are delivered to these organelles by macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy). However, whether this is a selective or a non-selective process remains a matter of debate. It was proposed to be selective and called \"glycophagy\" (for selective autophagy of glycogen) in the mouse liver. However, the evidence of this selectivity is lacking in other glycogen-rich organs, such as the heart and skeletal muscle, which both are heavily impacted by the aberrant lysosomal accumulation of glycogen in Pompe disease. We recently developed the <i>Komagataella phaffii</i> yeast as a simple model to study the relationship of glycogen and autophagy. Using this model, we showed that cytosolic glycogen granules are delivered to the vacuole by non-selective autophagy, at least during nitrogen starvation. We speculate that this type of autophagy might be responsible for the lysosomal glycogen turnover in non-hepatic mammalian tissues."

    "title": "Decoding the muscle transcriptome of patients with late-onset Pompe disease reveals markers of disease progression.",
    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase leading to progressive cellular dysfunction owing to the accumulation of glycogen in the lysosome. The mechanism of relentless muscle damage (a classic manifestation of the disease) has been studied extensively by analysing the whole-muscle tissue; however, little, if anything, is known about transcriptional heterogeneity among nuclei within the multinucleated skeletal muscle cells. This is the first report of application of single-nucleus RNA sequencing to uncover changes in the gene expression profile in muscle biopsies from eight patients with LOPD and four muscle samples from age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We matched these changes with histological findings using GeoMx spatial transcriptomics to compare the transcriptome of control myofibres from healthy individuals with non-vacuolated (histologically unaffected) and vacuolated (histologically affected) myofibres of LODP patients. We observed an increase in the proportion of slow and regenerative muscle fibres and macrophages in LOPD muscles. The expression of the genes involved in glycolysis was reduced, whereas the expression of the genes involved in the metabolism of lipids and amino acids was increased in non-vacuolated fibres, indicating early metabolic abnormalities. Additionally, we detected upregulation of autophagy genes and downregulation of the genes involved in ribosomal and mitochondrial function leading to defective oxidative phosphorylation. Upregulation of genes associated with inflammation, apoptosis and muscle regeneration was observed only in vacuolated fibres. Notably, enzyme replacement therapy (the only available therapy for the disease) showed a tendency to restore dysregulated metabolism, particularly within slow fibres. A combination of single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics revealed the landscape of the normal and diseased muscle and highlighted the early abnormalities associated with disease progression. Thus, the application of these two new cutting-edge technologies provided insight into the molecular pathophysiology of muscle damage in LOPD and identified potential avenues for therapeutic intervention."

    "abstract": "The efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa (AVA) versus alglucosidase alfa (ALG) on forced vital capacity percent predicted (FVCpp) in patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) has been assessed in the Phase 3 COMET trial (NCT02782741). Due to the rarity of LOPD and thus small sample size in COMET, additional data were analyzed to gain further insights into the efficacy of AVA versus ALG. Data from treatment-naive patients with LOPD were pooled from COMET and Phase 1/2 NEO1/NEO-EXT (NCT01898364/NCT02032524) trials for patients treated with AVA, and Phase 3 LOTS trial (NCT00158600) for patients treated with ALG. Regression analyses using mixed models with repeated measures consistent with those pre-specified in COMET were performed post-hoc. Analyses were adjusted for trials and differences in baseline characteristics. Four models were developed: Model 1 considered all trials; Model 2 included Phase 3 trials; Model 3 included Phase 3 trials and was adjusted for baseline ventilation use; Model 4 included COMET and NEO1/NEO-EXT (i.e., AVA trials only). Overall, 100 randomized patients from COMET (AVA, <i>n</i> = 51, ALG, <i>n</i> = 49), 60 from LOTS (ALG arm only), and three patients from NEO1/NEO-EXT (who received open-label AVA only) were considered for analysis. Mean age at enrollment was similar across trials (45.3-50.3 years); however, patients from LOTS had a longer mean duration of disease versus COMET and NEO1/NEO-EXT trials (9.0 years and 0.5-2.2 years, respectively) and younger mean age at diagnosis (36.2 years and 44.7-48.6 years, respectively). Least squares mean (95% confidence interval) improvement from baseline in FVCpp at Week 49-52 for AVA versus ALG was 2.43 (-0.13; 4.99) for COMET (<i>n</i> = 98); 2.31 (0.06; 4.57) for Model 1 (<i>n</i> = 160); 2.43 (0.21; 4.65) for Model 2 (<i>n</i> = 157); 2.80 (0.54; 5.05) for Model 3 (<i>n</i> = 154); and 2.27 (-0.30; 4.45) for Model 4 (<i>n</i> = 101). Models 1 to 3, which had an increased sample size versus COMET, demonstrated a nominally significant effect on FVCpp favoring AVA versus ALG after 1 year of treatment, consistent with results from COMET."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency, results in progressive glycogen accumulation and multisystem dysfunction. Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase is the standard of care; however, some patients develop anti-recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase antibodies, leading to reduced efficacy. This case report presents two infants with early-onset Pompe disease who developed IgG antibodies to enzyme replacement therapy and were subsequently treated with methotrexate, highlighting the importance of monitoring antibody development and exploring alternative therapeutic approaches. Patient 1, a 10-month-old female from Bogota, Colombia, presented with generalized hypotonia, macroglossia, hyporeflexia, and mild left ventricular hypertrophy. Diagnostic tests confirmed early-onset Pompe disease, and enzyme replacement therapy was started at 12 months. Due to a lack of improvement and high anti-recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase IgG antibody titers (1:1800), methotrexate was started at 18 months. After 8 months of combined therapy, antibody titers were negative and significant improvement in motor function was observed using the Gross Motor Function Measure 88. Patient 2, a 7-year-old female from Bogota, Colombia, was diagnosed with early-onset Pompe disease at 12 months and initiated enzyme replacement therapy. At 5 years of age, she experienced frequent falls and grip strength alterations. Functional tests revealed motor development delay, generalized hypotonia, and positive anti-recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase IgG antibody titers (6400). Methotrexate was initiated, leading to a reduction in falls and antibody titers (3200) after 6 months, with no adverse events or complications. Motor function improvement was assessed using the Motor Function Measurement 32. The presented cases highlight the importance of monitoring patients for anti-recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase antibody development during enzyme replacement therapy and the potential benefit of methotrexate as an immunomodulatory agent in early-onset Pompe disease. Early diagnosis and timely initiation of enzyme replacement therapy, combined with prophylactic immune tolerance induction, may improve clinical outcomes and reduce the development of anti-recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase antibodies. The cases also highlight the importance of objective motor function assessment tools, such as Gross Motor Function Measure 88 and Motor Function Measurement 32, in assessing treatment response. Further research is needed to optimize treatment regimens, monitor long-term effects, and address the current limitations of enzyme replacement therapy in Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) constitute a group of metabolic disorders characterized by the accumulation of substrates within lysosomes. For their treatment, disease-specific enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is employed. In cases of hypersensitivity reactions that may occur during these treatments, desensitization of enzyme therapy becomes necessary. Repeated desensitization procedures may result some degree of tolerance. This study presents cases of patients received abbreviated desensitization protocols following repeated desensitization procedures. During the period between September 2019 and January 2024, pediatric patients who experienced anaphylactic reactions to ERT and whose desensitization protocols were abbreviated after receiving uneventful treatment with desensitization for at least a year were included in the study. Six patients, four with Pompe disease, one with mucopolysaccharidosis type 2, and one with mucopolysaccharidosis type 4, had been receiving uninterrupted ERT by desensitization for at least 1 year. The mean age of the patients was 117.6 months (median: 104.5, IQR: 85.2-144). All patients experienced anaphylaxis as the initial reaction. Skin and intradermal tests were repeated on patients prior to protocol abbreviation. Premedication previously given to all patients was discontinued, and desensitization protocols were subsequently shortened by increasing the infusion rate and/or reducing the number of steps. The study investigated patients whose desensitization protocols were abbreviated. It demonstrated that some level of tolerance could be attained through repeated applications. This approach aims to identify concise, safe, and efficient protocols, thereby reducing hospitalizations, nosocomial infections, and treatment expenses."

This study aimed to evaluate the frequency and pattern of intracranial artery and brain parenchyma abnormalities in LOPD patients. Neuroimaging data from 30 Chinese adult LOPD patients were collected from our center. Seven patients (7/30) had acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed artery abnormalities in 23 patients (23/30). Dilative arteriopathy was found in 19 patients (19/30), with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia found in 17 patients and dilatation of the anterior circulation arteries found in 8 patients. The maximum diameter of the basilar artery was correlated with disease duration (p < 0.05). In addition, aneurysms (7/30) and fenestrations (3/30) were discovered. There were 14 patients with arterial stenosis (14/30), and both anterior and posterior circulation involvement occurred in 9 patients (9/14). Stenosis and dilative arteriopathy simultaneously occurred in 10 patients (10/30). White matter hyperintensities were present in 13 patients (13/28). Microbleeds, predominantly located in the cerebellum and brainstem, were detected in 7 patients (7/22) via susceptibility-weighted imaging. Intracranial vasculopathy involving both large arteries and small vessels is an important organ damage in LOPD patients. LOPD should be considered a key differential diagnosis in young adults with cryptogenic stroke, and a series of imaging evaluations of the brain and intracranial blood vessels is recommended as a routine workup in adult LOPD patients."

    "abstract": "People with rare lysosomal storage diseases face challenges in their care that arise from disease complexity and heterogeneity, compounded by many healthcare professionals being unfamiliar with these diseases. These challenges can result in long diagnostic journeys and inadequate care. Over 30 years ago, the Rare Disease Registries for Gaucher, Fabry, Mucopolysaccharidosis type I and Pompe diseases were established to address knowledge gaps in disease natural history, clinical manifestations of disease and treatment outcomes. Evidence generated from the real-world data collected in these registries supports multiple stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, drug developers, researchers and regulators. To maximise the impact of real-world evidence from these registries, engagement and collaboration with the patient communities is essential. To this end, the Rare Disease Registries Patient Council was established in 2019 as a partnership between the Rare Disease Registries and global and local patient advocacy groups to share perspectives on how registry data are used and disseminated. The Patient Council has resulted in a number of patient initiatives including patient representation at Rare Disease Registries advisory boards; development of plain language summaries of registry publications to increase availability of real-world evidence to patient communities; and implementation of digital innovations such as electronic patient-reported outcomes, and patient-facing registry reports and electronic consent (in development), all to enhance patient engagement. The Patient Council is building on the foundations of industry-patient advocacy group collaboration to fully integrate patient communities in decision-making and co-create solutions for the rare disease community."

    "abstract": "Genetic disorders pose great challenges for affected individuals and their families, as they must cope with the irreversible nature of the disease and a life-long dependence on medical assistance and treatment. Children and adolescents dealing with Pompe disease (PD) often struggle to keep up with their peers in physical activities. To gain valuable insights into their subjective experiences and better understand their perception and coping related to daily challenges linked to their condition and treatment, the use of standardized questionnaires is crucial. This study introduces the novel PompeQoL 1.0 questionnaire for children and adolescents with PD, designed for comprehensive assessment of both disease-specific FDH and HRQoL through self- and proxy reports. Content validity was ensured through patients' and parents' involvement at the initial stages of development and in subsequent cognitive debriefing process. Participants found the questionnaire easy to understand, answerable, relevant, and comprehensive. Adjustments based on feedback from patients and their parents improved its utility as a patient- and observer-reported outcome measure. After careful item examination, 52 items were selected, demonstrating moderate to excellent test-retest reliability for most scales and initial evidence for satisfactory construct validity. The PompeQoL questionnaire stands as a valuable screening instrument for both clinical and research purposes. Future research should prioritize additional revisions and larger validation studies, focusing on testing the questionnaire in clinical practice and trials. Nevertheless, the PompeQoL 1.0 stands out as the first standardized measure providing insights into disease-specific FDH and HRQoL among children and adolescents with various forms of PD."

We analyzed hospital admissions associated with the administration of Myozyme®, utilizing the French hospital discharge database, known in France as the Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information (PMSI), which comprehensively captures all hospital activity within the country. In this observational study, we examined hospitalization records from April 4, 2012, to December 31, 2019, within the PMSI database, focusing on admissions where Myozyme® was administered. We particularly investigated the incidence of critical care admissions and adverse events (AEs) related to Myozyme®. From 2012 to 2019, approximately 26,714 hospital stays involving Myozyme® administration were recorded for 239 patients. Most (96.6%) of these were outpatient stays, with only 3.2% in critical care. Furthermore, hospitalizations without critical care needs increased from 96% in 2012 to 99% in 2019. Of the patients receiving at least one infusion, 997 critical care admissions were recorded, with 781 (78.3%) occurring concurrent with or the day after the Myozyme® treatment without directly correlating to adverse effects of enzyme therapy. The analysis of the French hospital discharge database indicated that Myozyme® was associated with a low incidence of AEs and complications in a hospital context, supporting the consideration of its safe use in home-infusion settings."

We aimed to characterize the clinical features and related genetic variants in a series of Mexican patients. We performed a retrospective study of clinical records of patients diagnosed with LOPD, IOPD or pseudodeficiency. Twenty-nine patients were included in the study, comprising these three forms. Overall, age of symptom onset was 0.1 to 43 years old. The most frequent variant identified was c.-32-13T>G, which was detected in 14 alleles. Among the 23 different variants identified in the GAA gene, 14 were classified as pathogenic, 5 were likely pathogenic, and 1 was a variant of uncertain significance. Two variants were inherited in cis arrangement and 2 were pseudodeficiency-related benign alleles. We identified two novel variants (c.1615 G>A and c.1076-20_1076-4delAAGTCGGCGTTGGCCTG). To the best of our knowledge, this series represent the largest phenotypic and genotypic characterization of patients with PD in Mexico. Patients within our series exhibited a combination of LOPD and IOPD associated variants, which may be related to genetic diversity within Mexican population. Further population-wide studies are required to better characterize the incidence of this disease in Mexican population."

Up to 96% adenine deamination of target variants was observed, with minimal editing across >50 off-target sites. Post-base editing, expressed GAA protein was up to 0.66-fold normal (unaffected fibroblasts), an improvement over affected fibroblasts wherein GAA was undetectable. GAA enzyme activity was between 81.91 ± 13.51 and 129.98 ± 9.33 units/mg protein at 28 days post-transfection, which falls within the normal range (50-200 units/mg protein). LAMP2 protein was significantly decreased in the most robustly edited cell line, IOPD-3, indicating reduced lysosomal burden.

    "abstract": "Pulmonologists may be involved in managing pulmonary diseases in children with complex clinical pictures without a diagnosis. Moreover, they are routinely involved in the multidisciplinary care of children with rare diseases, at baseline and during follow-up, for lung function monitoring. Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of genetic diseases characterised by a specific lysosomal enzyme deficiency. Despite varying pathogen and organ involvement, they are linked by the pathological accumulation of exceeding substrates, leading to cellular toxicity and subsequent organ damage. Less severe forms of LSDs can manifest during childhood or later in life, sometimes being underdiagnosed. Respiratory impairment may stem from different pathogenetic mechanisms, depending on substrate storage in bones, with skeletal deformity and restrictive pattern, in bronchi, with obstructive pattern, in lung interstitium, with altered alveolar gas exchange, and in muscles, with hypotonia. This narrative review aims to outline different pulmonary clinical findings and a diagnostic approach based on key elements for differential diagnosis in some treatable LSDs like Gaucher disease, Acid Sphingomyelinase deficiency, Pompe disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis. Alongside their respiratory clinical aspects, which might overlap, we will describe radiological findings, lung functional patterns and associated symptoms to guide pediatric pulmonologists in differential diagnosis. The second part of the paper will address follow-up and management specifics. Recent evidence suggests that new therapeutic strategies play a substantial role in preventing lung involvement in early-treated patients and enhancing lung function and radiological signs in others. Timely diagnosis, driven by clinical suspicion and diagnostic workup, can help in treating LSDs effectively."

Analysis of liver pathology revealed that risk for liver failure cannot be predicted from liver biopsy findings alone in individuals affected by GSD IV. Moreover, analysis of postmortem liver pathology from an individual who died over 40 years after being diagnosed with nonprogressive hepatic GSD IV in childhood verified that liver fibrosis did not regress. Last, characterization of the liver involvement in a mouse model known to recapitulate the adult-onset neurodegenerative form of GSD IV (Gbe1ys/ys mouse model) demonstrated hepatic disease.ConclusionOur findings challenge the established subtype-based view of GSD IV and suggest that liver disease severity among patients with GSD IV represents a disease continuum.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT02683512FundingNone."

    "abstract": "The induction of immunological tolerance is a promising strategy for managing autoimmune diseases, allergies, and transplant rejection. Tregitopes, a class of peptides, have emerged as potential agents for this purpose. They activate regulatory T cells, which are pivotal in reducing inflammation and promoting tolerance, by binding to MHC II molecules and facilitating their processing and presentation to Treg cells, thereby encouraging their proliferation. Moreover, Tregitopes influence the phenotype of antigen-presenting cells by attenuating the expression of CD80, CD86, and MHC class II while enhancing ILT3, resulting in the inhibition of NF-kappa B signaling pathways. Various techniques, including in vitro and in silico methods, are applied to identify Tregitope candidates. Currently, Tregitopes play a vital role in balancing immune activation and tolerance in clinical applications such as Pompe disease, diabetes-related antigens, and the prevention of spontaneous abortions in autoimmune diseases. Similarly, Tregitopes can induce antigen-specific regulatory T cells. Their anti-inflammatory effects are significant in conditions such as autoimmune encephalomyelitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Additionally, Tregitopes have been leveraged to enhance vaccine design and efficacy. Recent advancements in understanding the potential benefits and drawbacks of IVIG and the discovery of the function and mechanism of Tregitopes have introduced Tregitopes as a popular option for immune system modulation. It is expected that they will bring about a significant revolution in the management and treatment of autoimmune and immunological diseases. This article is a comprehensive review of Tregitopes, concluding with the potential of these epitopes as a therapeutic avenue for immunological disorders."

Previous Pompe Registry (NCT00231400) analyses for ≤ 5 years' alglucosidase alfa treatment showed a single linear time trend of stable forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted. To assess longer term Pompe Registry data, piecewise linear mixed model regression analyses estimated FVC% predicted trajectories in invasive-ventilator-free patients with LOPD aged ≥ 5 years. We estimated annual FVC change 0-6 months, > 6 months-5 years, and > 5-13 years from treatment initiation, adjusting for baseline age, sex, and non-invasive ventilation. Among 485 patients (4612 FVC measurements; 8.3 years median follow-up), median ages at symptom onset, diagnosis, and alglucosidase alfa initiation were 34.3, 41.1, and 44.9 years, respectively. FVC% increased during the first 6 months' treatment (slope 1.83%/year; 95% confidence interval: 0.66, 3.01; P = 0.0023), then modestly declined -0.54%/year (-0.79, -0.30; P < 0.0001) during > 6 months-5 years, and -1.00%/year (-1.36, -0.63; P < 0.0001) during > 5-13 years. The latter two periods' slopes were not significantly different from each other (P<sub>difference</sub> = 0.0654) and were less steep than published natural history slopes (-1% to -4.6%/year). Estimated individual slopes were ≥ 0%/year in 96.1%, 30.3%, and 13.2% of patients during the 0-6 month, > 6 month-5 year, and > 5-13 year periods, respectively. These real-world data indicate an alglucosidase alfa benefit on FVC trajectory that persists at least 13 years compared with published natural history data. Nevertheless, unmet need remains since most individuals demonstrate lung function decline 5 years after initiating treatment. Whether altered FVC trajectory impacts respiratory failure incidence remains undetermined.

The European Pompe Consortium (EPOC) updates and extends the scope of the 2017 recommendations for starting, switching and stopping ERT. The European Pompe Consortium consists of 25 neuromuscular and metabolic experts from eight European countries. This update was performed after an in-person meeting, three rounds of discussion and voting to provide a consensus recommendation. The patient should be symptomatic, that is, should have skeletal muscle weakness or respiratory muscle involvement. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging findings showing substantial fat replacement can support the decision to start in a patient-by-patient scenario. Limited evidence supports switching ERT if there is no indication that skeletal muscle and/or respiratory function have stabilized or improved during standard ERT of 12 months or after severe infusion-associated reactions. Switching of ERT should be discussed on a patient-by-patient shared-decision basis. If there are severe, unmanageable infusion-associated reactions and no stabilization in skeletal muscle function during the first 2 years after starting or switching treatment, stopping ERT should be considered. After stopping ERT for inefficacy, restarting ERT can be considered. Six-monthly European Pompe Consortium muscle function assessments are recommended. The triple-S criteria on ERT start, switch and stop include muscle magnetic resonance imaging as a supportive finding and the potential option of home infusion therapy. Six-monthly long-term monitoring of muscle function is highly recommended to cover insights into the patient's trajectory under ERT."

The system operates as a critical cellular pro-survival mechanism in response to nutrient deprivation and a variety of stress conditions. On top of that, autophagy is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis through selective elimination of worn-out or damaged proteins and organelles. The autophagic pathway is largely responsible for the delivery of cytosolic glycogen to the lysosome where it is degraded to glucose via acid α-glucosidase. Although the physiological role of lysosomal glycogenolysis is not fully understood, its significance is highlighted by the manifestations of Pompe disease, which is caused by a deficiency of this lysosomal enzyme. Pompe disease is a severe lysosomal glycogen storage disorder that affects skeletal and cardiac muscles most. In this review, we discuss the basics of autophagy and describe its involvement in the pathogenesis of muscle damage in Pompe disease. Finally, we outline how autophagic pathology in the diseased muscles can be used as a tool to fast track the efficacy of therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "We thank Dr. Weimer and her colleagues for their comments related to our recent work (Anding et al., 2023) and are grateful for the opportunity to further discuss the importance of efficient lysosomal targeting of enzyme-replacement therapies (ERT) for the treatment of Pompe disease. Patients with Pompe disease have mutations in the gene that encodes for acid <i>α</i> glucosidase (GAA), a lysosomal enzyme necessary for the breakdown of glycogen. The first-generation ERT, alglucosidase alfa, provides a lifesaving therapy for the severe form of the disease (infantile onset Pompe disease) and improves or stabilizes respiratory and motor function in patients with less severe disease (late onset Pompe disease). Despite these gains, significant unmet need remains, particularly in patients who display respiratory and motor decline following years of treatment. Poor tissue uptake and lysosomal targeting via inefficient binding of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor (CIMPR) in skeletal muscle contributed to this suboptimal treatment response, prompting the development of new ERTs with increased levels of M6P."

    "abstract": "Newborn screening (NBS) for lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) is becoming an increasing concern in public health. However, the birth prevalence of these disorders is rarely reported in the Chinese population, and subclinical forms of diseases among patients identified by NBS have not been evaluated. To evaluate the birth prevalence of the 6 LSDs in the Shanghai population and determine subclinical forms based on clinical, biochemical, and genetic characteristics. This cohort study included 50 108 newborns recruited from 41 hospitals in Shanghai between January and December 2021 who were screened for 6 LSDs using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Participants with screen-positive results underwent molecular and biochemical tests and clinical assessments. Data were analyzed from January 2021 through October 2022. All participants were screened for Gaucher, acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), Krabbe, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, Fabry, and Pompe diseases using dried blood spots. Primary outcomes were the birth prevalence and subclinical forms of the 6 LSDs in the Shanghai population. Disease biomarker measurements, genetic testing, and clinical analysis were used to assess clinical forms of LSDs screened. Among 50 108 newborns (26 036 male [52.0%]; mean [SD] gestational age, 38.8 [1.6] weeks), the mean (SD) birth weight was 3257 (487) g. The MS/MS-based NBS identified 353 newborns who were positive. Of these, 27 newborns (7.7%) were diagnosed with 1 of 6 LSDs screened, including 2 newborns with Gaucher, 5 newborns with ASMD, 9 newborns with Krabbe, 8 newborns with Fabry, and 3 newborns with Pompe disease. The combined birth prevalence of LSDs in Shanghai was 1 diagnosis in 1856 live births, with Krabbe disease the most common (1 diagnosis/5568 live births), followed by Fabry disease (1 diagnosis/6264 live births), and ASMD (1 diagnosis/10 022 live births). Biochemical, molecular, and clinical analysis showed that early-onset clinical forms accounted for 3 newborns with positive results (11.1%), while later-onset forms represented nearly 90% of diagnoses (24 newborns [88.9%]). In this study, the combined birth prevalence of the 6 LSDs in Shanghai was remarkably high. MS/MS-based newborn screening, combined with biochemical and molecular genetic analysis, successfully identified and characterized newborns who were screen-positive, which may assist with parental counseling and management decisions."

    "abstract": "Empagliflozin has been successfully repurposed for treating neutropenia and neutrophil dysfunction in patients with glycogen storage disease type 1b (GSD 1b), however, data in infants are missing. We report on efficacy and safety of empagliflozin in infants with GSD 1b. This is an international retrospective case series on 21 GSD 1b infants treated with empagliflozin (total treatment time 20.6 years). Before starting empagliflozin (at a median age of 8.1 months with a median dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day) 12 patients had clinical signs and symptoms of neutrophil dysfunction. Six of these previously symptomatic patients had no further neutropenia/neutrophil dysfunction-associated findings on empagliflozin. Eight patients had no signs and symptoms of neutropenia/neutrophil dysfunction before start and during empagliflozin treatment. One previously asymptomatic individual with a horseshoe kidney developed a central line infection with pyelonephritis and urosepsis during empagliflozin treatment. Of the 10 patients who were treated with G-CSF before starting empagliflozin, this was stopped in four and decreased in another four. Eleven individuals were never treated with G-CSF. While in 17 patients glucose homeostasis remained stable on empagliflozin, four showed glucose homeostasis instability in the introductory phase. In 17 patients, no other side effects were reported, while genital (n = 2) or oral (n = 1) candidiasis and skin infection (n = 1) were reported in the remaining four. Empagliflozin had a good effect on neutropenia/neutrophil dysfunction-related signs and symptoms and a favourable safety profile in infants with GSD 1b and therefore qualifies for further exploration as first line treatment."

    "title": "Optimizing treatment outcomes: immune tolerance induction in Pompe disease patients undergoing enzyme replacement therapy.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease, a lysosomal storage disorder, is characterized by acid α-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency and categorized into two main subtypes: infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). The primary treatment, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA), faces challenges due to immunogenic responses, including the production of anti-drug antibody (ADA), which can diminish therapeutic efficacy. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of immune tolerance induction (ITI) therapy in cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM)-positive Pompe disease patients with established high ADA levels. In a single-center, open-label prospective study, we assessed ITI therapy's efficacy in Pompe disease patients, both IOPD and LOPD, with persistently elevated ADA titers (≥1:12,800) and clinical decline. The ITI regimen comprised bortezomib, rituximab, methotrexate, and intravenous immunoglobulin. Biochemical data, biomarkers, ADA titers, immune status, and respiratory and motor function were monitored over six months before and after ITI. This study enrolled eight patients (5 IOPD and 3 LOPD). After a 6-month ITI course, median ADA titers significantly decreased from 1:12,800 (range 1:12,800-1:51,200) to 1:1,600 (range 1:400-1:12,800), with sustained immune tolerance persisting up to 4.5 years in some cases. Serum CK levels were mostly stable or decreased, stable urinary glucose tetrasaccharide levels were maintained in four patients, and no notable deterioration in respiratory or ambulatory status was noted. Adverse events included two treatable infection episodes and transient symptoms like numbness and diarrhea. ITI therapy effectively reduces ADA levels in CRIM-positive Pompe disease patients with established high ADA titers, underscoring the importance of ADA monitoring and timely ITI initiation. The findings advocate for personalized immunogenicity risk assessments to enhance clinical outcomes. In some cases, prolonged immune suppression may be necessary, highlighting the need for further studies to optimize ITI strategies for Pompe disease treatment.

    "title": "Acid α-glucosidase (GAA) activity and glycogen content in muscle biopsy specimens of patients with Pompe disease: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of acid α-glucosidase (GAA), leading to the accumulation of glycogen in various tissues, especially in skeletal muscles. The disease manifests as a large spectrum of phenotypes from infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) to late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), depending on the age of symptoms onset. Quantifying GAA activity and glycogen content in skeletal muscle provides important information about the disease severity. However, the distribution of GAA and glycogen levels in skeletal muscles from healthy individuals and those impacted by Pompe disease remains poorly understood, and there is currently no universally accepted standard assay for GAA activity measurement. This systematic literature review aims to provide an overview of the available information on GAA activity and glycogen content levels in skeletal muscle biopsies from patients with Pompe disease. A structured review of PubMed and Google Scholar literature (with the latter used to check that no additional publications were identified) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications on glycogen storage disease type II [MeSH term] + GAA, protein human (supplementary concept), Pompe, muscle; and muscle, acid alpha-glucosidase. A limit of English language was applied. Results were grouped by methodologies used to quantify GAA activity and glycogen content in skeletal muscle. The search and selection strategy were devised and carried out in line with Preferred Reporting of Items in Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines and documented using a flowchart. Bibliographies of papers included in the analysis were reviewed and applicable publications not already identified in the search were included. Of the 158 articles retrieved, 24 (comprising >100 muscle biopsies from >100 patients) were included in the analysis, with four different assays. Analysis revealed that patients with IOPD exhibited markedly lower GAA activity in skeletal muscles than those with LOPD, regardless of the measurement method employed. Additionally, patients with IOPD had notably higher glycogen content levels in skeletal muscles than those with LOPD. In general, however, it was difficult to fully characterize GAA activity because of the different methods used. The findings underscore the challenges in the interpretation and comparison of the results across studies because of the substantial methodological variations. There is a need to establish standardized reference ranges of GAA activity and glycogen content in healthy individuals and in Pompe disease patients based on globally standardized methods to improve comparability and reliability in assessing this rare disease."

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) patients may still need ventilation support at some point of their disease course, despite regular recombinant human alglucosidase alfa treatment. This suggest that other pathophysiological mechanisms than muscle fibre lesion can contribute to the respiratory failure process. We investigate through neurophysiology whether spinal phrenic motor neuron dysfunction could contribute to diaphragm weakness in LOPD patients. A group of symptomatic LOPD patients were prospectively studied in our centre from January 2022 to April 2023. We collected both demographic and clinical data, as well as neurophysiological parameters. Phrenic nerve conduction studies and needle EMG sampling of the diaphragm were perfomed. Eight treated LOPD patients (3 males, 37.5%) were investigated. Three patients (37.5%) with no respiratory involvement had normal phrenic nerve motor responses [median phrenic compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude of 0.49 mV; 1st-3rd interquartile range (IQR), 0.48-0.65]. Those with respiratory failure (under nocturnal non-invasive ventilation) had abnormal phrenic nerve motor responses (median phrenic CMAP amplitude of 0 mV; 1st-3rd IQR, 0-0.15), and were then investigated with EMG. Diaphragm needle EMG revealed both myopathic and neurogenic changes in 3 (60%) and myopathic potentials in 1 patient. In the last one, no motor unit potentials could be recruited. Our study provide new insights regarding respiratory mechanisms in LOPD, suggesting a contribution of spinal phrenic motor neuron dysfunction for diaphragm weakness. If confirmed in further studies, our results recommend the need of new drugs crossing the blood-brain barrier."

    "abstract": "Genetic testing can offer early diagnosis and subsequent treatment of rare neuromuscular diseases. Options for these tests could be improved by understanding the preferences of patients for the features of different genetic tests, especially features that increase information available to patients. We developed an online discrete-choice experiment using key attributes of currently available tests for Pompe disease with six test attributes: number of rare muscle diseases tested for with corresponding probability of diagnosis, treatment availability, time from testing to results, inclusion of secondary findings, necessity of a muscle biopsy, and average time until final diagnosis if the first test is negative. Respondents were presented a choice between two tests with different costs, with respondents randomly assigned to one of two costs. Data were analyzed using random-parameters logit. A total of 600 online respondents, aged 18 to 50 years, were recruited from the U.S. general population and included in the final analysis. Tests that targeted more diseases, required less time from testing to results, included information about unrelated health risks, and were linked to shorter time to the final diagnosis were preferred and associated with diseases with available treatment. Men placed relatively more importance than women on tests for diseases with available treatments. Most of the respondents would be more willing to get a genetic test that might return unrelated health information, with women exhibiting a statistically significant preference. While respondents were sensitive to cost, 30% of the sample assigned to the highest cost was willing to pay $500 for a test that could offer a diagnosis almost 2 years earlier. The results highlight the value people place on the information genetic tests can provide about their health, including faster diagnosis of rare, unexplained muscle weakness, but also the value of tests for multiple diseases, diseases without treatments, and incidental findings. An earlier time to diagnosis can provide faster access to treatment and an end to the diagnostic journey, which patients highly prefer."

Studies of patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) have used the 6-min walk distance (6MWD) as an endpoint to assess motor function. However, an MCID for 6MWD (% predicted and meters) has yet to be established in LOPD. The objective of the study was to derive 6MWD MCID (% predicted and meters) with different analysis methods and for subgroups of different disease severity for LOPD. Data from the PROPEL trial were used to calculate 6MWD MCID in the overall PROPEL population and subgroups of baseline severity as assessed by walking distance and body mass index (BMI), using anchor- and distribution-based approaches. The 6MWD MCIDs varied widely, depending on the method and subgroup, ranging from 2.27%-8.11% predicted for the overall LOPD population (23.7 m-57.2 m). For patients with baseline 6MWD < 150 m, MCIDs ranged from -0.74%-3.37% (-2.1 m-11.3 m). MCIDs increased with distance walked at baseline until a plateau was reached. For BMI subgroups, the MCIDs were generally lowest in obese patients. Our analysis shows that MCID depends on the chosen method and disease severity. The findings suggest that applying a single MCID to all patients can be misleading; consequently, a range of possible MCIDs should be considered. This may also be highly relevant for other neuromuscular diseases. This study provides a range of 6MWD MCIDs for LOPD, with lower MCIDs for more severe patients."

Enzyme replacement therapy has been shown to be effective, but long-term treatment results vary. Avalglucosidase alfa demonstrated non-inferiority to alglucosidase alfa in a phase 3 study, allowing in France compassionate access for advanced LOPD patients unresponsive to alglucosidase alfa. Data from the French Pompe registry were analyzed for patients who benefited from a switch to avalglucosidase alfa with at least 1 year of follow-up. Respiratory (forced vital capacity [FVC]) and motor functions (Six-Minute Walk Test [6MWT]) were assessed before and 1 year after switching. Individual changes in FVC and 6MWT were expressed as slopes and statistical analyses were performed to compare values. Twenty-nine patients were included (mean age 56 years, 11 years of prior treatment). The FVC and 6MWT values remained stable. The individual analyses showed a stabilization of motor worsening: -1 m/year on the 6MWT after the switch versus -63 m/year the year before the switch (i.e., a worsening of 33%/year before vs. an improvement of 3%/year later). Respiratory data were not statistically different. At the group level, gait parameters improved slightly with a stabilization of previous worsening, but respiratory parameters showed limited changes. At the individual level, results were discordant, with some patients with a good motor or respiratory response and some with further worsening. Switching to avalglucosidase alfa demonstrated varied responses in advanced LOPD patients with failing alglucosidase alfa therapy, with a general improvement in motor stabilization."

We included 19 classic infantile Pompe patients (median age last assessment 8.9 years, range 1.5-22.5 years; 5/19 CRIM negative), treated with ERT. Using MR imaging of the brain (T1, T2, and FLAIR acquisitions), we classified progression of brain abnormalities on a 12-point rating scale at multiple time points throughout follow-up. Additionally we noted specific white matter patterns and examined atrophy. Cognitive development was studied using Wechsler IQ assessments obtained by certified neuropsychologists. The association between age and cognitive functioning, and MRI ratings and cognitive functioning was assessed by linear regression models. All but one patient developed brain abnormalities. The abnormalities progressed in a similar pattern throughout the brain, with early involvement of periventricular white matter, later followed by subcortical white matter, gray matter structures, and juxtacortical U-fibers. We found a significant decline (p < 0.01), with increasing age for full scale IQ, performance IQ and processing speed, but not for verbal IQ (p = 0.17). Each point increment in the 12-point MRI rating scale was associated with a significant decline (3.1-6.0 points) in all the IQ index scores (p < 0.05). The majority of long-term surviving patients in our cohort develop incremental brain MRI abnormalities and decline in cognitive functioning. This highlights the need for new therapies that can cross the blood-brain barrier in order to treat this CNS phenotype."

Anti-AAV neutralizing Abs (NAbs) titer is usually measured by in vitro assay and used for patient enroll; however, this assay could not evaluate NAbs' impacts on AAV pharmacology and potential harm in vivo. Here, we infused a mouse anti-AAV9 monoclonal antibody into Balb/C mice 2 h before receiving 1.2 × 10<sup>14</sup> or 3 × 10<sup>13</sup> vg/kg of rAAV9-coGAA by tail vein, a drug for our ongoing clinical trials for Pompe disease. The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and cellular responses combined with in vitro NAb assay validated the different impacts of preexisting NAbs at different levels in vivo. Sustained GAA expression in the heart, liver, diaphragm, and quadriceps were observed. The presence of high-level NAb, a titer about 1:1000, accelerated vector clearance in blood and completely blocked transduction. The AAV-specific T cell responses tended to increase when the titer of NAb exceeded 1:200. A low-level NAbs, near 1:100, had no effect on transduction in the heart and liver as well as cellular responses, but decreased transduction in muscles slightly. Therefore, we propose to preclude patients with NAb titers > 1:100 from rAAV9-coGAA clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Autophagy was initially recognized as a bulk degradation process that randomly sequesters and degrades cytoplasmic material in lysosomes (vacuoles in yeast). In recent years, various types of selective autophagy have been discovered. Glycophagy, the selective autophagy of glycogen granules, is one of them. While autophagy of glycogen is an important contributor to Pompe disease, which is characterized by the lysosomal accumulation of glycogen, its selectivity is still a matter of debate. Here, we developed the <i>Komagataella phaffii</i> yeast as a simple model of glycogen autophagy under nitrogen starvation conditions to address the question of its selectivity. For this, we turned the self-glucosylating initiator of glycogen synthesis, Glg1, which is covalently bound to glycogen, into the Glg1-GFP autophagic reporter. Our results revealed that vacuolar delivery of Glg1-GFP and its processing to free GFP were strictly dependent on autophagic machinery and vacuolar proteolysis. Notably, this process was independent of Atg11, the scaffold protein common for many selective autophagy pathways. Importantly, the non-mutated Glg1-GFP (which synthesizes and marks glycogen) and mutated Glg1<sup>Y212F</sup>-GFP (which does not synthesize glycogen and is degraded by non-selective autophagy as cytosolic Pgk1-GFP) were equally well delivered to the vacuole and had similar levels of released GFP. Therefore, we concluded that glycogen autophagy is a non-selective process in <i>K. phaffii</i> yeast under nitrogen starvation conditions."

    "abstract": "High sustained anti-rhGAA antibody titers (HSAT; ≥12,800) are directly linked to reduced efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and subsequent clinical deterioration in infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD). We have previously demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of a bortezomib-based immune-tolerance induction (ITI) regimen (bortezomib, rituximab, methotrexate, and IVIG) in eliminating HSAT. Here, we describe two IOPD cases (patients 6 and 8) who developed HSAT at 8 and 10 weeks on ERT despite transient low-dose methotrexate ITI administration in the ERT-naïve setting and were treated with a bortezomib-based ITI regimen, and we compare their courses to a series of six historical patients (patients 1-5, and 7) with a similar presentation who exemplify our evolving approach to treatment. In total, patients 6 and 8 received 16 and 8 doses of bortezomib (4 doses=1 cycle) respectively reducing titers from 25,600 to seronegative, but differences in the course of their therapy were instructive regarding the optimal approach to initial treatment of HSAT; specifically, patient 6 was treated initially with only a single course of bortezomib rescue therapy, while patient 8 received two back-to-back courses. Patient 8 received IVIG therapy throughout the immunosuppression whereas patient 6 received IVIG therapy and was switched to subcutaneous IgG replacement. Patient 6 had a transient reduction in anti-rhGAA antibodies, after receiving a single initial cycle of bortezomib, but had a recurrence of high anti-rhGAA antibody titer after 160 weeks that required 3 additional cycles of bortezomib to ultimately achieve tolerance. In contrast, patient 8 achieved tolerance after being given two consecutive cycles of bortezomib during their initial treatment and had B cell recovery by week 54. Since the reduction in anti-rhGAA antibodies, both patients are doing well clinically, and have decreasing ALT, AST, and CK. No major infections leading to interruption of treatment were observed in either patient. The bortezomib-based ITI was safe and well-tolerated, and patients continue to receive ERT at 40 mg/kg/week. These case studies and our previous experience suggest that to achieve an effective reduction of anti-rhGAA antibodies in the setting of HSAT, bortezomib should be initiated at the earliest sign of high anti-rhGAA antibodies with a minimum of two consecutive cycles as shown in the case of patient 8. It is important to note that, despite initiation of ERT at age 2.3 weeks, patient 8 quickly developed HSAT. We recommend close monitoring of anti-rhGAA antibodies and early intervention with ITI as soon as significantly elevated anti-rhGAA antibody titers are noted."

All three measures showed good test-retest reliability, with ICC values ranging from 0.85 to 0.87. The Gwet's AC values showed that four out of five dimensions of the 3L showed very good agreement. All hypothesized correlations between the 3L, 5L, SF-6Dv2, and items of WHODAS were supported, indicating satisfactory convergent validity. The 5L showed stronger correlations (|r|= 0.53-0.84) with WHODAS than the other two measures. The outcomes of ANOVA indicated that the 5L had higher F-statistics than the 3L and SF-6Dv2, indicating a stronger discriminant ability to differentiate most condition groups. The 5L demonstrates lower ceiling and floor effects, higher discriminant ability, and better convergent validity than the SF-6Dv2 and 3L in patients with PD. In addition, the 5L may generate a larger utility gain compared to the other two instruments when conducting cost-effectiveness analysis."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a progressive myopathy caused by the aberrant accumulation of glycogen in skeletal and cardiac muscle resulting from the deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Administration of recombinant human GAA as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) works well in alleviating the cardiac manifestations of PD but loses sustained benefit in ameliorating the skeletal muscle pathology. The limited efficacy of ERT in skeletal muscle is partially attributable to its inability to curb the accumulation of new glycogen produced by the muscle enzyme glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1). Substrate reduction therapies aimed at knocking down GYS1 expression represent a promising avenue to improve Pompe myopathy. However, finding specific inhibitors for GYS1 is challenging given the presence of the highly homologous GYS2 in the liver. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are chemically modified oligomers that hybridize to their complementary target RNA to induce their degradation with exquisite specificity. In the present study, we show that ASO-mediated Gys1 knockdown in the Gaa <sup>-/-</sup> mouse model of PD led to a robust reduction in glycogen accumulation in skeletal and cardiac muscle. In addition, combining Gys1 ASO with ERT further reduced glycogen content in muscle, eliminated autophagic buildup and lysosomal dysfunction, and improved motor function in Gaa <sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our results provide a strong foundation for further validation of the use of Gys1 ASO, alone or in combination with ERT, as a therapy for PD. We propose that early administration of Gys1 ASO in combination with ERT may be the key to preventative treatment options in PD."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a rare, progressive autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that directly impacts mitochondrial function, leading to structural abnormalities and potentially culminating in heart failure or cardiogenic shock. The clinical course and molecular mechanisms of the disease remain incompletely understood. We performed a retrospective analysis to examine the clinical manifestations, genetic traits, and the relationship between PD and mitochondrial function in a pediatric patient. This comprehensive evaluation included the use of ultrasound echocardiograms, computed tomography (CT) scans, electrocardiograms, mutagenesis analysis, and structural analysis to gain insights into the patient's condition and the underlying mechanisms of PD. For structural analysis and visualization, the structure of protein data bank ID 5KZX of human GAA was used, and VMD software was used for visualization and analysis. The study revealed that a 5-month-old male infant was admitted due to fever, with physical examination finding abnormal cardiopulmonary function and hepatomegaly. Laboratory tests and echocardiography confirmed heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Despite a week of treatment, which normalized body temperature and reduced pulmonary inflammation, cardiac abnormalities did not show significant improvement. Further genetic testing identified a homozygous mutation c.2662G>T (p.E888) in the GAA gene, leading to a diagnosis of Infantile-Onset Pompe Disease (IOPD). Although enzyme replacement therapy can significantly improve the quality of life for patients with PD, enhancing mitochondrial function may represent a new therapeutic strategy for treating PD."

We investigated the relation of thoracic fat and muscle with computed tomography (CT)-measured emphysema and bronchial wall thickening. Low-dose baseline chest CT scans from 1031 male lung cancer screening participants from one site were quantified for emphysema, bronchial wall thickening, subcutaneous fat, visceral fat and skeletal muscle. Body composition measurements were performed by segmenting the first slice above the aortic arch using Hounsfield unit thresholds with region growing and manual corrections. COPD presence and severity were evaluated with pre-bronchodilator spirometry testing. Participants had a median age of 61.5 years (58.6-65.6, 25th-75th percentile) and median number of 38.0 pack-years (28.0-49.5); 549 (53.2%) were current smokers. Overall, 396 (38.4%) had COPD (256 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 1, 140 GOLD 2-3). Participants with COPD had less subcutaneous fat, visceral fat and skeletal muscle (p<0.001 for all). With increasing GOLD stages, subcutaneous (p=0.005) and visceral fat values (p=0.004) were higher, and skeletal muscle was lower (p=0.004). With increasing severity of CT-derived emphysema, subcutaneous fat, visceral fat and skeletal muscle values were lower (p<0.001 for all). With increasing CT-derived bronchial wall thickness, subcutaneous and visceral fat values were higher (p<0.001 for both), without difference in skeletal muscle. All statistical relationships remained when adjusted for age, pack-years and smoking status. COPD presence and emphysema severity are associated with smaller amounts of thoracic fat and muscle, whereas bronchial wall thickening is associated with fat accumulation."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are predominantly enzyme deficiencies leading to substrate accumulation, causing progressive damage to multiple organs. To date, a crucial part of diagnosing LSDs is measuring enzymatic activity in leucocytes, plasma, or dried blood spots (DBS). Here, we present results from a proof-of-principle study, evaluating an innovative digital microfluidics (DMF) platform, referred to as SEEKER®, that can measure the activity of the following four lysosomal enzymes from DBS: α-L-iduronidase (IDUA) for mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I), acid α-glucosidase (GAA) for Pompe disease, β-glucosidase (GBA) for Gaucher disease, and α-galactosidase A (GLA) for Fabry disease. Over 900 DBS were analysed from newborns, children, and adults. DMF successfully detected known patients with MPS I, Pompe disease, and Gaucher disease, and known males with Fabry disease. This is the first demonstration of this multiplexed DMF platform for identification of patients with LSDs in a specialised diagnostic enzyme laboratory environment. We conclude that this DMF platform is relatively simple, high-throughput, and could be readily accommodated into a specialised laboratory as a first-tier test for MPS I, Pompe disease, and Gaucher disease for all patients, and Fabry disease for male patients only."

Rarely, patients may present with a hypercapnic respiratory failure (with minimal motor signs) unmasking an underlying disease. There are hardly any studies which have addressed the spectrum and challenges involved in management of this subset, especially in the real-world scenario. A retrospective study comprising consecutive patients hospitalized with hypercapnic respiratory failure as the sole/dominant manifestation. The clinical-electrophysiological spectrum, phrenic conductions, diaphragm thickness, and outcomes were analyzed. Twenty-seven patients were included, the mean age was 47.29 (SD 15.22) years, and the median duration of respiratory symptoms was 2 months (interquartile range [IQR] 1-4). Orthopnea was present in 23 patients (85.2%) and encephalopathy in 8 patients (29.6%). Phrenic nerve latencies and amplitudes were abnormal in 83.3% and 95.6%, respectively. Abnormal diaphragm thickness was noted in 78.5%. Based on a comprehensive electrophysiological strategy and paraclinical tests, an etiology was established in all. Reversible etiologies were identified in 17 patients (62.9%). These included myasthenia gravis (anti-AChR and MuSK), inflammatory myopathy, riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy, Pompe disease, bilateral phrenic neuritis, and thyrotoxicosis. Respiratory onset motor neuron disease was diagnosed in 8 patients (29.6%). Despite diaphragmatic involvement, a functional respiratory recovery was noted at discharge (45%) and last follow-up (60%). Predictors for good outcomes included female sex, normal nerve conductions, and recent-onset respiratory symptoms. A good functional recovery was noted in most of the patients including respiratory onset motor neuron disease. A systematic algorithmic approach helps in proper triaging, early diagnosis, and treatment.

We sought to review the latest available evidence on the safety and efficacy of recombinant human GAA enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for infantile-onset PD (IOPD). We systematically searched the MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Embase databases for prospective clinical studies evaluating ERT for IOPD on pre-specified outcomes. Meta-analysis was also performed. Of 1,722 articles identified, 16 were included, evaluating 316 patients. Studies were heterogeneous and with very low certainty of evidence for most outcomes. A moderate/high risk of bias was present for most included articles. The following outcomes showed improvements associated with alglucosidase alfa, over natural history of PD/placebo, for a mean follow-up of 48.3 months: left ventricular (LV) mass {mean change 131.3 g/m<sup>2</sup> [95% confidence interval (CI) 81.02, 181.59]}, time to start ventilation (TSV) [HR 0.21 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.36)], and survival [HR 0.10 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.19)]. There were no differences between the pre- and post-ERT period for myocardial function and psychomotor development. Adverse events (AEs) after ERT were mild in most cases. Our data suggest that alglucosidase alfa potentially improves LV mass, TSV, and survival in IOPD patients, with no important safety issues. PROSPERO identifier (CRD42019123700)."

Outcomes include 6-min walk distance (6MWD), forced vital capacity (FVC), creatine kinase (CK) and hexose tetrasaccharide (Hex4) levels, patient-reported outcomes and safety. Data are reported as change from PROPEL baseline to OLE week 52 (104 weeks post-PROPEL baseline). Of 118 patients treated in the OLE, 81 continued cipa + mig treatment from PROPEL (cipa + mig group; 61 enzyme replacement therapy [ERT] experienced prior to PROPEL; 20 ERT naïve) and 37 switched from alg + pbo to cipa + mig (switch group; 29 ERT experienced; 8 ERT naive). Mean (standard deviation [SD]) change in % predicted 6MWD from baseline to week 104 was + 3.1 (8.1) for cipa + mig and - 0.5 (7.8) for the ERT-experienced switch group, and + 8.6 (8.6) for cipa + mig and + 8.9 (11.7) for the ERT-naïve switch group. Mean (SD) change in % predicted FVC was - 0.6 (7.5) for cipa + mig and - 3.8 (6.2) for the ERT-experienced switch group, and - 4.8 (6.5) and - 3.1 (6.7), respectively, in ERT-naïve patients. CK and Hex4 levels improved in both treatment groups by week 104 with cipa + mig treatment. Three patients discontinued the OLE due to infusion-associated reactions. No new safety signals were identified. Cipa + mig treatment up to 104 weeks was associated with overall maintained improvements (6MWD, biomarkers) or stabilization (FVC) from baseline with continued durability, and was well tolerated, supporting long-term benefits for patients with LOPD.Trial registration number: NCT04138277; trial start date: December 18, 2019."

This study aimed to estimate the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for an improvement in forced vital capacity in the upright seated position (FVC<sub>up</sub>) and the 6-min walk test (6MWT) after a year of treatment with enzyme replacement therapy. Data were obtained from two prospective follow-up studies. Between-group and within-group MCIDs were estimated using anchor-based methods. Additionally, a distribution-based method was used to generate supportive evidence. As anchors, self-reported change in health and in physical functioning, shortness of breath and a categorization of the Short-Form 36 Physical Component Summary score were used. Anchor appropriateness was assessed using Spearman correlations (absolute values ≥0.29) and a sufficient number of observations in each category. In all, 102 patients had at least one FVC<sub>up</sub> or 6MWT measurement during enzyme replacement therapy. Based on the anchors assessed as appropriate, the between-group MCID for an improvement in FVC<sub>up</sub> ranged from 2.47% to 4.83% points. For the 6MWT, it ranged from 0.35% to 7.47% points which is equivalent to a distance of 2.18-46.61 m and 1.97-42.13 m for, respectively, a man and a woman of age 50, height 1.75 m and weight 80 kg. The results of the distribution-based method were within these ranges when applied to change in the outcome values. The MCIDs for FVC<sub>up</sub> and 6MWT derived in this study can be used to interpret differences between and within groups of patients with Pompe disease in clinical trials and cohort studies."

In the Infantile-Onset PD (IOPD), death generally occurs <1 year of age. There is no cure for IOPD. Mouse models of PD do not completely reproduce human IOPD severity. Our main objective was to generate the first IOPD rat model to assess an innovative muscle-directed adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated gene therapy. PD rats were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The novel highly myotropic bioengineered capsid AAVMYO3 and an optimized muscle-specific promoter in conjunction with a transcriptional cis-regulatory element were used to achieve robust Gaa expression in the entire muscular system. Several metabolic, molecular, histopathological, and functional parameters were measured. PD rats showed early-onset widespread glycogen accumulation, hepato- and cardiomegaly, decreased body and tissue weight, severe impaired muscle function and decreased survival, closely resembling human IOPD. Treatment with AAVMYO3-Gaa vectors resulted in widespread expression of Gaa in muscle throughout the body, normalizing glycogen storage pathology, restoring muscle mass and strength, counteracting cardiomegaly and normalizing survival rate. This gene therapy holds great potential to treat glycogen metabolism alterations in IOPD. Moreover, the AAV-mediated approach may be exploited for other inherited muscle diseases, which also are limited by the inefficient widespread delivery of therapeutic transgenes throughout the muscular system."

    "abstract": "Lafora disease is a rare and fatal form of progressive myoclonic epilepsy with onset during early adolescence. The disease is caused by mutations in EPM2A, encoding laforin, or EPM2B, encoding malin. Both proteins have functions that affect glycogen metabolism, including glycogen dephosphorylation by laforin and ubiquitination of enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism by malin. Lack of function of laforin or malin results in the accumulation of polyglucosan that forms Lafora bodies in the central nervous system and other tissues. Enzyme replacement therapy through intravenous administration of alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme®) has shown beneficial effects removing polyglucosan aggregates in Pompe disease. We evaluated the effectiveness of intracerebroventricular administration of alglucosidase alfa in the Epm2a<sup>-/-</sup> knock-out and Epm2a<sup>R240X</sup> knock-in mouse models of Lafora disease. Seven days after a single intracerebroventricular injection of alglucosidase alfa in 12-month-old Epm2a<sup>-/-</sup> and Epm2a<sup>R240X</sup> mice, the number of Lafora bodies was not reduced. Additionally, a prolonged infusion of alglucosidase alfa for 2 or 4 weeks in 6- and 9-month-old Epm2a<sup>-/-</sup> mice did not result in a reduction in the number of LBs or the amount of glycogen in the brain. These findings hold particular significance in guiding a rational approach to the utilization of novel therapies in Lafora disease."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder that preferentially affects muscles, and it is caused by GAA mutation coding acid alpha-glucosidase in lysosome and glycophagy deficiency. While the initial pathology of Pompe disease is glycogen accumulation in lysosomes, the special role of the lysosomal pathway in glycogen degradation is not fully understood. Hence, we investigated the characteristics of accumulated glycogen and the mechanism underlying glycophagy disturbance in Pompe disease. Skeletal muscle specimens were obtained from the affected sites of patients and mouse models with Pompe disease. Histological analysis, immunoblot analysis, immunofluorescence assay, and lysosome isolation were utilized to analyze the characteristics of accumulated glycogen. Cell culture, lentiviral infection, and the CRISPR/Cas9 approach were utilized to investigate the regulation of glycophagy accumulation. We demonstrated residual glycogen, which was distinguishable from mature glycogen by exposed glycogenin and more α-amylase resistance, accumulated in the skeletal muscle of Pompe disease. Lysosome isolation revealed glycogen-free glycogenin in wild type mouse lysosomes and variously sized glycogenin in Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> mouse lysosomes. Our study identified that a defect in the degradation of glycogenin-exposed residual glycogen in lysosomes was the fundamental pathological mechanism of Pompe disease. Meanwhile, glycogenin-exposed residual glycogen was absent in other glycogen storage diseases caused by cytoplasmic glycogenolysis deficiencies. In vitro, the generation of residual glycogen resulted from cytoplasmic glycogenolysis. Notably, the inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase led to a reduction in glycogenin-exposed residual glycogen and glycophagy accumulations in cellular models of Pompe disease. Therefore, the lysosomal hydrolysis pathway played a crucial role in the degradation of residual glycogen into glycogenin, which took place in tandem with cytoplasmic glycogenolysis. These findings may offer a novel substrate reduction therapeutic strategy for Pompe disease. © 2024 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland."

Enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme/Lumizyme) has led to better outcomes, but many patients have plateaued or declined despite treatment. The second-generation ERT avalglucosidase alfa (Nexviazyme) was designed to have enhanced cellular uptake via the conjugation of additional bis-mannose-6-phosphate residues. There have been trials comparing the efficacy of alglucosidase and avalglucosidase, but there remains a need for more real-world data on patients who switched from alglucosidase to avalglucosidase. <b>Methods:</b> A chart review was conducted on <i>n</i> = 15 patients with late-onset Pompe disease followed at a single center who switched from alglucosidase to avalglucosidase and continued for at least 6 months. <b>Results:</b> A total of <i>n</i> = 8/15 patients received alglucosidase for more than 3 years prior to switching, and <i>n</i> = 7/15 received it for more than 5 years prior to switching. There were statistically significant improvements in CK, Hex4, and AST with mean differences of -104.8 U/L, -3.0 mmol/molCr, and -14.7 U/L, respectively, post-switch. 6-Minute Walk Test; comfortable gait speed; Gait, Stairs, Gower, Chair; and Quick Motor Function Test scores improved or stabilized in most patients post-switch (<i>n</i> = 8/12, <i>n</i> = 11/12, <i>n</i> = 9/12, <i>n</i> =7/11, respectively). Of <i>n</i> = 7 patients with pulmonary function testing, <i>n</i> = 4/7 had improved upright FVC. Patient-reported outcomes revealed improvements in dyspnea (<i>n</i> = 4/4), physical function (<i>n</i> = 3/4), fatigue (<i>n</i> = 2/3), and lower back pain (<i>n</i> = 3/3). Avalglucosidase was well tolerated without infusion-associated reactions, and all <i>n</i> = 7 patients on home infusions continued receiving ERT at home. Anti-drug antibodies were seen in <i>n</i> = 9/10 of patients on alglucosidase and <i>n</i> = 8/13 of those on avalglucosidase, with titers below 12,800 in a majority of patients. We also present the first outcome data for a patient with LOPD who is non-ambulatory and a full-time wheelchair user; she demonstrated meaningful improvements in quality of life and motor function with the switch. <b>Discussion:</b> In summary, improved outcomes were seen in most patients, with a subset whose decline persisted. This study presents evidence that switching from alglucosidase to avalglucosidase may be associated with improved outcomes in certain patients with LOPD."

We recently developed an optimized form of lentiviral gene therapy for Pompe disease in which a codon-optimized version of the GAA transgene (LV-GAAco) was fused to an insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) peptide (LV-IGF2.GAAco), to promote cellular uptake via the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate/IGF2 receptor. Lentiviral gene therapy with LV-IGF2.GAAco showed superior efficacy in heart, skeletal muscle, and brain of Gaa <sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to gene therapy with untagged LV-GAAco. Here, we used quantitative mass spectrometry using TMT labeling to analyze the muscle proteome and the response to gene therapy in Gaa <sup>-/-</sup> mice. We found that muscle of Gaa <sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed altered levels of proteins including those with functions in the CLEAR signaling pathway, autophagy, cytoplasmic glycogen metabolism, calcium homeostasis, redox signaling, mitochondrial function, fatty acid transport, muscle contraction, cytoskeletal organization, phagosome maturation, and inflammation. Gene therapy with LV-GAAco resulted in partial correction of the muscle proteome, while gene therapy with LV-IGF2.GAAco resulted in a near-complete restoration to wild type levels without inducing extra proteomic changes, supporting clinical development of lentiviral gene therapy for Pompe disease. SIGNIFICANCE: Lysosomal glycogen accumulation is the primary cause of Pompe disease, and leads to a cascade of pathological events in cardiac and skeletal muscle and in the central nervous system. In this study, we identified the proteomic changes that are caused by Pompe disease in skeletal muscle of a mouse model. We showed that lentiviral gene therapy with LV-IGF2.GAAco nearly completely corrects disease-associated proteomic changes. This study supports the future clinical development of lentiviral gene therapy with LV-IGF2.GAAco as a new treatment option for Pompe disease."

    "title": "Treatment recommendations for glycogen storage disease type IB- associated neutropenia and neutrophil dysfunction with empagliflozin: Consensus from an international workshop.",
    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSD Ib, biallelic variants in SLC37A4) is a rare disorder of glycogen metabolism complicated by neutropenia/neutrophil dysfunction. Since 2019, the SGLT2-inhibitor empagliflozin has provided a mechanism-based treatment option for the symptoms caused by neutropenia/neutrophil dysfunction (e.g. mucosal lesions, inflammatory bowel disease). Because of the rarity of GSD Ib, the published evidence on safety and efficacy of empagliflozin is still limited and does not allow to develop evidence-based guidelines. Here, an international group of experts provides 14 best practice consensus treatment recommendations based on expert practice and review of the published evidence. We recommend to start empagliflozin in all GSD Ib individuals with clinical or laboratory signs related to neutropenia/neutrophil dysfunction with a dose of 0.3-0.4 mg/kg/d given as a single dose in the morning. Treatment can be started in an outpatient setting. The dose should be adapted to the weight and in case of inadequate clinical treatment response or side effects. We strongly recommend to pause empagliflozin immediately in case of threatening dehydration and before planned longer surgeries. Discontinuation of G-CSF therapy should be attempted in all individuals. If available, 1,5-AG should be monitored. Individuals who have previously not tolerated starches should be encouraged to make a new attempt to introduce starch in their diet after initiation of empagliflozin treatment. We advise to monitor certain safety and efficacy parameters and recommend continuous, alternatively frequent glucose measurements during the introduction of empagliflozin. We provide specific recommendations for special circumstances like pregnancy and liver transplantation."

    "abstract": "This study includes over 11.6M newborns screened (NBS) for Pompe Disease (PD) from 29 distinct universal screening programs across 8 countries and 4 continents. The birth prevalence of PD is 1:18,711, with no evidence of difference across populations of European, Latin American, or Asian ancestry, though differences may exist for PD subtypes. This study also compares these results, based on direct detection of disease and analyzed using a binomial method along with power analysis, with other methods for estimating the 'frequency' of rare genetic diseases (such as utilizing Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium on allele frequency and confidence interval analysis). This comparison demonstrates the implications of sample size and frames a discussion on its influence on the reliability of results when extrapolating to a population beyond the study dataset. Primary: Establish a new figure for prevalence at birth for Pompe disease by collecting and analyzing the largest relevant dataset to date and using that result to project population prevalence at birth in a novel way. Secondary: Compare these results to previous analyses to offer a framework for evaluating 'frequency' data that can be applied to other rare, genetic diseases, along with methods to assess quality of estimates."

    "abstract": "Glycogenosis type II (GSDII) is a rare autosomal disorder that is caused by the deficiency of alpha-glucosidase, a lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyzes glycogen to glucose. Autophagy dysregulation plays a critical role. Importantly, since 2006, both patients with infantile (classic Pompe disease) and adult GSDII (late-onset Pompe disease or LOPD) have been treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). To support this use, several double-blind and observational studies including large cohorts of GSDII patients have been undertaken and have shown ERT to be effective in modifying the natural course of disease. Indeed, most LOPD cases improve in the first 20 months of treatment in a six-minute walk test (6MWT), while those who are untreated do not; instead, their response declines over time. The author reviews avalglucosidase alpha, a therapy approved by both the FDA and European regulatory agencies. Herein, the author considers the pathophysiological approaches such as the role of enzyme entry, autophagy, and the response to ERT treatment of motor and respiratory components. There has been a notable drive toward the research of various aspects of this disease regarding the role of new enzyme penetration and immune adverse events. Consequently, avalglucosidase alpha might be a further step forward."

We carried out detailed immunophenotyping of IOPD patients (n=40), including analysis of circulating cell populations by flow cytometry and plasma cytokines by multiplex array, to determine whether patients with HSAT have unique immunological characteristics compared to those with low titers (LT; <12,800). Compared to patients with LT, patients who develop HSAT were skewed toward a type 2 immune profile, with an increased frequency of Th2 cells that was positively correlated with levels of Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) and pro-inflammatory (IL-6, TNF-α, MIP-1α, MIP-1β) cytokines. B cells were increased in HSAT patients with a decreased fraction of unswitched memory B cells. Plasma GM-CSF concentrations were lower on average in HSAT patients, while CXCL11 was elevated. Finally, using principal components analysis, we derived an HSAT Signature Score that successfully stratified patients according to their antibody titers. The immune profiles revealed in this study not only identify potential biomarkers of patients that developed HSAT but also provide insights into the pathophysiology of HSAT that will ultimately lead to improved immunotherapy strategies."

    "abstract": "In the last two decades, the development of high-throughput diagnostic methods and the availability of effective treatments have increased the interest in newborn screening for lysosomal storage disorders. However, long-term follow-up experience is needed to clearly identify risks, benefits and challenges. We report our 8-year experience of screening and follow-up on about 250,000 neonates screened for four lysosomal storage diseases (Pompe disease, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, Fabry disease, Gaucher disease), using the enzyme activity assay by tandem mass spectrometry, and biomarker quantification as a second-tier test. Among the 126 positive newborns (0.051%), 51 infants were confirmed as affected (positive predictive value 40%), with an overall incidence of 1:4874. Of these, three patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease, two with neonatal-onset Gaucher disease and four with mucopolysaccharidosis type I were immediately treated. Furthermore, another four Gaucher disease patients needed treatment in the first years of life. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of newborn screening for lysosomal storage diseases. Early diagnosis and treatment allow the achievement of better patient outcomes. Challenges such as false-positive rates, the diagnosis of variants of uncertain significance or late-onset forms and the lack of treatment for neuronopathic forms, should be addressed."

    "abstract": "Glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1), the rate-limiting enzyme in muscle glycogen synthesis, plays a central role in energy homeostasis and has been proposed as a therapeutic target in multiple glycogen storage diseases. Despite decades of investigation, there are no known potent, selective small-molecule inhibitors of this enzyme. Here, we report the preclinical characterization of MZ-101, a small molecule that potently inhibits GYS1 in vitro and in vivo without inhibiting GYS2, a related isoform essential for synthesizing liver glycogen. Chronic treatment with MZ-101 depleted muscle glycogen and was well tolerated in mice. Pompe disease, a glycogen storage disease caused by mutations in acid α glucosidase (GAA), results in pathological accumulation of glycogen and consequent autophagolysosomal abnormalities, metabolic dysregulation, and muscle atrophy. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant GAA is the only approved treatment for Pompe disease, but it requires frequent infusions, and efficacy is limited by suboptimal skeletal muscle distribution. In a mouse model of Pompe disease, chronic oral administration of MZ-101 alone reduced glycogen buildup in skeletal muscle with comparable efficacy to ERT. In addition, treatment with MZ-101 in combination with ERT had an additive effect and could normalize muscle glycogen concentrations. Biochemical, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analyses of muscle tissue demonstrated that lowering of glycogen concentrations with MZ-101, alone or in combination with ERT, corrected the cellular pathology in this mouse model. These data suggest that substrate reduction therapy with GYS1 inhibition may be a promising therapeutic approach for Pompe disease and other glycogen storage diseases."

    "abstract": "Clinical trials for rare diseases often include multiple endpoints that capture the effects of treatment on different disease domains. In many rare diseases, the primary endpoint is not standardized across trials. The win ratio approach was designed to analyze multiple endpoints of interest in clinical trials and has mostly been applied in cardiovascular trials. Here, we applied the win ratio approach to data from COMET, a phase 3 trial in late-onset Pompe disease, to illustrate how this approach can be used to analyze multiple endpoints in the orphan drug context. All possible participant pairings from both arms of COMET were compared sequentially on changes at week 49 in upright forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted and six-minute walk test (6MWT). Each participant's response for the two endpoints was first classified as a meaningful improvement, no meaningful change, or a meaningful decline using thresholds based on published minimal clinically important differences (FVC ± 4% predicted, 6MWT ± 39 m). Each comparison assessed whether the outcome with avalglucosidase alfa (AVA) was better than (win), worse than (loss), or equivalent to (tie) the outcome with alglucosidase alfa (ALG). If tied on FVC, 6MWT was compared. In this approach, the treatment effect is the ratio of wins to losses (\"win ratio\"), with ties excluded. In the 2499 possible pairings (51 receiving AVA × 49 receiving ALG), the win ratio was 2.37 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-4.29, p = 0.005) when FVC was compared before 6MWT. When the order was reversed, the win ratio was 2.02 (95% CI, 1.13-3.62, p = 0.018). The win ratio approach can be used in clinical trials of rare diseases to provide meaningful insight on treatment benefits from multiple endpoints and across disease domains."

    "abstract": "Surveys and retrospective studies have revealed considerable delays in diagnosing late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) in China, where the contributing factors remain poorly represented. Our study analyzed the diagnostic journey of 34 LOPD patients seen at our neuromuscular clinic from 2005 to 2022. We defined diagnostic delay as the time from the onset of the first relevant symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of LOPD to the eventual diagnosis, and we constructed a correlation matrix to assess relationships among these variables. The cohort consisted of 34 patients with an equal male-to-female ratio, and the mean age at diagnosis was 27.68 ± 10.03 years. We found the median diagnostic delay to be 5 years, with a range of 0.3 to 20 years, with 97.1% having been misdiagnosed previously, most commonly with \"Type II Respiratory insufficiency\" (36.7%). Notably, patients at earlier onset (mean age, 18.19 years vs. 31 years; <i>p</i> < 0.005) tended to have higher creatine kinase (CK) levels. Furthermore, 92.6% reported difficulty in sitting up from a supine position since childhood. Our research emphasizes the role of early indicators like dyspnea and difficulty performing sit-ups in adolescents for timely LOPD diagnosis and treatment initiation. The importance of early high-risk screening using dried blood spot testing cannot be overstated."

While neuromuscular manifestations of IOPD are well-described, central nervous system (CNS) manifestations of this disorder are far less characterized. Here we describe severe CNS-related neurological manifestations including seizures and encephalopathy in six individuals with IOPD. We identified six children with IOPD who developed CNS manifestations such as seizures and/or encephalopathy. We studied their brain magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRIs) and graded the severity of white matter hyperintensities (WMHI) using the Fazekas scale scoring system as previously published. Longitudinal cognitive measures were available from 4/6 children. All six IOPD patients (4 males/2 females) had been treated with ERT for 12-15 years. Seizures and/or encephalopathy were noted at a median age at onset of 11.9 years (range 9-15 years). All were noted to have extensive WMHI in the brain MRIs and very high Fazekas scores which preceded the onset of neurological symptoms. Longitudinal IQ scores from four of these children suggested developmental plateauing. Among a subset of IOPD patients on long-term ERT, CNS manifestations including hyperreflexia, encephalopathy and seizures may become prominent, and there is likely an association between these symptoms and significant WMHI on MRI. Further study is needed to identify risk factors for CNS deterioration among children with IOPD and develop interventions to prevent neurological decline."

Here, we further characterize results from disease-specific and general patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Adults who participated in the COMET trial receiving avalglucosidase alfa or alglucosidase alfa (both 20 mg/kg biweekly) during the 49-week double-blind treatment period were included in the analysis. Proportions of patients exceeding meaningful change thresholds at Week 49 were compared post hoc between treatment groups. PROs and their meaningful change thresholds included: Pompe Disease Severity Scale (PDSS; decrease 1.0-1.5 points), Pompe Disease Impact Scale (PDIS; decrease 1.0-1.5 points), Rasch-built Pompe-specific Activity Scale (R-PAct; change from unable to able to complete activity), 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12; physical component summary [PCS] score: increase ≥6 points, mental component summary [MCS] score: increase ≥7 points), EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L; improvement of ≥1 category), and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC; any improvement). The analysis included 99 adult patients (avalglucosidase alfa n = 50; alglucosidase alfa n = 49). Patients who received avalglucosidase alfa had significantly greater odds of achieving a meaningful change versus alglucosidase alfa for the PDSS Shortness of Breath (OR [95% CI] 11.79 [2.24; 62.18]), Fatigue/Pain (6.24 [1.20; 32.54]), Morning Headache (13.98 [1.71; 114.18]), and Overall Fatigue (5.88 [1.37; 25.11]) domains, and were significantly more likely to meet meaningful change thresholds across multiple PDSS domains (all nominal p < 0.05). A numerically greater proportion of patients in the avalglucosidase alfa group were able to complete selected activities of the R-PAct compared with the alglucosidase alfa group. Significantly greater proportions of patients who received avalglucosidase alfa achieved meaningful improvements for EQ-5D-5L usual activities dimension, EQ visual analog scale, and all four PGIC domains. The proportion of patients with improvements in SF-12 PCS and MCS was greater in the avalglucosidase alfa group versus alglucosidase alfa group, but was not significant (p > 0.05). These analyses show that avalglucosidase alfa improves multiple symptoms and aspects of daily functioning, including breathing and mobility. This supports the clinical relevance of the effects of avalglucosidase alfa on HRQoL for patients with LOPD."

Liver-directed gene therapy has recently become an option for treatment of haemophilias and is likely to become one of the favoured therapeutic strategies for inherited metabolic liver diseases in the near future. In this review, we present the different gene therapy vectors and strategies for liver-targeting, including gene editing. We highlight the current development of viral and nonviral gene therapy for a number of inherited metabolic liver diseases including urea cycle defects, organic acidaemias, Crigler-Najjar disease, Wilson disease, glycogen storage disease Type Ia, phenylketonuria and maple syrup urine disease. We describe the main limitations and open questions for further gene therapy development: immunogenicity, inflammatory response, genotoxicity, gene therapy administration in a fibrotic liver. The follow-up of a constantly growing number of gene therapy treated patients allows better understanding of its benefits and limitations and provides strategies to design safer and more efficacious treatments. Undoubtedly, liver-targeting gene therapy offers a promising avenue for innovative therapies with an unprecedented potential to address the unmet needs of patients suffering from inherited metabolic diseases."

    "abstract": "Impaired extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is a hallmark of many chronic inflammatory disorders that can lead to cellular dysfunction, aging, and disease progression. The ECM of the aged heart and its effects on cardiac cells during chronological and pathological aging are poorly understood across species. For this purpose, we first used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to quantitatively characterize age-related remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) of mice and humans during chronological and pathological (Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS)) aging. Of the approximately 300 ECM and ECM-associated proteins quantified (named as Matrisome), we identified 13 proteins that were increased during aging, including lactadherin (MFGE8), collagen VI α6 (COL6A6), vitronectin (VTN) and immunoglobulin heavy constant mu (IGHM), whereas fibulin-5 (FBLN5) was decreased in most of the data sets analyzed. We show that lactadherin accumulates with age in large cardiac blood vessels and when immobilized, triggers phosphorylation of several phosphosites of GSK3B, MAPK isoforms 1, 3, and 14, and MTOR kinases in aortic endothelial cells (ECs). In addition, immobilized lactadherin increased the expression of pro-inflammatory markers associated with an aging phenotype. These results extend our knowledge of the LV proteome remodeling induced by chronological and pathological aging in different species (mouse and human). The lactadherin-triggered changes in the proteome and phosphoproteome of ECs suggest a straight link between ECM component remodeling and the aging process of ECs, which may provide an additional layer to prevent cardiac aging."

Despite an improved prognosis with treatment, the risk for early death due cardiorespiratory crisis remains. Parents not only face physical fatigue and family distress in coping with the child's special needs but also experience emotions, worries, and unexpressed needs (a \"humanistic burden\") that require supportive interventions. Fourteen parents of children with PD completed an online self-report questionnaire assessing their child's QoL, their own parental burden of care, and disease-related issues. The aim was to estimate the associations between the child's QoL and the caregiver's burden levels. Three mothers were also interviewed. A total of 57.1% of parents lived with moderate/severe burden conditions; worse QoL for the child was associated with higher levels of caregiver burden (<i>r</i><sub>S</sub>[<i>N</i> = 14] = -0.67, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Uncertainty about the child's future was a state commonly described by mothers. However, the child's resilience, normalization of disease, and coping strategies (primarily positive appraisal and focusing on the present) alleviated suffering and helped mothers maintain family functioning. Finally, dissatisfaction with communication in relationships with professionals emerged. In conclusion, a typical pediatric palliative care approach is recommended since it manages to guarantee parents empathetic and supportive communication from healthcare professionals, alleviating feelings of isolation and loneliness in parents."

Immunofluorescence studies on quadriceps muscles were analyzed for lysosomal accumulations and autophagic buildup and correlated with MRI outcome measures. Fat fraction and water-T2 did not differ between groups and remained stable over time. In Pompe mice, fractional anisotropy increased, while mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD) decreased in all observed muscles. Autophagic marker and muscle fibre diameter revealed significant negative correlations with reduced RD and MD, while lysosomal marker did not show any change or correlation. Using qMRI, we showed diffusion changes in muscles of presymptomatic Pompe mice without fat-infiltrated muscles and correlated them to autophagic markers and fibre diameter, indicating diffusion MRI reveals autophagic buildup."

Using the examples of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Friedreich ataxia and Pompe disease, we discuss how the genetic causes of such diseases derail diverse homeostatic, energetic and signalling pathways, which span multiple cellular systems in varied tissues across the body. We outline existing therapeutics and treatments in the context of emerging novel genetic approaches. We discuss the hurdles that the field must overcome to deliver targeted therapies across the many tissue types affected in primary myopathies."

    "title": "Early discoveries on enzyme deficiencies in lysosomal storage diseases: The Indian contribution.",
    "abstract": "The discovery of enzyme deficiencies in lysosomal storage disorders began with two discoveries made in 1963. One of these was made by a Belgian scientist, Henri-Gery Hers, who discovered that in Pompe's disease there was a deficiency in α-glucosidase. The other was made by an international collaboration involving an American neurologist, James Austin, and an Indian biochemist, Bimal Bachhawat, where the enzyme arylsulfatase A was found deficient in metachromatic leukodystrophy. This article attempts to trace the events that led to this fruitful collaboration and how these two young investigators eventually discovered the defective enzyme in metachromatic leukodystrophy."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare genetic disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1:60.000. The two main phenotypes are Infantile Onset Pompe Disease (IOPD) and Late Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD). There is no published data from Spain regarding the existing number of cases, regional distribution, clinical features or, access and response to the treatment. We created a registry to collect all these data from patients with Pompe in Spain. Here, we report the data of the 122 patients registered including nine IOPD and 113 LOPD patients. There was a high variability in how the diagnosis was obtained and how the follow-up was performed among different centres. Seven IOPD patients were still alive being all treated with enzymatic replacement therapy (ERT) at last visit. Ninety four of the 113 LOPD patients had muscle weakness of which 81 were receiving ERT. We observed a progressive decline in the results of muscle function tests during follow-up. Overall, the Spanish Pompe Registry is a valuable resource for understanding the demographics, patient's journey and clinical characteristics of patients in Spain. Our data supports the development of agreed guidelines to ensure that the care provided to the patients is standardized across the country."

    "title": "Enzyme replacement therapy for late-onset Pompe disease.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). People with infantile-onset disease have either a complete or a near-complete enzyme deficiency; people with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) retain some residual enzyme activity. GAA deficiency is treated with an intravenous infusion of recombinant human acid alglucosidase alfa, an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Alglucosidase alfa and avalglucosidase alfa are approved treatments, but cipaglucosidase alfa with miglustat is not yet approved. To assess the effects of enzyme replacement therapies in people with late-onset Pompe disease. We searched the Cochrane Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched MEDLINE OvidSP, clinical trial registries, and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 21 April 2022. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ERT in people with LOPD of any age. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence (using GRADE). We resolved disagreements through discussion and by consulting a third author. We included six trials (358 randomised participants) lasting from 12 to 78 weeks. A single trial reported on each comparison listed below. None of the included trials assessed two of our secondary outcomes: need for respiratory support and use of a walking aid or wheelchair. Certainty of evidence was most commonly downgraded for selective reporting bias. Alglucosidase alfa versus placebo (90 participants) After 78 weeks, alglucosidase alfa probably improves the six-minute walk test (6MWT) distance compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 30.95 metres, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.98 to 53.92; moderate-certainty evidence) and probably improves respiratory function, measured as the change in per cent (%) predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) (MD 3.55, 95% CI 1.46 to 5.64; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between the groups in occurrence of infusion reactions (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.61; low-certainty evidence), quality of life physical component score (MD -1.36 points, 95% CI -5.59 to 2.87; low-certainty evidence), or adverse events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.39; low-certainty evidence). Alglucosidase alfa plus clenbuterol versus alglucosidase alfa plus placebo (13 participants) The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of alglucosidase alfa plus clenbuterol compared to alglucosidase alfa plus placebo on: change in 6MWT distance after 52 weeks (MD 34.55 metres, 95% CI-10.11 to 79.21; very low-certainty evidence) and change in % predicted FVC (MD -13.51%, 95% CI -32.44 to 5.41; very low-certainty evidence). This study did not measure infusion reactions, quality of life, and adverse events. Alglucosidase alfa plus albuterol versus alglucosidase alfa plus placebo (13 participants) The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of alglucosidase alfa plus albuterol compared to alglucosidase alfa plus placebo on: change in 6MWT distance after 52 weeks (MD 30.00 metres, 95% CI 0.55 to 59.45; very low-certainty evidence), change in % predicted FVC (MD -4.30%, 95% CI -14.87 to 6.27; very low-certainty evidence), and risk of adverse events (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.18; very low-certainty evidence). This study did not measure infusion reactions and quality of life. VAL-1221 versus alglucosidase alfa (12 participants) Insufficient information was available about this trial to generate effect estimates measured at one year or later. Compared to alglucosidase alfa, VAL-1221 may increase or reduce infusion-associated reactions at three months, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 2.80, 95% CI 0.18 to 42.80). This study did not measure quality of life and adverse events. Cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat versus alglucosidase alfa plus placebo (125 participants) Compared to alglucosidase alfa plus placebo, cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat may make little or no difference to: 6MWT distance at 52 weeks (MD 13.60 metres, 95% CI -2.26 to 29.46); infusion reactions (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.80); quality of life scores for physical function (MD 1.70, 95% CI -2.13 to 5.53) and fatigue (MD -0.30, 95% CI -2.76 to 2.16); and adverse effects potentially related to treatment (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.40) (all low-certainty evidence). Cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat probably improves % predicted FVC compared to alglucosidase alfa plus placebo (MD 3.10%, 95% CI 1.04 to 5.16; moderate-certainty evidence); however, it may make little or no change in % predicted sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (MD -0.06%, 95% CI -8.91 to 7.71; low-certainty evidence). Avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase alfa (100 participants) After 49 weeks, avalglucosidase alfa probably improves 6MWT compared to alglucosidase alfa (MD 30.02 metres, 95% CI 1.84 to 58.20; moderate-certainty evidence). Avalglucosidase alfa probably makes little or no difference to % predicted FVC compared to alglucosidase alfa (MD 2.43%, 95% CI -0.08 to 4.94; moderate-certainty evidence). Avalglucosidase alfa may make little or no difference to infusion reactions (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.45), quality of life (MD 0.77, 95% CI -2.09 to 3.63), or treatment-related adverse events (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.40), all low-certainty evidence. One trial compared the effect of ERT to placebo in LOPD, showing that alglucosidase alfa probably improves 6MWT and respiratory function (both moderate-certainty evidence). Avalglucosidase alfa probably improves 6MWT compared with alglucosidase alfa (moderate-certainty evidence). Cipaglucosidase plus miglustat probably improves FVC compared to alglucosidase alfa plus placebo (moderate-certainty evidence). Other trials studied the adjunct effect of clenbuterol and albuterol along with alglucosidase alfa, with little to no evidence of benefit. No significant rise in adverse events was noted with all ERTs. The impact of ERT on some outcomes remains unclear, and longer RCTs are needed to generate relevant information due to the progressive nature of LOPD. Alternative resources, such as post-marketing registries, could capture some of this information."

    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition syndrome caused primarily by biallelic pathogenic variants in 1 of 22 genes involved in DNA interstrand cross-link repair. An enduring question concerns cancer risk of those with a single pathogenic FA gene variant. To investigate all FA genes, this study utilized the DiscovEHR cohort of 170,503 individuals with exome sequencing and electronic health data. 5822 subjects with a single pathogenic variant in an FA gene were identified. Two control groups were used in primary analysis deriving cancer risk signals. Secondary exploratory analysis was conducted using the UK Biobank and The Cancer Genome Atlas. Signals for elevated cancer risk were found in all 5 known cancer predisposition genes. Among the remaining 15 genes associated with autosomal recessive inheritance cancer risk signals were found for 4 cancers across 3 genes in the primary cohort but were not validated in secondary cohorts. To our knowledge, this is the first and largest FA heterozygote study to use genomic ascertainment and validates well-established cancer predispositions in 5 genes, whereas finding insufficient evidence of predisposition in 15 others. Our findings inform clinical surveillance given how common pathogenic FA variants are in the population."

    "abstract": "Studies indicate that doses of alglucosidase alfa (ALGLU) higher than label dose (20 mg/kg every other week) improve clinical outcomes in infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD). We investigated data from the Pompe Registry to determine the association between ALGLU dose and survival in IOPD. We included 332 IOPD patients from the Registry as of January 2022 who had cardiomyopathy and were first treated at age < 1 year. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between ALGLU as a time-varying exposure and survival, adjusting for age at first treatment, sex, and cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM)/immune tolerance induction (ITI) status. Dose was measured as average relative dose received over time (in multiples of label dose, range > 0 to 4 times label dose), current dose, and lagged dose. 81% patients received label dose at treatment initiation. Over time, 52% received a higher dose. Higher ALGLU dose over time was associated with improved survival: adjusted HR 0.40 (95% CI 0.22-0.73, p = 0.003) per 1-unit increase in average relative dose, with similar results for invasive ventilation-free survival (adjusted HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28-0.84; p = 0.010). The association was consistent in patients first treated before or after 3 months of age and did not vary significantly by CRIM status. Results for current and lagged dose were similar to average dose. Higher ALGLU doses were associated with significantly improved overall and invasive ventilator-free survival in IOPD. Results were consistent across sensitivity analyses."

We report data from the Phase I/II ATB200-02 study for up to 48 months of treatment. Four adult cohorts, including one non-ambulatory ERT-experienced (n = 6) and three ambulatory cohorts, (two enzyme replacement therapy [ERT]-experienced cohorts [2-6 years (n = 11) and ≥ 7 years (n = 6)]), one ERT-naïve cohort (n = 6), received 20 mg/kg intravenous-infused cipa plus 260 mg oral mig biweekly. Change from baseline (CFBL) for multiple efficacy endpoints at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety, and immunogenicity data were assessed. Six-minute walking distance (% predicted) improved at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months: pooled ambulatory ERT-experienced cohorts, mean(± standard deviation [SD]) CFBL: 6.1(± 7.84), n = 16; 5.4(± 10.56), n = 13; 3.4(± 14.66), n = 12; 5.9(± 17.36), n = 9, respectively; ERT-naïve cohort: 10.7(± 3.93), n = 6; 11.0(± 5.06), n = 6; 9.0(± 7.98), n = 5; 11.7(± 7.69), n = 4, respectively. Percent predicted forced vital capacity was generally stable in ERT-experienced cohorts, mean(± SD) CFBL - 1.2(± 5.95), n = 16; 1.0(± 7.96), n = 13; - 0.3(± 6.68), n = 10; 1.0(± 6.42), n = 6, respectively, and improved in the ERT-naïve cohort: 3.2(± 8.42), n = 6; 4.7(± 5.09), n = 6; 6.2(± 3.35), n = 5; 8.3(± 4.50), n = 4, respectively. Over 48 months, CK and Hex4 biomarkers improved in ambulatory cohorts. Overall, cipa + mig was well tolerated with a safety profile like alglucosidase alfa. ATB200-02 results show the potential benefits of cipa + mig as a long-term treatment option for Pompe disease. Trial registration number: NCT02675465 January 26, 2016."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy has emerged as a promising frontier in the pursuit of effective treatments for primary myopathies. This scientific review explores the application of viral vectors and more specifically of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors as a potent gene delivery tool in the context of primary myopathies, highlighting its transformative potential. Focusing on primary myopathies, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs), X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), and Pompe disease, we review the ongoing pre-clinical and clinical trials that underscore the therapeutic promise of rAAV-based gene therapies. Recent developments in gene therapy have unveiled innovative gene transfer approaches, particularly with rAAV vectors. These vectors offer a well-tolerated and efficient means of delivering corrective genetic material to diseased muscles, thereby addressing the root causes of primary myopathies. Encouraging data from pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials have demonstrated the potential to ameliorate muscle function, reduce pathological manifestations, and enhance the quality of life for patients afflicted with these devastating diseases. However, the transition from bench to bedside is not without challenges. This review emphasizes the critical need for a comprehensive risk management strategy to better handle potential side effects and immune responses associated with gene therapy. As the field of gene therapy for primary myopathies is advancing, it is imperative to refine and optimize safety measures, ensuring that the transformative potential of these therapies is realized while the risks are minimized. © 2023 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of French Society of Pediatrics."

    "abstract": "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human alglucosidase alfa (rhGAA) was approved in Europe in 2006. Nevertheless, data on the long-term outcome of infantile onset Pompe disease (IOPD) patients at school age is still limited. We analyzed in detail cardiac, respiratory, motor, and cognitive function of 15 German-speaking patients aged 7 and older who started ERT at a median age of 5 months. Starting dose was 20 mg/kg biweekly in 12 patients, 20 mg/kg weekly in 2, and 40 mg/kg weekly in one patient. CRIM-status was positive in 13 patients (86.7%) and negative or unknown in one patient each (6.7%). Three patients (20%) received immunomodulation. Median age at last assessment was 9.1 (7.0-19.5) years. At last follow-up 1 patient (6.7%) had mild cardiac hypertrophy, 6 (42.9%) had cardiac arrhythmias, and 7 (46.7%) required assisted ventilation. Seven patients (46.7%) achieved the ability to walk independently and 5 (33.3%) were still ambulatory at last follow-up. Six patients (40%) were able to sit without support, while the remaining 4 (26.7%) were tetraplegic. Eleven patients underwent cognitive testing (Culture Fair Intelligence Test), while 4 were unable to meet the requirements for cognitive testing. Intelligence quotients (IQs) ranged from normal (IQ 117, 102, 96, 94) in 4 patients (36.4%) to mild developmental delay (IQ 81) in one patient (9.1%) to intellectual disability (IQ 69, 63, 61, 3x <55) in 6 patients (54.5%). White matter abnormalities were present in 10 out of 12 cerebral MRIs from 7 patients. Substantial motor, cardiac, respiratory, and cognitive deficits are frequent in IOPD long-term survivors who started ERT before 2016. The findings of this study can be valuable as comparative data when evaluating the impact of newer treatment strategies including higher enzyme dosage, immunomodulation, modified enzymes, or early start of treatment following newborn screening."

    "abstract": "Adults with late-onset Pompe disease (aLOPD) are characterized by muscular contractile tissue deterioration. However, their neuromuscular performances are poorly known. We aimed to compare maximal muscle strength, activation, explosive strength and neuromuscular fatigue between aLOPD and controls. We studied 20 aLOPD and 20 matched controls. Isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) torque was obtained for the hip, knee and ankle muscles. The voluntary activation level (VAL) during knee extensor MVC was assessed using interpolated twitch technique. Explosive strength was evaluated for knee and ankle muscles through the rate of torque development (RTD) during fast contractions. Neuromuscular fatigue was measured during a 30-second contraction of knee flexors and extensors. All muscle MVC torques were significantly lower in aLOPD than controls (p <0.05). The weakest muscles were the hip extensors followed by hip abductors and abductors. Raw value of RTD was lower in aLOPD for the majority of muscles (p <0.05). No intergroup differences were reported for normalized RTD, VAL and neuromuscular fatigue (p-values> 0.05). Our study shows that maximal strength was the only neuromuscular characteristic affected in aLOPD with a proximal-distal intensity gradient. This suggests that the surviving muscle tissue of aLOPD is as functionally efficient as that of control individuals."

In addition, the lockdown may have affected their regular treatment. To assess the perceived effect of COVID-19 infection and of the pandemic on the treatment, and physical and mental health of patients with Pompe disease. Patients with Pompe disease over 16 years of age participated in an international, cross-sectional, online survey (September 20, 2022-November 7, 2022). The questionnaire, available in eight languages, consisted of 89 questions divided into 3 parts: (A) severity of Pompe disease, (B) COVID-19 precautions and infection(s) and (C) effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among 342 respondents, originating from 25 different countries, 47.6% experienced one or more COVID-19 infections.

More severely affected patients took more stringent control measures. The pandemic additionally caused interruptions in medical care in many patients (56.0%) and 17.2% of patients experienced interruptions of enzyme replacement therapy. The pandemic also affected many patients' disease severity (27.7%), mental health (55.4%) and feeling of loneliness (43.4%).

A 3-year, longitudinal, prospective dataset contributed by patients with confirmed Becker muscular dystrophy was analyzed to characterize the natural history of this disorder. A better understanding of the natural history is crucial to rigorous therapeutic trials. A cohort of 83 patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (5-75 years at baseline) were followed for up to 3 years with annual assessments. Muscle and pulmonary function outcomes were analyzed herein. Age-stratified statistical analysis and modeling were conducted to analyze cross-sectional data, time-to-event data, and longitudinal data to characterize these clinical outcomes. Deletion mutations of dystrophin exons 45-47 or 45-48 were most common. Subgroup analysis showed greater pairwise association between motor outcomes at baseline than association between these outcomes and age. Stronger correlations between outcomes for adults than for those under 18 years were also observed. Using cross-sectional binning analysis, a ceiling effect was seen for North Star Ambulatory Assessment but not for other functional outcomes. Longitudinal analysis showed a decline in percentage predicted forced vital capacity over the life span. There was relative stability or improved median function for motor functional outcomes through childhood and adolescence and decreasing function with age thereafter. There is variable progression of outcomes resulting in significant heterogeneity of the clinical phenotype of Becker muscular dystrophy. Disease progression is largely manifest in adulthood. There are implications for clinical trial design revealed by this longitudinal analysis of a Becker natural history dataset."

    "title": "Late-Onset Pompe Disease with Normal Creatine Kinase Levels: The Importance of Rheumatological Suspicion.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD), also defined as acid maltase deficiency, is a rare autosomal recessive disease that causes glycogen accumulation due to a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase. An excessive amount of undisposed glycogen causes progressive muscle weakness throughout the body. It particularly affects skeletal muscles and the nervous system, especially in the late-onset phase. Here, we present a clinical case of late-onset PD (LOPD) with normal CK (creatinine kinase) values treated after a misdiagnosis of demyelinating motor polyneuropathy and chronic inflammatory neuropathy. The suspicion of possible fibromyalgia induced the patient to seek a rheumatology consultation, and the investigations performed led to the diagnosis of PD. The patient was investigated for genetic and enzymatic studies. PD was diagnosed using the α-glucosidase assay on DBS. In LOPD, clinical manifestations, such as muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, myalgia, or even high hyperCKemia, often appear as nonspecific and may mimic a wide variety of other muscle disorders, such as limb muscle dystrophies, congenital, metabolic, or inflammatory myopathies. In our case, the patient had CK values in the normal range but with continued complaints typical of PD. An analysis of enzyme activity revealed a pathologic value, and genetic analysis identified the c.-32-13T>G mutation in homozygosis. The association of the pathological enzyme value and mutation in homozygosity with LOPD led to a familial segregation study. Our results contribute to the characterization of PD in Italy and support the importance of rheumatologic attention. This suggests further studies are needed to define the broad clinical and pathological spectrum observed in this disease."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of monogenic condition, with many characterized by an enzyme deficiency leading to the accumulation of an undegraded substrate within the lysosomes. For those LSDs, postnatal enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) represents the standard of care, but this treatment has limitations when administered only postnatally because, at that point, prenatal disease sequelae may be irreversible. Furthermore, most forms of ERT, specifically those administered systemically, are currently unable to access certain tissues, such as the central nervous system (CNS), and furthermore, may initiate an immune response. In utero enzyme replacement therapy (IUERT) is a novel approach to address these challenges evaluated in a first-in-human clinical trial for IUERT in LSDs (NCT04532047). IUERT has numerous advantages: in-utero intervention may prevent early pathology; the CNS can be accessed before the blood-brain barrier forms; and the unique fetal immune system enables exposure to new proteins with the potential to prevent an immune response and may induce sustained tolerance. However, there are challenges and limitations for any fetal procedure that involves two patients. This article reviews the current state of IUERT for LSDs, including its advantages, limitations, and potential future directions for definitive therapies."

BALANCE (NCT02795676) assessed non-inferiority of pegunigalsidase alfa versus agalsidase beta in adults with Fabry disease with an annualised estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope more negative than -2 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year who had received agalsidase beta for ≥1 year. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive 1 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta every 2 weeks for 2 years. The primary efficacy analysis assessed non-inferiority based on median annualised eGFR slope differences between treatment arms. Seventy-seven patients received either pegunigalsidase alfa (n=52) or agalsidase beta (n=25). At baseline, mean (range) age was 44 (18-60) years, 47 (61%) patients were male, median eGFR was 74.5 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and median (range) eGFR slope was -7.3 (-30.5, 6.3) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year. At 2 years, the difference between median eGFR slopes was -0.36 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year, meeting the prespecified non-inferiority margin. Minimal changes were observed in lyso-Gb3 concentrations in both treatment arms at 2 years. Proportions of patients experiencing treatment-related adverse events and mild or moderate infusion-related reactions were similar in both groups, yet exposure-adjusted rates were 3.6-fold and 7.8-fold higher, respectively, with agalsidase beta than pegunigalsidase alfa. At the end of the study, neutralising antibodies were detected in 7 out of 47 (15%) pegunigalsidase alfa-treated patients and 6 out of 23 (26%) agalsidase beta-treated patients. There were no deaths. Based on rate of eGFR decline over 2 years, pegunigalsidase alfa was non-inferior to agalsidase beta.

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that presents with progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, the detailed mechanism remains clarified. Herein, PD patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells were differentiated into cardiomyocytes (PD-iCMs) that exhibited cardiomyopathic features of PD, including decreased acid alpha-glucosidase activity, lysosomal glycogen accumulation and hypertrophy. The defective mitochondria were involved in the cardiac pathology as shown by the significantly decreased number of mitochondria and impaired respiratory function and ATP production in PD-iCMs, which was partially due to elevated levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species produced from depolarized mitochondria. Further analysis showed that impaired fusion and autophagy of mitochondria and declined expression of mitochondrial complexes underlies the mechanism of dysfunctional mitochondria. This was alleviated by supplementation with recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase that improved the mitochondrial function and concomitantly mitigated the cardiac pathology. Therefore, this study suggests that defective mitochondria underlie the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy in patients with PD."

    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease XI, also known as Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (FBS), is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the <i>SLC2A2</i> gene that encodes the glucose-facilitated transporter type 2 (GLUT2). Patients develop a life-threatening renal proximal tubule dysfunction for which no treatment is available apart from electrolyte replacement. To investigate the renal pathogenesis of FBS, <i>SLC2A2</i> expression was ablated in mouse kidney and HK-2 proximal tubule cells. <i>GLUT2<sup>Pax8Cre+</sup></i> mice developed time-dependent glycogen accumulation in proximal tubule cells and recapitulated the renal Fanconi phenotype seen in patients. In vitro suppression of GLUT2 impaired lysosomal autophagy as shown by transcriptomic and biochemical analysis. However, this effect was reversed by exposure to a low glucose concentration, suggesting that GLUT2 facilitates the homeostasis of key cellular pathways in proximal tubule cells by preventing glucose toxicity. To investigate whether targeting proximal tubule glucose influx can limit glycogen accumulation and correct symptoms in vivo, we treated mice with the selective SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin reduced glycogen accumulation and improved metabolic acidosis and phosphaturia in the animals by normalizing the expression of Napi2a and NHE3 transporters. In addition, in a patient with FBS, dapagliflozin was safe, improved serum potassium and phosphate concentrations, and reduced glycogen content in urinary shed cells. Overall, this study provides proof of concept for dapagliflozin as a potentially suitable therapy for FBS."

    "title": "Variant Classification for Pompe disease; ACMG/AMP specifications from the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases Variant Curation Expert Panel.",
    "abstract": "Accurate determination of the clinical significance of genetic variants is critical to the integration of genomics in medicine. To facilitate this process, the NIH-funded Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) has assembled Variant Curation Expert Panels (VCEPs), groups of experts and biocurators which provide gene- and disease- specifications to the American College of Medical Genetics & Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology's (ACMG/AMP) variation classification guidelines. With the goal of classifying the clinical significance of GAA variants in Pompe disease (Glycogen storage disease, type II), the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases (LD) VCEP has specified the ACMG/AMP criteria for GAA. Variant classification can play an important role in confirming the diagnosis of Pompe disease as well as in the identification of carriers. Furthermore, since the inclusion of Pompe disease on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) for newborns in the USA in 2015, the addition of molecular genetic testing has become an important component in the interpretation of newborn screening results, particularly for asymptomatic individuals. To date, the LD VCEP has submitted classifications and supporting data on 243 GAA variants to public databases, specifically ClinVar and the ClinGen Evidence Repository. Here, we describe the ACMG/AMP criteria specification process for GAA, an update of the GAA-specific variant classification guidelines, and comparison of the ClinGen LD VCEP's GAA variant classifications with variant classifications submitted to ClinVar. The LD VCEP has added to the publicly available knowledge on the pathogenicity of variants in GAA by increasing the number of expert-curated GAA variants present in ClinVar, and aids in resolving conflicting classifications and variants of uncertain clinical significance."

    "title": "Safety outcomes and patients' preferences for home-based intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in pompe disease and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) disorder: COVID-19 and beyond.",
    "abstract": "The Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) demands precise information on benefit/risk profile of home-based enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of patients with Pompe disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). This passage is necessary to obtain the authorization for ERT home therapy, even after the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic period. This research intends to evaluate the safety, treatment satisfaction, and compliance of MPS I patients treated with laronidase (Aldurazyme®) and Pompe Disease patients treated with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme®) in a homecare setting. We report herein an early interim analysis of the HomERT (Home infusions of ERT) study, a multicenter, non-interventional, double-cohort study that retrospectively analyzed 38 patients from 14 sites in Italy: cohort A (Pompe disease - 32 patients) and cohort B (MPS I - 6 patients). Among the selected patients who started home therapy before enrollment, the average number of missed home-based infusions was 0.7 (1.3) in cohort A and 3.8 (6.4) in cohort B with no return to the hospital setting. Irrespective of the treatment location, 3 prior ADRs per cohort were reported. The majority of patients preferred home-based infusions (cohort A: 96.9%; cohort B: 100%): the main reason was attributed to treatment convenience (cohort A: 81.3%; cohort B: 83.3%). Despite the underlying conditions, most patients self-evaluated their health as \"good\" (cohort A: 50%; cohort B: 83.3%). Evidence of favorable safety profile, improved treatment compliance and personal satisfaction validates the use of ERT with laronidase and alglucosidase alfa as a strong candidate for home therapy."

    "abstract": "Metabolic myopathies (MM) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders affecting metabolic pathways involved in energy production during rest, exercise and physiologic stress (fever, fasting, …). Impairments in the pathways of glycolysis/ glycogenolysis, fatty acid transport/oxidation or in the mitochondrial respiratory chain present primarily with exercise intolerance, myalgias, weakness, cramps, or rhabdomyolysis. Depending on aetiology, the diagnosis can be made through neonatal screening, pre-symptomatic or in the set of clinical manifestations for which a high level of suspicion is important. Retrospective descriptive study of the clinical, biochemical, and molecular features of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MM followed by the multidisciplinary team of the Reference Center of Inherited Metabolic Diseases of Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Lisboa Central from 2009 to 2022. Twenty-three patients with MM were included: 9 (39%) glycogen storage diseases (7 McArdle and 2 Pompe), 7 (30%) fatty acid oxidation disorders (3 CPT2, 3 LCHAD and 1 MAD deficiencies), 6 (26%) mitochondrial disease with significant muscle involvement (2 Pearson, 1 Kearns Sayre, 1 VARS2, 1 SUCLA2 and 1 MT-TL1 deficiencies), and 1 myoadenylate deaminase deficiency. Ages varied from 15 months to 35 years. Eighteen (78%) patients were diagnosed by clinical symptoms, 3 by newborn screening (LCHAD) and 2 were asymptomatic (1 Pompe and 1 McArdle). Frequent symptoms were rhabdomyolysis triggered by illness or exercise 12 (52%), fatigue 11 (48%), exercise intolerance 10 (43%), and myalgia 9 (43%). Eight (35%) patients (LCHAD and mitochondrial) had multisystemic involvement. In 20 (87%) patients, the diagnosis was confirmed by biochemical and/or genetic analysis and 3 (McArdle) by muscle biopsy. MM are a heterogeneous set of disorders, but a careful history may guide the differential diagnosis among biochemical pathways and other etiologies. Nowadays, molecular testing has become a powerful tool for diagnosis confirmation, surpassing muscular biopsy in most cases. Accurate diagnosis is important to identify who may benefit from specific therapeutic options, such as enzyme replacement therapy, restricted diets, emergency regime and cofactors. All patients benefit from adequate lifestyle modifications, individualized exercise prescription, nutritional intervention, and genetic counselling."

A 46-year-old man with acromegaly had an 8-year history of progressive weakness. His myopathy was initially attributed to the acromegaly, but severe progression prompted a muscle biopsy, which suggested an inflammatory myopathy. However, his weakness progressed despite treatment for polymyositis. His muscle ultrasound scan pattern was more suggestive of Pompe disease than polymyositis, and Pompe disease was confirmed by genetic and enzymatic testing. Patients with apparent polymyositis, which persists despite treatment, require reconsideration of the diagnosis, with particular attention to treatable genetic causes."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder of deficient or absent acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), resulting in defective lysosomal glycogen catabolism. Muscle weakness, respiratory deficiency and gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly monitored in PD. However, pain and associated psychological symptoms are less focused upon. A pediatric patient with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) comorbid with chronic pain is presented. Symptoms of pain in the feet were first reported between 6 and 7 years of age and were attributed to growing pains. Following progression of lower body pain, weakness, fatigue, and difficulties with ambulation, a thorough clinical assessment including genetic testing was performed, which led to a diagnosis of LOPD at 9 years of age. ERT with recombinant human alglucosidase alfa was subsequently started. The patient's clinical status is compounded by depressed mood, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which may further exacerbate pain. A multidisciplinary pain treatment approach consisting of orthopedics, physical therapy, and psychosocial therapy aimed at enhancing pain coping skills is described for this LOPD patient. This case highlights the need for a greater understanding of pain generation and identification of optimized pain treatment approaches in children with LOPD that can be implemented alongside ERT."

This retrospective cohort study aimed to explore effects of long-term healthy physical activity according to the WHO norm and the former exercise training program on the disease course. A total of 29 adult late onset Pompe patients were included: 19 former exercise training program participants and 10 comparable control patients. Patients, who based on interviews, met the 2010 WHO healthy physical activity norm (active, n = 16) performed better on endurance (maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test), muscle strength and function compared to patients not meeting this norm (inactive, n = 13) (p < 0.05). Majority of the outcomes, including endurance and manually tested muscle strength, tended to be higher in the active patients of the 2011 training cohort who continued the program compared to active control patients (p > 0.05). In Pompe disease long-term healthy physical activity according to the 2010 WHO norm leads to physical benefits and a personalized exercise training program may have additional favorable effects and both should be recommended as standard of care."

This study aimed to validate and compare 2 fluorimetric methods for measuring α-glucosidase acid activity in dried blood spot sample (DBS), with potential applications in neonatal screening, and disease follow-up of Pompe patients among the Iranian population for the first time. The evaluation involved 3 enzyme levels and 7 parameters. The analysis included 141 Healthy individuals, 8 Pompe patients, and 10 obligate heterozygotes using reference and modified methods. Both methods exhibited highly linear calibration curves. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were obtained in the micromolar concentration range in 2 methods. Inter-day and intra-day precision, expressed as relative standard deviations (RSD%) were calculated. The normal ranges were determined in healthy individuals. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were analyzed, and 2 parameters, total neutral α-glucosidase (NAG)/acid α-glucosidase (GAA) and pH ratio, were identified as cut-off values with excellent accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for evaluating Pompe disease in both methods. Establishing and implementing these 2 methods for the Iranian population effectively differentiated between healthy and patient individuals.

Therefore, this study aims to determine the frequency of Duchenne muscular dystrophy/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) in male children and Pompe disease (PD) in male and female children with isolated hypertransaminasemia. This multi-center, prospective study enrolled patients aged 3-216 months with serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and/or aspartate transaminase (AST) levels >2× the upper limit of normal (ULN) for ≥3 months. Patients with a known history of liver or muscle disease or physical examination findings suggestive of liver disease were excluded. Patients were screened for creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels, and molecular genetic tests for DMD/BMD in male patients and enzyme analysis for PD in male and female patients with elevated CPK levels were performed. Genetic analyses confirmed PD. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the patients were analyzed. Overall, 589 patients [66.8% male, mean age of 63.4 months (standard deviation: 60.5)] were included. In total, 251 patients (188 male and 63 female) had CPK levels above the ULN. Of the patients assessed, 47% (85/182) of male patients were diagnosed with DMD/BMD and 1% (3/228) of male and female patients were diagnosed with PD. The median ALT, AST, and CPK levels were statistically significantly higher, and the questioned neurological symptoms and previously unnoticed examination findings were more common in DMD/BMD patients than those without DMD/BMD or PD (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Questioning neurological symptoms, conducting a complete physical examination, and testing for CPK levels in patients with isolated hypertransaminasemia will prevent costly and time-consuming investigations for liver diseases and will lead to the diagnosis of occult neuromuscular diseases.

This study aimed to develop and validate an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to detect these three urinary saccharide metabolites. Urine samples were diluted and then analyzed. Chromatographic separation was performed on an Acquity™ UPLC Amide column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm) with gradient elution. The quantitation of analytes was achieved on a 5500 Qtrap mass spectrometer using negative multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The calibration curves for all analytes were linear over the range of 0.500 to 100 μg/mL with a correlation coefficient, R<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.999. The percent relative standard deviations (RSD%) were ≤12.8%, and the percent relative errors (RE%) were in the range of -11.7%-11.0%. The relative matrix effects of all analytes were between 87.2% and 104% with RSD% < 3.10% across three concentrations. The developed analytical method was simple, accurate, and reliable for rapid and simultaneous analysis of these three urinary saccharide metabolites. It was applied to healthy volunteers and patients. To our knowledge, it was the first validated assay for urinary maltotetraose quantification. This work provides support for exploring the potential of maltotetraose as a biomarker for Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD1a) is caused by a congenital deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase-α (G6Pase-α, encoded by G6PC), which is primarily associated with life-threatening hypoglycemia. Although strict dietary management substantially improves life expectancy, patients still experience intermittent hypoglycemia and develop hepatic complications. Emerging therapies utilizing new modalities such as adeno-associated virus and mRNA with lipid nanoparticles are under development for GSD1a but potentially require complicated glycemic management throughout life. Here, we present an oligonucleotide-based therapy to produce intact G6Pase-α from a pathogenic human variant, G6PC c.648G>T, the most prevalent variant in East Asia causing aberrant splicing of G6PC. DS-4108b, a splice-switching oligonucleotide, was designed to correct this aberrant splicing, especially in liver. We generated a mouse strain with homozygous knockin of this variant that well reflected the pathophysiology of patients with GSD1a. DS-4108b recovered hepatic G6Pase activity through splicing correction and prevented hypoglycemia and various hepatic abnormalities in the mice. Moreover, DS-4108b had long-lasting efficacy of more than 12 weeks in mice that received a single dose and had favorable pharmacokinetics and tolerability in mice and monkeys. These findings together indicate that this oligonucleotide-based therapy could provide a sustainable and curative therapeutic option under easy disease management for GSD1a patients with G6PC c.648G>T."

    "abstract": "Glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc<sub>4</sub>) and maltotetraose (M<sub>4</sub>) are important biomarkers for Pompe disease and other glycogen storage diseases (GSDs). With the development of new treatments for GSDs, more specific and sensitive bioanalytical methods are needed to determine biomarkers. In recent years, differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) has become an effective analytical technique with high selectivity and specificity. This study aimed to develop an efficient analytical method for the two urinary tetrasaccharide metabolites using DMS and apply it to patients with GSDs (type Ib and II). Urine samples were directly diluted and injected into liquid chromatography-differential mobility spectrometry tandem mass spectrometry (LC-DMS-MS/MS). Chromatographic separation was performed on an Acquity™ UPLC BEH Amide column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) with a short gradient elution of 2.6 min.

A total of 20 urine samples from 6 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with GSDs (type Ib and II) were collected for analysis. The method was linear over a concentration range of 0.5~100.0 µg/mL for each urinary tetrasaccharide (r≥0.99). The intra- and inter-day precision RSD% were less than 14.3%, and the accuracy RE% were in the range of -14.3~13.4%. The relative matrix effect was between 86.6 and 114.3%.

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder with impaired glycogen degradation caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA). Children with the severe infantile form do not survive beyond the first year of life without treatment. Since 2006, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with Alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme) has been available, which is a recombinant human GAA (rhGAA). Myozyme therapy has prolonged the life span of affected patients, but many patients showed a continuing, albeit slower, disease progression. A new generation of rhGAA, Cipaglucosidase alfa (Amicus) has a higher content of mannose-6-phosphate residues, which are necessary for efficient cellular uptake and lysosomal targeting. Cipaglucosidase alfa is co-administered with an enzyme stabilizer, Miglustat, which also optimizes the pharmacological properties. In mouse models, the superiority of Cipaglucosidase alfa/Miglustat compared to the previous standard therapy could be determined. Here, we report the disease course of a patient with severe infantile M. Pompe, who showed serious progression even with high-dose standard of care ERT. Changing the therapy to Cipaglucosidase alfa/Miglustat improved respiratory failure, cardiomyopathy, and motor functions significantly. The patient could be weaned from respiratory support and oxygen supplementation. Cardiac function was normalized. Most impressively, the patient, who had lost nearly all motor skills, acquired head control, learned to speak, and could move his wheelchair by himself. Overall, the patient's clinical situation has improved dramatically with the new ERT."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disease characterised by skeletal and respiratory muscle weakness. Since 2006, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa has been available. ERT significantly improves the prognosis of patients with Pompe disease. The effect of high antibody titres on treatment response in adults with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) remains unclear but may contribute to interpatient variation. We therefore conducted a systematic review on this subject. A systematic search was performed in Embase, Medline Ovid, Web of Science, Psych Info Ovid, Cochrane (Clinical Trials only), and Google Scholar (random top-200). Articles were included if they involved adults with LOPD treated with alglucosidase alfa and mentioned anti-rhGAA antibodies or antibody titres. In addition, articles mentioning dosages different from the standard recommended dosage were included. Our literature search retrieved 2562 publications, and 17 fulfilled our selection criteria, describing 443 cases. Seven publications reported on anti-rhGAA antibody titres on a group level, with the percentage of patients with a high titre as defined in the included articles ranging from 0-33%. Six publications reported on the effect of anti-rhGAA antibody titre on clinical course, and four found no correlation. Two studies reported a negative effect on treatment. The first study found a greater improvement in Medical Research Council (MRC) score in patients with no detectable antibody titre. In the second study, a patient discontinued ERT due to a declining neuromuscular state as a result of high anti-rhGAA antibody titres. Seven publications reported on 17 individual patients with a high antibody titre (range 1:12,800-1:3,906,250). In only two cases were high-sustained neutralising antibodies reported to interfere with treatment efficacy. No clear effect of anti-rhGAA IgG antibodies on treatment response could be established for the majority of LOPD patients with a high antibody titre. In a minority of patients, a clinical decline related to (possible) interference of anti-rhGAA antibodies was described."

Two clinical presentations are usually considered, named infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), which differ in age of onset, organ involvement, and severity of disease. Assessment of acid alpha-glucosidase activity on a dried blood spot is the first-line screening test, which needs to be confirmed by genetic analysis in case of suspected deficiency. LOPD is a multi-system disease, thus requiring a multidisciplinary approach for efficacious management. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which was introduced over 15 years ago, changes the natural progression of the disease. However, it has limitations, including a reduction in efficacy over time and heterogeneous therapeutic responses among patients. Novel therapeutic approaches, such as gene therapy, are currently under study. We provide a comprehensive review of diagnostic advances in LOPD and a critical discussion about the advantages and limitations of current and future treatments."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) constitute a large group of rare, multisystemic, inherited disorders of metabolism, characterized by defects in lysosomal enzymes, accessory proteins, membrane transporters or trafficking proteins. Pompe disease (PD) is produced by mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) lysosomal enzyme. This enzymatic deficiency leads to the aberrant accumulation of glycogen in the lysosome. The onset of symptoms, including a variety of neurological and multiple-organ pathologies, can range from birth to adulthood, and disease severity can vary between individuals. Although very significant advances related to the development of new treatments, and also to the improvement of newborn screening programs and tools for a more accurate diagnosis and follow-up of patients, have occurred over recent years, there exists an unmet need for further understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of the disease. Also, the reason why currently available treatments lose effectiveness over time in some patients is not completely understood. In this scenario, characterization of the metabolic phenotype is a valuable approach to gain insights into the global impact of lysosomal dysfunction, and its potential correlation with clinical progression and response to therapies. These approaches represent a discovery tool for investigating disease-induced modifications in the complete metabolic profile, including large numbers of metabolites that are simultaneously analyzed, enabling the identification of novel potential biomarkers associated with these conditions. This review aims to highlight the most relevant findings of recently published omics-based studies with a particular focus on describing the clinical potential of the specific metabolic phenotypes associated to different subgroups of PD patients."

The standard treatment is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), a therapy that is lifesaving, yet with limitations. Clinical trials have emerged for other potential treatment options, including adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy. We present clinical parameters and AAV antibody titers for 19 individuals with LOPD undergoing screening for a Phase I clinical trial with an AAV serotype 8 vector targeting hepatic transduction (AAV2/8-LSPhGAA). Reported clinical parameters included <i>GAA</i> genotype, assessments of muscle function, upright and supine spirometry, anti-recombinant human GAA antibody titers, and biomarkers. Variability in measured parameters and phenotypes of screened individuals was evident. Eligibility criteria required that all participants have six-minute walk test (6MWT) and upright forced vital capacity (FVC) below the expected range for normal individuals, and were stably treated with ERT for >2 years. All participants had Pompe disease diagnosed by enzyme deficiency, and all had the common c.-32-13T>G LOPD pathogenic variant. Screening identified 14 patients (74%) with no or minimal detectable neutralizing antibodies against AAV8 (titer ≤1:5). 6MWT distance varied significantly (percent of expected distance ranging from 24% to 91% with an average of 60 and standard deviation of 21).

The time-averaged glucose Ra was significantly higher in (1) preprandial/fasted patients with GSDIa than HV and (2) postprandial HV compared with fasted HV(P < .05). A progressive decrease in glucose Ra was observed in preprandial/fasted patients with GSDIa; the change in glucose Ra time-course was directly correlated with the change in capillary glucose (P < .05). This is the first study to quantify glucose Ra in patients with GSDIa using oral D-[6,6-2H2] glucose. The test can reliably estimate EGP under conditions in which fasting tolerance is unaffected but does not discriminate between relative contributions of EGP (eg, liver, kidney) and exogenous sources (eg, dietary cornstarch). Future application is warranted for longitudinal monitoring after novel genome based treatments in patients with GSDIa in whom nocturnal dietary management can be discontinued."

    "abstract": "One of the main causes of heart failure is cardiomyopathies. Among them, the most common is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), characterized by thickening of the left ventricular muscle. This article focuses on HCM and other cardiomyopathies with myocardial hypertrophy, including Fabry disease, Pompe disease, and Danon disease. The genetics and pathogenesis of these diseases are described, as well as current and experimental treatment options, such as pharmacological intervention and the potential of gene therapies. Although genetic approaches are promising and have the potential to become the best treatments for these diseases, further research is needed to evaluate their efficacy and safety. This article describes current knowledge and advances in the treatment of the aforementioned cardiomyopathies."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) - a lysosomal enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing glycogen. GAA deficiency leads to accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes, causing cellular disruption. The severity of PD is directly related to the extent of GAA deficiency - if no or minimal GAA is produced, symptoms are severe and manifest in infancy, known as infantile onset PD (IOPD). If left untreated, infants with IOPD experience muscle hypotonia and cardio-respiratory failure leading to significant morbidity and mortality in the first year of life. In contrast, late-onset PD (LOPD) patients have more GAA activity and present later in life, but also have significant respiratory function decline. Despite FDA-approved enzyme replacement therapy, respiratory insufficiency remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, emphasizing the importance of early detection and management of respiratory complications. These complications include impaired cough and airway clearance, respiratory muscle weakness, sleep-related breathing issues, and pulmonary infections. This review aims to provide an overview of the respiratory pathology, monitoring, and management of PD patients. In addition, we discuss the impact of novel approaches and therapies on respiratory function in PD."

This Primer describes the multi-organ clinical features of hepatic GSDs and muscle GSDs, in addition to their epidemiology, biochemistry and mechanisms of disease, diagnosis, management, quality of life and future research directions. Some GSDs have available guidelines for diagnosis and management. Diagnostic considerations include phenotypic characterization, biomarkers, imaging, genetic testing, enzyme activity analysis and histology. Management includes surveillance for development of characteristic disease sequelae, avoidance of fasting in several hepatic GSDs, medically prescribed diets, appropriate exercise regimens and emergency letters. Specific therapeutic interventions are available for some diseases, such as enzyme replacement therapy to correct enzyme deficiency in Pompe disease and SGLT2 inhibitors for neutropenia and neutrophil dysfunction in GSD Ib. Progress in diagnosis, management and definitive therapies affects the natural course and hence morbidity and mortality. The natural history of GSDs is still being described. The quality of life of patients with these conditions varies, and standard sets of patient-centred outcomes have not yet been developed. The landscape of novel therapeutics and GSD clinical trials is vast, and emerging research is discussed herein."

    "title": "Increasing Enzyme Mannose-6-Phosphate Levels but Not Miglustat Coadministration Enhances the Efficacy of Enzyme Replacement Therapy in Pompe Mice.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare glycogen storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme acid <i>α</i>-glucosidase, which leads to muscle weakness, cardiac and respiratory failure, and early mortality. Alglucosidase alfa, a recombinant human acid <i>α</i>-glucosidase, was the first approved treatment of Pompe disease, but its uptake into skeletal muscle via the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor (CIMPR) is limited. Avalglucosidase alfa has received marketing authorization in several countries for infantile-onset and/or late-onset Pompe disease. This recently approved enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was glycoengineered to maximize CIMPR binding through high-affinity interactions with ∼7 bis-M6P moieties. Recently, small molecules like the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor miglustat were reported to increase the stability of recombinant human acid <i>α</i>-glucosidase, and it was suggested that an increased serum half-life would result in better glycogen clearance. Here, the effects of miglustat on alglucosidase alfa and avalglucosidase alfa stability, activity, and efficacy in Pompe mice were evaluated. Although miglustat increased the stability of both enzymes in fluorescent protein thermal shift assays and when incubated in neutral pH buffer over time, it reduced their enzymatic activity by ∼50%. Improvement in tissue glycogen clearance and transcriptional dysregulation in Pompe mice correlated with M6P levels but not with miglustat coadministration. These results further substantiate the crucial role of CIMPR binding in lysosomal targeting of ERTs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This work describes important new insights into the treatment of Pompe disease using currently approved enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs) coadministered with miglustat. Although miglustat increased the stability of ERTs in vitro, there was no positive impact to glycogen clearance and transcriptional correction in Pompe mice. However, increasing mannose-6-phosphate levels resulted in increased cell uptake in vitro and increased glycogen clearance and transcriptional correction in Pompe mice, further underscoring the crucial role of cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor-mediated lysosomal targeting for ERTs."

    "abstract": "Implementation of newborn screening (NBS) in the United States now detects infants with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), a lysosomal storage disease characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness, and detailed clinical evaluation has identified early muscle weakness. Biomarkers may be uninformative; thus, non-invasive imaging is needed to assess early LOPD muscle changes. Muscle ultrasound (US) measuring echointensity (EI) is a non-invasive measure of muscle health. In this study, we aimed to evaluate if EI can identify characteristic patterns of muscle involvement in LOPD patients identified by NBS. Prospective, cross-sectional, single time point study. One-center study. We examined 20 infants with NBS-identified LOPD (ages 5-20 months). All had standardized physical therapy assessments. Creatine Kinase (CK) and Urine Hexose Tetrasaccharide (Glc4) were obtained. Muscle US of deltoid, biceps brachii, forearm flexors, thoracic paraspinals, gluteus maximus, quadriceps, tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius was performed. Mean EI was calculated for all involved muscle groups. Quantitative EI Sum Scores were calculated as total EI divided by number of muscle groups assessed. We performed a comprehensive literature review to compare our results to previous LOPD muscle ultrasound studies. Six of 20 participants had elevated CK and 15 had <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo>≥</mo></math>50% of the most common concerning kinematic physical findings; with normal urine Glc4 in all except one. Based upon muscle EI, the most affected muscles were quadriceps and medial gastrocnemius, with notable elevated EI in thoracic paraspinals. Biceps brachii was the most frequently affected upper extremity muscle. EI sum scores correlated moderately with increasing CK. Statistically significant positive correlation was found between posterior pelvic tilt in sitting and EI of gluteus maximus. Sonographic pattern of muscle involvement was similar to previous studies assessing older patients with LOPD. In this study, muscle EI was elevated most often in the quadriceps, tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, thoracic paraspinals, and biceps brachii. Involved muscles generally fit the profile of physical and muscle ultrasound/MRI exam findings in LOPD patients. Muscle ultrasound is recommended for rapid, focused muscle assessment in LOPD, especially those identified via NBS. Future studies should focus on this pattern of ultrasonographic abnormality and changes over time."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal exoglycosidases are responsible for processing endocytosed glycans from the non-reducing end to produce the corresponding monosaccharides. Genetic mutations in a particular lysosomal glycosidase may result in accumulation of its particular substrate, which may cause diverse lysosomal storage disorders. The identification of effective therapeutic modalities to treat these diseases is a major yet poorly realised objective in biomedicine. One common strategy comprises the identification of effective and selective competitive inhibitors that may serve to stabilize the proper folding of the mutated enzyme, either during maturation and trafficking to, or residence in, endo-lysosomal compartments. The discovery of such inhibitors is greatly aided by effective screening assays, the development of which is the focus of the here-presented work. We developed and applied fluorescent activity-based probes reporting on either human GH30 lysosomal glucosylceramidase (GBA1, a retaining β-glucosidase) or GH31 lysosomal retaining α-glucosidase (GAA). FluoPol-ABPP screening of our in-house 358-member iminosugar library yielded compound classes selective for either of these enzymes. In particular, we identified a class of <i>N</i>-alkyldeoxynojirimycins that inhibit GAA, but not GBA1, and that may form the starting point for the development of pharmacological chaperone therapeutics for the lysosomal glycogen storage disease that results from genetic deficiency in GAA: Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "The life expectancy of Pompe disease patients has increased due to improved neonatal screening and enzyme replacement therapy. Nevertheless, the potential effect of frequent medical device exposure on pubertal development in these patients is not well understood, so further investigation is warranted. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the growth and puberty of nine Pompe disease patients. In addition, to determine the effects of frequent plastic medical device exposure in these patients, we measured urinary phthalate metabolites before and one day after enzyme replacement therapy. Five out of nine patients (55%) with Pompe disease on enzyme replacement therapy had precocious puberty. Patients with precocious puberty had significantly shorter predicted adult heights compared to those with normal puberty (<i>p</i> = 0.014). The levels of mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP) increased after enzyme replacement therapy, but the average levels of phthalate metabolites did not significantly differ between patients with normal and precocious puberty. Pompe disease patients on enzyme replacement therapy tend to have precocious puberty, which may reduce their adult height. There are no significant differences in urinary phthalate metabolites between normal and precocious puberty patients. Regular follow-up of growth and puberty in Pompe disease patients is important to improve their health outcomes."

The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) among patients not previously diagnosed or tested for this entity despite presenting possible signs or symptoms of the disease in Internal Medicine departments in Spain. This epidemiological, observational, cross-sectional, multicenter study included a single cohort of individuals with clinical suspicion of LOPD seen at Internal Medicine departments in Spain. The diagnosis of LOPD was initially established on the basis of the result of DBS. If decreased enzyme acid-alpha-1,4-glucosidase (GAA) activity was detected in DBS, additional confirmatory diagnostic measurements were conducted, including GAA activity in lymphocytes, fibroblasts, or muscle and/or genetic testing. The diagnosis of LOPD was confirmed in 2 out of 322 patients (0.6%). Reasons for suspecting LOPD diagnosis were polymyositis or any type of myopathy of unknown etiology (in one patient), and asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic hyperCKemia (in the other). The time between symptom onset and LOPD diagnosis was 2.0 and 0.0 years. Both patients were asymptomatic, with no muscle weakness. Additionally, 19.7% of the non-LOPD cases received an alternative diagnosis. Our study highlights the existence of a hidden population of LOPD patients in Internal Medicine departments who might benefit from early diagnosis and early initiation of potential treatments."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare, inherited, devastating condition that causes progressive weakness, cardiomyopathy and neuromotor disease due to the accumulation of glycogen in striated and smooth muscle, as well as neurons. While enzyme replacement therapy has dramatically changed the outcome of patients with the disease, this strategy has several limitations. Gene therapy in Pompe disease constitutes an attractive approach due to the multisystem aspects of the disease and need to address the central nervous system manifestations. This review highlights the recent work in this field, including methods, progress, shortcomings, and future directions. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) and lentiviral vectors (LV) are well studied platforms for gene therapy in Pompe disease. These products can be further adapted for safe and efficient administration with concomitant immunosuppression, with the modification of specific receptors or codon optimization. rAAV has been studied in multiple clinical trials demonstrating safety and tolerability. Gene therapy for the treatment of patients with Pompe disease is feasible and offers an opportunity to fully correct the principal pathology leading to cellular glycogen accumulation. Further work is needed to overcome the limitations related to vector production, immunologic reactions and redosing."

    "abstract": "The treatment landscape for lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) is rapidly evolving. An increase in the number of preclinical and clinical studies in the last decade has demonstrated that pharmacological chaperones are a feasible alternative to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for individuals with LSDs. A systematic search was performed to retrieve and critically assess the evidence from preclinical and clinical applications of pharmacological chaperones in the treatment of LSDs and to elucidate the mechanisms by which they could be effective in clinical practice. Publications were screened according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Fifty-two articles evaluating 12 small molecules for the treatment of seven LSDs are included in this review. Overall, a substantial amount of preclinical and clinical data support the potential of pharmacological chaperones as treatments for Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, and Pompe disease. Most of the available clinical evidence evaluated migalastat for the treatment of Fabry disease. There was a lack of consistency in the terminology used to describe pharmacological chaperones in the literature. Therefore, the new small molecule chaperone (SMC) classification system is proposed to inform a standardized approach for new, emerging small molecule therapies in LSDs."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare metabolic myopathy caused by pathogenic variants affecting the activity of the lysosomal glycogen-degrading enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Impaired GAA function results in the accumulation of undegraded glycogen within lysosomes in multiple tissues but predominantly affects the skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscle. The degree of residual enzymatic activity appears to roughly correlate with the age of onset and the severity of the clinical symptoms. Here, we report four siblings in which the <i>GAA</i> variants NM_000152.5:c.2237G > C p.(Trp746Ser) and NM_000152.5:c.266G > A p.(Arg89His) were identified as an incidental finding of clinical exome sequencing. These variants are listed in the ClinVar and the Pompe disease <i>GAA</i> variant databases but are reported here for the first time in compound heterozygosity. All four siblings displayed normal urine tetrasaccharide levels and no clinical manifestations related to Pompe disease. Nevertheless, GAA enzymatic activity was within the range for late onset Pompe patients. Our report shows an association between a novel genotype and attenuated GAA enzymatic activity. The clinical significance can only be established by the regular monitoring of these individuals. The study highlights the major challenges for clinical care arising from incidental findings of next generation sequencing."

The phrenic-diaphragm motor system is affected preferentially, and respiratory failure often occurs despite GAA enzyme replacement therapy. We hypothesized that the continued use of diaphragm pacing (DP) might improve ventilator-dependent subjects' respiratory outcomes and increase ventilator-free time tolerance. Six patients (3 pediatric) underwent clinical DP implantation and started diaphragm conditioning, which involved progressively longer periods of daily, low intensity stimulation. Longitudinal respiratory breathing pattern, diaphragm electromyography, and pulmonary function tests were completed when possible, to assess feasibility of use, as well as diaphragm and ventilatory responses to conditioning. All subjects were eventually able to undergo full-time conditioning via DP and increase their maximal tolerated time off-ventilator, when compared to pre-implant function. Over time, 3 of 6 subjects also demonstrated increased or stable minute ventilation throughout the day, without positive-pressure ventilation assistance. Respiratory insufficiency is one of the main causes of death in patients with Pompe disease. Our results indicate that DP in Pompe disease was feasible, led to few adverse events and stabilized breathing for up to 7 years."

Mice with an LAMP2-exon-6-deletion (L2<sup>Δ6</sup>), develop cardiac hypertrophy followed by dilated cardiomyopathy, in association with accumulation of autophagosomes, fibrosis and oxidative stress. We investigated the effect of drugs used to treat heart failure and of LAMP2 gene therapy on the phenotype, molecular markers and ROS in LAMP2 cardiomyopathy. L2<sup>Δ6</sup> mice were treated with Angiotensin II, Ramipril, Metoprolol or Spironolactone. Gene therapy was delivered by IP injection of Adeno-associated-virus (AAV9) -LAMP2 vector to neonates (\"AAV<sub>LAMP2-</sub>Prevention\"), or at 15 weeks of age (\"AAV<sub>LAMP2-</sub>Treatment\"). Angiotensin II markedly aggravated the cardiac phenotype. Ramipril and Spironolactone were effective in attenuating left ventricular hypertrophy and preserving the systolic function. Cardiac protection was associated with decreased autophagosome accumulation, reduced fibrosis and oxidative stress. Gene therapy effectively attenuated autophagosome accumulation and ROS in L2<sup>Δ6</sup> hearts, lowering troponin release to nearly normal levels. AAV<sub>LAMP2-</sub>Prevention protected against systolic dysfunction and decreased hypertrophy. AAV<sub>LAMP2-</sub>Treatment prevented ventricular dilatation and dysfunction but had no effect on wall thickness. We conclude that RAAS inhibitors are highly effective against cardiomyopathy progression in an experimental mouse model of Danon's and shall be considered in human patients for this purpose until novel therapies become clinically available."

In this sense, a network reconstruction based on a comprehensive literature review of evidence found in PD enriched with the STRING database and other scientific articles is presented. The role of autophagic lysosome reformation, PGC-1α, MCOLN1, calcineurin, and Keap1 as intermediates between the events involved in the pathologic cascade is discussed and contextualized within their relationship with mTORC1/AMPK.

The COMET trial was a randomized, double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa in patients with LOPD aged 16-78 years at baseline. Adult participants (18 years or older) completed the PDSS and PDIS daily for 14 days at baseline and for 2 weeks before quarterly clinic visits for 1 year after randomization using an electronic diary. Data were pooled across treatment groups for the current analyses. Factor analysis and inter-item correlations were used to derive a scoring algorithm. Test-retest and internal consistency analyses examined the reliability of the measures. Correlations with criterion measures were used to evaluate validity and sensitivity to change. Anchor and distribution-based analyses were conducted to estimate thresholds for meaningful change. Five multi-item domain scores were derived from the PDSS (Shortness of Breath, Overall Fatigue, Fatigue/Pain, Upper Extremity Weakness, Pain) and 2 from the PDIS (Mood, Difficulty Performing Activities). Internal consistency (Cronbach α > 0.90) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation >0.60) of the scores were supported. Cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations with the criterion measures generally supported the validity of the scores (<i>r</i> > 0.40). Within-patient meaningful change estimates ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 points were generated for the PDSS and PDIS domain scores.

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme called acid alpha-glucosidase and is classified into infantile and late-onset forms. Since 2006, an enzyme replacement therapy involving alglucosidase alfa has been available. In 2021, a new enzyme replacement therapy involving avalglucosidase alfa demonstrated improved clinical benefits. In this article, the authors describe the pharmacokinetics of avalglucosidase alfa using a population pharmacokinetic approach. The population pharmacokinetic model was developed using a data set that included 75 patients and 2042 plasma drug concentrations determined through enzymatic activity assay from 3 studies (phases I/II and III) and involved 3 dose levels (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg). The analysis was performed using NONMEM software. Two sequences were observed in the plasma drug concentration profile: the first kinetic driving exposure, and after 12 hours postdose, a slight rebound addressing very low concentrations that lasted up to 2 weeks. Following model screening, a model with a central compartment with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination and 2 concatenated peripheral compartments was proposed. A putative back-redistribution of a marginal fraction of the drug from the second peripheral compartment to the central compartment may explain the slight rebound in concentration. The final model's mean bias and precision for individual predictions were -2.66% and 30.7%, respectively, and -0.433% and 38.9%, respectively, for population predictions. A concatenated 3-compartment model was developed to describe the avalglucosidase alfa concentrations in patients with late-onset Pompe disease. None of the covariates tested could explain the interindividual variability."

While its primary role in carbohydrate storage and energy metabolism in the liver and muscle is well characterized, recent research has highlighted critical metabolic and non-metabolic roles for glycogen in the brain. In this review, the emerging roles of glycogen homeostasis in the healthy and diseased brain are discussed with a focus on advancing our understanding of the role of glycogen in the brain. Innovative technologies that have led to novel insights into glycogen functions are detailed. Key insights into how cellular localization impacts neuronal and glial function are discussed. Perturbed glycogen functions are observed in multiple disorders of the brain, including where it serves as a disease driver in the emerging category of neurological glycogen storage diseases (n-GSDs). n-GSDs include Lafora disease (LD), adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD), Cori disease, Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (G1D), GSD0b, and late-onset Pompe disease (PD). They are neurogenetic disorders characterized by aberrant glycogen which results in devastating neurological and systemic symptoms. In the most severe cases, rapid neurodegeneration coupled with dementia results in death soon after diagnosis. Finally, we discuss current treatment strategies that are currently being developed and have the potential to be of great benefit to patients with n-GSD. Taken together, novel technologies and biological insights have resulted in a renaissance in brain glycogen that dramatically advanced our understanding of both biology and disease. Future studies are needed to expand our understanding and the multifaceted roles of glycogen and effectively apply these insights to human disease."

The mechanisms responsible for altered locomotion in adults with LOPD are unknown. The identification of clinical biomarkers is essential for clinical follow-up and research. To identify muscle determinants of impaired locomotor performance, gait stability and gait pattern, and biomechanical determinants of falls in adults with LOPD. In this cross-sectional, case-control study, LOPD and control participants underwent 3D gait analysis, locomotor performance tests and muscle strength measurements (isokinetic dynamometer). We explored the muscular determinants of locomotor performance (gait speed, 6-minute walk test distance and timed up and go test), gait stability (spatiotemporal gait variables) and the gait pattern. We also explored biomechanical gait determinants of falls. After intergroup comparisons, determinants were sought to use forward stepwise multiple regression. Eighteen participants with LOPD and 20 control participants were included. Locomotor performance, gait stability, and the gait pattern were significantly altered in LOPD compared to control participants. Hip abductor strength was the main common determinant of locomotor performance, gait stability and pelvic instability. Hip flexor strength was the main determinant of abnormal gait kinematics at the hip and knee. Percentage duration of single support phase during the gait cycle was the main determinant of falls. Hip abductor strength and percentage duration of single support during gait were the major determinants of locomotor performance, gait stability, falls and the gait pattern in LOPD. These new clinical biomarkers should therefore be systematically assessed using instrumented tools to improve the follow-up of adults with LOPD. They should also be considered in future studies to accurately assess the effects of new therapies. Hip abductor strength and single support phase should also be priority targets for rehabilitation."

Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) patients present within the first year of life with profound hypotonia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has significantly improved survival for this otherwise lethal disorder. This study aims to describe the clinical and molecular spectrum of Malaysian IOPD patients, and to analyze their long term treatment outcomes. Seventeen patients diagnosed with IOPD between 2000 and 2020 were included in this retrospective cohort study. Clinical and biochemical data were collated and analyzed using descriptive statistics. GAA enzyme levels were performed on dried blood spots. Molecular analysis of the GAA gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. Structural modelling was used to predict the effect of the novel mutations on enzyme structure. Our cohort had a median age of presentation of 3 months and median age of diagnosis of 6 months. Presenting features were hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (100%), respiratory insufficiency (94%), hypotonia (88%), failure to thrive (82%), feeding difficulties (76%), and hepatomegaly (76%). Fourteen different mutations in the GAA gene were identified, with three novel mutations, c.1552-14_1552-1del, exons 2-3 deletion and exons 6-10 deletion. The most common mutation identified was c.1935C > A p.(D645E), with an allele frequency of 33%. Sixteen patients received ERT at the median age of 7 months. Overall survival was 29%. Mean age of death was 17.5 months. Our longest surviving patient has atypical IOPD and is currently 20 years old. This is the first study to analyze the genotype and phenotype of Malaysian IOPD patients, and has identified the c.1935C > A p.(D645E) as the most common mutation. The three novel mutations reported in this study expands the mutation spectrum for IOPD.

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by α-glucosidase acid enzyme deficiency. It significantly impacts patients' health and life quality and may lead to death in the first few years of life. Among the well-established diagnostic methods, urinary glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc<sub>4</sub>) screening by high performance-liquid chromatography has been helpful in monitoring Glc<sub>4</sub> levels in patients on enzyme replacement therapy, demonstrating therapy efficacy. However, the specimen shipping process from a sample collecting location to a specialized laboratory for monitoring the Glc<sub>4</sub> is costly and presents preanalytical challenges. In this work, we developed a filter paper based-urine collection kit to facilitate specimen shipment, and liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis to determine Glc<sub>4</sub> and creatinine in dried urine on filter paper. The LC-HRMS was based on a combination of targeted and untargeted screening on the same specimen injection and was successfully developed and validated. Bland-Altman statistics revealed a good relationship between dried and liquid urine samples and Glc<sub>4</sub> and creatinine. Glc<sub>4</sub> and other metabolites in dried urine showed stability for at least 7 days at 4 and 22 °C, and 3 days at 50 °C. The stability of the analytes and the efficiency of the kit were tested simulating real conditions by sending it by post. After two days in transit without refrigeration, the stability of compounds was maintained, showing the reliability of the urine collection kit and analysis method to determine the PD biomarker Glc<sub>4</sub>."

    "abstract": "Avalglucosidase alfa (AVAL) was approved in the United States (2021) for patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), aged ≥ 1 year. In the present study, pharmacokinetic (PK) simulations were conducted to propose alternative dosing regimens for pediatric LOPD patients based on a bodyweight cut-off. Population PK (PopPK) analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed effect modeling approach on pooled data from three clinical trials with LOPD patients, and a phase 2 study (NCT03019406) with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD: 1-12 years) patients. A total of 2257 concentration-time points from 91 patients (LOPD, n = 75; IOPD, n = 16) were included in the analysis. The model was bodyweight dependent allometric scaling with time varying bodyweight included on clearance and distribution volume. Simulations were performed for two dosing regimens (20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg) with different bodyweight cut-off (25, 30, 35 and 40 kg) by generating virtual pediatric (1-17 years) and adult patients. Corresponding simulated individual exposures (maximal concentration, C<sub>max</sub> and area under the curve in the 2-week dosing interval, AUC<sub>2W</sub>), and distributions were calculated. It was found that dosing of 40 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg in pediatric patients < 30 kg and ≥ 30 kg, respectively, achieved similar AVAL exposure (based on AUC<sub>2W</sub>) to adult patients receiving 20 mg/kg. PK simulations conducted on the basis of this model provided supporting data for the currently approved US labelling for dosing adapted bodyweight in LOPD patients ≥ 1 year by USFDA."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of α-glucosidase, resulting in the accumulation of glycogen in smooth, cardiac, and skeletal muscles, leading to skeletal muscle dysfunction, proximal muscle weakness, and early respiratory insufficiency. Although many patients exhibit decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fractures, there is currently no official protocol for surveillance and management of osteoporosis and osteopenia in late onset Pompe disease (LOPD). Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has therapeutic effects on muscle function; however, very few studies report on the effect of ERT on bone mineralization in LOPD patients. Our study included 15 Pompe patients from 25 to 76 years of age on ERT for variable durations. Progressive impact of ERT on BMD of the hips and spine, and the frequency of osteopenia or osteoporosis was studied using DEXA scanning, and correlations were made with age of initiation of ERT, duration of ERT and six-minute walk test. We found a significant positive correlation between the age of ERT initiation and age of the subject, with increases in the Z-scores for the femur and lumbar region. Females had a significantly higher risk for developing osteoporosis compared to males. These results highlight the significance of ERT on reducing progression of osteoporosis in LOPD patients."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder, with onset between the first weeks after birth and adulthood, depending on its phenotype. It can affect multiple organ systems and presents itself with a wide variety of symptoms. Thus, recognizing Pompe disease is difficult. Especially since enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe disease was introduced (in Germany in 2006), early diagnosis by means of enzyme activity determination from dried blood spot analysis and genetic verification has become important for outcome and quality of life. When facing an obscure muscular disorder, it is crucial to consider Pompe disease. This article provides an overview about Pompe disease and focuses on the diagnosis of the late onset type. The most important aspects of interdiciplinary care for patients with Pompe disease are presented. Additionally, it contains a section focusing on psychosocial challenges for children with Pompe disease and their families, which may include mental disorders and social retreat, and gives advice on how to support parents of affected children."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy is under advanced clinical development for several lysosomal storage disorders. Pompe disease, a debilitating neuromuscular illness affecting infants, children, and adults with different severity, is caused by a deficiency of lysosomal glycogen-degrading enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA). Here, we demonstrated that adeno-associated virus-mediated (AAV-mediated) systemic gene transfer reversed glycogen storage in all key therapeutic targets - skeletal and cardiac muscles, the diaphragm, and the central nervous system - in both young and severely affected old Gaa-knockout mice. Furthermore, the therapy reversed secondary cellular abnormalities in skeletal muscle, such as those in autophagy and mTORC1/AMPK signaling. We used an AAV9 vector encoding a chimeric human GAA protein with enhanced uptake and secretion to facilitate efficient spread of the expressed protein among multiple target tissues. These results lay the groundwork for a future clinical development strategy in Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Sleep represents a major frontier both in clinical myology and as a new possibility for delivering treatment to neuromuscular patients since various neuromuscular cases present a variable degree of disordered sleep and such conditions should be diagnosed and prevented, i.e., sleep apnea and hypoxemia. These sleep disorders are present in dystrophinopathies and in various types of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD). Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is found in patients affected by spastic paraparesis or cerebellar ataxia but is rather common in both myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 2, and the correction of sleep disorders is therefore important to improve their daily quality of life (QoL) and consequent daily functioning. Other types of sleep dysfunction such as insomnia, a reduction in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, loss of normal REM, or sleep-disordered breathing are found in other disorders including myasthenia, ataxias, spastic paraparesis, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and neurogenic disorders, including polyneuropathies, and need appropriate treatment. Research done on this topic aims to incorporate a variety of nuances in metabolic disorders such as those in late-onset Pompe disease and are such as those in late-onset Pompe disease who are susceptible to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). The overarching goal is to explore both the diagnosis and methodology of sleep-related problems in both genetic and acquired neuromuscular disorders. We also review the type of available treatment opportunities utilized to improve neuromuscular patients' QoL."

    "abstract": "In Infantile Onset Pompe Disease (IOPD), enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) may improve survival, cardiac function, and motor development. However, even with early enzyme replacement therapy, some patients experienced poor response to ERT and abnormal motor milestones that could be due to motor neuron involvement. In this long-term retrospective study, we analyzed concomitant clinical motor outcomes and electroneuromyography (ENMG) findings in patients with IOPD and Juvenile Onset Pompe Disease (JOPD). Twenty-nine pediatric patients were included and 20 surviving were analyzed for neuromotor studies: 12 had IOPD (group 1), 4 had JOPD (group 2) and 4 (group 3) received ERT in the first month of age. Motor nerve conduction studies were mostly normal. Needle EMG performed at diagnosis always indicated the existence of myopathy that responded to ERT. Two IOPD patients (group 1) presenting with mixed motor neuropathy and myopathy displayed a poor outcome and never walked. Two patients became non-walkers (one IOPD patient and one patient of group 3) at respectively 9 and 3 years of age. One JOPD patient is about to lose walking ability. This motor deterioration was associated with the development of a motor neuropathy. Patients older than 10 years of age develop a motor neuropathy. Initial or secondary motor neuron involvement seems to be associated with a poor motor outcome showing that ERT may fail to prevent the accumulation of glycogen in motor neuron. Neurophysiological findings are important to assess severity of motor neuron damage in all Pompe pediatric patients and should be systematically performed."

    "abstract": "Starch-binding domain-containing protein 1 (STBD1) is a glycogen-binding protein discovered in skeletal muscle gene differential expression that is pivotal to cellular energy metabolism. Recent studies have indicated that STBD1 is involved in many physiological processes, such as glycophagy, glycogen accumulation, and lipid droplet formation. Moreover, dysregulation of STBD1 causes multiple diseases, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, and even cancer. Deletions and/or mutations in STBD1 promote tumorigenesis. Therefore, STBD1 has garnered considerable interest in the pathology community. In this review, we first summarized the current understanding of STBD1, including its structure, subcellular localization, tissue distribution, and biological functions. Next, we examined the roles and molecular mechanisms of STBD1 in related diseases. Based on available research, we discussed the novel function and future of STBD1, including its potential application as a therapeutic target in glycogen-related diseases. Given the significance of STBD1 in energy metabolism, an in-depth understanding of the protein is crucial for understanding physiological processes and developing therapeutic strategies for related diseases."

    "title": "History of international connections of myology in Europe.",
    "abstract": "Over the past centuries, myology as a basic and clinical science has passed through three major stages of development: the classical period, the modern nosographic stage, and the molecular era. The classical period spans the sixteenth century up to the earlier parts of the twentieth century. During this time, several major muscle diseases were clinically and pathologically characterized, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), myotonic dystrophy, and facio-scapulo-humeral dystrophy, by master clinicians such as Duchenne, Erb, Becker, Steinert, Landouzy, Dejerine, Meryon, and others. These accomplishments laid solid foundations for the following modern era with nosographic classification and the following molecular era. European clinicians and scientists were major contributors to the modern era in the second half of the twentieth century, which is characterized by three major discoveries. First, it was observed that substantial elevation of the serum activity of creatine kinase indicates muscle damage or destruction. Then, the adaptation of modern histo-and cytochemical techniques to the study of muscle biopsies markedly improved the diagnostic accuracy and made possible the identification of new changes and structures. Thirdly, the advent of modern biochemical techniques permitted the identification of various enzyme defects/storage diseases such as Pompe disease, McArdle's disease, and carnitine deficiency states. The molecular era was made possible by the strikingly fast development of molecular biology and its application to muscle diseases. This permitted the identification of gene defects in many inherited diseases, leading to an accurate and specific diagnosis. The growth of international collaboration in Europe was achieved through the exchange of international scientists and collaborative networks."

This literature review summarizes the development of gene therapy for the GSDs. The abnormal accumulation of glycogen and deficiency of glucose production in GSDs lead to unique symptoms based upon the enzyme step and tissues involved, such as liver and kidney involvement associated with severe hypoglycemia during fasting and the risk of long-term complications including hepatic adenoma/carcinoma and end stage kidney disease in GSD Ia from glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency, and cardiac/skeletal/smooth muscle involvement associated with myopathy +/- cardiomyopathy and the risk for cardiorespiratory failure in Pompe disease. These symptoms are present to a variable degree in animal models for the GSDs, which have been utilized to evaluate new therapies including gene therapy and genome editing. Gene therapy for Pompe disease and GSD Ia has progressed to Phase I and Phase III clinical trials, respectively, and are evaluating the safety and bioactivity of adeno-associated virus vectors. Clinical research to understand the natural history and progression of the GSDs provides invaluable outcome measures that serve as endpoints to evaluate benefits in clinical trials. While promising, gene therapy and genome editing face challenges with regard to clinical implementation, including immune responses and toxicities that have been revealed during clinical trials of gene therapy that are underway. Gene therapy for the glycogen storage diseases is under development, addressing an unmet need for specific, stable therapy for these conditions."

    "abstract": "The French Pompe disease registry was created in 2004 for study of the natural course of the disease in patients. It rapidly became a major tool for assessing the long-term efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) after the market release of alglucosidase-alfa. Approximately 10 years after publication of the baseline characteristics of the 126 initial patients of the French Late-Onset Pompe Disease registry, we provide here an update of the clinical and biological features of patients included in this registry. We describe 210 patients followed at 31 hospital-based French neuromuscular or metabolic centers. The median age at inclusion was 48.67 ± 14.91 years. The first symptom was progressive lower limb muscle weakness, either isolated (50%) or associated with respiratory symptoms (18%), at a median age of 38 ± 14.9 years. At inclusion, 64% of the patients were able to walk independently and 14% needed a wheelchair. Positive associations were found between motor function measure, manual motor test, and 6-minute walk test (6MWT) results, and these parameters were inversely associated with the time taken to sit up from a lying position at inclusion. Seventy-two patients had been followed for at least 10 years in the registry. Thirty-three patients remained untreated a median of 12 years after symptom onset. The standard ERT dose was administered for 177 patients. This update confirms previous findings for the adult population included in the French Pompe disease registry, but with a lower clinical severity at inclusion, suggesting that this rare disease is now diagnosed earlier; thanks to greater awareness among physicians. The 6MWT remains an important method for assessing motor performance and walking ability. The French Pompe disease registry provides an exhaustive, nationwide overview of Pompe disease and can be used to assess individual and global responses to future treatments."

There are two phenotypes: infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). The objective was to evaluate the diagnostic and follow-up outcomes of children identified with PD through newborn screening (NBS) in the state of Minnesota over a 4-year period. This study is a retrospective analysis of infants born in Minnesota between August 1, 2017, and July 31, 2021, by the Minnesota Department of Health NBS Program for Pompe disease. Newborn screening and clinical diagnostic data are summarized for all newborns with positive newborn screens for Pompe disease. Children with IOPD had abnormal biomarkers necessitating immediate initiation of treatment. Children with LOPD are asymptomatic to date (1.25-4.58 years) with normal biomarkers including creatine kinase, urine glucotetrasaccharides, liver function tests, and echocardiogram. The estimated birth prevalence of PD is 1:15,160. The positive predictive value for PD was 81% with a false positive rate of 1.9 per 10 positive screens. 32% of the children with LOPD were lost to follow up among which 66% were from minority ethnic groups. This emphasizes the disparity in access to health care among specific demographics, as well as the importance of a primary care provider's early involvement in educating these families.

Previous studies quantitatively analyzed static upright posture, spatial-temporal parameters, and kinematics of the lower limbs and trunk, considered as single bone segment. Sagittal plane analysis of the spine and whole body during walking has never been investigated in patients with LOPD. The aim of the study was to evaluate sagittal kinematics and imbalance of the spine and whole body in patients with LOPD by three-dimensional (3-D)-motion analysis using an appropriate marker set protocol and introducing innovative kinematic parameters. Seven siblings with LOPD were assessed by 3-D-stereophotogrammetry using the DB-total protocol, which allows to analyze sagittal alignment of whole body. Fourteen age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were used as controls. LOPD group showed a flattening of the spinal curvatures, with a head and neck posteriorization with respect to sacrum, a significant increase of concavity in Heel-S2-Nasion/C7 angles, a rear-position of upper limbs with respect to pelvis, a shorter pendular activity, and a trend of elbow extension during ambulation. Moreover, a significant increase of excursion range in most of sagittal parameters was found. The present study highlighted a specific pathological postural pattern, resembling \"man falling backwards,\" which reveals a biomechanical compensation strategy of patients with LOPD to maintain the balance against the instability of the spinopelvic region, kinematically verified by increase of the excursion ranges.

We observed no complete disease specificity for any of the markers tested. However, comparison among the different LSDs highlighted new applications and perspectives of the existing biomarkers. We observed elevations in glucosylceramide isoforms in the NPC and Gaucher patients relative to the controls. In NPC, there was a greater proportion of C24 isoforms, giving a specificity of 96-97% for NPC, higher than 92% for the NPC biomarker N-palmitoyl-O-phosphocholineserine ratio to lyso-sphingomyelin. We also observed significantly elevated levels of lyso-dihexosylceramide in Gaucher and Fabry disease as well as elevated lyso-globotriaosylceramide (Lyso-Gb3) in Gaucher disease and the neuronopathic forms of Mucopolysaccharidoses. In conclusion, DBS glucosylceramide isoform profiling has increased the specificity for the detection of NPC, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. Low levels of lyso-lipids can be observed in other LSDs, which may have implications in their disease pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease caused by mutations in the gene that encodes acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA)-an enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing lysosomal glycogen. GAA deficiency results in systemic lysosomal glycogen accumulation and cellular disruption. Glycogen accumulation in skeletal muscles, motor neurons, and airway smooth muscle cells is known to contribute to respiratory insufficiency in Pompe disease. However, the impact of GAA deficiency on the distal alveolar type 1 and type 2 cells (AT1 and AT2) has not been evaluated. AT1 cells rely on lysosomes for cellular homeostasis so that they can maintain a thin barrier for gas exchange, whereas AT2 cells depend on lysosome-like structures (lamellar bodies) for surfactant production. Using a mouse model of Pompe disease, the <i>Gaa</i><sup>-/-</sup> mouse, we investigated the consequences of GAA deficiency on AT1 and AT2 cells using histology, pulmonary function and mechanics, and transcriptional analysis. Histological analysis revealed increased accumulation of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) in the <i>Gaa</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice lungs. Furthermore, ultrastructural examination showed extensive intracytoplasmic vacuoles enlargement and lamellar body engorgement. Respiratory dysfunction was confirmed using whole body plethysmography and forced oscillometry. Finally, transcriptomic analysis demonstrated dysregulation of surfactant proteins in AT2 cells, specifically reduced levels of surfactant protein D in the <i>Gaa</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. We conclude that GAA enzyme deficiency leads to glycogen accumulation in the distal airway cells that disrupts surfactant homeostasis and contributes to respiratory impairments in Pompe disease.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This research highlights the impact of Pompe disease on distal airway cells. Prior to this work, respiratory insufficiency in Pompe disease was classically attributed to pathology in respiratory muscles and motor neurons.

To investigate the potential of NfL, we analyzed serum samples of patients with classic infantile Pompe disease who were treated with ERT. The samples were collected at ages of <1, 5, and 10 years, as well as around MRI scans. We compared the outcomes with levels in age- and sex-matched peers.

We analyzed 74 serum samples of 17 patients collected at ages ranging from 22 days to 21.2 years (1-8 samples per patient) and compared these with outcomes of 71 matched peers. In the first year of age, NfL levels in patients and controls were similar (10.3 vs 11.0 pg/mL), but mixed linear model analysis showed a yearly increase of NfL of 6.0% in patients, compared with a decrease of 8.8% in controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Higher NfL was associated with lower IQ scores (<i>p</i> = 0.009) and lower processing speed scores (<i>p</i> = 0.001).

Home-based ERT is unavailable in many countries because of the boxed warning alglucosidase alfa received due to the risk of infusion-associated reactions (IARs). Since 2008, home infusions have been provided in The Netherlands. This study aimed to provide an overview of our experience with home-based infusions with alglucosidase alfa in adult Pompe patients, focusing on safety, including management of IARs. We analysed infusion data and IARs from adult patients starting ERT between 1999 and 2018. ERT was initially given in the hospital during the first year. Patients were eligible for home treatment if they were without IARs for multiple consecutive infusions and if a trained home nurse, with on-call back-up by a doctor, was available. The healthcare providers graded IARs. We analysed data on 18,380 infusions with alglucosidase alfa in 121 adult patients; 4961 infusions (27.0%) were given in hospital and 13,419 (73.0%) were given at home. IARs occurred in 144 (2.9%) hospital infusions and 113 (0.8%) home infusions; 115 (79.9% of 144) IARs in hospital and 104 (92.0% of 113) IARs at home were mild, 25 IARs (17.4%) in hospital and 8 IARs (7.1%) at home were moderate, and very few severe IARs occurred (4 IARs in hospital [2.8%] and 1 IAR at home [0.9%]). Only one IAR in the home situation required immediate clinical evaluation in the hospital. Given the small numbers of IARs that occurred with the home infusions, of which only one was severe, we conclude that alglucosidase alfa can be administered safely in the home situation, provided the appropriate infrastructure is present."

    "title": "Phosphorus Dendrimers for Metal-Free Ligation: Design of Multivalent Pharmacological Chaperones against Gaucher Disease.",
    "abstract": "The first phosphorus dendrimers built on a cyclotriphosphazene core and decorated with six or twelve monofluorocyclooctyne units were prepared. A simple stirring allowed the grafting of N-hexyl deoxynojirimycin inhitopes onto their surface by copper-free strain promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition click reaction. The synthesized iminosugars clusters were tested as multivalent inhibitors of the biologically relevant enzymes β-glucocerebrosidase and acid α-glucosidase, involved in Gaucher and Pompe lysosomal storage diseases, respectively. For both enzymes, all the multivalent compounds were more potent than the reference N-hexyl deoxynojirimycin. Remarkably, the final dodecavalent compound proved to be one of the best β-glucocerebrosidase inhibitors described to date. These cyclotriphosphazene-based deoxynojirimycin dendrimers were then evaluated as pharmacological chaperones against Gaucher disease. Not only did these multivalent constructs cross the cell membranes but they were also able to increase β-glucocerebrosidase activity in Gaucher cells. Notably, dodecavalent compound allowed a 1.4-fold enzyme activity enhancement at a concentration as low as 100 nM. These new monofluorocyclooctyne-presenting dendrimers may further find numerous applications in the synthesis of multivalent objects for biological and pharmacological purposes."

    "title": "Hypersensitivity infusion-associated reactions induced by enzyme replacement therapy in a cohort of patients with late-onset Pompe disease: An experience from the French Pompe Registry.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare hereditary glycogen storage disorder due to lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the only available treatment. Infusion-associated reactions (IAR) are challenging since there are no guidelines for ERT rechallenge after a drug hypersensitivity reaction (DHR) in Pompe disease. The objective of the present study was to describe IAR and their management in late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) patients in France, and to discuss the various possibilities of ERT rechallenge. An exhaustive screening of LOPD patients receiving ERT between 2006 and 2020 from the 31-participating hospital-based or reference centers was performed. The patients who had presented at least one hypersensitivity IAR (=DHR) episode were included. Demographic characteristics of the patients, IAR onset and timing, were retrospectively collected from the French Pompe Registry. Fifteen patients among 115 treated LOPD patients in France presented at least 1 IAR; 80.0% were women. Twenty-nine IAR were reported; 18 (62.1%) IAR were Grade I reactions, 10 (34.5%) IAR were Grade II, and 1 (3.4%) IAR was Grade III. IgE-mediated hypersensitivity was found in 2/15 patients (13.3%). The median [IQR] time from ERT introduction to the first IAR was 15.0 months [11.0-24.0]. ERT was safely and effectively re-introduced either with premedication alone, or in combination with either modified regimen or desensitization protocol, in all 9 rechallenged patients; including in patients with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, in the patient with the Grade III reaction, as well as in patients with very high anti-GAA titer. Based on the results herein and previous reports, we discuss premedication and modified regimen for Grade I reactions, and desensitization in Grade II and III reactions. In conclusion, ERT-induced IAR can be safely and effectively managed with a modified regimen or desensitization protocol in LOPD patients."

    "title": "Mitochondrial reprogramming in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with glycogen storage disease type Ia.",
    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa) is an inborn metabolic disorder caused by the deficiency of glucose-6-phospatase-α (G6Pase-α) leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. It remains unclear whether mitochondrial dysfunction is present in patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and whether dietary treatment can play a role. The aim of this study was to investigate mitochondrial function in PBMC of GSDIa patients. Ten GSDIa patients and 10 age-, sex- and fasting-time matched controls were enrolled. Expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function and activity of key fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and Krebs cycle proteins were assessed in PBMC. Targeted metabolomics and assessment of metabolic control markers were also performed. Adult GSDIa patients showed increased CPT1A, SDHB, TFAM, mTOR expression (p < 0.05) and increased VLCAD, CPT2 and citrate synthase activity in PBMC (p < 0.05). VLCAD activity directly correlated with WC (p < 0.01), BMI (p < 0.05), serum malonycarnitine levels (p < 0.05). CPT2 activity directly correlated with BMI (p < 0.05). Mitochondrial reprogramming is detectable in PBMC of GSDIa patients. This feature may develop as an adaptation to the liver enzyme defect and may be triggered by dietary (over)treatment in the frame of G6Pase-α deficiency. PBMC can represent an adequate mean to assess (diet-induced) metabolic disturbances in GSDIa."

    "abstract": "Primary mitochondrial myopathies (PMMs) encompass a group of genetic disorders that impair mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, adversely affecting physical function, exercise capacity, and quality of life (QoL). Current PMM standards of care address symptoms, with limited clinical impact, constituting a significant therapeutic unmet need. We present data from MMPOWER-3, a pivotal, phase-3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of elamipretide in participants with genetically confirmed PMM. After screening, eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either 24 weeks of elamipretide at a dose of 40 mg/d or placebo subcutaneously. Primary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline to week 24 on the distance walked on the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and total fatigue on the Primary Mitochondrial Myopathy Symptom Assessment (PMMSA). Secondary endpoints included most bothersome symptom score on the PMMSA, NeuroQoL Fatigue Short-Form scores, and the patient global impression and clinician global impression of PMM symptoms. Participants (N = 218) were randomized (n = 109 elamipretide; n = 109 placebo). The m0ean age was 45.6 years (64% women; 94% White). Most of the participants (n = 162 [74%]) had mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alteration, with the remainder having nuclear DNA (nDNA) defects. At screening, the most frequent bothersome PMM symptom on the PMMSA was tiredness during activities (28.9%). At baseline, the mean distance walked on the 6MWT was 336.7 ± 81.2 meters, the mean score for total fatigue on the PMMSA was 10.6 ± 2.5, and the mean T score for the Neuro-QoL Fatigue Short-Form was 54.7 ± 7.5. The study did not meet its primary endpoints assessing changes in the 6MWT and PMMSA total fatigue score (TFS). Between the participants receiving elamipretide and those receiving placebo, the difference in the least squares mean (SE) from baseline to week 24 on distance walked on the 6MWT was -3.2 (95% CI -18.7 to 12.3; <i>p</i> = 0.69) meters, and on the PMMSA, the total fatigue score was -0.07 (95% CI -0.10 to 0.26; <i>p</i> = 0.37). Elamipretide treatment was well-tolerated with most adverse events being mild to moderate in severity. Subcutaneous elamipretide treatment did not improve outcomes in the 6MWT and PMMSA TFS in patients with PMM. However, this phase-3 study demonstrated that subcutaneous elamipretide is well-tolerated. Trial registered with clinicaltrials.gov, Clinical Trials Identifier: NCT03323749; submitted on October 12, 2017; first patient enrolled October 9, 2017. gov/ct2/show/NCT03323749?term = elamipretide&draw = 2&rank = 9. This study provides Class I evidence that elamipretide does not improve the 6MWT or fatigue at 24 weeks compared with placebo in patients with primary mitochondrial myopathy."

    "abstract": "This consensus statement by a panel of neurology experts aimed to provide a practical and implementable guidance document to assist clinicians with the best clinical practice in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). The participating experts consider the clinical suspicion of LOPD by the physician to be of utmost importance in the prevention of diagnostic and therapeutic delay in LOPD patients. A diagnostic algorithm is proposed to facilitate the diagnosis of LOPD in patients presenting with unexplained proximal/axial weakness (with or without respiratory symptoms) or restrictive respiratory insufficiency with hyperCKemia and/or exercise intolerance as the red flag symptoms/signs that raise the index of suspicion for LOPD diagnosis. The diagnosis is based on the subsequent use of dried blood spot (DBS) assay, and the DBS assay can be confirmed by acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) tissue analysis in leukocytes, fibroblasts, or muscle fibers and/or genetic mutation analysis. Accordingly, experts consider increased awareness among physicians about potential presenting characteristics with a high index of suspicion for LOPD to be crucial to suspect and consider LOPD in the differential diagnosis, while strongly suggesting the use of a diagnostic algorithm combined with DBS assay and confirmatory tests in the timely diagnosis of LOPD and implementation of best practice patterns."

    "title": "Nutritional management of glycogen storage disease type III: a case report and a critical appraisal of the literature.",
    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease Type III (GSD III) is an autosomal recessive disease due to the deficiency of the debranching enzyme, which has two main consequences: a reduced availability of glucose due to the incomplete degradation of glycogen, and the accumulation of abnormal glycogen in liver and cardiac/skeletal muscle. The role of dietary lipid manipulations in the nutritional management of GSD III is still debated. A literature overview shows that low-carbohydrate (CHO) / high-fat diets may be beneficial in reducing muscle damage. We present a 24-year GSD IIIa patient with severe myopathy and cardiomyopathy in whom a gradual shift from a high-CHO diet (61% total energy intake), low-fat (18%), high-protein (21%) to a low-CHO (32 %) high-fat (45%) / high-protein (23%) diet was performed. CHO was mainly represented by high-fiber, low glycemic index food, and fat consisted prevalently of mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids. After a 2-year follow-up, all biomarkers of muscle and heart damage markedly decreased (by 50-75%), glucose levels remained within the normal range and lipid profile was unchanged. At echocardiography, there was an improvement in geometry and left ventricular function. A low -CHO, high-fat, high-protein diet seems to be safe, sustainable and effective in reducing muscle damage without worsening cardiometabolic profile in GSDIIIa. This dietary approach could be started as early as possible in GSD III displaying skeletal/cardiac muscle disease in order to prevent/minimize organ damage."

    "title": "Metabolic Myopathies in the Era of Next-Generation Sequencing.",
    "abstract": "Metabolic myopathies are rare inherited disorders that deserve more attention from neurologists and pediatricians. Pompe disease and McArdle disease represent some of the most common diseases in clinical practice; however, other less common diseases are now better-known. In general the pathophysiology of metabolic myopathies needs to be better understood. Thanks to the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), genetic testing has replaced more invasive investigations and sophisticated enzymatic assays to reach a final diagnosis in many cases. The current diagnostic algorithms for metabolic myopathies have integrated this paradigm shift and restrict invasive investigations for complicated cases. Moreover, NGS contributes to the discovery of novel genes and proteins, providing new insights into muscle metabolism and pathophysiology. More importantly, a growing number of these conditions are amenable to therapeutic approaches such as diets of different kinds, exercise training protocols, and enzyme replacement therapy or gene therapy. Prevention and management-notably of rhabdomyolysis-are key to avoiding serious and potentially life-threatening complications and improving patients' quality of life. Although not devoid of limitations, the newborn screening programs that are currently mushrooming across the globe show that early intervention in metabolic myopathies is a key factor for better therapeutic efficacy and long-term prognosis. As a whole NGS has largely increased the diagnostic yield of metabolic myopathies, but more invasive but classical investigations are still critical when the genetic diagnosis is unclear or when it comes to optimizing the follow-up and care of these muscular disorders."

    "abstract": "Classical infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is the most severe form of Pompe disease. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has significantly increased survival but only a few studies have reported long-term outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of classical IOPD patients diagnosed in France between 2004 and 2020. Sixty-four patients were identified. At diagnosis (median age 4 months) all patients had cardiomyopathy and most had severe hypotonia (57 of 62 patients, 92%). ERT was initiated in 50 (78%) patients and stopped later due to being ineffective in 10 (21%). Thirty-seven (58%) patients died during follow-up, including all untreated and discontinued ERT patients, and 13 additional patients. Mortality was higher during the first 3 years of life and after the age of 12 years. Persistence of cardiomyopathy during follow-up and/or the presence of heart failure were highly associated with an increased risk of death. In contrast, cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM)-negative status (n = 16, 26%) was unrelated to increased mortality, presumably because immunomodulation protocols prevent the emergence of high antibody titers to ERT. Besides survival, decreased ERT efficacy appeared after the age of 6 years, with a progressive decline in motor and pulmonary functions for most survivors. This study reports the long-term follow-up of one of the largest cohorts of classical IOPD patients and demonstrates high long-term mortality and morbidity rates with a secondary decline in muscular and respiratory functions. This decreased efficacy seems to be multifactorial, highlighting the importance of developing new therapeutic approaches targeting various aspects of pathogenesis."

First compounds are already available in clinical practice and numerous other substances are in advanced phases of clinical trials. This article gives an exemplary overview of the current state of clinical research in molecular therapies of neuromuscular diseases. It also gives a view into the near future of the clinical application, including the challenges. Using Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and myotubular myopathy as examples, the principles of gene addition in monogenetic skeletal muscle diseases, which are already manifested in childhood are described. In addition to initial successes, the challenges and setbacks hindering the approval and regular clinical application of further compounds are demonstrated. Furthermore, the state of current clinical research in Becker-Kiener muscular dystrophy (BMD) and the numerous forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) are summarized. Numerous new therapeutic approaches and a corresponding outlook are also shown for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), Pompe disease, and myotonic dystrophy. Clinical research in the field of molecular therapy of neuromuscular diseases is one of the pacesetters of modern precision medicine; however, challenges need to be seen, jointly addressed and overcome in the future."

    "abstract": "Clenbuterol, a beta-agonist, has plausible mechanisms for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this highly inclusive open-label trial (NCT04245709), we aimed to study the safety and efficacy of clenbuterol in patients with ALS. All participants received clenbuterol starting at 40 μg daily and increased to 80 μg twice daily. Outcomes included safety, tolerability, ALS Functional Rating Score (ALSFRS-R) progression, forced vital capacity (FVC) progression, and myometry. ALSFRS-R and FVC slopes measured during treatment were compared with slopes before treatment (calculated by assuming ALSFRS-R was 48 and FVC was 100% at ALS onset). The 25 participants had a mean age of 59, mean disease duration of 43 months, ALSFRS-R score at enrollment 34, and FVC at enrollment 77%. Forty-eight percent were female, 68% were taking riluzole, and none were taking edaravone. Two participants experienced severe adverse events, neither related to the study. Twenty-four participants experienced adverse events, most commonly tremors/jitters, cramps/spasms, insomnia, and stiffness/spasticity. Fourteen participants withdrew early from the trial, 13 due to adverse events. Patients who withdrew early were significantly older and more likely to be male. Per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses showed meaningfully slower ALSFRS-R and FVC progression during treatment. Hand grip dynamometry and myometry changes were highly variable between participants; most declined slowly, but some showed improvements. Clenbuterol was safe but less tolerable at the doses we selected compared with an earlier Italian case series. Consistent with that series, our study suggested benefits on ALS progression. However, the latter result should be interpreted with caution as our study is limited by small sample size, large drop out, lack of randomization, and blinding and placebo controls. A larger, more traditional trial now seems warranted."

    "abstract": "To explore the clinical features, lysosomal enzymatic [acid α-glucosidase (GAA)] activities and genetic variants in a child with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). Clinical data of a child who had presented at the Genetic Counseling Clinic of West China Second University Hospital in August 2020 was retrospectively analyzed. Blood samples were collected from the patient and her parents for the isolation of leukocytes and lymphocytes as well as DNA extraction. The activity of lysosomal enzyme GAA in leukocytes and lymphocytes was analyzed with or without addition of inhibitor of GAA isozyme. Potential variants in genes associated with neuromuscular disorders were analyzed, in addition with conservation of the variant sites and protein structure. The remaining samples from 20 individuals undergoing peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosomal karyotyping were mixed and used as the normal reference for the enzymatic activities. The child, a 9-year-old female, had featured delayed language and motor development from 2 years and 11 months. Physical examination revealed unstable walking, difficulty in going upstairs and obvious scoliosis. Her serum creatine kinase was significantly increased, along with abnormal electromyography, whilst no abnormality was found by cardiac ultrasound. Genetic testing revealed that she has harbored compound heterozygous variants of the GAA gene, namely c.1996dupG (p.A666Gfs*71) (maternal) and c.701C>T (p.T234M) (paternal). Based on the guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, the c.1996dupG (p.A666Gfs*71) was rated as pathogenic (PVS1+PM2_Supporting+PM3), whilst the c.701C>T (p.T234M) was rated as likely pathogenic (PM1+PM2_Supporting+PM3+PM5+PP3). The GAA in the leukocytes from the patient, her father and mother were respectively 76.1%, 91.3% and 95.6% of the normal value without the inhibitor, and 70.8%, 112.9% and 128.2% of the normal value with the inhibitor, whilst the activity of GAA in their leukocytes had decreased by 6 ~ 9 times after adding the inhibitor. GAA in lymphocytes of the patient, her father and mother were 68.3%, 59.0% and 59.5% of the normal value without the inhibitor, and 41.0%, 89.5% and 57.7% of the normal value with the inhibitor, the activity of GAA in lymphocytes has decreased by 2 ~ 5 times after adding the inhibitor. The child was diagnosed with LOPD due to the c.1996dupG and c.701C>T compound heterozygous variants of the GAA gene. The residual activity of GAA among LOPD patients can range widely and the changes may be atypical. The diagnosis of LOPD should not be based solely on the results of enzymatic activity but combined clinical manifestation, genetic testing and measurement of enzymatic activity."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by acid α-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency. Reduced GAA activity leads to pathological glycogen accumulation in cardiac and skeletal muscles responsible for severe heart impairment, respiratory defects, and muscle weakness. Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) is the standard-of-care treatment for PD, however, its efficacy is limited due to poor uptake in muscle and the development of an immune response. Multiple clinical trials are ongoing in PD with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors based on liver- and muscle-targeting. Current gene therapy approaches are limited by liver proliferation, poor muscle targeting, and the potential immune response to the hGAA transgene. To generate a treatment tailored to infantile-onset PD, we took advantage of a novel AAV capsid able to increase skeletal muscle targeting compared to AAV9 while reducing liver overload. When combined with a liver-muscle tandem promoter (LiMP), and despite the extensive liver-detargeting, this vector had a limited immune response to the hGAA transgene. This combination of capsid and promoter with improved muscle expression and specificity allowed for glycogen clearance in cardiac and skeletal muscles of Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> adult mice. In neonate Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> , complete rescue of glycogen content and muscle strength was observed 6 months after AAV vector injection. Our work highlights the importance of residual liver expression to control the immune response toward a potentially immunogenic transgene expressed in muscle. In conclusion, the demonstration of the efficacy of a muscle-specific AAV capsid-promoter combination for the full rescue of PD manifestation in both neonate and adult Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> provides a potential therapeutic avenue for the infantile-onset form of this devastating disease."

In this study, we provide a comprehensive description of articulation, resonance, and voice in children with Pompe disease. Fifteen children with Pompe disease (11 with infantile-onset Pompe disease [IOPD], four with late-onset Pompe disease [LOPD]) ranging from 6 to 18 years of age participated in standard speech assessments. Measures included maximum tongue pressure; nasalance; cepstral peak prominence (CPP); low/high ratio (L/H ratio); diadochokinetic (DDK) rates; percent consonants correct (PCC); and visual analog scale (VAS) ratings of articulation, resonance, voice quality, and overall speech severity. Maximum tongue pressures, nasalance, CPP, L/H ratio, DDK rates, and PCC were compared to normative data from typically developing (TD) children. Correlation analyses and multiple regression models of speech measure predictors were conducted. Children with IOPD had greater speech impairment than those with LOPD. The IOPD group had lower maximum tongue pressures, slower articulation rates, lower PCC scores, higher nasalance, and higher L/H voice ratios than TD children. VAS ratings confirmed the presence of impaired articulatory precision, hypernasality, and dysphonia for most of the children with IOPD, with severity of impairment ratings ranging from mild to severe. The LOPD group had mildly elevated nasalance and L/H ratio values relative to TD children, and auditory-perceptual ratings suggested mild to no speech impairment. Speech disorders involving articulatory precision, resonance balance, and voice quality are common in children with Pompe disease, especially in those with IOPD. With improvements in the detection and treatment of Pompe disease, clinicians should be aware of the associated speech deficits."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a monogenic autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic variants of the <i>GAA</i> gene encoding lysosomal alpha-glucosidase; its loss causes glycogen storage in lysosomes, mainly in the muscular tissue. The genotype-phenotype correlation has been extensively discussed, and caution is recommended when interpreting the clinical significance of any mutation in a single patient. As there is no evidence that environmental factors can modulate the phenotype, the observed clinical variability in PD suggests that genetic variants other than pathogenic GAA mutations influence the mechanisms of muscle damage/repair and the overall clinical picture. Genes encoding proteins involved in glycogen synthesis and catabolism may represent excellent candidates as phenotypic modifiers of PD. The genes analyzed for glycogen synthesis included <i>UGP2,</i> glycogenin (<i>GYG1</i>-muscle, <i>GYG2</i>, and other tissues), glycogen synthase (<i>GYS1</i>-muscle and <i>GYS2</i>-liver), <i>GBE1</i>, <i>EPM2A, NHLRC1</i>, <i>GSK3A,</i> and <i>GSK3B.</i> The only enzyme involved in glycogen catabolism in lysosomes is α-glucosidase, which is encoded by <i>GAA</i>, while two cytoplasmic enzymes, phosphorylase (<i>PYGB</i>-brain, <i>PGL</i>-liver, and <i>PYGM</i>-muscle) and glycogen debranching (<i>AGL</i>) are needed to obtain glucose 1-phosphate or free glucose. Here, we report the potentially relevant variants in genes related to glycogen synthesis and catabolism, identified by whole exome sequencing in a group of 30 patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). In our exploratory analysis, we observed a reduced number of variants in the genes expressed in muscles versus the genes expressed in other tissues, but we did not find a single variant that strongly affected the phenotype. From our work, it also appears that the current clinical scores used in LOPD do not describe muscle impairment with enough qualitative/quantitative details to correlate it with genes that, even with a slightly reduced function due to genetic variants, impact the phenotype."

    "abstract": "Enzyme replacement therapy shows remarkable clinical improvement in treating lysosomal storage disorders. However, this therapeutic approach is hampered by limitations in the delivery of the enzyme to cells and tissues. Therefore, there is an urgent, unmet clinical need to develop new strategies to enhance the enzyme delivery to diseased cells. Graphene-based materials, due to their dimensionality and favourable pattern of interaction with cells, represent a promising platform for the loading and delivery of therapeutic cargo. Herein, the potential use of graphene-based materials, including defect-free graphene with positive or negative surface charge and graphene oxide with different lateral dimensions, was investigated for the delivery of lysosomal enzymes in fibroblasts derived from patients with Mucopolysaccharidosis VI and Pompe disease. We report excellent biocompatibility of all graphene-based materials up to a concentration of 100 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> in the cell lines studied. In addition, a noticeable difference in the uptake profile of the materials was observed. Neither type of graphene oxide was taken up by the cells to a significant extent. In contrast, the two types of graphene were efficiently taken up, localizing in the lysosomes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cationic graphene flakes can be used as carriers for arylsulfatase B enzyme, for the delivery of the lacking enzyme to the lysosomes of Mucopolysaccharidosis VI fibroblasts. Arylsulfatase B complexed with cationic graphene flakes not only retained the enzymatic activity, but also exerted biological effects almost twice as high as arylsulfatase B alone in the clearance of the substrate in Mucopolysaccharidosis VI fibroblasts. This study lays the groundwork for the potential use of graphene-based materials as carriers for enzyme replacement therapy in lysosomal storage disorders."

Prospective data on symptoms occurring during or within 48 h after infusion and retrospective data on infusion associated reactions (IARs) in the last three months were collected four times during one year. In total, 116 out of 120 eligible patients (17 classic infantile, 2 atypical infantile, 15 childhood onset and 82 adult) filled out 423 questionnaires (response rate: 88.1%). Symptoms during or after infusion were reported 27 times in 17 patients. Fatigue was the most commonly reported health complaint (in 9.5% of patients). Four health complaints were judged to be IARs and reported to the Erasmus MC University Medical Center. None of the IARs reported in this study warranted emergency clinical care. Our data demonstrate that home-based ERT in Pompe disease can be safely implemented as few, mostly mild, symptoms were reported during or after infusion. Insights from this study can be used as a base for implementing home-based ERT in other countries and to further optimize patient care, as unreported mild symptoms do not pose a health risk but may still be relevant to the patient."

    "title": "An artificial intelligence-based approach for identifying rare disease patients using retrospective electronic health records applied for Pompe disease.",
    "abstract": "We retrospectively screened 350,116 electronic health records (EHRs) to identify suspected patients for Pompe disease. Using these suspected patients, we then describe their phenotypical characteristics and estimate the prevalence in the respective population covered by the EHRs. We applied Symptoma's Artificial Intelligence-based approach for identifying rare disease patients to retrospective anonymized EHRs provided by the \"University Hospital Salzburg\" clinic group. Within 1 month, the AI screened 350,116 EHRs reaching back 15 years from five hospitals, and 104 patients were flagged as probable for Pompe disease. Flagged patients were manually reviewed and assessed by generalist and specialist physicians for their likelihood for Pompe disease, from which the performance of the algorithms was evaluated. Of the 104 patients flagged by the algorithms, generalist physicians found five \"diagnosed,\" 10 \"suspected,\" and seven patients with \"reduced suspicion.\" After feedback from Pompe disease specialist physicians, 19 patients remained clinically plausible for Pompe disease, resulting in a specificity of 18.27% for the AI. Estimating from the remaining plausible patients, the prevalence of Pompe disease for the greater Salzburg region [incl. Bavaria (Germany), Styria (Austria), and Upper Austria (Austria)] was one in every 18,427 people. Phenotypes for patient cohorts with an approximated onset of symptoms above or below 1 year of age were established, which correspond to infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), respectively. Our study shows the feasibility of Symptoma's AI-based approach for identifying rare disease patients using retrospective EHRs. Via the algorithm's screening of an entire EHR population, a physician had only to manually review 5.47 patients on average to find one suspected candidate. This efficiency is crucial as Pompe disease, while rare, is a progressively debilitating but treatable neuromuscular disease. As such, we demonstrated both the efficiency of the approach and the potential of a scalable solution to the systematic identification of rare disease patients. Thus, similar implementation of this methodology should be encouraged to improve care for all rare disease patients."

There is not enough information about the course of coronavirus disease in lysosomal storage diseases. This study aimed to evaluate coronavirus disease vaccination status and the impact of coronavirus disease on lysosomal storage disease. The study included 87 lysosomal storage disease patients. The patients' diagnoses were Gaucher, mucopolysaccharidosis I, II, IVA, VI, VII, Fabry, and Pompe. A questionnaire assessing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure, coronavirus disease symptoms, and vaccine status was administered in person or by phone calls. The number of coronavirus disease positive patients was 8 (9.1%). Only 2 patients were treated in the intensive care unit. Other coronavirus disease patients had mild symptoms and stayed in-home quarantine. Patients over 12 years of age could receive a COVID-19 vaccine. 63.5% of those aged ≥12 years were vaccinated. Lysosomal storage disease patients did not have an increased risk of COVID-19 compared to the healthy population, despite the chronic inflammatory disease.

    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease type 1b (GSD1b) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by defective glucose-6-phosphate transporter encoded by SLC37A4 leading to the accumulation of glycogen in various tissues. The high rate of consanguineous marriages in Tunisian population provides an ideal environment to facilitate the identification of homozygous pathogenic mutations. We aimed to determine the clinical and genetic profiles of patients with GSD1b to evaluate SLC37A4 mutations spectrum in Tunisian patients. All exons and flanking intron regions of SLC37A4 gene were screened by direct sequencing to identify mutations and polymorphisms in three unrelated families with GSD1b. Bioinformatics tools were then used to predict the impacts of identified mutations on the structure and function of protein in order to propose a function-structure relationship of the G6PT1 protein. Three patients (MT, MB and SI) in Families I, II and III who had the severe phenotype were homoallelic for the two identified mutations: p.R300H (famillies I, II) and p.W393X (Family III), respectively. One of the alterations was a missense mutation p.R300H of exon 6 in SLC37A4 gene. The analysis of the protein structure flexibility upon p.R300H mutation using DynaMut tool and CABS-flex 2.0 server showed that the reported mutation increase the molecule flexibility of in the cytosol region and would probably lead to significant conformational changes. This is the first Tunisian report of SLC37A4 mutations identified in Tunisia causing the glycogenosis type Ib disease. Bioinformatics analysis allowed us to establish an approximate structure-function relationship for the G6PT1 protein, thereby providing better genotype/phenotype correlation knowledge."

    "abstract": "The estimated global prevalence of late onset Pompe's disease is 1/57000 live birth(1). We present the case of two patients diagnosed to have Pompe's disease with a rare association of cardiomyopathy. Two siblings born out of non consanguineous marriage presented with proximal myopathy of 5 years duration. Patient 1 - 19 year female, there was atrophy and weakness of face, neck, girdle and limbs. Her Echocardiogram showed LV dilation with low ejection fraction, ECG showed LV hypertrophy with incomplete LBBB. Her CK-NAC values came to be 918 U/L. Patient 2 - 16 year male; progression, distribution and severity slightly different to his sister but had exertional dyspnea since last one year. His echocardiogram showed LV diastolic dysfunction, ECG showed short PR interval partial LBBB and his CK-NAC came to be 2347 U/L. His skeletal muscle biopsy showed deposition of glycogen. Genetic analysis revealed pathogenic mutation in GAA gene (c.2040G&gt;A) in both patients. Late onset Pompe disease is of less severity but progressive. The involvement of heart is less likely compared to infantile onset(2). It is also interesting that the same variant presents differently in both patients. Genetic diseases manifest as rare phenotype which in itself is a clinical puzzle. When rare disease present with a rare manifestation of itself, this pose a great diagnostic challenge. Pompe's disease is one of the very few inherited disorder which has definitive treatment- enzyme replacement therapy. Molecular characterization of the variant is absolutely necessary before initiating therapy. References Ausems MG, Verbiest J, Hermans MM, et al.

    "abstract": "Patients with Lysosomal disorders (LSDs) are treated with regular infusions of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). During the COVID-19 pandemic, home treatment was permitted. This study aimed at monitoring the patients' compliance with home therapy and its effects on physical, psychological, and relational issues. Moreover, we also tested the possible impact of home therapy on familial relationships and contacts with the referral hospital. Thirteen patients with Pompe disease (N = 8) and MPS (N = 5) were tested through an online questionnaire designed to assess their level of appreciation and satisfaction with home therapy and their feelings about the referral centre and psychological support provided. Most of the patients (84%) stressed the positive impact of home therapy. All patients described a significant reduction in stressful conditions associated with the need to attend the hospital every week or two. Home ERT leads to a clear improvement in \"daily life skills\", as represented in our by sample by positive feelings, better emotional self-control, and an increased ability to understand the feelings of relatives. Our data underline the paramount positive effect home ERT has on both patients and their families."

Here, we describe the molecular basis of genetic defects in an 8-month-old domestic short-haired cat with PD. The cat was previously diagnosed with PD based on the clinical and pathological findings of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and excessive accumulation of glycogen in the cardiac muscles. Sanger sequencing was performed on 20 exons of the feline <i>GAA</i> gene using genomic DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded liver tissues. The affected cat was found to be homozygous for the <i>GAA</i>:c.1799G>A mutation resulting in an amino acid substitution (p.R600H) of acid α-glucosidase, a codon position of which is identical with three missense mutations (p.R600C, p.R600L, and p.R600H) causing human infantile-onset PD (IOPD). Several stability and pathogenicity predictors have also shown that the feline mutation is deleterious and severely decreases the stability of the GAA protein. The clinical, pathological, and molecular findings in the cat were similar to those of IOPD in humans. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pathogenic mutation in a cat. Feline PD is an excellent model for human PD, especially IOPD."

    "abstract": "The Lantern Project is an ongoing complimentary diagnostic program for patients in the United States sponsored by Sanofi and implemented by PerkinElmer Genomics. It combines specific enzymatic, biomarker, and genetic testing to facilitate rapid, accurate laboratory diagnosis of Pompe disease and several other lysosomal storage diseases, and a multigene next-generation sequencing panel including Pompe disease, LGMD, and other neuromuscular disorders. This article reports data for Pompe disease collected from October 2018 through December 2021, including acid α-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme assay and GAA sequencing (standard or expedited for positive newborn screening [NBS] to rule out infantile-onset Pompe disease [IOPD]) and the Focused Neuromuscular Panel, which includes GAA. One hundred forty patients (12 received only GAA enzyme testing, 128 had GAA sequencing alone or in addition to enzyme assay) have been confirmed with Pompe disease in this project. Eight of the 140 had a variant of unknown significance, but GAA activity ≤2.10 μmol/L/h, thus were confirmed with Pompe disease. Three diagnosed patients 0-2 years old had cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM)-negative GAA variants and thus IOPD. One additional infant with presumptive IOPD had a homozygous frameshift c.1846del, likely CRIM-negative; symptoms were not provided. Among the 128 patients with molecular results, the c.-32-13T>G splice variant was homozygous in 11, compound-heterozygous in 98, and absent in 19. Proximal muscle weakness (58 patients) was the most common sign reported at testing; elevated creatine kinase (29 patients) was the most common laboratory result. The most common symptom categories were muscular (73 patients), musculoskeletal (13 patients), and respiratory (23 patients). Clinical information was not available for 42 samples, and 17 infants had only \"abnormal NBS\" or \"low GAA\" reported. Cardiac symptoms in 7 included potentially age-related conditions in five c.-32-13T>G-compound-heterozygous adults (myocardial infarction, heart murmur/palpitations, congestive heart failure: 1 each; 2 with atrial fibrillation) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 2 children (1 and 2 years old) with presumptive IOPD. One novel GAA variant was observed in a patient with enzyme activity 0.31 μmol/L/h: c.1853_1854ins49, a frameshift pathogenic variant. The Lantern Project demonstrates the combinatorial utility of enzyme assay, targeted single-gene testing, and a focused neuromuscular next-generation sequencing panel in diagnosing Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a debilitating medical condition caused by a functional deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). In addition to muscle weakness, people living with Pompe disease experience motor coordination deficits including an instable gait and posture. We reasoned that an impaired muscle spindle function might contribute to these deficiencies and therefore analyzed proprioception as well as muscle spindle structure and function in 4- and 8-month-old Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Gait analyses showed a reduced inter-limb and inter-paw coordination in Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Electrophysiological analyses of single-unit muscle spindle proprioceptive afferents revealed an impaired sensitivity of the dynamic and static component of the stretch response. Finally, a progressive degeneration of the sensory neuron and of the intrafusal fibers was detectable in Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We observed an increased abundance and size of lysosomes, a fragmentation of the inner and outer connective tissue capsule and a buildup of autophagic vacuoles in muscle spindles from 8-month-old Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> mice, indicating lysosomal defects and an impaired autophagocytosis. These results demonstrate a structural and functional degeneration of muscle spindles and an altered motor coordination in Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Similar changes could contribute to the impaired motor coordination in patients living with Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), metabolic disorders resulting in build-up of endogenous waste and progressive organ damage, can be treated with intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). ERT can be administered either in specialized clinics, at a physician's office or in the home care setting. Legislative goals in Germany strive to shift to more outpatient care while maintaining treatment objectives. This study investigates the patient perspective on home-based ERT in terms of acceptance, safety, and treatment satisfaction in LSD patients. This was a longitudinal observational study, carried out under real-world conditions in patients' home environment, covering 30 months from January 2019 to June 2021. Patients with LSDs who were deemed suitable for home-based ERT by their physicians were recruited to the study. Patients were interviewed before the start of the first home-based ERT and then at regular intervals thereafter using standardized questionnaires. Data from 30 patients were analyzed: 18 with Fabry disease, 5 with Gaucher disease, 6 with Pompe disease and 1 with Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). Age ranged from 8 to 77 years (mean age 40). The reported average waiting time prior to infusion of more than half an hour decreased from 30% of the patients affected at baseline to 5% across all follow-up time points. All patients felt adequately informed about home-based ERT throughout follow-ups and reported that they would choose home-based ERT again. At almost each time point, patients indicated that home-based ERT had improved their ability to cope with the disease. All but one patient indicated feeling safe at each follow-up time point. Compared to 36.7% at baseline, only 6.9% of patients reported a need for improvement in their care after 6 months of home-based ERT. Mean treatment satisfaction increased by approximately 1.6 scale points after 6 months of home-based ERT compared to baseline, and by another 0.2 scale points after 18 months. In terms of quality of care, all but one patient rated home-based ERT as an equivalent alternative throughout follow-ups. Patients would recommend home-based ERT to other suitable LSD-patients. Home-based ERT increases patients' treatment satisfaction, and patients perceive the quality of care as an equivalent alternative, compared to ERT in a center, clinic, or at a physician's office."

    "abstract": "Non-invasive ventilatory support (NVS) is a technique used to reduce respiratory work in neuromuscular diseases, preventing the progression of respiratory failure. NVS is usually administered via a nasal or an oronasal mask, causing discomfort, especially in patients ventilated for more than 16 h/day. Intermittent abdominal pressure ventilation (IAPV) differs completely from conventional NVS and consists of a portable ventilator and a corset with Velcro closures as the interface. In our study, the practicability and efficacy of IAPV were studied in three Italian centers monitoring 28 neuromuscular patients using IAPV who were then retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcomes were an improvement in hypoxemia and the normalization of hypercapnia, and the secondary outcome was an improvement in quality of life. Data were collected at baseline (T0) and after two hours of ventilation (T1), with follow-ups at three months (T2) and six months (T3). Statistical significance was found for PaCO<sub>2</sub> over time (F (2.42) = 7.63, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and PaO<sub>2</sub> (W = 0.539, <i>p</i> = 0.033). The time of NVS usage also significantly affected the quality of life (F (2.14) = 6.90, <i>p</i> = 0.010), as seen when comparing T0 and T3. As an alternative ventilation method, IAPV is still relevant today and could become a key part of daytime support, especially for patients who do not tolerate standard daytime NVS with an oral interface."

This phase 3 double-blind randomized clinical trial with crossover in the extension period enrolled patients 3 years and older with previously untreated late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) between November 2, 2016, and February 10, 2021, with primary analysis after 49 weeks. Patients were treated at 55 referral centers in 20 countries. Efficacy outcomes were assessed at 97 weeks and safety outcomes to last follow-up, with data cutoff at February 10, 2021. Data were analyzed from May to June 2021. Random assignment (1:1) to receive 20 mg/kg of avalglucosidase alfa or alglucosidase alfa by intravenous infusion every other week for 49 weeks; thereafter, all patients received 20 mg/kg of avalglucosidase alfa every other week. The primary outcome was the least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in FVC percent predicted. Secondary outcomes included the LS mean change from baseline in 6MWT, muscle strength, motor function, quality of life, and disease biomarkers. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Of 100 participants from the double-blind treatment period, 95 entered the extension period. Of these, 51 (54%) were men, and the mean (range) age was 48.3 (10-79) years. At the start of this study, mean upright FVC percent predicted was similar between treatment arms, and 6MWT distance was greater in the avalglucosidase alfa arm. From baseline to week 97, LS mean (SE) FVC percent predicted increased by 2.65 (1.05) for those who continued avalglucosidase alfa and 0.36 (1.12) for those who switched to avalglucosidase alfa. The LS mean (SE) 6MWT distance increased by 18.60 (12.01) m and 4.56 (12.44) m, respectively. For participants who switched to avalglucosidase alfa, FVC percent predicted remained stable (LS mean [SE] change from week 49 to 97, 0.09 [0.88]) and 6MWT distance improved (LS mean [SE] change from week 49 to 97, 5.33 [10.81] m). Potentially treatment-related adverse events were reported in 29 patients (56.9%) who continued avalglucosidase alfa and in 25 patients (56.8%) who switched. In this randomized clinical trial extension, maintenance of positive clinical outcomes was demonstrated for patients continuing avalglucosidase alfa treatment and, to a lesser extent, patients who switched from alglucosidase alfa.

Although anti-transgene immune responses are usually mild and non-adverse, they can confound pharmacological readouts and complicate translation of results between species. We developed a gene therapy candidate for Pompe disease consisting of AAVhu68, a clade F AAV closely related to AAV9, that expresses an engineered human acid-alpha glucosidase (hGAA) tagged with an insulin-like growth factor 2 variant (vIGF2) peptide for enhanced cell uptake. Rhesus macaques were administered an intravenous dose of 1x10<sup>13</sup> genome copies (GC)/kg, 5x10<sup>13</sup> GC/kg, or 1 x 10<sup>14</sup> GC/kg of AAVhu68.vIGF2.hGAA. Some unusually severe adaptive immune responses to hGAA presented, albeit with a high degree of variability between animals. Anti-hGAA responses ranged from absent to severe cytotoxic T-cell-mediated myocarditis with elevated troponin I levels. Cardiac toxicity was not dose dependent and affected five out of eleven animals. Upon further investigation, we identified an association between toxicity and a major histocompatibility complex class I haplotype (Mamu-A002.01) in three of these animals. An immunodominant peptide located in the C-terminal region of hGAA was subsequently identified <i>via</i> enzyme-linked immunospot epitope mapping. Another notable observation in this preclinical safety study cohort pertained to the achievement of robust and safe gene transfer upon intravenous administration of 5x10<sup>13</sup> GC/kg in one animal with a low pre-existing neutralizing anti-capsid antibodies titer (1:20).

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a 12-week tailored lifestyle intervention, consisting of physical training and a high protein diet (2 grams/kg), in children with Pompe disease. This randomized controlled semi-crossover trial investigated the effects of a lifestyle intervention on the primary outcome: exercise capacity. Secondary outcomes were: muscle strength, core stability, motor function, physical activity levels, quality of life, fatigue, fear of exercise, caloric intake, energy balance, body composition, and safety. Fourteen Pompe patients with a median age of 10.6 [IQR: 7.2-14.5], of whom six classic infantile patients, participated in the lifestyle intervention. At baseline, patients had a lower exercise capacity compared to healthy peers (median 70.3% [IQR: 54.8%-98.6%] of predicted). After the intervention, absolute Peak VO<sub>2</sub> improved significantly (1279 mL/min [1012.5-2006] vs. 1352 mL/min [1101.5-2069], p = 0.039), but not compared to the control period. Muscle strength of the hip flexors, hip abductors, elbow extensors, neck extensors, knee extensors, and core stability improved significantly compared to the control period. Children reported a significant increase on the change in health domain of quality of life, parents reported significantly better scores on the quality of life domains: physical functioning, change in health, family cohesion, and fatigue. A 12-week tailored lifestyle intervention for children with Pompe disease seemed safe and led to improvements in muscle strength, core stability, quality of life, and parent-reported fatigue. Pompe patients with a stable disease trajectory seemed to benefit the most from the intervention."

    "abstract": "A major challenge to adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy is the presence of anti-AAV capsid neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), which can block viral vector transduction even at very low titers. In the present study, we examined the ability of a combination immunosuppression (IS) treatment with bortezomib and a mouse-specific CD20 monoclonal antibody to suppress anti-AAV NAbs and enable readministration of AAV vectors of the same capsid in mice. An AAV8 vector (AAV8-CB-hGAA) that ubiquitously expresses human α-glucosidase was used for initial gene therapy and a second AAV8 vector (AAV8-LSP-hSEAP) that contains a liver-specific promoter to express human secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (hSEAP) was used for AAV readministration. Plasma samples were used for determination of anti-AAV8 NAb titers. Cells isolated from whole blood, spleen, and bone marrow were analyzed for B-cell depletion by flow cytometry. The efficiency of AAV readministration was determined by the secretion of hSEAP in blood. In näive mice, an 8-week IS treatment along with AAV8-CB-hGAA injection effectively depleted CD19<sup>+</sup> B220<sup>+</sup> B cells from blood, spleen, and bone marrow and prevented the formation of anti-AAV8 NAbs. Following administration of AAV8-LSP-hSEAP, increasing levels of hSEAP were detected in blood for up to 6 weeks, indicating successful AAV readministration. In mice pre-immunized with AAV8-CB-hGAA, comparison of IS treatment for 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks revealed that the 16-week IS treatment demonstrated the highest plasma hSEAP level following AAV8-LSP-hSEAP readministration. Our data suggest that this combination treatment is an effective IS approach that will allow retreatment of patients with AAV-mediated gene therapy. A combination IS treatment with bortezomib and a mouse-specific CD20 monoclonal antibody effectively suppressed anti-AAV NAbs in naïve mice and in mice with pre-existing antibodies, allowing successful readministration of the same AAV capsid vector."

We collected 21 urine specimens from 13 Pompe disease patients and compared their metabolic signatures with 21 control specimens. Multivariate statistical analyses on the untargeted profiling data revealed Glc<sub>4</sub>, creatine, sorbitol/mannitol, L-phenylalanine, N-acetyl-4-aminobutanal, N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid, and 2-aminobenzoic acid as significantly altered in Pompe disease. This panel of metabolites increased sample class prediction (Pompe disease versus control) compared with a single biomarker. This study has demonstrated the potential of combined acquisition methods in LC-HRMS for Pompe disease investigation, allowing for routine determination of an established biomarker and discovery of complementary candidate biomarkers that may increase diagnostic accuracy, or improve the risk stratification of patients with disparate clinical phenotypes."

    "title": "Orphan Drugs in Neurology-A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": "Orphan diseases, or rare diseases, are defined in Europe as diseases that affect less than 5 out of every 10,000 citizens. Given the small number of cases and the lack of profit potential, pharmaceutical companies have not invested much in the development of possible treatments. However, over the last few years, new therapies for rare diseases have emerged, giving physicians a chance to offer personalized treatment. With this paper, we aim to present some of the orphan neurological diseases for which new drugs have been developed lately. We have conducted a literature review of the papers concerning rare diseases and their treatment, and we have analyzed the existing studies for each orphan drug. For this purpose, we have used the Google Scholar search engine and the Orphanet. We have selected the studies published in the last 15 years. Since the formation of the National Organization for Rare Diseases, the Orphan Drug Act, and the National Institutes of Health Office of Rare Diseases, pharmacological companies have made a lot of progress concerning the development of new drugs. Therefore, diseases that until recently were without therapeutic solutions benefit today from personalized treatment. We have detailed in our study over 15 neurological and systemic diseases with neurological implications, for which the last 10-15 years have brought important innovations regarding their treatment. Many steps have been taken towards the treatment of these patients, and the humanity and professionalism of the pharmaceutical companies, along with the constant support of the patient's associations for rare diseases, have led to the discovery of new treatments and useful future findings."

    "title": "Unusual Evolution of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in Non-Compaction Myocardium in a Pompe Disease Patient.",
    "abstract": "Classic infantile Pompe disease is characterized by a severe phenotype with cardiomyopathy and hypotonia. Cardiomyopathy is generally hypertrophic and rapidly regresses after enzyme replacement therapy. In this report, for the first time, we describe a patient with infantile Pompe disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that evolved into non-compaction myocardium after treatment. The male newborn had suffered since birth with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure. He was treated with standard enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) (alglucosidase alfa) and several immunomodulation cycles due to the development of anti-ERT antibodies, without resolution of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. At the age of 2.5 years, he was treated with a new combination of ERT therapy (cipaglucosidase alfa) and a chaperone (miglustat) for compassionate use. After 1 year, the cardiac hypertrophy was resolved, but it evolved into non-compaction myocardium. Non-compaction cardiomyopathy is often considered to be a congenital, primitive cardiomyopathy, due to an arrest of compaction of the myocardium wall during the embryonal development. Several genetic causes have been identified. We first describe cardiac remodeling from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to a non-compaction form in a patient with infantile Pompe disease treated with a new ERT. This has important implications both for the monitoring of Pompe disease patients and for the understanding of the pathophysiological basis of non-compaction myocardium."

    "abstract": "In newborn screening, false-negative results can be disastrous, leading to disability and death, while false-positive results contribute to parental anxiety and unnecessary follow-ups. Cutoffs are set conservatively to prevent missed cases for Pompe and MPS I, resulting in increased falsepositive results and lower positive predictive values. Harmonization has been proposed as a way to minimize false-negative and false-positive results and correct for method differences, so we harmonized enzyme activities for Pompe and MPS I across laboratories and testing methods (Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) or Digital Microfluidics (DMF)). Participating states analyzed proofof- concept calibrators, blanks, and contrived specimens and reported enzyme activities, cutoffs, and other testing parameters to Tennessee. Regression and multiples of the median were used to harmonize the data. We observed varied cutoffs and results. Six of seven MS/MS labs reported enzyme activities for one specimen for MPS I marginally above their respective cutoffs with results classified as negative, whereas all DMF labs reported this specimen's enzyme activity below their respective cutoffs with results classified as positive. Reasonable agreement in enzyme activities and cutoffs was achieved with harmonization; however, harmonization does not change how a value would be reported as this is dependent on the placement of cutoffs."

    "abstract": "This review summarizes the clinical presentation and provides an update on the current strategies for diagnosis of Pompe disease. We will review the available treatment options. We examine newly approved treatments as well as upcoming therapies in this condition. We also provide commentary on the unmet needs in clinical management and research for this disease. In March 2015, Pompe disease was added to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) and since then a number of states have added Pompe disease to their slate of diseases for their Newborn Screening (NBS) program. Data emerging from these programs is revising our knowledge of incidence of Pompe disease. In 2021, two randomized controlled trials involving new forms of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) were completed and one new product is already FDA-approved and on the market, whereas the other product will come up for FDA review in the fall. Neither of the new ERT were shown to be superior to the standard of care product, <i>alglucosidase</i>. The long-term effectiveness of these newer forms of ERT is unclear. Newer versions of the ERT are in development in addition to multiple different strategies of gene therapy to deliver GAA, the gene responsible for producing acid alpha-glucosidase, the defective protein in Pompe Disease. Glycogen substrate reduction is also in development in Pompe disease and other glycogen storage disorders. There are significant unmet needs as it relates to clinical care and therapeutics in Pompe disease as well as in research. The currently available treatments lose effectiveness over the long run and do not have penetration into neuronal tissues and inconsistent penetration in certain muscles. More definitive gene therapy and enzyme replacement strategies are currently in development and testing."

    "abstract": "This retrospective observational case series is to evaluate the histopathological findings of drooping eyelids in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease and assess the feasibility of levator muscle resection combined with conjoint fascial sheath suspension for ptosis correction. It included six patients from a single tertiary referral center with ptosis and infantile-onset Pompe disease between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2021. They most suffered from recurrent ptosis after initial surgical correction (6/11 eyes, 54.55%). The recurrence rate was high in eyes with levator muscle resection alone (4/6 eyes, 66.67%). No recurrence of ptosis was observed in eyes with levator muscle resection combined with conjoint fascial sheath suspension. The follow-up period was approximately 16-94 months. Histopathological examination revealed that the levator muscle had the most abundant glycogen accumulation-related vacuolar changes, followed by Müller's muscle and extraocular muscles. No vacuolar changes were observed in the conjoint fascial sheath. For patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease-related ptosis, performing levator muscle resection alone is not sufficient, while utilizing conjoint fascial sheath suspension can achieve the desired long-term outcomes with minimal recurrence. These findings may have important implications for the management of ophthalmic complications in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare, progressive, and metabolic myopathy. Reduced pulmonary function is one of the main problems seen in adult patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). We aimed to explore the association between changes over time in pulmonary function and in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), in these patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). This is a post hoc analysis of two cohort studies. Pulmonary function was assessed as forced vital capacity in the upright position (FVC<sub>up</sub> ). As PROMs, we assessed the physical component summary score (PCS) of the Medical Outcome Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and daily life activities (Rasch-Built Pompe-Specific Activity [R-PACT] scale). We fitted Bayesian multivariate mixed-effects models. In the models of PROMs, we assumed a linear association with FVC<sub>up</sub> , and adjusted for time (nonlinear), sex, and age and disease duration at the start of ERT. One hundred and one patients were eligible for analysis. PCS and R-PAct were positively associated with FVC<sub>up</sub> , while their relation with time was nonlinear (initial increase then decrease). A 1%-point increase in FVC<sub>up</sub> is expected to increase PCS by 0.14 points (95% Credible Interval: [0.09;0.19]) and R-PACT by 0.41 points [0.33;0.49] at the same time point. In the first year of ERT, we expect a change of PCS and R-PAct scores by +0.42 and +0.80 points, and in the 5th year of +0.16 and +0.45, respectively. We conclude that the physical domain of quality of life and daily life activities improve when FVC<sub>up</sub> increases during ERT."

    "abstract": "Neuromuscular disease (NMD) research is experiencing tremendous growth as a result of progress in diagnostics and therapeutics yet there continues to be a significant clinical data shortage for these rare diseases. To maximize the development and impact of new therapies, the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) created the neuroMuscular ObserVational Research Data Hub (MOVR) as an observational research study that collects disease-specific measures from individuals living with NMDs in the United States. This manuscript provides a description of MOVR, participants enrolled in MOVR, and longitudinal data availability. MOVR collects longitudinal data from individuals diagnosed with ALS, BMD, DMD, FSHD, LGMD, Pompe disease, or SMA, and who are seen for care at a participating MDA Care Center. Data are entered from medical records into standardized electronic case report forms (eCRFs). These eCRFs capture participants' demographics, diagnostic journeys, clinical visits, and discontinuation from the study. From January 2019 to May 2022, MOVR collected data from 50 participating care centers and 1,957 participants. Data from 1,923 participants who participated in MDA's pilot registry were migrated into MOVR, creating a total of 3,880 participants in MOVR. Initial analysis of aggregated data demonstrated that 91% of eCRFs were complete. Forty-three percent of participants had 3 or more encounters and 50% of all encounters were 5 months or less from the previous encounter. As a centralized data hub for multiple NMDs, MOVR serves as a platform that can be used to inform disease understanding, guide clinical trial design, and accelerate drug development for NMDs."

    "abstract": "Patients with classic infantile Pompe disease are born with a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which resolves after treatment with Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). We aimed to assess potential deterioration of cardiac function over time using myocardial deformation analysis. Twenty-seven patients treated with ERT were included. Cardiac function was assessed at regular time intervals (before and after start with ERT) using conventional echocardiography and myocardial deformation analysis. Separate linear mixed effect models were used to asses temporal changes within the first year and the long-term follow-up period. Echocardiograms of 103 healthy children served as controls. A total of 192 echocardiograms were analyzed. Median follow-up was 9.9 years (IQR: 7.5-16.3). Mean LVMI before start of ERT was increased 292.3 g/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: 202.8-381.8, mean Z-score + 7.6) and normalized after 1 year of ERT 87.3 g/m<sup>2</sup> (CI: 67.5-107.1, mean Z-score + 0.8, p < 0.001). Mean shortening fraction was within normal limits before start of ERT, up to 22 years of follow-up. Cardiac function measured by RV/LV longitudinal, and circumferential strain was diminished before start of ERT, but normalized (<-16%) within 1 year after start of ERT, and all remained within normal limits during follow-up. Only LV circumferential strain gradually worsened in Pompe patients (+0.24%/year) during follow-up compared to controls. LV longitudinal strain was diminished in Pompe patients, but did not change significantly over time compared to controls. Cardiac function, measured using myocardial deformation analysis, normalizes after start of ERT, and seems to remain stable over a median follow-up period of 9.9 years."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a rare, progressive neuromuscular condition typically characterized by weakness of skeletal muscles, including those involved in respiration and diaphragmatic dysfunction. Individuals with LOPD typically eventually require mobility and/or ventilatory support. <b>Objectives:</b> This study aimed to develop health state vignettes and estimate health state utility values for LOPD in the United Kingdom. <b>Methods:</b> Vignettes were developed for 7 health states of LOPD with states defined in terms of mobility and/or ventilatory support. Vignettes were drafted based on patient-reported outcome data from the Phase 3 PROPEL trial (NCT03729362) and supplemented by a literature review. Qualitative interviews with individuals living with LOPD and clinical experts were conducted to explore the health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) impact of LOPD and to review the draft vignettes. Vignettes were finalized following a second round of interviews with individuals living with LOPD and used in health state valuation exercises with people of the UK population. Participants rated the health states using the EQ-5D-5L, visual analogue scale, and time trade-off interviews. <b>Results:</b> Twelve individuals living with LOPD and 2 clinical experts were interviewed. Following the interviews, 4 new statements were added regarding dependence on others, bladder control problems, balance issues/fear of falling, and frustration. One hundred interviews with a representative UK population sample were completed. Mean time trade-off utilities ranged from 0.754 (SD = 0.31) (no support) to 0.132 (SD = 0.50) (invasive ventilatory and mobility support-dependent). Similarly, EQ-5D-5L utilities ranged from 0.608 (SD = 0.12) to -0.078 (SD = 0.22). <b>Discussion:</b> The utilities obtained in the study are consistent with utilities reported in the literature (0.670-0.853 for nonsupport state). The vignette content was based on robust quantitative and qualitative evidence and captured the main HRQoL impacts of LOPD. The general public rated the health states consistently lower with increasing disease progression. There was greater uncertainty around utility estimates for the severe states, suggesting that participants found it harder to rate them. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study provides utility estimates for LOPD that can be used in economic modeling of treatments for LOPD. Our findings highlight the high disease burden of LOPD and reinforce the societal value of slowing disease progression."

    "abstract": "The survival of infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) patients has improved dramatically since the introduction of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with a1glucosidase alfa. However, long-term IOPD survivors on ERT demonstrate motor deficits indicating that current therapy cannot completely prevent disease progression in skeletal muscle. We hypothesized that in IOPD, skeletal muscle endomysial stroma and capillaries would show consistent changes that could impede the movement of infused ERT from blood to muscle fibers. We retrospectively examined 9 skeletal muscle biopsies from 6 treated IOPD patients using light and electron microscopy. We found consistent ultrastructural endomysial stromal and capillary changes. The endomysial interstitium was expanded by lysosomal material, glycosomes/glycogen, cellular debris, and organelles, some exocytosed by viable muscle fibers and some released on fiber lysis. Endomysial scavenger cells phagocytosed this material. Mature fibrillary collagen was seen in the endomysium, and both muscle fibers and endomysial capillaries showed basal laminar reduplication and/or expansion. Capillary endothelial cells showed hypertrophy and degeneration, with narrowing of the vascular lumen. Ultrastructurally defined stromal and vascular changes likely constitute obstacles to movement of infused ERT from capillary lumen to muscle fiber sarcolemma, contributing to the incomplete efficacy of infused ERT in skeletal muscle. Our observations can inform approaches to overcoming these barriers to therapy."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency, also known as Pompe disease, is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to the accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes and cytoplasm, resulting in tissue destruction. Infantile-onset GAA deficiency is characterized by cardiomyopathy and severe generalized hypotonia. Without treatment, most patients die within the first two years of life. The demonstration of reduced GAA activity, followed by sequencing of the GAA gene, confirms the disease. GAA deficiency is currently treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with improved clinical outcomes and survival. <i>Case Presentation</i>. We describe the case of DGAA in two siblings, in which the diagnostic time point, treatment, and outcomes were completely different. The girl was diagnosed with DGAA at the age of 6 months during investigations for poor weight gain and excessive sleepiness. The finding of severe cardiomyopathy through EKG and echocardiography led to the suspicion of storage disease, and the GAA deficiency was later confirmed by genetic analysis. The girl died of complications due to the clinical picture before starting ERT. Conversely, her younger brother had the opportunity to receive an early diagnosis and the rapid onset of ERT. He is showing a regression of cardiac hypertrophy. The advent of ERT improved clinical outcomes and survival in infantile-onset PD. Its impact on cardiac function is still under study, but different reports in the literature have shown encouraging data. Early recognition of DGAA and prompt initiation of ERT is therefore crucial to prevent the progression of the disease and improve the outcomes."

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the diagnosis of asymptomatic Late-Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) patients, who are detected via family screening or Newborn Screening (NBS). The dilemma is when to start Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) in patients without any clinical sign of the disease, considering its important benefits in terms of loss of muscle but also its very high cost, risk of side effects, and long-term immunogenicity. Muscle Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is accessible, radiation-free, and reproducible; therefore, it is an important instrument for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with LOPD, especially in asymptomatic cases. European guidelines suggest monitoring in asymptomatic LOPD cases with minimal MRI findings, although other guidelines consider starting ERT in apparently asymptomatic cases with initial muscle involvement (e.g., paraspinal muscles). We describe three siblings affected by LOPD who present compound heterozygosis and wide phenotypic variability. The three cases differ in age at presentation, symptoms, urinary tetrasaccharide levels, and MRI findings, confirming the significant phenotypic variability of LOPD and the difficulty in deciding when to start therapy."

Six Belgian neuromuscular reference centers participated, covering all patisiran-treated hATTR amyloidosis patients at the study time. This study was conducted to collect data requested in the context of the reimbursement of patisiran in Belgium. Thirty-one patients were diagnosed with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, Coutinho stage 1 or 2, and eligible for active treatment during the data collection period. Of the hATTR amyloidosis patients treated with patisiran (n = 12), seven and five had polyneuropathy stages 1 and 2, respectively. Six patients had cardiac symptoms (New York Heart Association class 2 or above). Follow-up information was available for nine patients. Following patisiran treatment, eight patients showed stable or improved assessments for most neurological or cardiological parameters. Only one patient presented with worsening statuses at the end of the data collection period. The patients with hATTR amyloidosis in Belgium have similar baseline demographics and disease characteristics to those studied in the patisiran APOLLO study and show a similar therapeutic response in the real-world, altering the expected disease progression in most patients."

We report initial safety and bioactivity of the first dose (1.6 × 10<sup>12</sup> vector genomes/kg) cohort (n = 3) in a 52-week open-label, single-dose, dose-escalation study (NCT03533673) in patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). Subjects discontinued biweekly ERT after week 26 based on the detection of elevated serum GAA activity and the absence of clinically significant declines per protocol. Prednisone (60 mg/day) was administered as immunoprophylaxis through week 4, followed by an 11-week taper. All subjects demonstrated sustained serum GAA activities from 101% to 235% of baseline trough activity 2 weeks following the preceding ERT dose. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. No subject had anti-capsid T cell responses that decreased transgene expression. Muscle biopsy at week 24 revealed unchanged muscle glycogen content in two of three subjects. At week 52, muscle GAA activity for the cohort was significantly increased (p < 0.05). Overall, these initial data support the safety and bioactivity of AAV8-LSPhGAA, the safety of withdrawing ERT, successful immunoprophylaxis, and justify continued clinical development of AAV8-LSPhGAA therapy in Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder arising from recessive mutations in the acid α-glucosidase gene and resulting in the accumulation of glycogen, particularly in the cardiac and skeletal muscle. The current standard of care is administration of enzyme replacement therapy in the form of alglucosidase alfa or the recently approved avalglucosidase alfa. In order to better understand the underlying cellular processes that are disrupted in Pompe disease, we conducted gene expression analysis on skeletal muscle biopsies obtained from late-onset Pompe disease patients (LOPD) prior to treatment and following six months of enzyme replacement with avalglucosidase alfa. The LOPD patients had a distinct transcriptomic signature as compared to control patient samples, largely characterized by perturbations in pathways involved in lysosomal function and energy metabolism. Although patients were highly heterogeneous, they collectively exhibited a strong trend towards attenuation of the dysregulated genes following just six months of treatment. Notably, the enzyme replacement therapy had a strong stabilizing effect on gene expression, with minimal worsening in genes that were initially dysregulated. Many of the cellular process that were altered in LOPD patients were also affected in the more clinically severe infantile-onset (IOPD) patients. Additionally, both LOPD and IOPD patients demonstrated enrichment across several inflammatory pathways, despite a lack of overt immune cell infiltration. This study provides further insight into Pompe disease biology and demonstrates the positive effects of avalglucosidase alfa treatment."

This study aimed to describe whether energy deprivation and the toxic effects of accumulated glycogen affect the heart of patients with GSD. We evaluated the left ventricle (LV) wall mass, LV systolic and diastolic function and myocardial strain with conventional echocardiography and two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D STE) in 62 patients with GSD type I, III, VI and IX who visited the Wonju Severance Hospital in 2021.

Of the patients, 43 (62.3%), 7 (11.3%) and 12 (19.4%) patients were diagnosed with GSD type I, type III, and type IX, respectively. The median age was 9 years (range, 1-36 years), with 55 children under 18 years old and seven adults over 18 years. For the 55 pediatric patients, the echocardiographic parameters were converted into a z-score and analyzed. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the BMI z-score (<i>p</i> = 0.022) and CK (<i>p</i> = 0.020) predicted increased LV mass z-score, regardless of GSD type. There was no difference in the diastolic and systolic functions according to myocardial thickness; however, 2D STE showed a negative correlation with the LV mass (r = -0.28, <i>p</i> = 0.041). Given that patients with GSD tend to be overweight, serial evaluation with echocardiography might be required for all types of GSD."

    "abstract": "Oligosaccharidoses, sphingolipidoses and mucolipidoses are lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) in which defective breakdown of glycan-side chains of glycosylated proteins and glycolipids leads to the accumulation of incompletely degraded oligosaccharides within lysosomes. In metabolic laboratories, these disorders are commonly diagnosed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) but more recently also mass spectrometry-based approaches have been published. To expand the possibilities to screen for these diseases, we developed an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) with a high-resolution accurate mass (HRAM) mass spectrometry (MS) screening platform, together with an open-source iterative bioinformatics pipeline. This pipeline generates comprehensive biomarker profiles and allows for extensive quality control (QC) monitoring. Using this platform, we were able to identify α-mannosidosis, β-mannosidosis, α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency, sialidosis, galactosialidosis, fucosidosis, aspartylglucosaminuria, GM1 gangliosidosis, GM2 gangliosidosis (M. Sandhoff) and mucolipidosis II/III in patient samples. Aberrant urinary oligosaccharide excretions were also detected for other disorders, including NGLY1 congenital disorder of deglycosylation, sialic acid storage disease, MPS type IV B and GSD II (Pompe disease). For the latter disorder, we identified heptahexose (Hex7), as a potential urinary biomarker, in addition to glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc4), for the diagnosis and monitoring of young onset cases of Pompe disease. Occasionally, so-called \"neonate\" biomarker profiles were observed in young patients, which were probably due to nutrition. Our UHPLC/HRAM-MS screening platform can easily be adopted in biochemical laboratories and allows for simple and robust screening and straightforward interpretation of the screening results to detect disorders in which aberrant oligosaccharides accumulate."

A 55 year old male had a diagnosed neurodegenerative disorder with suspected Pompe's disease associated with Trap door epiglottis and proximal myopathy.This was complicated with emergency airway distress and subsequent tracheostomy.Trap-door epiglottis (also known as adult-onset laryngomalacia) associated with neurodegenerative disorders constitute a surgical challenge as it is often coupled with failure of tracheostomy decannulation when present. The patient underwent a novel dual staged endoscopic supraglottoplasty whereby an initial stage of epiglottopexy and submucosal diathermy was made at the vallecula.This was then followed by an interval of 6 weeks whereby a partial epiglottotectomy was made at the upper 3rd of the epiglottis and reduction of lingual tonsils was done using radiofrequency ablation.Trachesotomy was decannulated 1 month after the second stage procedure and his airway remains asymptomatic after 1 year of surgical treatment. This case report describes the success of tracheostomy decannulation after a novel dual staged supraglottoplasty for adult onset laryngomalcia (also known as trap-door epiglottis) ."

    "abstract": "Most rare diseases are caused by single-gene mutations, and as such, lend themselves to a host of new gene-targeted therapies and technologies including antisense oligonucleotides, phosphomorpholinos, small interfering RNAs, and a variety of gene delivery and gene editing systems. Early successes are encouraging, however, given the substantial number of distinct rare diseases, the ability to scale these successes will be unsustainable without new development efficiencies. Herein, we discuss the need for genomic newborn screening to match pace with the growing development of targeted therapeutics and ability to rapidly develop individualized therapies for rare variants. We offer approaches to move beyond conventional \"one disease at a time\" preclinical and clinical drug development and discuss planned regulatory innovations that are necessary to speed therapy delivery to individuals in need. These proposals leverage the shared properties of platform classes of therapeutics and innovative trial designs including master and platform protocols to better serve patients and accelerate drug development. Ultimately, there are risks to these novel approaches; however, we believe that close partnership and transparency between health authorities, patients, researchers, and drug developers present the path forward to overcome these challenges and deliver on the promise of gene-targeted therapies for rare diseases."

    "abstract": "To understand and model public health emergencies, epidemiologists need data that describes how humans are moving and interacting across physical space. Such data has traditionally been difficult for researchers to obtain with the temporal resolution and geographic breadth that is needed to study, for example, a global pandemic. This paper describes Colocation Maps, which are spatial network datasets that have been developed within Meta's Data For Good program. These Maps estimate how often people from different regions are colocated: in particular, for a pair of geographic regions x and y, these Maps estimate the rate at which a randomly chosen person from x and a randomly chosen person from y are simultaneously located in the same place during a randomly chosen minute in a given week. These datasets are well suited to parametrize metapopulation models of disease spread or to measure temporal changes in interactions between people from different regions; indeed, they have already been used for both of these purposes during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we show how Colocation Maps differ from existing data sources, describe how the datasets are built, provide examples of their use in compartmental modeling, and summarize ideas for further development of these and related datasets. Among the findings of this study, we observe that a pair of regions can exhibit high colocation despite few people moving between those regions. Additionally, for the purposes of clarifying how to interpret and utilize Colocation Maps, we scrutinize the Maps' built-in assumptions about representativeness and contact heterogeneity."

    "abstract": "First-tier MS-based newborn screening by flow injection analysis can have high presumptive positive rates, often due to isomeric/isobaric compounds or poor biomarker specificity. These presumptive positive samples can be analyzed by second-tier screening assays employing separations such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), which increases test specificity and drastically reduces false positive referrals. The ability to screen for multiple disorders in a single multiplexed test simplifies workflows and maximizes public health laboratories' resources. In this study, we developed and validated a highly multiplexed second-tier method for dried blood spots using a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) column coupled to an MS/MS system. The LC-MS/MS method was capable of simultaneously detecting second-tier biomarkers for maple syrup urine disease, homocystinuria, methylmalonic acidemia, propionic acidemia, glutaric acidemia type 1, glutaric acidemia type 2, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency, short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, adrenoleukodystrophy, and Pompe disease."

The heterogeneity of asthma is becoming increasingly important in the era of personalized treatment and response assessment. Several radiological imaging modalities are available in asthma including chest x-ray, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. In addition to qualitative imaging, quantitative imaging could play an important role in asthma imaging to identify phenotypes with distinct disease course and response to therapy, including biologics. MRI in asthma is mainly performed in research settings given cost, technical challenges, and there is a need for standardization. Imaging analysis applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to subclassify asthma using image analysis have demonstrated initial feasibility, though additional work is necessary to inform the role of AI in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "In August 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Nexviazyme (avalglucosidase alfa-ngpt) for intravenous infusion to treat patients 1 year of age and older with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). The effectiveness and safety were studied in patients with LOPD and patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD). The dosage(s) tested in clinical trials was 20 mg/kg every other week (qow) in patients with LOPD and 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg qow in patients with IOPD. While patients 3 years old and greater with LOPD were eligible for participation in the pivotal trial, the youngest patient enrolled was 16 years old. Therefore, pediatric patients with LOPD were not well represented in the clinical trial. The prevalence of LOPD in pediatrics is extremely low. Thus, conducting a clinical trial in pediatric patients with LOPD would be challenging. Given the similar pathophysiology, mechanism of action, and disease manifestations across the age spectrum of patients with LOPD, the approved dosages for pediatric patients younger than 16 years old with LOPD were based on extrapolation of efficacy using a model-informed exposure bridging strategy, leveraging the safety data from pediatric patients with IOPD. Specifically, the exposure associated with 20 mg/kg qow in adult patients with LOPD was the target exposure for bridging of efficacy. The safety data obtained with 40 mg/kg qow in patients with IOPD was leveraged to support approval in pediatric patients with LOPD aged 1 year and older. This article illustrates a regulatory use of model-informed extrapolation approach for dose selection in pediatric patients with a rare disease."

There is no study evaluating anaphylaxis and its management in PD in the long term. We aimed to evaluate the development of anaphylaxis and rapid drug desensitization (RDD) with rhGAA in children with PD. All children diagnosed and followed up in our institution with PD over 12 years between January 2009 and September 2021 were evaluated for development of anaphylaxis and RDD with rhGAA from medical records. Fourteen patients, 64% of whom were female and diagnosed with PD (1 juvenile, 13 infantile types) during the study period included in the study. The median age at diagnosis was 3.2 months (1-40 months). The median follow-up time of the patients was 20 months (1-129 months). Thirteen patients were given rhGAA, one died before ERT. Four (30.8%) patients developed moderate to severe anaphylaxis, and RDD was applied with rhGAA. A total of 390 RDDs have been performed so far without any serious breakthrough reactions during all RDDs. Anaphylaxis with rhGAA is not rare and RDD with rhGAA is safe and effective in the long term."

Although the pathogenesis and clinical outcomes of PD are well-established, disease-modeling ability, mechanism elucidation, and drug development targeting PD have been substantially limited by the unavailable PD-relevant cell models. This obstacle has been overcome with the help of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming technology, thus providing a powerful tool for cell replacement therapy, disease modeling, drug screening, and drug toxicity assessment.

A major step for treatment of Pompe disease was reached in 2006 with the marketing of alglucosidase alfa, a first enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) that showed a significant motor and respiratory benefit. However, efficacy of alglucosidase alfa is limited in LOPD with a loss of efficacy over time, promoting research on new treatments. Next-generation ERT are new enzymes biochemically modified to increase the uptake of exogenous enzyme by target tissues, and the benefit of two recombinant enzymes (avalglucosidase alfa and cipaglucosidase alfa) has been recently studied in large phase III clinical trials, the latest combined with miglustat. Several innovative therapies, based on GAA gene transfer, antisense oligonucleotides or inhibition of glycogen synthesis with substrate reduction therapy, are currently under study, but are still at an early stage of development. Overall, active research for new treatments raises hope for LOPD patients but challenges remain for the clinician with the need for reliable efficacy assessment tools, long-term registry data, and evidence-based recommendations for the best use of these new molecules recently available or under development."

A large amount of glycogen accumulates in the lysosomes, causing these to swell and rupture. Its incidence is about 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 50,000 newborns. The main features are hypotonia and cardiomyopathy. Only a few clinical cases of Pompe disease have been reported, and appendicular torsion has rarely been observed. Herein, we report a case of Pompe disease combined with appendicular torsion, both of which were diagnosed on autopsy pathology. The clinical diagnosis of this disease is difficult in developing countries, and it is mostly misdiagnosed as other types of heart disease. Once the clinical symptoms worsen, most of them die within a short period. Therefore, screening for neonatal genetic metabolic diseases for early diagnosis and treatment should be carried out.

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), are a group of heterogeneous diseases that mainly affect central nervous system (CNS) functions. A subset of NDDs exhibit CNS dysfunction and muscle degeneration, as observed in Gangliosidosis 1 (GM1) and late stages of PD. Neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) are a group of diseases in which patients show primary progressive muscle weaknesses, including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), Pompe disease, and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). NDDs and NMDs typically have a genetic component, which affects the physiological functioning of critical cellular processes, leading to pathogenesis. Currently, there is no cure or efficient treatment for most of these diseases. More than 200 clinical trials have been completed or are currently underway in order to establish safety, tolerability, and efficacy of promising gene therapy approaches. Thus, gene therapy-based therapeutics, including viral or non-viral delivery, are very appealing for the treatment of NDDs and NMDs. In particular, adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) are an attractive option for gene therapy for NDDs and NMDs. However, limitations have been identified after systemic delivery, including the suboptimal capacity of these therapies to traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB), degradation of the particles during the delivery, high reactivity of the patient's immune system during the treatment, and the potential need for redosing. To circumvent these limitations, several preclinical and clinical studies have suggested intrathecal (IT) delivery to target the CNS and peripheral organs via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF administration can vastly improve the delivery of small molecules and drugs to the brain and spinal cord as compared to systemic delivery. Here, we review AAV biology and vector design elements, different therapeutic routes of administration, and highlight CSF delivery as an attractive route of administration. We discuss the different aspects of neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases, such as pathogenesis, the landscape of mutations, and the biological processes associated with the disease. We also describe the hallmarks of NDDs and NMDs as well as discuss current therapeutic approaches and clinical progress in viral and non-viral gene therapy and enzyme replacement strategies for those diseases."

To improve and guide intensive care management in complex scenarios, ultrasonography and echocardiography are invaluable. In five clinical scenarios involving acute deterioration, serial ultrasound examinations of the respiratory system, general critical care ultrasound (GCCUS), and non-invasive haemodynamic critical care echocardiography (CCE) were used routinely. Ultrasonographic results were used to guide further management and initiate experimental therapy or transition from curative to supportive care. The process of initiation of ultrasound examinations to clinical decision-making in these complex scenarios is outlined. These case vignettes highlight the utility of ultrasound and echocardiography. When clinical management is not clear, or evidence is not available, the use of ultrasound for the evaluation of the respiratory system, GCCUS, and non-invasive haemodynamic CCE can help to guide management, reveal newly developed pathologies, lead to clinical management changes, and support the decision for employing experimental therapy approaches in a dynamic way of which few other imaging modalities or monitoring tools are currently capable."

We designed an automated sequencing platform using dried blood spot samples and a NEOseq_ACTION panel comprising 254 genes associated with Mendelian diseases having curable or manageable treatment options. Retrospective validation was performed using data from 24 genetically and biochemically confirmed patients. Prospective validation was performed using data from 111 patients with suspected actionable genetic diseases. In prospective clinical validation, 13.5% patients presented with medically actionable diseases, including short- or medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies (N=6), hyperphenylalaninemia (N=2), mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (N=1), alpha thalassemia (N=1), 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 2 deficiency (N=1), propionic acidemia (N=1), glycogen storage disease, type IX(a) (N=1), congenital myasthenic syndrome (N=1), and citrullinemia, type II (N=1). Using the automated analytic pipeline, the turnaround time from blood collection to result reporting was <4 days.

Further external or internal structural modifications of 17 and 18 were performed to increase structural diversity, followed by the protein thermal shift study to evaluate the GAA stabilizing ability. Fortunately, pyrrolidine 21, possessing an l-arabino-typed configuration pattern, was identified as a specific potent rh-GAA stabilizer, enabling the suppression of rh-GAA protein denaturation. In a cell-based Pompe model, co-administration of 21 with rh-GAA protein significantly improved enzymatic activity (up to 5-fold) compared to administration of enzyme alone. Potentially, pyrrolidine 21 enables the direct increase of ERT (enzyme replacement therapy) efficacy in cellulo and in vivo."

There are two main phenotypes, the infantile consisting of early onset severe weakness and cardiomyopathy, and the adult which is characterized by slowly progressive skeletal and respiratory muscle weakness. Enzymatic replacement therapy (ERT) has been available for Pompe disease for more than 15 years. Although the treatment has improved many aspects of the disease, such as prolonged survival through improved cardiomyopathy and acquisition of motor milestones in infants and slower progression rate in adults, ERT is far from being a cure as both infantile and adult patients continue to progress. This fact has prompted the development of improved or new enzymes and other treatments such as gene therapy or substrate reduction strategies. Here, we review the data obtained from randomized clinical trials but also from open-label studies published so far that have assessed the advantages and limitations of this therapy.

Due to the contactless recording, OPM-MMG might be preferable to standard electromyography (EMG) for patients with neuromuscular diseases, particularly when repetitive recordings for diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring are mandatory. OPM-MMG studies have focused on recording physiological muscle activity in healthy individuals, whereas research on neuromuscular patients with pathological altered muscle activity is non-existent. Here, we report a proof-of-principle study on the application of OPM-MMG in patients with neuromuscular diseases. Specifically, we compare the muscular activity during maximal isometric contraction of the left rectus femoris muscle in three neuromuscular patients with severe (Transthyretin Amyloidosis in combination with Pompe's disease), mild (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2), and without neurogenic, but myogenic, damage (Myotonia Congenita). Seven healthy young participants served as the control group. As expected, and confirmed by using simultaneous surface electromyography (sEMG), a time-series analysis revealed a dispersed interference pattern during maximal contraction with high amplitudes. Furthermore, both patients with neurogenic damage (ATTR and CMT2) showed a reduced variability of the MMG signal, quantified as the signal standard deviation of the main component of the frequency spectrum, highlighting the reduced possibility of motor unit recruitment due to the loss of motor neurons. Our results show that recording pathologically altered voluntary muscle activity with OPM-MMG is possible, paving the way for the potential use of OPM-MMG in larger studies to explore the potential benefits in clinical neurophysiology."

Nonetheless, it is difficult to detect subtle changes of the muscle. Besides, no ultrasonographic parameter has been proposed to predict the motor functions of Pompe disease. Therefore, we aimed to find out an ultrasonographic parameter that can quantify the muscle involvement and correlate with the motor functions in Pompe disease. Eighteen patients with Pompe disease were enrolled. The echo heterogeneity index (standard deviation divided by mean echogenicity values by ImageJ analysis) and shear modulus were recorded from rectus femoris, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles. Motor functions, including manual muscle strength, 6-min walk and four-limb stair climb tests were assessed. Correlations between ultrasonographic parameters and Heckmatt scale and motor functions were analyzed. The echo heterogeneity index, but not the shear modulus, was negatively correlated with the Heckmatt scale rating in all muscles. The echo heterogeneity indices of tibialis anterior (r = 0.698, p = 0.008) and medial gastrocnemius (r = 0.615, p = 0.025) muscles showed positive correlations with the walking distance. Besides, the echo heterogeneity indices of four lower limb muscles were negatively correlated with the duration of stair climbing. The echo heterogeneity index but not the shear modulus can be used to quantitatively describe the muscle involvement in Pompe disease. In addition, lower echo heterogeneity indices of lower limb muscles are associated with worse motor functions in these patients."

As classic infantile patients survive due to treatment, they exhibit progressive white matter abnormalities, while brain involvement in late-onset patients is not fully elucidated. To study the underlying microstructure of white matter, we acquired structural (T1, T2, FLAIR) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the brain in 12 classic infantile patients (age 5-20 years) and 18 late-onset Pompe patients (age 11-56 years). Structural images were scored according to a rating scale for classic infantile patients. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) from classic infantile patients were compared to a reference population, using a Wilcoxon signed-rank, one sample test. Effect sizes (Hedges' G) were used to compare DTI metrics across different tracts. For late-onset patients, results were compared to (reported) tractography data on normal aging. In classic infantile patients, we found a significant lower FA and higher MD (p < 0.01) compared to the reference population. Large-association fibers were most severely affected. Classic infantile patients with advanced white matter abnormalities on structural MRI showed the largest deviations from the reference population. FA and MD were similar for younger and older late-onset patients in large WM-association fibers. We conclude that, while no deviations from typical neurodevelopment were found in late-onset patients, classic infantile Pompe patients showed quantifiable, substantially altered white matter microstructure, which corresponded with disease stage on structural MRI. DTI holds promise to monitor therapy response in future therapies targeting the brain."

    "title": "Multisystem presentation of Late Onset Pompe Disease: what every consulting neurologist should know.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare, autosomal recessive, lysosomal disorder caused by deficiency of alpha glucosidase (GAA). It leads to the accumulation of glycogen in body tissues, with severe myopathy and cardiomegaly as a hallmark of the classic infantile form. Non-classical, or late onset, Pompe disease (LOPD) manifests after 12 months of age or in adulthood. The clinical heterogeneity of LOPD causes delay in diagnosis and pharmacological treatment. In the Polish population, it is still underdiagnosed, and the time from onset to diagnosis remains a cause for concern. Although typically patients present with proximal muscle weakness, high CK or early respiratory insufficiency, they can also suffer from multiple symptoms from other organs. Patients may present with arrhythmias, vascular abnormalities including aneurysms or dilative arteriopathy, gastric or urinary symptoms, or musculoskeletal pathologies. A high index of suspicion among neurologists consulting internal medicine wards would aid early diagnosis of LOPD, while a multidisciplinary approach with the involvement of other specialists can reduce the risk of complications and improve the prognosis for LOPD patients. Patients who manifest with musculoskeletal and respiratory symptoms are prone to be diagnosed sooner than individuals with non-muscular symptoms, and therefore it is important to raise awareness of other manifestations of this disease."

    "abstract": "Despite the availability of several clinical guidelines, not all health professionals use their recommendations to manage patients with Pompe disease, a rare genetic disorder involving high-impact therapy. Through several discussion meetings and a survey, the present study aimed to learn about the management of Pompe disease in routine clinical practice in Spain, to improve clinical care in a real-life situation. The survey was sent to 42 healthcare professionals who manage patients with Pompe disease in their clinical practice. Although most respondents followed the clinical guidelines, clinical practice differed from the expert recommendations in many cases. Approximately 7% did not request a genetic study to confirm the diagnosis before starting treatment, and 21% considered that only two dried blood spot determinations suffice to establish the diagnosis. About 76% requested anti-GAA antibodies when there is a suspicion of lack of treatment efficacy, though a significant percentage of respondents have never requested such antibodies. According to 31% of the respondents, significant impairment of motor function and/or respiratory insufficiency is a requirement for authorizing medication at their hospital. Up to 26% waited for improvements over the clinical follow-up to maintain treatment and withdrew it in the absence of improvement since they did not consider disease stabilization to be a satisfactory outcome. The results highlight the lack of experience and/or knowledge of some professionals caring for patients with Pompe disease. It is necessary to develop and disseminate simple guidelines that help to apply the expert recommendations better or centralize patient follow-up in highly specialized centers."

Second trimester fetal sonographic anatomical scan was performed in all 13 cases during pregnancy. Two cases (15.4%) were found to have a persistently open mouth at 23 weeks and 24 weeks, respectively. Serials follow-up ultrasound examinations demonstrated the same findings in the two cases. Third trimester ultrasound was also performed in all cases. Large heart was found in five cases (38.5%), and fetal echocardiography confirmed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare genetic neuromuscular disorder caused by acid α-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency resulting in lysosomal glycogen accumulation and progressive myopathy. Enzyme replacement therapy, the current standard of care, penetrates poorly into the skeletal muscles and the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS), risks recombinant enzyme immunogenicity, and requires high doses and frequent infusions. Lentiviral vector-mediated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) gene therapy was investigated in a Pompe mouse model using a clinically relevant promoter driving nine engineered GAA coding sequences incorporating distinct peptide tags and codon optimizations. Vectors solely including glycosylation-independent lysosomal targeting tags enhanced secretion and improved reduction of glycogen, myofiber, and CNS vacuolation in key tissues, although GAA enzyme activity and protein was consistently lower compared with native GAA. Genetically modified microglial cells in brains were detected at low levels but provided robust phenotypic correction. Furthermore, an amino acid substitution introduced in the tag reduced insulin receptor-mediated signaling with no evidence of an effect on blood glucose levels in Pompe mice. This study demonstrated the therapeutic potential of lentiviral HSPC gene therapy exploiting optimized GAA tagged coding sequences to reverse Pompe disease pathology in a preclinical mouse model, providing promising vector candidates for further investigation."

    "abstract": "The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), Pompe Disease (PD), and Krabbe disease (KD) are inherited conditions known as lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) The resulting enzyme deficiencies give rise to progressive symptoms. The United States Department of Health and Human Services' Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) suggests LSDs for inclusion in state universal newborn screening (NBS) programs and has identified screening deficiencies in MPS I, KD, and PD NBS programs. MPS I NBS programs utilize newborn dried blood spots and assay alpha L-iduronidase (IDUA) enzyme to screen for potential cases. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) offer potential as a confirmatory test. KD NBS programs utilize galactocerebrosidase (GaLC) as an initial test, with psychosine (PSY) activity increasingly used as a confirmatory test for predicting onset of Krabbe disease, though with an excessive false positive rate. PD is marked by a deficiency in acid α-glucosidase (GAA), causing increased glycogen, creatine (CRE), and other biomarkers. Bivariate normal limit (BVNL) methods have been applied to GaLC and PSY activity to produce a NBS tool for KD, and more recently, to IDUA and GAG activity to develop a NBS tool for MPS I. A BVNL tool based on GAA and CRE is in development for infantile PD diagnosis. Early infantile KD, MPS I, and PD cases were pre-symptomatically identified by BVNL-based NBS tools. This article reviews these developments, discusses how they address screening deficiencies identified by the RUSP and may improve NBS more generally."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease. Acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency leads to glycogen storage in lysosomes, causing skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle lesions. Pompe disease is progressive, and its severity depends on the age of onset. Classic infantile Pompe disease, the most severe form, is characterized by an age of onset before 12 months. Pompe disease with intrauterine onset has rarely been reported. The proband was born at a gestational age of 40 weeks and 3 days and admitted to our hospital because of intrauterine cardiac hypertrophy, shortness of breath, and cyanosis until 13 min postnatally. Physical examination at admission revealed poor responsiveness, pale skin, shortness of breath, reduced limb muscle tone, and bilateral pedal edema. The heart sounds were weak, and no heart murmur was heard. Echocardiography showed left (9 mm) and right (5 mm) ventricular hypertrophies. The patient was subjected to non-invasive ventilator-assisted respiration, fluid restriction, diuresis, and metoprolol treatment. Infantile Pompe disease was diagnosed on day 16 with a GAA enzymatic activity of 0.31 µmol/L/h and with the full-penetrance genetic test showing the homozygous gene mutation c.1844G>T(p.Gly615Val). Enzyme replacement therapy was refused by the patient's parents, and the patient died at seven months of age from cardiopulmonary failure. Infants with intrauterine-onset Pompe disease usually have early manifestations of heart disease. Prompt GAA enzymatic activity determination and molecular genetic testing are helpful in aiding the parents' decision and planning the treatment."

This study aimed to fill this gap and provide evidence-based suggestions for policy improvement based on policy simulation. Data were derived from a nationally based cross-sectional survey on rare diseases in early 2018. Answers from 92 PD patients were used for data analysis and simulation. Catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and impoverishment due to illness (IDI) were adopted to measure PD patients' economic burden. Two typical reimbursement patterns, a dosage-based model and a cost-based model, in China were simulated. Twenty-four pediatric and 68 adult PD patients were investigated. Families with pediatric PD patients on average had lower annual household incomes than families with adult PD patients (RMB 37 890 vs. RMB 66 120). The direct medical expense and out-of-pocket expenses were almost double for pediatric patients compared with adult patients (RMB 120 050 vs. RMB 66 350; RMB 112 710 vs. RMB 57 940, respectively). The direct non-medical expense for patients was almost six times the expense of adult patients (RMB 73 790 vs. RMB 13 080, respectively). About 88.24% of families with pediatric PD patients and 67.21% of families with adult PD patients suffered from CHE. Around 84.21% of families with pediatric PD patients and 45.90% of families with adult PD patients were forced to live in poverty due to illness. The simulation indicated that, although the two current reimbursement schemes helped reduce CHE, they almost had no effect on reducing IDI; the dosage-based model was more sensitive to changes in policy parameters. Our study highlighted the alarmingly high disease burden faced by PD patients with first-hand patient-reported evidence. Our series of simulations could be a good reference for China and other countries to improve their reimbursement policy regarding PD."

    "abstract": "Protein based therapeutics have successfully improved the quality of life for patients of monogenic disorders like hemophilia, Pompe and Fabry disease. However, a significant proportion of patients develop immune responses towards intravenously infused therapeutic protein, which can complicate or neutralize treatment and compromise patient safety. Strategies aimed at circumventing immune responses following therapeutic protein infusion can greatly improve therapeutic efficacy. In recent years, antigen-based oral tolerance induction has shown promising results in the prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases, food allergies and can prevent anti-drug antibody formation to protein replacement therapies. Oral tolerance exploits regulatory mechanisms that are initiated in the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) to promote active suppression of orally ingested antigen. In this review, we outline general perceptions and current knowledge about the mechanisms of oral tolerance, including tissue specific sites of tolerance induction and the cells involved, with emphasis on antigen presenting cells and regulatory T cells. We define several factors, such as cytokines and metabolites that impact the stability and expansion potential of these immune modulatory cells. We highlight preclinical studies that have been performed to induce oral tolerance to therapeutic proteins or enzymes for single gene disorders, such as hemophilia or Pompe disease. These studies mainly utilize a transgenic plant-based system for oral delivery of antigen in conjugation with fusion protein technology that favors the prevention of antigen degradation in the stomach while enhancing uptake in the small intestine by antigen presenting cells and regulatory T cell induction, thereby promoting antigen specific systemic tolerance."

We performed in silico analysis of the GAA gene transcript for potential splicing silencers and designed oligomers targeting motifs predicted to enhance exon 2 retention in the mature mRNA. Two patient-derived fibroblasts were obtained from Coriell Institute for Medical Research, and seven fibroblast strains from unrelated patients were supplied by Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia. Both fibroblasts and forced-myogenic cells were treated with optimized phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers supplied by Sarepta Therapeutics. Total RNA and protein were extracted from the cells after incubation with phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers, and RT-PCR and RT-qPCR were performed to confirm exon 2 inclusion is enhanced.

Patients with IOPD treated with enzyme replacement therapy were longitudinally followed with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and evaluation for IQ scores from 2004 to 2021. Investigation of CNS involvement focused on white matter (WM) abnormalities and was quantified using a scoring system for metachromatic leukodystrophy. MRI scores were correlated with plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) concentration and IQ scores. A total of 19 patients who started enzyme replacement therapy at a mean age of 26 days were analyzed; the median age at last examination was 12.1 (range = 1.7-19) years. MRI abnormalities were found in all patients, from supratentorial central WM to U-fibers, then to infratentorial WM, and eventually to gray matter. MRI scores progressed (n = 16) at variable rates (range = 0.8-2.7/y) and were positively correlated with age (n = 16) and negatively correlated with IQ scores (n = 8). Plasma NfL concentration was positively correlated with MRI scores (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.8569; P < .001; n = 13). Our results suggest that the progression of CNS involvement in IOPD may be associated with neuroaxonal injury and decreased IQ scores. NfL could serve as a biomarker for CNS involvement in IOPD."

Enzymatic replacement therapy is available, but early diagnosis by newborn screening (NBS) is essential for early treatment and better outcomes, especially with more severe forms. We present results from 7 years of NBS for PD and the management of infantile-onset (IOPD) and late-onset (LOPD) patients, during which we sought candidate predictive parameters of phenotype severity at baseline and during follow-up. We used a tandem mass spectrometry assay for α-glucosidase activity to screen 206,741 newborns and identified 39 positive neonates (0.019%). Eleven had two pathogenic variants of the <i>GAA</i> gene (3 IOPD, 8 LOPD); six carried variants of uncertain significance (VUS). IOPD patients were treated promptly and had good outcomes. LOPD and infants with VUS were followed; all were asymptomatic at the last visit (mean age 3.4 years, range 0.5-5.5). Urinary glucose tetrasaccharide was a useful and biomarker for rapidly differentiating IOPD from LOPD and monitoring response to therapy during follow-up. Our study, the largest reported to date in Europe, presents data from longstanding NBS for PD, revealing an incidence in North East Italy of 1/18,795 (IOPD 1/68,914; LOPD 1/25,843), and the absence of mortality in IOPD treated from birth. In LOPD, rigorous long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate the best time to start therapy. The high pseudodeficiency frequency, ethical issues with early LOPD diagnosis, and difficulty predicting phenotypes based on biochemical parameters and genotypes, especially in LOPD, need further study."

In severe IOPD cases, complete/almost-complete acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme deficiency is observed. Considering the rapid progression of the disease, timely diagnosis and treatment are important; even slight delays can remarkably alter the course of the disease. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase is safe and beneficial for IOPD patients. However, there is heterogeneity in the patient response to ERT. The factors influencing treatment effectiveness include the patient's age at the time of treatment initiation, pre-existing muscle damage, and cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status at baseline. Immunomodulation along with ERT is the recently developed therapeutic approach that has been included in the therapeutic armamentarium of IOPD for optimizing clinical benefits, particularly in CRIM-negative IOPD patients. However, there is a dearth of published data on the early diagnosis and clinical position of the immunomodulation protocol along with ERT in the treatment of IOPD in the Gulf region. Expert panel meetings, involving six experts from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, were convened to develop consensus-based recommendations addressing current diagnostic and management challenges for patients with IOPD in the Gulf region. Furthermore, this consensus guideline may be implemented in clinical practice for the timely diagnosis and management of patients with IOPD. The expert consensus will help clinicians to make appropriate and timely decisions regarding immunomodulation initiation and ERT treatment in IOPD patients in the Gulf region."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare neuromuscular disease caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase. The late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) in adults is characterized by weakness of ventilatory, axial, and proximal extremity muscles. These muscle impairments progressively impair various motor functions such as locomotion and postural control. Nearly 87% of adults with LOPD (aLOPD) report walking problems, and more than 80% report instability and falls. Knowledge of these motor functions is now sufficient to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of motor function in aLOPD. Therefore, this scoping review aimed to summarize current knowledge about motor function in aLOPD. It specifically targeted neuromuscular performance, locomotion, and postural control. A systematic search in MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was conducted until May 2021. We included studies providing primary data on at least 4 participants, exploring neuromuscular performance, locomotion, and/or postural control in aLOPD. Risk of bias analysis was assessed using tools appropriate to the study designs; the risk of bias 2 (Cochrane tool) for randomized controlled trials, risk of bias in Nonrandomized Studies - of Interventions (Cochrane tool) for nonrandomized interventional trials, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies and case-control studies. The search identified 2,885 articles. After screening, 58 articles were included in the analysis. In these studies, 88% explored locomotion, 83% neuromuscular performance, and 3% postural control. This review showed that aLOPD experience symmetrical weakness, concerning especially the hip and lumbar muscles. Locomotor activities are limited with a distance reduction, spatiotemporal gait parameter modification, and an increased pelvic drop and tilt. Balance disorders are also observed especially in the anteroposterior direction. We performed the first review on motor function characteristics in aLOPD. Although a significant amount of knowledge was synthesized in this review, our study also highlighted the lack of current research on this topic. Maximal muscle strength was the only neuromuscular performance studied, and gait biomechanics and postural control were poorly explored in LOPD. Relationships between the degree of muscle weakness and motor function alterations also remain to be determined in aLOPD."

Whole blood was tested for acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) assay through the fluorometric method, and all cases with enzyme levels of ≤10 pmoL/punch/h were reflexed to molecular testing for mutations in the GAA gene. Clinical and demographic information was abstracted from their clinical visit and, along with study data, entered into a purpose-built REDCap database, and analyzed at the University of California, Irvine. GAA enzyme assay results were available on 906 of the 921 participants who consented for the study. LOPD was confirmed in 9 participants (1% prevalence). Another 9 (1%) were determined to have pseudodeficiency of GAA, whereas 19 (1.9%) were found to be heterozygous for a pathogenic GAA mutation (carriers). Of the definite LOPD participants, 8 (89%) were Caucasian and were heterozygous for the common leaky (IVS1) splice site mutation in the GAA gene (c -32-13T>G), with a second mutation that was previously confirmed to be pathogenic.

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) improves cardiac, motor, and respiratory functions but is limited by poor cellular uptake and its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Previously, we showed that hematopoietic stem cell (HSPC)-mediated lentiviral gene therapy (LVGT) with codon-optimized <i>GAA</i> (LV-<i>GAAco</i>) caused glycogen reduction in heart, skeletal muscles, and partially in the brain at high vector copy number (VCN). Here, we fused insulin-like growth factor 2 (<i>IGF2</i>) to a codon-optimized version of <i>GAA</i> (LV-<i>IGF2.GAAco</i>) to improve cellular uptake by the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate/IGF2 (CI-M6P/IGF2) receptor. In contrast to LV-<i>GAAco</i>, LV-<i>IGF2.GAAco</i> was able to completely normalize glycogen levels, pathology, and impaired autophagy at a clinically relevant VCN of 3 in heart and skeletal muscles. LV-<i>IGF2.GAAco</i> was particularly effective in treating the CNS, as normalization of glycogen levels and neuroinflammation was achieved at a VCN between 0.5 and 3, doses at which LV-<i>GAAco</i> was largely ineffective.

In this study, we developed a potentially novel dual promoter consisting of a liver-specific promoter (LSP) and the CB promoter for gene therapy in adult GSD IIIa mice. Ten-week treatment with an adeno-associated virus vector containing the LSP-CB dual promoter in adult GSD IIIa mice significantly increased pullulanase expression and reduced glycogen contents in the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle, accompanied by the reversal of liver fibrosis, improved muscle function, and a significant decrease in plasma biomarkers alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine kinase. Compared with the CB promoter, the dual promoter effectively decreased pullulanase-induced cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and enabled persistent therapeutic gene expression in adult GSD IIIa mice.

We validated the assay with 12 control variants and subsequently analyzed eight VUS or novel variants in <i>GAA</i> identified in patients with a positive newborn screen for Pompe disease without phenotypic evidence of infantile-onset disease. <b>Results:</b> The control variants were analyzed in our expression system and an activity range was established. The pathogenic controls had GAA activity between 0% and 11% of normal. The benign or likely benign controls had an activity range of 54%-100%. The pseudodeficiency variant had activity of 17%. These ranges were then applied to the variants selected for functional studies. Using the threshold of <11%, we were able to apply PS3_ supporting to classify two variants as likely pathogenic (c.316C > T and c.1103G > A) and provide further evidence to support the classification of likely pathogenic for two variants (c.1721T > C and c.1048G > A). One variant (c.1123C > T) was able to be reclassified based on other supporting evidence. We were unable to reclassify three variants (c.664G > A, c.2450A > G, and c.1378G > A) due to insufficient or conflicting evidence. <b>Conclusion:</b> We investigated eight <i>GAA</i> variants as proof of concept using our validated and reproducible <i>in vitro</i> expression and functional analysis system. While additional work is needed to further refine our system with additional controls and different variant types in order to apply the PS3/BS3 criteria at a higher level, this tool can be utilized for variant classification to meet the growing need for novel <i>GAA</i> variant classification in the era of newborn screening for Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is a rare, severe disorder of lysosomal storage of glycogen that leads to progressive cardiac and skeletal myopathy. IOPD is a fatal disease in childhood unless treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) from an early age. Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a relatively common hemoglobinopathy caused by a specific variant in the hemoglobin beta-chain. Here we report a case of a male newborn of African ancestry diagnosed and treated for IOPD and SCA. Molecular testing confirmed two <i>GAA</i> variants, NM_000152.5: c.842G>C, p.(Arg281Pro) and NM_000152.5: c.2560C>T, p.(Arg854<sup>*</sup>) in <i>trans</i>, and homozygosity for the <i>HBB</i> variant causative of SCA, consistent with his diagnosis. An acute neonatal presentation of hypotonia and cardiomyopathy required ERT with alglucosidase alfa infusions preceded by immune tolerance induction (ITI), as well as chronic red blood cell transfusions and penicillin V potassium prophylaxis for treatment of IOPD and SCA. Clinical course was further complicated by multiple respiratory infections. We review the current guidelines and interventions taken to optimize his care and the pitfalls of those guidelines when treating patients with concomitant conditions. To the best of our knowledge, no other case reports of the concomitance of these two disorders was found. This report emphasizes the importance of newborn screening, early intervention, and treatment considerations for this complex patient presentation of IOPD and SCA."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) are rare diseases, caused by inherited deficiencies of lysosomal enzymes/transporters, that affect 1 in 7000 to 1 in 8000 newborns. Individuals with LSDs face long diagnostic journeys during which debilitating and life-threatening events can occur. Clinical trials and classical descriptions of LSDs typically focus on common manifestations, which are not representative of the vast phenotypic heterogeneity encountered in real-world experience. Additionally, recognizing that there was a limited understanding of the natural history, disease progression, and real-world clinical outcomes of rare LSDs, a collaborative partnership was pioneered 30 years ago to address these gaps. The Rare Disease Registries (RDR) (for Gaucher, Fabry, Mucopolysaccharidosis type I, and Pompe), represent the largest observational database for these LSDs. Over the past thirty years, data from the RDRs have helped to inform scientific understanding and the development of comprehensive monitoring and treatment guidelines by creating a framework for data collection and establishing a standard of care, with an overarching goal to improve the quality of life of affected patients. Here, we highlight the history, process, and impact of the RDRs, and discuss the lessons learned and future directions."

We conducted a multicenter screening study to determine LOPD prevalence in high-risk populations and define the early manifestation of LOPD in China. Between August 2020 and April 2021, the participants were prospectively identified through medical examination at 20 centers from inpatient departments and outpatient neuromuscular clinics in China. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age ≥ 1 year and (2) either one of the following conditions: (a) persistent hyperCKemia, (b) muscle weakness of the axial and/or limb-girdle muscles, or (c) unexplained restrictive respiratory insufficiency (RI). Enzymatic activity of acid α-glucosidase (GAA) was measured in a dried blood spot (DBS) using a tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) assay. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to evaluate all samples with decreased GAA activity, searching for <i>GAA</i> mutations and pseudodeficiency alleles. Among the 492 cases, 26 positive samples (5.3%) were detected in the DBS test. Molecular studies confirmed a diagnosis of LOPD in eight cases (1.6%). Using MS/MS assay, GAA activities in individuals with pseudodeficiency could be distinguished from those in patients with LOPD. The median interval from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 5 years. All patients also showed RI, with a mean forced vital capacity (FVC) of 48%, in addition to axial/proximal muscle weakness. The creatine kinase (CK) level ranged from normal to no more than 5-fold the upper normal limit (UNL). LOPD with isolated hyperCKemia was not identified. Less frequent hyperCKemia and predominant RI depict a different early portrait of adult Chinese patients with LOPD. A modified high-risk screening strategy should be proposed for the early diagnosis of Chinese patients with LOPD."

In this review, we focus on different metabolic diseases with respiratory symptoms in adults: lysosomal glycosphingolipidoses such as acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (Niemann-Pick types A and B disease), Gaucher, Fabry, Pompe diseases and mucopolysaccharidoses in general. We also address classical homocystinuria, which is a monogenic vascular disease, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, which is associated with disorders in the lysosomal-related-organelles, and lysinuric protein intolerance, which is due to an amino-acid transporter defect. Presentation and prognosis of these diseases are highly heterogeneous, and respiratory impairment may be central and prognostic. Many are primarily pediatric, and diagnoses are often delivered during childhood. Improved pediatric management has enabled better prognosis and new phenotype of the diseases in the adulthood. Some others can be diagnosed during adulthood. While some diseases call for specific, specialized treatment, all necessitate systematic multidisciplinary management. It is of paramount importance that a pneumologist be familiar with these phenotypes, most of which can benefit from early diagnosis and early therapeutic management with dedicated innovative treatments."

We aimed to evaluate abdominal muscles in LOPD compared in DM1 using muscle ultrasonography. Patients with LOPD (<i>n</i> = 3), DM1 (<i>n</i> = 10), and age- and gender-matched healthy subjects (<i>n</i> = 34) were enrolled for muscle ultrasonography. Patients with LOPD and DM1 were 20 to 59 years of age with a disease duration ranging between 7 and 30 years. A multifrequency linear transducer was used to evaluate quality and thickness in the abdominal muscles and extremities. The quantitative muscle echo score revealed a higher Z score in abdominal muscles in Patients with LOPD (scores were relatively normal for the biceps and flexor digitorum groups). Patients with LOPD had significantly lower abdominal muscle thickness than patients with DM1. Abdominal muscle strength was significantly correlated with the muscle echogenicity, trunk impairment scale, and trunk control test. The extremities' sum score was correlated with the total Medical Research Council score. The increased quantitative muscle score in abdominal muscles, sparing the biceps and flexor digitorum groups, may offer differential diagnosis between LOPD and DM1. Ultrasound can easily access abdominal muscles and investigate muscle echogenicity and thickness. A quantitative approach using muscle echogenicity rather than muscle thickness may provide a greater correlation with trunk muscle function."

Patients with PD develop cellular dysfunction and muscle damage. PD can be classified into two classic forms, namely infantile-onset PD (IOPD) and late-onset PD (LOPD). Delayed treatment, particularly in IOPD, would result in significant organ damage and early death. Nonetheless, early diagnosis and timely treatment are often hampered by the rarity of PD and its wide variety of, but overlapping, symptoms. This article reviews the common clinical presentations of PD and outlines the essentials of PD management. In particular, the implications of newborn screening (NBS) and clinical performance of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) are highlighted."

This long-term follow-up study demonstrates our diagnostic and treatment strategies for IOPD and compares our clinical outcomes with those of other medical centres. In this long-term follow-up study, we analysed the outcomes of very early ERT with premedication hydrocortisone in patients with IOPD. Out of 1 228 539 infants screened between 1 January 2010 and 28 February 2021, 33 newborns had confirmed IOPD in Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Twenty-six were regularly treated and monitored at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Echocardiographic parameters, biomarkers, IgG antibodies against alglucosidase alpha, pulmonary function variables and developmental status were all assessed regularly over an average follow-up duration of 6.18±3.14 years. We compared the long-term treatment outcomes of our patients with those of other research groups. The average age at ERT initiation was 9.75±3.17 days for patients with classic IOPD. The average of the latest antialglucosidase alpha IgG titre was 669.23±1159.23. All enrolled patients had normal heart sizes, motor milestones, cognitive function and pulmonary function that were near-normal to normal. Compared with patients in other studies, our patients had better outcomes in all aspects. Very early ERT using our rapid diagnostic and treatment strategy enabled our patients with IOPD to have better outcomes than patients in other medical centres."

A systematic search was performed to retrieve and critically assess economic evaluations of enzyme replacement therapy. Publications were screened according to predefined criteria and evaluated according to the Quality of Economic Studies. Data were narratively synthesized. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio greatly exceeded willingness to pay thresholds. The cost of the medication dominated the sensitivity analysis. For Infantile-onset Pompe's disease, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated at €1.043.868 per Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) based on the dose of alglucosidase 40 mg/kg/ week, and €286.114 per QALY for 20 mg of alglucosidase/kg/2 weeks. For adults patients presenting with Pompe disease the reported was ICER € 1.8 million/ QALY. In the case of Fabry disease, the ICER per QALY amounts to 6.1 million Euros/QALY. Respectively for Gaucher's disease, the ICER /QALY was estimated at € 884,994 per QALY. Finally, for patients presenting LAL deficiency NCPE perpetuated an ICER of €2,701,000/QALY. ERT comprise a promising treatment modality for orphan diseases; nevertheless, it is interlaced with a substantial economic burden. Moreover, the available data on the cost-effectiveness ratio are scarce. For certain diseases, such as Fabry, a thorough selection of patients could exert a beneficial effect on the reported ICER. Steep price reductions are imperative for these products, in the conventional reimbursement pathway or a new assessment framework should be elaborated, which in principle, should target uncertainty."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is an inherited metabolic myopathy caused by deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), resulting in lysosomal glycogen accumulation. Residual GAA enzyme activity affects disease onset and severity, although other factors, including dysregulation of cytoplasmic glycogen metabolism, are suspected to modulate the disease course. In this study, performed in mice and patient biopsies, we found elevated protein levels of enzymes involved in glucose uptake and cytoplasmic glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle from mice with Pompe disease, including glycogenin (GYG1), glycogen synthase (GYS1), glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), glycogen branching enzyme 1 (GBE1), and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP2). Expression levels were elevated before the loss of muscle mass and function. For first time, quantitative mass spectrometry in skeletal muscle biopsies from five adult patients with Pompe disease showed increased expression of GBE1 protein relative to healthy controls at the group level. Paired analysis of individual patients who responded well to treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) showed reduction of GYS1, GYG1, and GBE1 in all patients after start of ERT compared to baseline. These results indicate that metabolic changes precede muscle wasting in Pompe disease, and imply a positive feedforward loop in Pompe disease, in which lysosomal glycogen accumulation promotes cytoplasmic glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake, resulting in aggravation of the disease phenotype."

An enzymatic newborn screening (NBS) program started regionally in Japan in 2013 for early enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). We report the ERT responses of the first NBS-identified Japanese IOPD case and of another case diagnosed prior to NBS, to discuss the problems of promptly starting ERT in Japan. Acid alpha-glucosidase activity was measured by fluorometric assay in both patients. The diagnosis of IOPD was confirmed by next-generation followed by Sanger-method sequencing (patient 1) or direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified products (patient 2) of the GAA gene. A female infant identified by NBS had a novel out-of-frame (p.F181Dfs*6) variant and a reported pathogenic (p.R600C) variant, along with two pseudodeficiency variants. Enzyme replacement therapy was started at age 58 days when the infant had increased serum levels of creatine kinase and slight myocardial hypertrophy. Clinical and biochemical markers improved promptly. She has been alive and well without delayed development at age 14 months. Patient 2, a Japanese male, received a diagnosis of IOPD at age 5 months before the NBS era. He had a homozygotic variant of GAA (p.R608X), later registered as a cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM)-negative genotype, and developed a high titer of anti-rhGAA antibodies. The patient has survived myocardial hypertrophy with continuous respiratory support for 12 years of ERT. Enzyme replacement therapy should not be delayed over the age of 2 months for reversible cardiac function, although CRIM-negative cases may hamper turnaround time reduction."

This leads to an expansion of the phenotypic spectrum, whereby new or previously less relevant disease manifestations in different organ systems gain more importance. The care of adolescents and young adults with neuromuscular diseases, therefore, requires increasingly close interdisciplinary collaboration within neuromuscular centers. How can the transition process from pediatric to adult care be structured so that the individual disciplines are efficiently integrated into the complex treatment and care process, and the patients' quality of life is improved? A structured transition process was established at the University Hospital in Essen, Germany. Exemplarily, a comparable care concept was developed based on Pompe disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and juvenile myasthenia gravis comprising four elements: (1) With the introduction of cross-department standard operating procedures, the logistical processes, as well as the diagnostic and therapeutic measures, are uniformly coordinated, and the transition process is bindingly defined. (2) To ensure a seamless transition, young patients are seen with their parents during joint consultations before they reach their 17th birthday. This creates an opportunity for patients to get to know the subsequent department structure and build a lasting relationship of trust. (3) A quarterly \"transition board\" regularly brings together the participating disciplines from pediatric and adult care systems for a case-related interdisciplinary exchange and continuous optimization of the transition process. (4) A cross-department \"Transition Database\", in which medical findings and parameters are recorded, was implemented as a common information platform and database.

An adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) encoding an excitatory DREADD (AAV9-hSyn-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry, 2.44 × 10<sup>10</sup> vg) was administered to the posterior tongue of 5-7-wk-old Gaa null (<i>Gaa<sup>-/-</sup></i>) mice.

The sign is potentially important due to associations with clinically recurrent abdominal pain or even colonic volvulus. Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) could have the high prevalence of CS because of widened hepatodiaphragmatic space, following diaphragmatic atrophy, and the abnormal dilation of intestine caused by glycogen accumulation in smooth muscle of intestine. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of CS in LOPD, and to identify the risk factors of CS in LOPD patients. Medical records of genetically confirmed patients of Pompe disease at the National Center Hospital, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry were retrospectively reviewed. We evaluated CS using chest X-ray (CXR) and abdominal CT and assessed the prevalence of CS in LOPD patients. We also divided the patients into two groups, CS and non-CS group, and evaluated the factor associated with CS compared to clinical variables between groups. Three of seven (43%) were detected in CS. CS group (P5-7) and non-CS group (P1-4) were obtained. In comparison of clinical variables, the severity of atrophy in right diaphragms was significantly higher in CS than non-CS groups (p = 0.029).

As a result, glycogen accumulates in several tissues including motor neurons, skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles. The course of the disease varies according to the type of mutations, and the clinical phenotype can be affected by the enzyme levels. Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a challenging issue for clinicians as it has a milder phenotype with later onset of symptoms and slower disease progression. One of the most important differentials in the diagnosis of LOPD is inflammatory myositis as both diseases have some common clinical and laboratory features. Herein, we presented a 30-year-old female patient initially diagnosed as polymyositis and treated with immunosuppressive therapy without a benefit on her symptoms and later diagnosed as LOPD."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the acid α-glucosidase gene leading to a multiorgan deficiency of the enzyme acid glucosidase alfa. To recover to a nondiseased status, a lift over a threshold of 25% acid glucosidase alfa enzyme activity is required. This update on therapeutic thoroughfares for adult Pompe disease aims to assist neuromuscular and metabolic specialists. We reviewed the recent studies covering enzyme replacement therapy, gene therapy, and substrate reduction therapy in adult Pompe disease. Results of phase 3 studies and the first sets of long-term data of both novel enzyme replacement therapies, avalglucosidase alfa, and ciplaglucodsidase alfa combined with miglustat, are public. First gene therapy trials are ongoing. Substrate reduction therapy is in early transition to the clinical trial phase. We still miss dose escalation and intensification of frequency trials on enzyme replacement therapy in adults, probably suitable to echo current results in infantile and juvenile Pompe disease. Therapy of Pompe disease reaches new thoroughfares reducing the overall disease burden of patients; however, individualization of these novel therapeutic options remains challenging. Consensus-based and shared decision-based recommendations need to be established based on reliable real-world data to allow the best standards of care worldwide."

Herein, we report a 1,6-<i>epi</i>-cyclophellitol cyclosulfamidate as a new class of reversible α-glucosidase inhibitors that displays enzyme inhibitory activity by virtue of its conformational mimicry of the substrate when bound in the Michaelis complex. The α-d-<i>glc-</i>configured cyclophellitol cyclosulfamidate <b>4</b> binds in a competitive manner the human lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (GAA), ER α-glucosidases, and, at higher concentrations, intestinal α-glucosidases, displaying an excellent selectivity over the human β-glucosidases GBA and GBA2 and glucosylceramide synthase (GCS). Cyclosulfamidate <b>4</b> stabilizes recombinant human GAA (rhGAA, alglucosidase alfa, Myozyme) in cell medium and plasma and facilitates enzyme trafficking to lysosomes. It stabilizes rhGAA more effectively than existing small-molecule chaperones and does so <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in cellulo</i>, and <i>in vivo</i> in zebrafish, thus representing a promising therapeutic alternative to Miglustat for Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Newborn screening (NBS) for Pompe disease (PD) was added to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) in the United States in 2015 because there was compelling evidence of health benefits for early diagnosis of Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD). However, one limitation of NBS for PD is its inability to distinguish IOPD and late onset forms of Pompe disease (LOPD). Management of LOPD is challenging because of uncertainty around progression of LOPD and determining the appropriate time for treatment initiation. The aims of this study were to understand the impact of LOPD identified through NBS, by exploring the differences in attitudes, emotions and opinions among parents and identify their needs for follow-up care. Study participants were recruited from states that included PD on their NBS panel. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents of nine children who were diagnosed with LOPD after an abnormal NBS result. Predominantly, parents reported a lack of adequate information, guidance, and psychosocial support from the very beginning and through the course of their diagnosis. This caused uncertainty, anxiety, frustration, and fear of the unknown. Parents live in a 'worry or not to worry' phase, balancing between coping methods to avoid over medicalization of their child, but also preparing concrete follow-up plans to be on the lookout for any signs of PD-related symptoms. Understanding parents' experiences allows genetic counselors and NBS programs to proactively design care plan for parents during this difficult period."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease was added to the United States recommended uniform screening panel in 2015 to avoid diagnostic delay and implement prompt treatment, specifically for those with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD). However, most newborns with abnormal newborn screening (NBS) for Pompe disease have late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). An early diagnosis of LOPD raises the question of when symptoms will arise which is challenging for parents, patients, and providers managing an LOPD diagnosis. This study aimed to characterize mothers' experiences of their child's LOPD diagnosis and medical monitoring. A qualitative descriptive approach was chosen to gain an in-depth understanding of parental experiences. Eight mothers were interviewed about their experiences with positive NBS and diagnosis, experiences with living with the diagnosis, and experiences with medical monitoring. Interview transcripts were analyzed through conventional content analysis. Negative emotions like fear were more frequent with communication of NBS results. Participants expressed uncertainty surrounding age of symptom onset and the future. The medical monitoring experience increased worry but participants expressed that being vigilant with management reassured them. Parental emotions shifted to thankfulness and reassurance with time and education. These findings can provide guidance to providers about the psychosocial implications of receiving positive NBS results and an LOPD diagnosis."

To describe the genotype and clinical characteristics of Mexican patients with LOPD. Clinical information from 19 Mexican patients with LOPD confirmed with enzyme activity and GAA gene analysis was reviewed. Genetic information of our population was crossed with international genetic databases. Median age between onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 19 years (range 2-43) and diagnostic confirmation 36 years (range 9-52). Most frequently referred symptoms were proximal axial weakness (n = 17; 89.5%), waddling gait (n = 17; 89.5%) and hyperlordosis (n = 7; 36.8%). Sixteen patients (84.2%) were evaluated with electromyography; a myopathic pattern was reported in 11 (57.8%), but only in 5 patients (26%) paraspinal muscle evaluation was included. The most pathogenic mutations in our group were c.-32-13T>G, c.1799G>A and c.1082C>T. Similar to other international publications, LOPD in Mexico is clinically heterogeneous; patients may delay years before diagnosis is established. Axial and proximal weakness is the most frequent clinical feature; thus, electromyography with paraspinal muscle evaluation is essential. Except for one, the mutations found in our patients have been previously reported in PD genetic databases."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a lysosomal glycogen storage disorder caused by a deficiency in acid α-glucosidase (GAA) activity. Various organs, including the skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and liver, are commonly involved. Early initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human α-glucosidase (rhGAA) can improve the outcome. However, some patients experience a poor clinical course despite ERT because of the emergence of anti-rhGAA antibodies that neutralize rhGAA. Treatment against anti-rhGAA antibodies is challenging. A 14-year-old boy with late-onset PD was referred to our hospital with proteinuria detected by school urinalysis screening. He was diagnosed with PD at the age of 4 years based on muscle biopsy and decreased GAA activity. Treatment with rhGAA was initiated, but anaphylaxis occurred frequently. Anti-rhGAA antibodies were detected and immune tolerance therapy was therefore given, but his antibody titer remained high. Kidney biopsy revealed stage II membranous nephropathy. Immunohistochemistry staining revealed anti-rhGAA antibody/rhGAA immune complexes along the glomerular capillary loop. Aggressive immunotherapy combined with bortezomib and rituximab was then initiated. Serum levels of anti-rhGAA antibodies decreased significantly and his proteinuria finally resolved. There have been few reports of membranous nephropathy associated with ERT for PD. We clarified the cause in the current patient. Bortezomib and rituximab effectively suppressed anti-rhGAA antibody production resulting in the resolution of proteinuria and maintenance of ERT efficacy."

Eligible Chinese subjects with IOPD received an infusion of alglucosidase alfa at a dose of 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks for up to 52 weeks. The primary endpoints of clinical efficacy were the survival rate and changes in the left ventricular mass index (LVMI). The safety assessment was based on the incidence of adverse events (AEs). <b>Results:</b> A total of 10 eligible subjects were enrolled in the study. The mean age at the start of ERT was 5.36 ± 1.56 months. Nine subjects had survived after 52 weeks of treatment. One subject discontinued the study and died after mechanical ventilation was withdrawn. The intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated that the survival rate was 90.0% (95% confidence interval: 55.5-99.7%). The mean LVMI at week 52 was 70.59 ± 39.93 g/m<sup>2</sup> compared to that of 298.02 ± 178.43 g/m<sup>2</sup> at baseline, with a difference of -227.60 ± 155.99 g/m<sup>2</sup>. All subjects had left ventricular mass (LVM) Z scores >10 at baseline, and eight subjects (80%) achieved Z scores <5 at week 52. No treatment-related AEs were observed, and no AEs led to the discontinuation of treatment. <b>Conclusions:</b> This clinical trial is the first study of ERT for IOPD in China, indicating that alglucosidase alfa has favourable efficacy and safety for the treatment of Chinese patients with IOPD (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03687333)."

    "abstract": "To evaluate changes in diaphragmatic function in Pompe disease using MRI over time, both during natural disease course and during treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). In this prospective study, 30 adult Pompe patients and 10 healthy controls underwent pulmonary function tests and spirometry-controlled MRI twice, with an interval of 1 year. In the sagittal view of 3D gradient echo breath-hold acquisitions, diaphragmatic motion (cranial-caudal ratio between end-inspiration and end-expiration) and curvature (diaphragm height and area ratio) were calculated using a machine learning algorithm based on convolutional neural networks. Changes in outcomes after 1 year were compared between Pompe patients and healthy controls using the Mann-Whitney test. Pulmonary function outcomes and cranial-caudal ratio in Pompe patients did not change significantly over time compared to healthy controls. Diaphragm height ratio increased by 0.04 (-0.38 to 1.79) in Pompe patients compared to -0.02 (-0.18 to 0.25) in healthy controls (p = 0.02). An increased diaphragmatic curvature over time was observed in particular in untreated Pompe patients (p = 0.03), in those receiving ERT already for over 3 years (p = 0.03), and when severe diaphragmatic weakness was found on the initial MRI (p = 0.01); no progression was observed in Pompe patients who started ERT less than 3 years ago and in Pompe patients with mild diaphragmatic weakness on their initial MRI. MRI enables to detect small changes in diaphragmatic curvature over 1-year time in Pompe patients. It also showed that once severe diaphragmatic weakness has occurred, improvement of diaphragmatic muscle function seems unlikely. • Changes in diaphragmatic curvature in Pompe patients over time assessed with 3D MRI may serve as an outcome measure to evaluate the effect of treatment on diaphragmatic function. • Diaphragmatic curvature showed a significant deterioration after 1 year in Pompe patients compared to healthy controls, but the curvature seems to remain stable over this period in patients who were treated with enzyme replacement therapy for less than 3 years, possibly indicating a positive effect of ERT. • Improvement of diaphragmatic curvature over time is rarely seen in Pompe patients once diaphragmatic motion shows severe impairment (cranial-caudal inspiratory/expiratory ratio < 1.4)."

    "abstract": "Infantile onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is a rare devastating disease that presents in early infancy with rapidly progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe generalized myopathy and death within the first year of life. The emergence of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human acid alpha glucosidase (rhGAA) has improved the natural course of IOPD with a significant impact on cardiomyopathy but has a more limited effect on the progression of myopathy and consequently the later deterioration of the disease. Possible reasons for reduced ERT efficacy include insufficient enzyme, partial targeting of skeletal muscle and the development of IgG rhGAA antibodies especially in patients who are cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM) negative. We report a CRIM-negative IOPD female patient who started treatment upon diagnosis at 4.5 months with ERT at 20 mg/kg every other week and a course of combined immunomodulation with rituximab, methotrexate and IVIG according to the published Duke protocol and increased ERT within a month to 40 mg/kg/week. Despite initial good clinical response to ERT and immunomodulation, monthly monitoring identified a gradual increase of serum antibody titers to rhGAA necessitating a second course of immunomodulation with bortezomib and maintenance rituximab and methotrexate. A gradual reduction in frequency of immunotherapy was instituted and over a period of 14 months was discontinued. Serum anti-rhGAA antibody titers remained negative for 5 months since cessation of immunomodulation and the patient is now immune tolerant with recovery of CD19. At the age of 30 months the patient is walking independently and has normal cardiac function and anatomy. We recommend initiating ERT at 40 mg/kg/week in CRIM-negative IOPD patients, concomitant with immunomodulation and monthly monitoring of serum anti-rhGAA IgG titers upon confirmation of the diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Glycogen is the primary energy reserve in mammals, and dysregulation of glycogen metabolism can result in glycogen storage diseases (GSDs). In muscle, glycogen synthesis is initiated by the enzymes glycogenin-1 (GYG1), which seeds the molecule by autoglucosylation, and glycogen synthase-1 (GYS1), which extends the glycogen chain. Although both enzymes are required for proper glycogen production, the nature of their interaction has been enigmatic. Here, we present the human GYS1:GYG1 complex in multiple conformations representing different functional states. We observe an asymmetric conformation of GYS1 that exposes an interface for close GYG1 association, and propose this state facilitates handoff of the GYG1-associated glycogen chain to a GYS1 subunit for elongation. Full activation of GYS1 widens the GYG1-binding groove, enabling GYG1 release concomitant with glycogen chain growth. This structural mechanism connecting chain nucleation and extension explains the apparent stepwise nature of glycogen synthesis and suggests distinct states to target for GSD-modifying therapeutics."

Hypoglycemia represents one of the most common metabolic emergencies in childhood, potentially leading to serious neurologic sequelae, including death. Therefore, appropriate investigation of its specific etiology is paramount to provide adequate diagnosis, specific therapy and prevent its recurrence. In the absence of critical samples for biochemical studies, etiological assessment of children with hypoglycemia may include dynamic methods, such as <i>in vivo</i> functional tests, and continuous glucose monitoring. By providing detailed information on actual glucose fluxes <i>in vivo</i>, proof-of-concept studies have illustrated the potential (clinical) application of dynamic stable isotope techniques to define biochemical and clinical phenotypes of inherited metabolic diseases associated with hypoglycemia. According to the textbooks, individuals with glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I) display the most severe hypoglycemia/fasting intolerance. In this review, three dynamic methods are discussed which may be considered during both diagnostic work-up and monitoring of children with hypoglycemia: 1) functional <i>in vivo</i> tests; 2) <i>in vivo</i> metabolic profiling by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM); 3) stable isotope techniques. Future applications and benefits of dynamic methods in children with hypoglycemia are also discussed."

This study aimed to develop a novel proteomics-based assay for rapid and accurate second-tier screening of PD and MPS I. A fast turnaround assay would enable the identification of severe cases who need immediate clinical follow up and treatment. We developed an immunocapture coupled with mass spectrometry-based proteomics (Immuno-SRM) assay to quantify GAA and IDUA proteins in dried blood spots (DBS) and buccal swabs. Sensitivity, linearity, reproducibility, and protein concentration range in healthy control samples were determined. Clinical performance was evaluated in known PD and MPS I patients as well as pseudodeficiency and carrier cases. Using three 3.2 mm punches (~13.1 μL of blood) of DBS, the assay showed reproducible and sensitive quantification of GAA and IDUA. Both proteins can also be quantified in buccal swabs with high reproducibility and sensitivity. Infantile onset Pompe disease (IOPD) and severe MPS I cases are readily identifiable due to the absence of GAA and IDUA, respectively. In addition, late onset Pompe disease (LOPD) and attenuated MPS I patients showed much reduced levels of the target protein. By contrast, pseudodeficiency and carrier cases exhibited significant higher target protein levels compared to true patients. Direct quantification of endogenous GAA and IDUA peptides in DBS by Immuno-SRM can be used for second-tier screening to rapidly identify severe PD and MPS I patients with a turnaround time of <1 week. Such patients could benefit from immediate clinical follow up and possibly earlier treatment."

To assess CGM metrics for glycemic variation and glycemic control in adult patients with GSDIa as compared to matched healthy volunteers. Prospective CGM data were collected during the ENGLUPRO GSDIa trial (NCT04311307) in which a Dexcom G6 device was used. Ten adult patients with GSDIa and 10 age-, sex- and body mass index-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled. Capillary blood glucose was concurrently measured during 2 standardized 2-hour time intervals. Descriptive [eg, glycemic variability (GV), time below range, time in range (TIR), time above range (TAR)] and advanced (ie, first- and second-order derivatives, Fourier analysis) CGM outcomes were calculated. For each descriptive CGM outcome measure, 95% CIs were computed in patients with GSDIa and healthy volunteers, respectively. CGM overestimation was higher under preprandial and level 1 hypoglycemia (ie, capillary glucose values ≥ 3.0 mmol/L and < 3.9 mmol/L) conditions. GV and TAR were higher while TIR was lower in patients with GSDIa compared to healthy volunteers (P < 0.05). Three patients with GSDIa showed descriptive CGM outcomes outside the calculated 95% CI in GSDIa patients. Advanced CGM analysis revealed a distinct pattern (ie, first- and second-order derivatives and glucose curve amplitude) in each of these 3 patients within the patients group. This is the first study to prospectively compare CGM outcomes between adult patients with GSDIa and matched healthy volunteers. The generation of a set of CGM metrics will provide guidance in using and interpreting CGM data in GSDIa and will be useful for the definition of glycemic targets for CGM in patients with GSDIa. Future studies should investigate the prognostic value of CGM outcomes and their major determinants in patients with GSDIa."

    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease type 2 (also known as Pompe disease) is a metabolic disorder characterized by an accumulation of glycogen within lysosomes. Pathophysiologically, this condition is caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of the lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme, resulting in defects in lysosomal metabolism. Glycogen accumulation causes advanced muscle weakness (myopathy) throughout the body, including the heart, skeletal muscles, liver, and the neurological system. Currently, there is no definitive treatment for Pompe disease. However, recent studies have indicated that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) can be effective. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune illness that affects the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors and causes fatigue that can be eased by rest. MG is frequently accompanied by a thymoma. Dyspnea and/or bulbar symptoms can indicate an imminent crisis requiring immediate intervention. Here, we present a rare case of a four-year-old female patient who initially presented at the age of one month with the infantile form of Pompe disease and congenital myasthenia syndrome type 5. The patient presented with bradycardia, poor suckling, respiratory distress, and respiratory failure requiring assisted ventilation, subglottic stenosis, and tachypnea. Whole exome sequencing was used for definitive diagnosis. ERT (Myozyme) was administered with good results.

However, clinicians face numerous clinical challenges related to the diagnosis of the disease. Two expert group committee meetings, involving 11 experts from the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Oman, were convened in October 2019 and November 2020 respectively to develop a uniform diagnostic algorithm for the diagnosis of pediatric and adult LOPD in the Arabian Peninsula region. During the first meeting, the specialty-specific clinical presentation of LOPD was defined. During the second meeting, a diagnostic algorithm was developed after a thorough validation of clinical presentation or symptoms, which was performed with the aid of existing literature and expert judgement. A consensus was reached on the diagnostic algorithm for field specialists, such as neurologists, rheumatologists, general practitioners/internal medicine specialists, orthopedic specialists, and pulmonologists. This specialty-specific diagnostic referral algorithm for pediatric and adult LOPD will guide clinicians in the differential diagnosis of LOPD."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is usually considered in children with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and decreased acidic α-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme activity. However, there are exceptions, such as GAA pseudo deficiency alleles, which result in lower GAA enzyme activity but do not cause Pompe disease. Here, we report two cases presenting with high CK levels and low GAA activity who were ultimately diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Case 1 patient was a 2-month-old boy who presented with an extremely high serum CK level (5,480∼11,880 U/L) and low GAA activity (2.72 nmol/1 h/mg). The whole-exome sequencing did not find the pathogenic GAA gene mutation, however, there was a DMD gene hemizygous variation (c. 7657C > T, p. Arg2553Ter) inherited from his mother, which was verified by the first-generation sequencing. Further genetic analysis of GAA identified two homozygous pseudo deficiency alleles (c.1726G > A, p. Gly576Ser and c.2065G > A, p. Glu689Lys), which were believed to induce the patient's low GAA activity. Therefore, the boy was diagnosed with DMD, although he had extremely low GAA activity. Case 2 patient was also a 2-month-old boy presenting with a significant increase in CK level (12,408∼24,828 U/L). His blood GAA activity (colorimetric method) was 9.02 nmol/1 h/mg. Similarly, his whole-exome sequencing did not find the pathogenic mutation of the GAA gene, but a DMD gene hemizygous variation (c.5571del, p. Lys1857AsnfsTer8), hence he was diagnosed with DMD as well. Regarding GAA activity, the case 2 patient was not as low as the case 1 patient, mainly because his two GAA pseudo deficiency alleles were heterozygous. Pompe disease is usually screened in infants with high CK levels. We should be aware that pseudo deficiency alleles can cause low GAA activities but not Pompe disease. Genetic tests would be helpful to distinguish cases with GAA pseudo deficiency alleles from patients with some muscular disorder diseases such as DMD."

    "abstract": "Alglucosidase alpha is an orphan drug approved for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in Pompe disease (PD); however, its efficacy is limited in skeletal muscle because of a partial blockage of autophagic flux that hinders intracellular trafficking and enzyme delivery. Adjunctive therapies that enhance autophagic flux and protect mitochondrial integrity may alleviate autophagic blockage and oxidative stress and thereby improve ERT efficacy in PD. In this study, we compared the benefits of ERT combined with a ketogenic diet (ERT-KETO), daily administration of an oral ketone precursor (1,3-butanediol; ERT-BD), a multi-ingredient antioxidant diet (ERT-MITO; CoQ10, α-lipoic acid, vitamin E, beetroot extract, HMB, creatine, and citrulline), or co-therapy with the ketone precursor and multi-ingredient antioxidants (ERT-BD-MITO) on skeletal muscle pathology in GAA-KO mice. We found that two months of 1,3-BD administration raised circulatory ketone levels to ≥1.2 mM, attenuated autophagic buildup in type 2 muscle fibers, and preserved muscle strength and function in ERT-treated GAA-KO mice. Collectively, ERT-BD was more effective vs. standard ERT and ERT-KETO in terms of autophagic clearance, dampening of oxidative stress, and muscle maintenance. However, the addition of multi-ingredient antioxidants (ERT-BD-MITO) provided the most consistent benefits across all outcome measures and normalized mitochondrial protein expression in GAA-KO mice. We therefore conclude that nutritional co-therapy with 1,3-butanediol and multi-ingredient antioxidants may provide an alternative to ketogenic diets for inducing ketosis and enhancing autophagic flux in PD patients."

In 53.6% (n = 56) of the patients (23 patients with Gaucher disease [10 type III, 13 type I], 26 patients with MPS [8 type VI, 11 type IVA, 1 type III, 3 type II, and 3 type I], and 7 patients with Pompe disease), an abnormality in at least one of the autoimmunity or immunodeficiency parameters was reported. Furthermore, 12 (57%) of 21 Gaucher cases (7 type III, 5 type I), 18 (40.9%) of 44 MPS cases (9 type IVA, 5 type VI, 1 type I, 2 type II, and 1 type III), and six (66%) of nine Pompe cases were reported to involve abnormalities in at least one of the parameters related to immunodeficiency. Immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgA levels were reported to be lower, and there were abnormalities in the lymphocyte counts and subgroups in the MPS group. ANA was reported to be positive in one patient with Gaucher type III, anti-DNA in two patients with Gaucher type I and one patient with MPS type VI, antithyroglobulin in two patients with Gaucher type I, anti-TPO in one patient with Gaucher type I, TRAB in one patient with Gaucher type I, antiphospholipid IgM in three patients with Gaucher type III and one patient with Gaucher type I, anticardiolipin IgM in one patient with Gaucher type I, one patient with Gaucher type III, and one patient with MPS type II. However, no clinical presentation was consistent with the laboratory results except for one patient with Gaucher type I disease with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Two of the four patients who survived the COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms had a diagnosis of Gaucher type I, and no abnormality was detected in their laboratory tests. The other two patients had a diagnosis of MPS types VI and II. Immune dysfunction was detected in the patient with a diagnosis of MPS type II. Four of our patients were discharged without any sequelae. Problems with immunity did not cause any noticeable clinical results. Being well protected by reducing social contact might have played a role. However, we believe that it should be borne in mind that cardiac and pulmonary involvement, as well as immune dysfunction in LSDs, may cause an increased need for intensive care because of secondary bacterial infections."

    "title": "GFPT1-Associated Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome Mimicking a Glycogen Storage Disease - Diagnostic Pitfalls in Myopathology Solved by Next-Generation-Sequencing.",
    "abstract": "GFPT1-related congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) is characterized by progressive limb girdle weakness, and less prominent involvement of facial, bulbar, or respiratory muscles. While tubular aggregates in muscle biopsy are considered highly indicative in GFPT1-associated CMS, excessive glycogen storage has not been described. Here, we report on three affected siblings with limb-girdle myasthenia due to biallelic pathogenic variants in GFPT1: the previously reported missense variant c.41G > A (p.Arg14Gln) and the novel truncating variant c.1265_1268del (p.Phe422TrpfsTer26). Patients showed progressive proximal atrophic muscular weakness with respiratory involvement, and a lethal disease course in adulthood. In the diagnostic workup at that time, muscle biopsy suggested a glycogen storage disease. Initially, Pompe disease was suspected. However, enzymatic activity of acid alpha-glucosidase was normal, and gene panel analysis including 38 genes associated with limb-girdle weakness (GAA included) remained unevocative. Hence, a non-specified glycogen storage myopathy was diagnosed. A decade later, the diagnosis of GFPT1-related CMS was established by genome sequencing. Myopathological reexamination showed pronounced glycogen accumulations, that were exclusively found in denervated muscle fibers. Only single fibers showed very small tubular aggregates, identified in evaluation of serial sections. This family demonstrates how diagnostic pitfalls can be addressed by an integrative approach including broad genetic analysis and re-evaluation of clinical as well as myopathological findings."

Retrospective observational study that included patients with LDS treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT). Published clinical trials (CT) and LDS treatment guidelines were reviewed to select efficacy variables. Data to measure them (and adverse effects) were obtained from the medical history. No CTs have been found in which efficacy is evaluated with final variables, all have been surrogated. Twenty-two patients were included: eight with Gaucher disease, six with Niemann-PickC disease, two with Hunter disease, one with Morquio-A disease, and five with Pompe disease. Eight patients have responded to ERT and one to SRT with eliglustat. ERT has not been associated with adverse effects. Miglustat has produced tolerance problems, requiring a change in a patient. The effectiveness was variable according to the pathology. Regarding safety, manageable adverse reactions to SRT were associated with dosage adjustments."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) gene. Most gene therapies (GT) partially rely on the cross-correction of unmodified cells through the uptake of the GAA enzyme secreted by corrected cells. In the present study, we generated isogenic murine GAA-KO cell lines resembling severe mutations from Pompe patients. All of the generated GAA-KO cells lacked GAA activity and presented an increased autophagy and increased glycogen content by means of myotube differentiation as well as the downregulation of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (CI-MPRs), validating them as models for PD. Additionally, different chimeric murine GAA proteins (IFG, IFLG and 2G) were designed with the aim to improve their therapeutic activity. Phenotypic rescue analyses using lentiviral vectors point to IFG chimera as the best candidate in restoring GAA activity, normalising the autophagic marker p62 and surface levels of CI-MPRs. Interestingly, in vivo administration of liver-directed AAVs expressing the chimeras further confirmed the good behaviour of IFG, achieving cross-correction in heart tissue. In summary, we generated different isogenic murine muscle cell lines mimicking the severe PD phenotype, as well as validating their applicability as preclinical models in order to reduce animal experimentation."

    "abstract": "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the current standard treatment for Pompe disease, a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). ERT has shown to be lifesaving in patients with classic infantile Pompe disease. However, a major drawback is the development of neutralizing antibodies against ERT. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell-mediated lentiviral gene therapy (HSPC-LVGT) provides a novel, potential lifelong therapy with a single intervention and may induce immune tolerance. Here, we investigated whether ERT can be safely applied as additional or alternative therapy following HSPC-LVGT in a murine model of Pompe disease. We found that lentiviral expression at subtherapeutic dose was sufficient to induce tolerance to the transgene product, as well as to subsequently administered ERT. Immune tolerance was established within 4-6 weeks after gene therapy. The mice tolerated ERT doses up to 100 mg/kg, allowing ERT to eliminate glycogen accumulation in cardiac and skeletal muscle and normalizing locomotor function. The presence of HSPC-derived cells expressing GAA in the thymus suggested the establishment of central immune tolerance. These findings demonstrate that lentiviral gene therapy in murine Pompe disease induced robust and long-term immune tolerance to GAA either expressed by a transgene or supplied as ERT."

Pompe, Gaucher and Krabbe are characterized by the deficiency of acid α-glucosidase (GAA), β-Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) and galactocerebrosidase (GALC), and treatable if detected in their early stages. Here, we present the fabrication of an electrochemical immunosensor for the multiplexed quantification and simultaneous detection of GAA, GBA and GALC. The sensor was developed by electrodepositing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on an array of carbon electrodes, followed by the immobilization of GAA, GBA and GALC specific antibodies via functionalization with cysteamine and glutaraldehyde. The multiplexed immunosensor was able to successfully detect GAA, GBA and GALC at the femtomolar level with respective low detection limits of 0.12 pg/ml, 0.31 pg/ml and 0.18 pg/ml. The immunosensor showed good selectivity, sensitivity and good recovery when spiked in human serum, which confirms its possible applicability in point-of-care testing for the early diagnosis of LSDs."

Assessments by the means of a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and grip strength were applied at multiple points throughout the program. Two cases showed an increase in lean mass index of +0.319 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, +0.721 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and bone mineral content of +0.028 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, +0.031 kg/m<sup>2</sup> over one year. Additionally physiotherapeutic therapy goals could be achieved. In the remaining child lean mass index did not change, bone mineral content decreased by -0.03 kg. The neuromuscular rehabilitation program \"Auf die Beine\" has shown to be safe and effective in two of three cases for muscle and bone mass gain as well as in achievement of physiotherapeutic goals. To summarize, WBV is an innovative therapy in a rehabilitation concept, which might be helpful in Pompe disease, but further studies with larger cohorts are needed."

Avalglucosidase alfa, a recombinant human GAA enzyme replacement therapy designed for increased cellular uptake and glycogen clearance, has been studied for long-term efficacy and safety in patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). Here, we report up to 6.5 years' experience with avalglucosidase alfa during the NEO1 and NEO-EXT studies. NEO1 participants with LOPD, either treatment naive (Naive Group) or receiving alglucosidase alfa for ≥9 months (Switch Group), received avalglucosidase alfa (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg every other week [qow]) for 6 months before entering NEO-EXT and continued their NEO1 dose until all proceeded with 20 mg/kg qow. Safety and efficacy, a prespecified exploratory secondary outcome, were assessed; slopes of change for efficacy outcomes were calculated from a repeated mixed-measures model. Twenty-four participants enrolled in NEO1 (Naive Group, n = 10; Switch Group, n = 14); 21 completed and 19 entered NEO-EXT; in February 2020, 17 participants remained in NEO-EXT, with data up to 6.5 years. Avalglucosidase alfa was generally well tolerated during NEO-EXT, with a safety profile consistent with that in NEO1. No deaths or treatment-related life-threatening serious adverse events occurred. Eighteen participants developed antidrug antibodies without apparent effect on clinical outcomes. No participants who were tested developed immunoglobulin E antibodies. Upright forced vital capacity %predicted remained stable in most participants, with slope estimates (95% CIs) of -0.473 per year (-1.188 to 0.242) and -0.648 per year (-1.061 to -0.236) in the Naive and Switch Groups, respectively. Six-minute walk test (6MWT) %predicted was also stable for most participants, with slope estimates of -0.701 per year (-1.571 to 0.169) and -0.846 per year (-1.567 to -0.125) for the Naive and Switch Groups, respectively. Improvements in 6MWT distance were observed in most participants aged <45 years at NEO1 enrollment in both the Naive and Switch Groups. Avalglucosidase alfa was generally well tolerated for up to 6.5 years in adult participants with LOPD either naive to alglucosidase alfa or who had previously received alglucosidase alfa for ≥9 months. This study provides Class IV evidence of long-term tolerability and sustained efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa in patients with LOPD after up to 6.5 years.

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a rare genetic disorder produced by mutations in the GAA gene and is characterized by progressive muscle weakness. LOPD muscle biopsies show accumulation of glycogen along with the autophagic vacuoles associated with atrophic muscle fibers. The expression of molecules related to muscle fiber atrophy in muscle biopsies of LOPD patients was studied using immunofluorescence and real-time PCR. BCL2 and adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), a well-known atrogene, was identified as a potential mediator of muscle fiber atrophy in LOPD muscle biopsies. Vacuolated fibers in LOPD patient muscle biopsies were smaller than nonvacuolated fibers and expressed BNIP3. The current data suggested that BNIP3 expression is regulated by inhibition of the AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, leading to phosphorylation of Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) at Ser317 by AMP-activated protein kinase. Myoblasts and myotubes obtained from LOPD patients and age-matched controls were studied to confirm these results using different molecular techniques. Myotubes derived from LOPD patients were likewise smaller and expressed BNIP3. Conclusively, transfection of BNIP3 into control myotubes led to myotube atrophy. These findings suggest a cascade that starts with the inhibition of the AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and activation of BNIP3 expression, leading to progressive muscle fiber atrophy. These results open the door to potential new treatments targeting BNIP3 to reduce its deleterious effects on muscle fiber atrophy in Pompe disease."

In severe cases, the natural course is characterized by death due to cardiopulmonary failure in the first year after birth. However, the clinical outcomes have improved since the emergence of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was widely used. The reported female case in China was an atypical IOPD, which demonstrates an unusual presentation of glycogen accumulation syndrome type II without obvious skeletal muscle involvement, and reviewed physical examination, biochemical examinations, chest radiograph, and acid α-glucosidase (GAA) mutation analysis. After 4-mo specific ERT, the case received 12-mo follow-up. Moreover, the patient has obtained a very good prognosis under ERT. For the atypical IOPD patients, early diagnosis and treatment may contribute to good prognosis."

Recent availability in treatment for DMD raised the need of early diagnosis, and DMD became as a selective item of newborn screening (NBS) since Feb. 2021 in our center. Dried blood spots (DBS) muscle-type creatine kinase (CK) isoform was measured with a commercialized kit with age-adjusted cutoffs. Subjects with an elevation of CK in the first screen were requested for a re-screen 2 weeks later. A DBS whole-exome sequencing (WES) panel for dystrophin and other neuromuscular-related genes was applied to confirm the diagnosis for subjects with persistent hyperCKemia. During a 1-year period, 50,572 newborns (male 26,130) received DMD screening at a mean age of 2 days (SD 1 day). Among them, 632 (1.2%) had an elevated CK value. A re-screen at a mean age of 14 days (SD 8 days) revealed 14 subjects with persistent hyperCKemia, and DMD was confirmed in 3 of them. The incidence of DMD in Taiwan was 1:8,710 (95% CI 1 in 2,963 to 1 in 25,610) live birth males. Results of DMD DBS also assisted in Pompe newborn screening. NBS for DMD enables earlier management of the disease. The high re-screening rate could potentially be waived by moving the DBS WES assay to a second-tier test. The long-term benefit and the impact of newborn screening on the prognosis of DMD, however, remain further elucidated."

At 3 months of age, he develops heart failure, respiratory impairment, and neurological deterioration. The echocardiogram revealed concentric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with left-diastolic dysfunction. We found increased creatine-phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and urinary glucose tetrasaccharide levels, 50% of PAS-positive vacuolated lymphocytes in the peripheral blood smear, and low GAA activity. Sequencing of coding exons and flanking intronic sequences revealed a novel homozygous 4 bp deletion in exon 15 of the GAA gene (c.2066_2069delAGCC/p.Glu689Glyfs*6). IOPD was diagnosed. At 5 months old, we started enzyme replacement therapy with an alpha-alglucosidase of 20 mg/kg weekly and immunomodulation with intravenous immunoglobulin. He developed two cardiorespiratory arrests with subsequent neurologic deterioration, convulsive crisis, and respiratory failure and died at 9 months old. We found the usual PD hallmarks in the heart, striated muscle, and liver but also we found neuronal lesions characterized by cytoplasm vacuolization with PAS-positive granules in the central nervous system and myenteric plexus. We describe a novel GAA gene pathogenic variant with a particular phenotype characterized by classic IOPD and neurologic histopathological findings.

In this way, many medical schools have developed formal observational training on works of art to improve their students' visual diagnostic skills.

Observational study. The painting reveals that the Infant Jesus has facial features consistent with some of the main clinical manifestations of Pompe disease (poor head control, facial weakness with open mouth posture, tongue protrusion, and eyelid ptosis). These results may indicate that Botticelli in 1500 may have made the first pictorial representation of Pompe's disease that was only described in the medical literature in 1932. Furthermore, this description demonstrates the importance of the medico-artistic field for the study of any disease during the Renaissance period, which will be essential for the learning process of visual diagnostic."

Clinical data from 112 individuals with GSD Ib were evaluated, representing a total of 94 treatment years. The median age at start of empagliflozin treatment was 10.5 years (range = 0-38 years). Empagliflozin showed positive effects on all neutrophil dysfunction-related symptoms, including oral and urogenital mucosal lesions, recurrent infections, skin abscesses, inflammatory bowel disease, and anemia. Before initiating empagliflozin, most patients with GSD Ib were on G-CSF (94/112; 84%). At the time of the survey, 49 of 89 (55%) patients previously treated with G-CSF had completely stopped G-CSF, and another 15 (17%) were able to reduce the dose. The most common adverse event during empagliflozin treatment was hypoglycemia, occurring in 18% of individuals.

This cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2019 through March 2021 and children with IOPD, who had received early and regular enzyme replacement therapy, were enrolled. Participants or their parents completed the Dysfunctional Voiding Scoring System (DVSS) questionnaire. All children underwent uroflowmetry and postvoid residual urine measurements. Fourteen children (age, 4-9 years) with IOPD were enrolled. Ten patients (71.4%) had abnormal uroflow curves. In addition, results of the DVSS revealed that approximately half (42.9%) of our IOPD patients had voiding dysfunction, with urinary incontinence as the most common symptom (64.3%, 9/14). No significant correlations were found between LUTS and uroflow curves in children with IOPD. The frequency of LUTS and lower urinary tract dysfunction noted on uroflowmetry should encourage pediatricians to actively identify IOPD patients with LUTS, regardless of the timing and frequency of their treatments, and refer them to a urologist for further evaluation and appropriate treatment."

The aim of this study was to analyse the pain characteristics and its relation to a small nerve fiber involvement in LOPD patients. In 35 patients with LOPD under enzyme replacement therapy without clinical signs of polyneuropathy (19 females; 51 ± 15 years), pain characteristics as well as depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the PainDetect questionnaire (PDQ) and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), respectively. Distal skin biopsies were analysed for intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) and compared to age- and gender-matched reference data. Skin biopsies from 20 healthy subjects served as controls to assure validity of the morphometric analysis. Pain was reported in 69% of the patients with an average intensity of 4.1 ± 1.1 on the numeric rating scale (NRS; anchors: 0-10). According to PDQ, neuropathic pain was likely in one patient, possible in 29%, and unlikely in 67%. Relevant depression and anxiety symptoms occurred in 31% and 23%, respectively, and correlated with pain intensity. Distal IENFD (3.98 ± 1.95 fibers/mm) was reduced in 57% of the patients. The degree of IENFD reduction did not correlate with the durations of symptoms to ERT or duration of ERT to biopsy. Pain is a frequent symptom in treated LOPD on ERT, though a screening questionnaire seldom indicated neuropathic pain. The high frequency of small nerve fiber pathology in a treated LOPD cohort was found regardless of the presence of pain or comorbid risk factors for SFN and needs further exploration in terms of clinical context, exact mechanisms and when developing novel therapeutic options for LOPD."

Genetic analysis was performed for samples with decreased activity. The number of myopathologically diagnosed patients was retrospectively assessed. The GAA activity was distributed similarly to previous results from dried blood spot screening. GAA activity measured using muscle sections corresponded to that measured using muscle blocks. Of 163 patients with GAA activity <3 nmol/hour/mg protein, 43 (26%) patients had homozygous pseudodeficiency alleles in <i>GAA</i> (p.G576S and p.E689K). In the retrospective analysis, the number of patients diagnosed with Pompe disease via muscle biopsies decreased to zero over time. Muscle pathology is an accurate method to diagnose Pompe disease.

Neutropenia in GSD-Ib has been known to result from enhanced apoptosis of neutrophils. However, it has also been raised that neutrophil maturation arrest in the bone marrow would contribute to neutropenia. We now show that G6pt<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit severe neutropenia and impaired neutrophil differentiation in the bone marrow. To investigate the role of G6PT in myeloid progenitor cells, the G6PT gene was mutated using CRISPR/Cas9 system, and single cell-derived G6PT<sup>-/-</sup> human promyelocyte HL-60 cell lines were established. The G6PT<sup>-/-</sup> HL-60s exhibited impaired neutrophil differentiation, which is associated with two mechanisms: (i) abnormal lipid metabolism causing a delayed metabolic reprogramming and (ii) reduced nuclear transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) in G6PT<sup>-/-</sup> HL-60s. In this study, we demonstrated that G6PT is essential for neutrophil differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells and regulates PPARγ activity."

    "title": "Late-Onset Pompe Disease Presenting with Isolated Tongue Involvement.",
    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that is caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), which is responsible for glycogen breakdown. It has a wide clinical spectrum but usually presents with limb girdle and respiratory muscles weakness. Tongue involvement has been rarely reported as the sole initial symptom of LOPD. A 65-year-old male presented with difficulty in speech and eating for a 4-year duration. He started to notice speech difficulty with production of particular speech sounds such as /l/, /d/, and /t/. Within 1 year, he developed difficulties in manipulating food with the tongue and oral residue in lateral sulci requiring digital manipulation, which was suggestive of tongue muscles weakness. Clinical examination showed tongue fasciculations, mild atrophic changes, and mild tongue weakness. Investigations showed mildly elevated creatine kinase levels, and electromyography of the tongue muscles revealed moderate spontaneous activity, denervation, chronic reinnervation with high-amplitude motor unit potentials, and positive sharp waves, with preserved recruitment. Given the diagnostic uncertainty, a screening for LOPD was performed using a dried blood spot, and GAA enzyme activity levels were found to be low; 1.06 μmol/L/h (reference values in adults: 2.10-29.00 μmol/L/h). Next-generation sequencing showed pathogenic variant in <i>GAA</i> gene, confirming the diagnosis of LOPD. This rare report of LOPD presenting with isolated tongue involvement adds to the expanding phenotypic variability of this disease. Tongue involvement is an important and early clinical sign of LOPD that needs careful evaluation and can aid in early diagnosis of this rare and treatable disease."

    "title": "What's new and what's next for gene therapy in Pompe disease?",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of acid-α-glucosidase (GAA), an enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing lysosomal glycogen. A lack of GAA leads to accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells, as well as in the central and peripheral nervous system. Enzyme replacement therapy has been the standard of care for 15 years and slows disease progression, particularly in the heart, and improves survival. However, there are limitations of ERT success, which gene therapy can overcome. Gene therapy offers several advantages including prolonged and consistent GAA expression and correction of skeletal muscle as well as the critical CNS pathology. We provide a systematic review of the preclinical and clinical outcomes of adeno-associated viral mediated gene therapy and alternative gene therapy strategies, highlighting what has been successful. Although the preclinical and clinical studies so far have been promising, barriers exist that need to be addressed in gene therapy for Pompe disease. New strategies including novel capsids for better targeting, optimized DNA vectors, and adjuctive therapies will allow for a lower dose, and ameliorate the immune response."

    "title": "Establishment of Cutoff Values for Newborn Screening of Six Lysosomal Storage Disorders by Tandem Mass Spectrometry.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are becoming increasingly important in newborn screening, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is widely used in newborn screening for LSDs through measurement of enzymatic activities in dried blood spots (DBSs). Overall, the determination of the cutoff value is important in such screening, and different laboratories have different methods of determining this value; most do not use a fixed cutoff value but rather calculate the corresponding batch cutoff value based on each batch of experimental data. In this study, we used MS/MS to screen for LSDs and sought to find an appropriate method to establish the cutoff value for LSD screening. A total of 38,945 samples from newborn blood tablets collected from various maternity hospitals in six cities in Shandong province, including Jinan, Dezhou, Heze, Linyi, Weifang, and Zibo, were tested using a <i>Waters Xevo TQD</i> tandem mass spectrometer; the experimental data were analyzed with <i>MassLynx V4.1</i>. The laboratory used 30% of the median GLA enzyme activity and 20% of the median ABG, ASM, GALC, IDUA, and GAA enzyme activities in every test as the cutoff values for that batch of experiments. There were 254 suspicious positives in the initial screening test, including one case of Gaucher disease, one of Niemann-Pick disease, 47 of Krabbe disease, four of MPS-I, 21 of Fabry disease, and 180 of Pompe disease. After genetic screening, 11 children were diagnosed, including three with Pompe disease, three with Fabry disease, and five with Krabbe disease. In addition, the enzyme activity cutoff value of this experiment showed seasonal variation, which was initially believed to be related to the ambient temperature, such as the effect of ambient temperature on the human body or the temperature when the blood tablets dried naturally. Overall, MS/MS can be used in LSD screening, and using different cutoff values in each batch of experiments is feasible. The ambient temperature might be a reason why the enzyme activity cutoff value has seasonal variation. More samples are needed to develop a method of determining cutoff values in laboratories."

    "title": "To detect potential pathways and target genes in infantile Pompe patients using computational analysis.",
    "abstract": "<i><b>Introduction:</b></i> Pompe disease (PD) is a disease caused by pathogenic variations in the GAA gene known as glycogen storage disease type II, characterized by heart hypertrophy, respiratory failure, and muscle hypotonia, leading to premature death if not treated early. The only treatment option, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), significantly improves the prognosis for some patients while failing to help others. In this study, the determination of key genes involved in the response to ERT and potential molecular mechanisms were investigated. <i><b>Methods:</b> </i> Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data, accession number GSE38680, containing samples of biceps and quadriceps muscles was used. Expression array data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools. Biceps group patients did not receive ERT, while quadriceps received treatment with rhGAA at 0, 12, and 52 weeks. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were deeply analyzed by DAVID, GO, KEGG and STRING online analyses, respectively. <i><b>Results:</b> </i> A total of 1727 genes in the biceps group and 1198 genes in the quadriceps group are expressed differently. It was observed that DEGs were enriched in the group that responded poorly to ERT in the 52nd week. Genes frequently changed in the weak response group; the expression of 530 genes increased and 1245 genes decreased compared to 0 and 12 weeks. The GO analysis demonstrated that the DEGs were mainly involved in vascular smooth muscle contraction, lysosomes, autophagy, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, inflammatory response, and the WNT signaling pathway. We also discovered that the WNT signaling pathway is highly correlated with DEGs. Several DEGs, such as <i>WNT11, WNT5A, CTNNB1, M6PR, MYL12A, VCL, TLN, FYN, YES1</i>, and <i>BCL2</i>, may be important in elucidating the mechanisms underlying poor response to ERT. <i><b>Conclusion:</b> </i> Early diagnosis and treatment of PD are very important for the clinic of the disease. As a result, it suggests that the enriched genes and new pathways emerging as a result of the analysis may help identify the group that responds poorly to treatment and the outcome of the treatment. Obtained genes and pathways in neonatal screening will guide diagnosis and treatment."

    "abstract": "Some storage diseases, caused by a deficiency of a specific enzyme, which results in the systemic accumulation of non-metabolized substances, can be treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which can protect many organs, including the endocrine system. The aim of the study was to assess the function and morphology of the thyroid gland in children with storage diseases treated with ERT, and to review the literature. Eight patients were included in the study: 3 with Fabry disease (age: 17; 9.9; 10 years), 3 with Hunter's disease (12.3; 4.1; 9,3), and 2 with Pompe disease (6.8; 9,5). Thyroid function and morphology were assessed in each patient during ERT, and 4 of them were reassessed 27 months later. One patient with Fabry disease had been treated for hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis diagnosed before the study. The remaining patients had normal thyroid tests and negative anti-thyroid antibodies at first and second evaluation; however, in all reassessed patients a decrease in TSH value was noted. Among the remaining patients with Fabry disease, one had normal and a second had heterogeneous echogenicity of the thyroid during first assessment. In the second patient, normalisation of echogenicity was observed at reassessment. Both patients with Pompe disease assessed once had slightly heterogeneous thyroid echogenicity. In 3 patients with Hunter's disease in the first ultrasound examination, no abnormalities were found. In re-evaluation, 2 of them showed heterogeneous thyroid echogenicity. We conclude that patients with storage diseases should undergo assessment of thyroid function and morphology before and during ERT."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive hereditary lysosomal disorder and correlated with acid α-glucosidase enzyme (GAA) deficiencies, which lead to accumulation of glycogen in all tissues, most notably in skeletal muscles. Adult late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a slowly progressive disease of proximal myopathy with later involvement of the respiratory muscles, resulting in respiratory failure. In this study, we reported a 22-year-old Chinese woman with inability to withstand heavy physical activity since childhood, who presented with respiratory and ambulation weakness in 2 months. On admission, her bilateral upper limbs strength was 4/5 and lower limbs strength was 3/5 according to Medical Research Council (MRC) score. The patient had compound heterozygotes containing a newly identified 4 nt deletion of coding sequence (deletion nt 1411_1414) in one of the acid α-glucosidase alleles and a c.2238G>C (p.Trp746Cys) missense mutation. This deletion has been reported in infant-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) but not LOPD. Intriguingly, this deletion mutation was not found in the patient's family and was considered as pathogenic. Muscle biopsy showed scattered vacuoles with basophilic granules inside the subsarcolemmal area, which were strongly stained by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). Laboratory tests revealed a significant increase of creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). GAA level was 9.77 nmol/1 h/mg and was not sufficient for the diagnosis of GAA activity deficiency (0-3.78 nmol/1 h/mg). In summary, mutational analysis of GAA and muscle biopsy are crucial in the diagnosis of Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a progressive myopathy resulting from deficiency in lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA), which leads to glycogen accumulation in lysosomes primarily in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human (rh) GAA works well in alleviating the cardiomyopathy; however, many patients continue to have progressive muscle weakness. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a respiratory training combined with 24-week supervised resistance training program on muscle strength (measured by Biodex)), and respiratory function including maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) in subjects with late onset Pompe disease receiving ERT. Ten subjects participated in a 24-week resistance exercise program, three times per week, in addition to respiratory muscle exercise training six days per week. Overall, at the end of the resistance training program, as measured by Biodex dynamometry, the leg extensor strength improved by 10.5 ± 3.2Nm. (<p 0.01), leg flexors improved by 12.1 ± 4.1Nm (p < 0.01), the elbow flexors improved by 5.1 ± 2.3Nm (p = 0.03), and the elbow extensor strength improved by a mean of 4.5 ± 1.9Nm. (p = 0.02). MIP improved by 8.5 ± 3.7 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (p = 0.03) and the MEP by 6.4 ± 4.4 (p = 0.16). The exercise training significantly improved the trajectories of MIP and 6 MWT outcomes but not FVC when compared with the natural history data available in 6 individuals. These pilot results indicate that resistance training combined with respiratory training and ERT had a positive effect on muscular strength, functional capacity, and respiratory function in patients with late-onset Pompe disease and might be considered as a potential adjunct therapy in this population."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a progressive myopathy that combines motor, respiratory, and cardiac impairments. The 6-min walk test is the gold standard for assessing disease severity at the motor level. The objective of this study was to better determine the parameters that influence the total distance covered in patients with Pompe disease. We performed a retrospective review of 15 patients with late-onset Pompe disease who were followed regularly at a single referral center. Logistic regression was used to investigate the links between motor, respiratory and cardiac variables and 6-min walk test performance. When considering baseline clinical and demographic variables, a seven-step backward elimination regression analysis yielded a model with two predictors (age and the use of an assistive device) that explained 85.5% of the variance. When considering the cardiorespiratory variables monitored during gait, a three-step backward elimination regression analysis showed that two predictors (heart rate recovery and the baseline partial pressure of carbon dioxide) explained 42.2% of the variance. Our results highlighted the importance of respiratory and cardiac adaptation during exercise (along with motor ability) during the 6-min walk test in patients with Pompe disease. Further studies of larger cohorts are necessary to validate the model, which might enable investigators to determine whether intra-individual fluctuations in 6-min walk test performance are related to physiological parameters and/or to other variables such as the patient's level of motivation during the test."

One disorder, Pompe Disease (Glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII)), remains relatively unstudied. This disease is marked by dramatic accumulation of intracellular myofiber glycogen. Here we assessed the electrical properties of skeletal muscle in a model of GSDII, the Pompe<sup>6neo/6neo</sup> (Pompe) mouse. Ex vivo impedance measurements of gastrocnemius (GA) were obtained using a dielectric measuring cell in 30-week-old female Pompe (N = 10) and WT (N = 10) mice. Longitudinal and transverse conductivity, σ, and the relative permittivity, ε<sub>r</sub>, and Cole-Cole complex resistivity parameters at 0 Hz and infinite frequency, ρ<sub>o</sub> and ρ<sub>∞</sub>, respectively, and the intracellular resistivity, ρ<sub>intracellular</sub> were determined from the impedance data. Glycogen content (GC) was visualized histologically and quantified biochemically. At frequencies > 1 MHz, Pompe mice demonstrated significantly decreased longitudinal and transverse conductivity, increased Cole-Cole parameters, ρ<sub>o</sub> and ρ<sub>o</sub>-ρ<sub>∞</sub>, and decreased ρ<sub>intracellular</sub>. Changes in longitudinal conductivity and ρ<sub>intracellular</sub> correlated with increased GC in Pompe animals. Ex vivo high frequency impedance measures are sensitive to alterations in intracellular myofiber features considered characteristic of GSDII, making them potentially useful measures of disease status."

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is currently the best treatment option for PD, but is not resolutive. While other potential therapeutic approaches have been reported before, these have never been tried as co- treatments. L-alanine oral supplementation (LAOS) has been proven to reduce muscle breakdown: we hereby report the first case of supplementation on a PD patient on ERT. F. is a 9 y.o. infantile onset Pompe Disease (IOPD) girl ERT-treated since age 1 developing a progressive myopathy. We started her on LAOS and performed assessments at baseline, 6 and 9 months. At baseline, F.'s weight, height and BMI were within normal ranges, while body composition showed low fat mass -FM and high resting energy expenditure-REE levels. After LAOS, a progressive FM increase and REE reduction could be observed both at 6 and 9 months. ERT is not curative for PD patients thus additional treatments could be considered to improve outcomes. Our patient showed physical signs of inability to accumulate energy when exclusively on ERT, while FM increase and REE reduction occurred when supplemented with LAOS, likely reflecting anabolic pathways' implementation. This is the first case reporting potential LAOS benefits in PD-on ERT patients. Longitudinal case control studies are yet needed to evaluate possible efficacy of combined LAOS And ERT treatment in PD patients."

We describe patients with LOPD and macroglossia included in the French national Pompe disease registry. Clinical, functional, and radiological data were collected during periodic follow-up and analyzed retrospectively. These cases were compared with 15 previously reported cases. Five patients, three females and two males, aged 71-88 years, were included in this study. All but one of the patients suffered from symptoms related to macroglossia before the diagnosis of Pompe disease. Three had localized tongue atrophy and one had significant localized tongue hypertrophy which led to glossectomy 10 years before diagnosis. Two patients had severe dysphagia, one of whom underwent gastrostomy for enteral nutritional support. One patient experienced the persistence of numerous sleep apneas despite nocturnal bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation. All our patients had dysarthria, and two required speech therapy. Four patients had a tongue hypersignal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T1 sequences. Detection of macroglossia should be part of the clinical diagnosis and follow-up of patients with LOPD, with a careful evaluation of its main consequences. Macroglossia can have severe functional impacts on speech, swallowing, and sleep. Whole-body MRI with facial sections may facilitate the early diagnosis of Pompe disease with the \"bright tongue sign\"."

    "abstract": "Neuromuscular disorders are a heterogeneous group of acquired or hereditary conditions that affect striated muscle function. The resulting decrease in muscle strength and motility irreversibly impacts quality of life. In addition to directly affecting skeletal muscle, pathogenesis can also arise from dysfunctional crosstalk between nerves and muscles, and may include cardiac impairment. Muscular weakness is often progressive and paralleled by continuous decline in the ability of skeletal muscle to functionally adapt and regenerate. Normally, the skeletal muscle resident stem cells, named satellite cells, ensure tissue homeostasis by providing myoblasts for growth, maintenance, repair and regeneration. We recently defined 'Satellite Cell-opathies' as those inherited neuromuscular conditions presenting satellite cell dysfunction in muscular dystrophies and myopathies (doi:10.1016/j.yexcr.2021.112906). Here, we expand the portfolio of Satellite Cell-opathies by evaluating the potential impairment of satellite cell function across all 16 categories of neuromuscular disorders, including those with mainly neurogenic and cardiac involvement. We explore the expression dynamics of myopathogenes, genes whose mutation leads to skeletal muscle pathogenesis, using transcriptomic analysis. This revealed that 45% of myopathogenes are differentially expressed during early satellite cell activation (0 - 5 hours). Of these 271 myopathogenes, 83 respond to Pax7, a master regulator of satellite cells. Our analysis suggests possible perturbation of satellite cell function in many neuromuscular disorders across all categories, including those where skeletal muscle pathology is not predominant. This characterisation further aids understanding of pathomechanisms and informs on development of prognostic and diagnostic tools, and ultimately, new therapeutics."

We discuss two infants presenting with respiratory symptoms since early infancy and found to have cardiomegaly, hypotonia, elevated muscle enzymes, leading to the diagnosis of Pompe disease with genetic confirmation. However, both infants expired before the enzyme replacement therapy due to complications of irreversible muscle damage despite supportive medical care. Presentation with respiratory symptoms common during childhood, absence of alarming symptoms such as hypoglycaemia, ketoacidosis or encephalopathy, and relative rarity of Pompe disease can contribute to lapses in the early diagnosis as observed in the index patients. Thus, these cases emphasise the importance of vigilant assessment of common paediatric presentations, which may be presenting symptoms of underlying sinister pathologies."

C-4 Branched LAB alkyl and phenyl derivatives 5La-d showed potent α-glucosidase inhibition, particularly against human lysosomal acid α-glucosidase; C-4 DAB derivatives 5Da-d, with small alkyl groups, showed enhanced inhibition of rat intestinal maltase and sucrase. Both enantiomeric C-4 arylated derivatives 5Lf-l and 5Df-l exhibited potent and selective α-glucosidase inhibition; and compound 5Li with a para-electron donating group (EDG) on its C-4 aryl group, showed the most potent rat intestinal sucrase inhibition. Docking studies showed similar hydrogen bonding modes for the iminosugar skeletons of DAB (1) and LAB (2) with ntMGAM,. While C-4 alkylated LAB derivatives showed high similarity in their binding modes with the active site of ntMGAM, binding modes of the DAB derivatives relied on the size of C-4 alkyl groups with methyl and butyl showed the optimum interactions. Furthermore, C-4 arylation improved the interactions of LAB derivatives with enzymes by T-shaped π-π stack with residue Trp-406; for C-4 arylated DAB derivatives, the π-π stack interactions were found with distinct planar distortions caused by EDGs or EWGs on the C-4 aryls.

With this, a shift in the phenotype of the diseases from the neuromuscular system towards other organs is more frequently observed, requiring closer interdisciplinary cooperation in caring for these young adults. Therefore, the transition to the adult caring system is nowadays a multilayered transfer with the need for complex care of these patients. How can the transitional process be efficiently structured to combine the therapeutic effort of each specialist discipline involved and improve the healthcare process and quality of life in young adults with neuromuscular diseases? The Departments of Neuropediatrics and Neurology of the University Medicine Essen established the Essen transition model for a structured transitional process. A concept of care was developed for the late onset Pompe's disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and juvenile myasthenia gravis representatively for neuromuscular diseases. It consists of four components: 1) In a standardized operational procedure (SOP), general processes, clinical diagnostic steps and guidance of treatment between the two departments are harmonized and specified. 2) The young adults and their relatives are seen in a joint consultation of both disciplines allowing a comprehensive handover for healthcare professionals. 3) In a quarterly meeting, transition conference representatives from the different specialized disciplines from pediatric and adult medicine get together for a case-related interdisciplinary exchange. 4) An interdepartmental transitional database was created to integrate all diagnostic results and parameters as a common information platform and data basis. The Essen transition model aims to close a gap in the transition of patients with neuromuscular diseases and improve healthcare in these patients with their complex needs."

Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) with recombinant GAA became available in 2006. Since then, several outcome measures have been investigated for the adequate follow-up of disease progression and treatment response, usually focusing on respiratory and motor function. Prognostic factors predicting outcome have not been identified till now. <b>Methods:</b> In this single Centre, prospective study, we evaluate the response to enzyme replacement therapy in 15 patients (7 males) with LOPD in different stages of disease, aged 49.4 ± 16.1, followed-up for 15 years. Treatment response was measured by the 6-min walking test, vital capacity in supine and upright position, respiratory muscle strength, muscle MRI, manual muscle testing. We investigated the usefulness of Body Impedance Vectorial Analysis for serial body composition assessment. <b>Results:</b> Although most patients with LOPD benefit from long-term treatment, some secondary decline may occur after the first 3-5 years. Some nutritional (lower body mass index, higher fat free mass, higher phase angle) and disease parameters (higher creatinine and shorter disease duration at the beginning of treatment) seem to predict a better motor outcome. Lower Phase Angle, possibly reflecting loss of integrity of skeletal muscle membranes and thus treatment mis-targeting, seems to correlate with worse treatment response on long-term follow-up. <b>Conclusion:</b> Body Impedance Vectorial Analysis is a fast, easily performed and cheap tool that may be able to predict long-term treatment response in patients with LOPD. Low Phase angle may serve as a marker of muscle quality and may be used to predict the response to a muscle-targeted intervention such as ERT, thus improving the identification of patients needing a closer follow-up due to higher fragility and risk of deterioration."

Enzymatic replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa is the only available treatment, but adverse immune reactions can reduce ERT's effectiveness and safety. It is therefore very important to identify strategies to prevent and manage these complications. Several articles have been written on this disease over the last 10 years, but no univocal indications have been established. Our study presents a review of the current literature on management of immune responses to ERT in c-IOPD as considered by an Italian study group of pediatric metabolists and immunologists in light of our shared patient experience. We summarize the protocols for the management of adverse reactions to ERT, analyzing their advantages and disadvantages, and provide expert recommendations for their optimal management, to the best of current knowledge. However, further studies are needed to improve actual management protocols, which still have several limitations."

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive inborn metabolic disorder caused by a glucocerebrosidase (GCase) defect. GD is classified into three main types depending on accompanying neurological symptoms. Enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy are limited in the treatment of neurological symptoms, and using genotype and GCase activity to discriminate between non-neuronopathic and neuronopathic GD may be challenging as the two sometimes phenotypically overlap. The number of patients exhibiting neurological symptoms in Japan is significantly higher than that in Europe and the United States, and newborn screening (NBS) is still not actively performed in Japan. Definitive determination of the actual frequency and proportion of the type of GD from the results of NBS remains inconclusive. We performed NBS for Fabry disease, Pompe disease, and GD, mainly in the Kyushu area in Japan. Herein, we discuss the results of NBS for GD, as well as, the insights gained from following the clinical course of patients diagnosed through NBS. A total of 155,442 newborns were screened using an enzyme activity assay using dried blood spots. We found four newborns showing lower GCase activity and were definitively diagnosed with GD by <i>GBA</i> gene analysis. The frequency of GD diagnosis through NBS was 1 in 77,720 when limited to the probands. This frequency is higher than that previously estimated in Japan. In the future, NBS for GD is expected to be performed in many regions of Japan and contribute to detecting more patients with GD. Early screening and diagnosis may have a very significant impact on the quality of life and potentially longevity in infants with GD."

    "title": "Generation of Human iPSC-Derived Myotubes to Investigate RNA-Based Therapies In Vitro.",
    "abstract": "Alternative pre-mRNA splicing can be cell-type specific and results in the generation of different protein isoforms from a single gene. Deregulation of canonical pre-mRNA splicing by disease-associated variants can result in genetic disorders. Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) offer an attractive solution to modulate endogenous gene expression through alteration of pre-mRNA splicing events. Relevant in vitro models are crucial for appropriate evaluation of splicing modifying drugs. In this chapter, we describe how to investigate the splicing modulating activity of AONs in an in vitro skeletal muscle model, applied to Pompe disease. We also provide a detailed description of methods to visualize and analyze gene expression in differentiated skeletal muscle cells for the analysis of muscle differentiation and splicing outcome. The methodology described here is relevant to develop treatment options using AONs for other genetic muscle diseases as well, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy."

    "title": "Gene Therapy Developments for Pompe Disease.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is an inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). The most severe form is infantile-onset Pompe disease, presenting shortly after birth with symptoms of cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure and skeletal muscle weakness. Late-onset Pompe disease is characterized by a slower disease progression, primarily affecting skeletal muscles. Despite recent advancements in enzyme replacement therapy management several limitations remain using this therapeutic approach, including risks of immunogenicity complications, inability to penetrate CNS tissue, and the need for life-long therapy. The next wave of promising single therapy interventions involves gene therapies, which are entering into a clinical translational stage. Both adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors and lentiviral vector (LV)-mediated hematopoietic stem and progenitor (HSPC) gene therapy have the potential to provide effective therapy for this multisystemic disorder. Optimization of viral vector designs, providing tissue-specific expression and GAA protein modifications to enhance secretion and uptake has resulted in improved preclinical efficacy and safety data. In this review, we highlight gene therapy developments, in particular, AAV and LV HSPC-mediated gene therapy technologies, to potentially address all components of the neuromuscular associated Pompe disease pathology."

    "title": "A Systematic Review investigating the Effectiveness of Exercise training in Glycogen Storage Diseases.",
    "abstract": "Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) are rare inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism typically with skeletal muscle and liver involvement. In those with skeletal muscle involvement, the majority display symptoms of exercise intolerance which can cause profound exercise limitation and impair everyday living and quality of life (QoL). There are no curative treatments for GSDs, thus therapeutic options, such as exercise training, are aimed at improving QoL by alleviating signs and symptoms. In order to investigate the effectiveness of exercise training in adults with GSDs, we systematically reviewed the literature. In this review we conducted searches within SCOPUS and MEDLINE to identify potential papers for inclusion. These papers were independently assessed for inclusion and quality by two authors. We identified 23 studies which included aerobic training, strength training or respiratory muscle training in patients with McArdles (<i>n</i> = 41) and Pompe disease (<i>n</i> = 139). In McArdle disease, aerobic exercise training improved aerobic capacity (VO<sub>2</sub> peak) by 14-111% with further benefits to functional capacity and well-being. Meanwhile, strength training increased muscle peak power by 100-151% and reduced disease severity. In Pompe disease, a combination of aerobic and strength training improved VO<sub>2</sub> peak by 9-10%, muscle peak power by 64%, functional capacity and well-being. Furthermore, respiratory muscle training (RMT) improved respiratory muscular strength [maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) increased by up to 65% and maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) by up to 70%], with additional benefits shown in aerobic capacity, functional capacity and well-being. This adds to the growing body of evidence which suggests that supervised exercise training is safe and effective in improving aerobic capacity and muscle function in adults with McArdle or Pompe disease. However, the literature base is limited in quality and quantity with a dearth of literature regarding exercise training in other GSD subtypes."

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a rare, progressive disorder characterized by limb-girdle muscle weakness and/or respiratory insufficiency, caused by acid alpha-glucosidase (<i>GAA</i>) gene mutations and treated with enzyme replacement therapy. We studied isometric muscle strength in eight muscle groups bilaterally using a Biodex<sup>®</sup> dynamometer, as well as the Medical Research Council sum score (MRC-SS), hand grip strength, 6 min walk distance (6MWD), 10 m walk test (10MWT) and timed up-and-go test (TUG) in 12 adult, ambulatory, treated LOPD patients and 12 age-/gender-matched healthy controls, every 6 months for 2 years. The mean isometric muscle strength showed a significant decline in right and left knee extensors at 12 months in controls (<i>p</i> < 0.014; <i>p</i> < 0.016), at 18 months in patients (<i>p</i> < 0.010; <i>p</i> < 0.007) and controls (only right side, <i>p</i> < 0.030) and at 24 months in both groups (<i>p</i> < 0.035). The mean 6MWD in patients significantly decreased after 24 months, from 451.9 m to 368.1 m (<i>p</i> < 0.003), whereas in controls, the mean 6MWD significantly increased after 6 months (<i>p</i> < 0.045) and 18 months (<i>p</i> < 0.020) (at 24 months <i>p</i> = 0.054). In patients and controls, the MRC-SS, hand grip test, 10MWT and TUG did not show significant changes (<i>p</i> > 0.05). We conclude that the 6MWD is a useful outcome measure to detect motor decline in treated LOPD patients."

Twenty infants ages 6-21 months with LOPD diagnosed by NBS underwent systematic clinical evaluation at Duke University including cardiac imaging, biomarker testing, physical therapy evaluation, and speech-language pathology evaluation. Of the 20 infants, four were homozygous for the \"late-onset\" IVS1 splice site variant c.-32-13 T > G, fourteen were compound heterozygous, and two did not have any copies of this variant. None of the patients had evidence of cardiomyopathy or cardiac rhythm disturbances. Biomarker testing showed an increase in CK, AST, and ALT in 8 patients (40%) and increase in Glc4 in two patients (10%). All patients demonstrated postural and kinematic concerns. Three patients (17%) scored below the 10%ile on the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) and 15 patients (83%) scored above the 10%ile. Speech-language pathology assessments were normal in all patients and mild feeding/swallowing abnormalities were noted in nine patients (45%). Our data show high variability among children with LOPD diagnosed via NBS. Careful physical therapy evaluation is necessary to monitor for subtle musculoskeletal signs that may reflect early muscle involvement. Patients should be monitored closely for symptom progression."

Outcome parameters were MRC sum-score, 6 Minute Walk Test 6MWT, Quick Motor Function Test QMFT, forced vital capacity FVC sitting/supine, CK levels and rhGAA IgG antibody titers. We retrospectively analysed six patients with a median age at diagnosis/start of ERT of 63 years (range 52-69), and a median ERT duration of eight years (range 7-12). 6MWT improved in 4/6, and 2/6 each showed an improvement or stabilization in muscle strength and FVC supine. In contrast, FVC showed a decline in all patients in a sitting position, and QMFT worsened in 5/6. CK levels decreased in all patients. Antibody titers were not associated with treatment effects. Highest titers were present in best responders who were female, still ambulatory and without ventilatory support at follow-up. ERT effects were very heterogeneous and showed best results in 6MWT, followed by muscle strength in manual testing and FVC supine."

    "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Physical activity is associated with many physiological and psychological health benefits across the lifespan. Children with a chronic disease often have lower levels of daily physical activity, and a decreased exercise capacity compared to healthy peers. In order to learn more about limitations for physical activity, we investigate children with four different chronic diseases: children with a Fontan circulation, children with Broncho Pulmonary Dysplasia (BPD), Pompe disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Each of these diseases is likely to interfere with physical activity in a different way. Knowing the specific limitations for physical activity would make it possible to target these, and increase physical activity by a personalized intervention. The aim of this study is to first investigate limitations for physical activity in children with various chronic diseases. Secondly, to measure the effects of a tailored exercise intervention, possibly including a personalized dietary advice and/or psychological counseling, on exercise capacity, endurance, quality of life, fatigue, fear for exercise, safety, muscle strength, physical activity levels, energy balance, and body composition. <b>Methods and Analysis:</b> This randomized crossover trial will aim to include 72 children, aged 6-18 years, with one of the following diagnosis: a Fontan circulation, BPD, Pompe disease and IBD. Eligible patients will participate in the 12-week tailored exercise intervention and are either randomized to start with a control period or start with the intervention. The tailored 12-week exercise interventions, possibly including a personalized dietary advice and/or psychological counseling, will be designed based on the found limitations for physical activity in each disease group during baseline measurements by the Rotterdam Exercise Team. Effects of the tailored training interventions will be measured on the following endpoints: exercise capacity (measured by cardiopulmonary exercise test), endurance, physical activity levels, muscle strength, quality of life, fatigue, fear for exercise, disease activity, cardiac function (in children with a Fontan circulation), energy balance, and body composition. <b>Ethics and Dissemination:</b> Conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. Medical-ethical approval was obtained. <b>Trial Registration Number:</b> NL8181, https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/8181."

    "title": "Antibodies against recombinant human alpha-glucosidase do not seem to affect clinical outcome in childhood onset Pompe disease.",
    "abstract": "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA, alglucosidase alfa) has improved survival, motor outcomes, daily life activity and quality of life in Pompe patients. However, ERT in Pompe disease often induces formation of antibodies, which may reduce the efficacy of treatment and can lead to adverse events. In this study antibody formation and their effect on clinical outcome in patients with childhood onset Pompe disease treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) are analyzed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine anti-rhGAA antibody titers at predefined time points. The effect of antibodies on rhGAA activity (neutralizing effects) was measured in vitro. Clinical effects were evaluated by assessing muscle strength (MRC score) and function (QMFT-score), pulmonary function and infusion associated reactions (IARs). Twenty-two patients were included (age at start ERT 1.1-16.4 years, median treatment duration 12.4 years). Peak antibody titers were low (< 1:1250) in 9%, intermediate (1:1250-1:31,250) in 68% and high (≥ 1:31250) in 23% of patients; three patients (14%) had more than one titer of ≥ 1:31,250. Four patients (18%) experienced IARs; two patients from the high titer group had 86% of all IARs. Inhibition of intracellular GAA activity (58%) in vitro was found in one sample. The clinical course did not appear to be influenced by antibody titers. Ninety-one percent of childhood onset Pompe patients developed anti-rhGAA antibodies (above background level), a minority of whom had high antibody titers at repeated time points, which do not seem to interfere with clinical outcome. High antibody titers may be associated with the occurrence of IARs. Although the majority of patients does not develop high titers; antibody titers should be determined in case of clinical deterioration."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of acid α-glucosidase (GAA), resulting in skeletal muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. Muscle weakness progresses despite currently available therapy, which has prompted the development of gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV) type 2 vectors cross-packaged as AAV8 (2/8). Preclinical studies of gene therapy demonstrated that the minimum effective dose (MED) for biochemical correction with AAV2/8-LSPhGAA was ∼2 × 10<sup>11</sup> vector genomes (vg)/kg body weight. The current study examined the transduction of AAV2/8-LSPeGFP vector in adult GAA-KO mice with Pompe disease, and correlated that degree of transduction with the biochemical correction achieved by the same dose of AAV2/8-LSPhGAA. The MED was found to be ∼2 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg/kg, with all hepatocytes variably transducing at this dose. At this dose, liver GAA significantly increased, while liver glycogen significantly decreased. The 2 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg/kg dose was sufficient to significantly decrease diaphragm glycogen. However, the heart, diaphragm, and quadriceps all required a fourfold higher dose to achieve correction of GAA deficiency in association with significant clearance of stored glycogen, which correlated with increased serum GAA activity. These data indicate that AAV2/8-LSPeGFP transduced all hepatocytes when the 2 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg/kg dose was administered, which correlated with partial biochemical correction from the equivalent dose of AAV2/8-LSPhGAA. Altogether, these data support the conclusion that substantial transduction of the liver is required to achieve biochemical correction from AAV2/8-LSPhGAA."

Current ERTs are limited by anti-drug antibodies, the blood-brain barrier, and early disease onset and progression before ERT is started. We have opened a phase I clinical trial of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for fetuses with LSDs (NCT04532047). We evaluated the attitudes of parents and patients with LSDs towards fetal clinical trials and therapies. A multidisciplinary team designed a survey which was distributed by five international patient advocacy groups. We collected patients' demographic, diagnostic, and treatment information. Associations between respondent characteristics and attitudes towards fetal therapies/trials were analyzed using multivariate ordinal logistic regression. The survey was completed by 181 adults from 19 countries. The majority of respondents were mothers from the United States. The most common diseases were MPS1 (26%), MPS3 (19%), and infantile-onset Pompe (14%). Most patients (88%) were diagnosed after birth, at a median of 21 months. Altogether, 65% of participating patients and children of participants had received ERT, 27% a stem cell transplant, and 4% gene therapy. We found that half (49%) of respondents were unlikely to terminate a future affected pregnancy, 55% would enroll in a phase I clinical trial for fetal ERT, and 46% would enroll in a fetal gene therapy trial. Respondents who received postnatal ERT were significantly more likely enroll in a trial for fetal ERT or gene therapy (ERT OR 4.48, 95% CI 2.13-9.44, p < 0.0001; gene therapy OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.43-6.43, p = 0.0038). Respondents who used clinicaltrials.gov as a main source of information were more likely to choose to participate in a fetal trial (ERT OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.18-5.01, p = 0.016; gene therapy OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.27-6.46, p = 0.011). Familiarity with postnatal ERT increased respondents' likelihood of pursuing fetal therapies. Families who use clinicaltrials.gov may be more receptive to innovative fetal treatments. The patient community has a favorable attitude towards fetal therapy; over half of respondents would enroll in a phase I clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of fetal ERT."

    "abstract": "Longer glucan chains tend to precipitate. Glycogen, by far the largest mammalian glucan and the largest molecule in the cytosol with up to 55 000 glucoses, does not, due to a highly regularly branched spherical structure that allows it to be perfused with cytosol. Aberrant construction of glycogen leads it to precipitate, accumulate into polyglucosan bodies that resemble plant starch amylopectin and cause disease. This pathology, amylopectinosis, is caused by mutations in a series of single genes whose functions are under active study toward understanding the mechanisms of proper glycogen construction. Concurrently, we are characterizing the physicochemical particularities of glycogen and polyglucosans associated with each gene. These genes include GBE1, EPM2A and EPM2B, which respectively encode the glycogen branching enzyme, the glycogen phosphatase laforin and the laforin-interacting E3 ubiquitin ligase malin, for which an unequivocal function is not yet known. Mutations in GBE1 cause a motor neuron disease (adult polyglucosan body disease), and mutations in EPM2A or EPM2B a fatal progressive myoclonus epilepsy (Lafora disease). RBCK1 deficiency causes an amylopectinosis with fatal skeletal and cardiac myopathy (polyglucosan body myopathy 1, OMIM# 615895). RBCK1 is a component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, with unique functions including generating linear ubiquitin chains and ubiquitinating hydroxyl (versus canonical amine) residues, including of glycogen. In a mouse model we now show (i) that the amylopectinosis of RBCK1 deficiency, like in adult polyglucosan body disease and Lafora disease, affects the brain; (ii) that RBCK1 deficiency glycogen, like in adult polyglucosan body disease and Lafora disease, has overlong branches; (iii) that unlike adult polyglucosan body disease but like Lafora disease, RBCK1 deficiency glycogen is hyperphosphorylated; and finally (iv) that unlike laforin-deficient Lafora disease but like malin-deficient Lafora disease, RBCK1 deficiency's glycogen hyperphosphorylation is limited to precipitated polyglucosans. In summary, the fundamental glycogen pathology of RBCK1 deficiency recapitulates that of malin-deficient Lafora disease. Additionally, we uncover sex and genetic background effects in RBCK1 deficiency on organ- and brain-region specific amylopectinoses, and in the brain on consequent neuroinflammation and behavioural deficits. Finally, we exploit the portion of the basic glycogen pathology that is common to adult polyglucosan body disease, both forms of Lafora disease and RBCK1 deficiency, namely overlong branches, to show that a unified approach based on downregulating glycogen synthase, the enzyme that elongates glycogen branches, can rescue all four diseases."

The development of gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors revealed a sex-dependent decrease in efficacy in female mice with Pompe disease. This study evaluated the effect of testosterone on gene therapy with an AAV2/8 vector containing a liver-specific promoter to drive expression of GAA (AAV2/8-LSPhGAA) in female GAA-knockout (KO) mice that were implanted with pellets containing testosterone propionate before vector administration. Six weeks after treatment, neuromuscular function and muscle strength were improved as demonstrated by increased Rotarod and wirehang latency for female mice treated with testosterone and vector, in comparison with vector alone. Biochemical correction improved after the addition of testosterone as demonstrated by increased GAA activity and decreased glycogen content in the skeletal muscles of female mice treated with testosterone and vector, in comparison with vector alone. An alternative androgen, oxandrolone, was evaluated similarly to reveal increased GAA in the diaphragm and extensor digitorum longus of female GAA-KO mice after oxandrolone administration; however, glycogen content was unchanged by oxandrolone treatment. The efficacy of androgen hormone treatment in females correlated with increased mannose-6-phosphate receptor in skeletal muscle. These data confirmed the benefits of brief treatment with an androgen hormone in mice with Pompe disease during gene therapy."

The coadministration of a pharmacological chaperone and recombinant human acid α-glucosidase (rhGAA) leads to improved stability and maturation by binding to the folded state of the rhGAA and thereby promotes enzyme delivery. This study provides the first example of a strategy to design a high-affinity ligand toward lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (GAA) focusing on alkyl branches on 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ); 5-<i>C</i>-heptyl-DNJ produced a nanomolar affinity for GAA with a <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> value of 0.0047 μM, which is 13-fold more potent than DNJ. The protein thermal shift assay revealed that 10 μM 5-<i>C</i>-heptyl-DNJ increased the midpoint of the protein denaturation temperature (<i>T</i><sub>m</sub>) to 73.6 °C from 58.6 °C in the absence of the ligand, significantly improving the thermal stability of rhGAA. Furthermore, 5-<i>C</i>-heptyl-DNJ dose dependency increased intracellular GAA activities in Pompe patient's fibroblasts with the M519V mutation. The introduction of C5 alkyl branches on DNJ provides a new molecular strategy for pharmacological chaperone therapy for Pompe disease, which may lead to the development of higher-affinity and practically useful chaperones."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare, progressive, and life-threatening autosomal recessive disorder. In its late-onset form, the disease is primarily characterised by mild progressive proximal limb and respiratory muscle weakness. Mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase (<i>GAA</i>) gene cause lysosomal enzyme GAA to be significantly reduced or missing altogether, for which supplementation can be given through enzyme replacement therapy. Fourteen patients diagnosed with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from 2017 to 2021 were enrolled. GAA activity was measured based on enzymatic activity in dried blood spots, and next-generation sequencing was used to detect mutations in the <i>GAA</i> gene. The impacts of novel missense variants were determined by five different prediction algorithms. The structural figures of novel variants and their wide types were processed with PyMOL. The study included 14 patients with LOPD (male-to-female ratio, 1:1) from eastern China. The median age at symptom onset and diagnosis was 15.0 years (7-36 years) and 21.5 years (8-47 years), respectively. The median diagnostic delay from onset was 3.0 years (0-22 years). Proximal muscle weakness was the first prominent symptom in 8 patients, while the other 6 patients experienced respiratory failure, chest congestion and asthma, and scoliosis. The most frequent mutation of the GAA gene was c.2238G>C (p.W746C), which was observed at an allele frequency of 14.3% (4/28) and in 28.6% of patients (4/14). Four novel variants potentially related to the pathogenicity of LOPD were found: c.1299G>C (p.Q433H), c.1409A>G (p.N470S), c.2242delG (p.E748Rfs*16), and c.2832delA (p.E945Sfs*78). The c.2238G>C (p.W746C) mutation was the most common mutation in 14 patients with LOPD from eastern China. This study has identified four novel variants in patients with LOPD. Predicting the pathogenicity of these novel variants may increase the understanding of the genetic mutation spectrum in LOPD. Our findings may also improve recognition of the characteristics of Chinese patients with LOPD."

A prospective observational cohort study was conducted from the initiation of Pompe disease NBS by following subjects every 3-12 months for motor development and biochemical markers. Between 2005 and 2018, 39 of 994 975 newborns evaluated were classified as having LOPD based on low acid α-glucosidase (GAA) activity but no cardiac involvement at the time of screening. As of December 2020, 8 of these 39 infants (21%) were treated with enzyme replacement therapy owing to persistent elevation of creatine kinase (CK), cardiac involvement, or developmental delay. All subjects' physical performance and endurance improved after treatment. Subjects carrying c.[752C>T;761C>T] and c.[546+5G>T; 1726G>A] presented a phenotype of nonprogressive hypotonia, muscle weakness, and impairment in physical fitness tests, but they have not received treatment.

GAA variants c.[752C>T;761C>T] and c.[546+5G>T; 1726G>A] might not cause Pompe disease but still may affect skeletal muscle function."

    "abstract": "Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) <i>N</i>-acetyl signals (Glyc) from glycoproteins and supramolecular phospholipids composite peak (SPC) from phospholipid quaternary nitrogen methyls in subcompartments of lipoprotein particles) can give important systemic metabolic information, but their absolute quantification is compromised by overlap with interfering resonances from lipoprotein lipids themselves. We present a J-Edited DIffusional (JEDI) proton NMR spectroscopic approach to selectively augment signals from the inflammatory marker peaks Glyc and SPCs in blood serum NMR spectra, which enables direct integration of peaks associated with molecules found in specific compartments. We explore a range of pulse sequences that allow editing based on peak J-modulation, translational diffusion, and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> relaxation time and validate them for untreated blood serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (<i>n</i> = 116) as well as samples from healthy controls and pregnant women with physiological inflammation and hyperlipidemia (<i>n</i> = 631). The data show that JEDI is an improved approach to selectively investigate inflammatory signals in serum and may have widespread diagnostic applicability to disease states associated with systemic inflammation."

    "title": "Diaphragmatic dysfunction in neuromuscular disease, an MRI study.",
    "abstract": "The aim of this exploratory study was to evaluate diaphragmatic function across various neuromuscular diseases using spirometry-controlled MRI. We measured motion of the diaphragm relative to that of the thoracic wall (cranial-caudal ratio vs. anterior posterior ratio; CC-AP ratio), and changes in the diaphragmatic curvature (diaphragm height and area ratio) during inspiration in 12 adults with a neuromuscular disease having signs of respiratory muscle weakness, 18 healthy controls, and 35 adult Pompe patients - a group with prominent diaphragmatic weakness. CC-AP ratio was lower in patients with myopathies (n=7, 1.25±0.30) and motor neuron diseases (n=5, 1.30±0.10) than in healthy controls (1.37±0.14; p=0.001 and p=0.008), but not as abnormal as in Pompe patients (1.12±0.18; p=0.011 and p=0.024). The mean diaphragm height ratio was 1.17±0.33 in patients with myopathies, pointing at an insufficient diaphragmatic contraction. This was also seen in patients with Pompe disease (1.28±0.36), but not in healthy controls (0.82±0.33) or patients with motor neuron disease (0.82±0.24). We conclude that spirometry-controlled MRI enables us to investigate respiratory dysfunction across neuromuscular diseases, suggesting that the diaphragm is affected in a different way in myopathies and motor neuron diseases. Whether MRI can also be used to evaluate progression of diaphragmatic dysfunction requires additional studies."

    "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Pompe disease is caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase, which results in cardiac and muscular complications that can jeopardize perioperative outcomes. We report a 4-month-old infant with Pompe disease receiving cheiloplasty under general anesthesia with the aid of peripheral nerve blocks and intensive hemodynamic monitoring. <b>Case Description:</b> This case report describes a 4-month-old full-term Taiwanese female infant who presented with left unilateral cleft lip and palate in the prenatal examination. She was diagnosed with infantile-onset Pompe disease after acidic α-glucosidase (GAA) gene sequencing. She also received enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) 15 days after birth and regular ERT every other week. Cheiloplasty was performed under general anesthesia uneventfully, and peripheral nerve blocks were adopted for analgesia. Intensive hemodynamic monitoring using electrical cardiometry technology (ICON<sup>®</sup>) and pulse contour analysis (FloTrac system) were applied during the operation. No adverse effects were observed, and the wound healed well. Therefore, the patient was discharged 4 days after surgery. <b>Conclusion:</b> With the availability of ERT, severe organ dysfunction in infantile-onset Pompe disease patients is no longer common. However, moderate cardiac depression can still occur while increasing inspiratory pressure and deepening the anesthesia level despite a normal preoperative echocardiogram report. Therefore, careful, gradual titration is desirable. Furthermore, electrical cardiometry can detect hemodynamic changes more instantaneously and reliably than pulse contour analysis. In addition, we suggest taking advantage of the peripheral nerve block as a part of balanced anesthesia to alleviate the cardiac suppression caused by general anesthesia."

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 2019 (SARS-CoV2/COVID-19) is frequently more severe in individuals with pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. The impact on patients with neuromuscular disorders is of concern, but remains largely unknown. Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a lysosomal-storage disorder characterized by progressive skeletal and respiratory muscle degeneration. Mortality is typically caused by respiratory failure. We examined the impact of COVID-19 on these patients. This is a case series of four patients with LOPD who contracted COVID-19. All patients had a mild/moderate illness from COVID-19 and did not require hospitalization. Neurological worsening occurred in one, with no change in physical ability in the other three, and respiratory symptoms remained stable in all four. COVID-19 infection can result in a benign course in some patients with LOPD. However, individuals with LOPD remain at high risk and should receive COVID-19 vaccinations and exercise precautions to avoid exposure to COVID-19 infection."

    "abstract": "An 8-month-old domestic short-haired female cat presented with acute tachypnea, poor growth, hypothermia, and lethargy. Thoracic radiography showed cardiomegaly with mild pleural effusion, and transthoracic echocardiography identified dilatation of both atria and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Although clinical signs improved temporarily with treatment, the cat died of pulmonary edema 135 days after the first visit. At necropsy, the heart was grossly enlarged. Microscopic examination of the heart identified severe vacuolization of cardiac muscle cells in histologic sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Examination of periodic acid-Schiff stained preparations of formalin-fixed heart tissue disclosed coarse granules within vacuoles that disappeared on predigestion with diastase, indicating that they were glycogen. On the basis of these findings, a necropsy diagnosis of glycogen storage disease type II (Pompe disease) was made. This report is the first case of a young cat with clinical signs closely resembling infantile Pompe disease of humans."

Brain imaging (T1, T2, T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, susceptibility-weighted images, and magnetic resonance angiography-time of flight) was combined with extensive cognitive testing of general intelligence (Wechsler IQ Test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) and specific neuropsychological domains (verbal fluency, cognitive flexibility, attention, memory, and visuospatial abilities). We included 19 patients with late-onset Pompe disease (age range 11-56 years). Two patients showed mild punctate WMA within normal range for age, with a Fazekas score (FS) of 1 to 2. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed a slight vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia in two patients yet did not show any aneurysms or vascular dissections. Most patients had age-adjusted scores within the normal range for the Wechsler index scores (verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed) and combined total intelligence (IQ) score (median 101, interquartile range 91-111; one patient had a below-average score for total IQ) as well as for the specific domains verbal fluency, attention, and memory. A subset of patients performed suboptimally on the Rey Complex Figure Test (9/14 patients) or cube-copying/clock-drawing test of the MoCA (8/10 patients). We therefore concluded that our study showed no brain abnormalities, other than minor microvascular lesions considered within normal range for age, nor general cognitive impairment in late-onset Pompe patients. These findings are in sharp contrast with the widespread WMA and cognitive problems found in some classic infantile patients."

Due to the COVID-19 crisis, eight neuromuscular reference centers in France were obligated to stop the treatment for 31 patients. We collected the motor and respiratory data from our French registry, before COVID-19 and at treatment restart. In 2.2 months (mean), patients showed a significant deterioration of 37 m (mean) in the 6-min walk test and a loss of 210 ml (mean) of forced vital capacity, without ad integrum restoration after 3 months of ERT restart. This national study based on data from the French Pompe Registry shows that the interruption of ERT, even as short as a few months, worsens Pompe patients' motor and respiratory function."

Pompe disease manifests as an accumulation of lysosomal glycogen in the skeletal and heart muscle. We conducted newborn screening (NBS) for Pompe disease in Japan from April 2013 to October 2020 to determine the feasibility and utility of NBS for Pompe disease. From the 296,759 newborns whose enzyme activity was measured, 107 of which underwent GAA analysis, we found one patient with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) and seven with potential late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). We identified 34 pseudodeficient individuals and 65 carriers or potential carriers. The frequency of patients with IOPD was similar to that in the United States, but significantly lower than that in Taiwan. One patient with IOPD underwent early enzyme replacement therapy within a month after birth before presenting exacerbated manifestations, whereas those with potential LOPD showed no manifestations during the follow-up period of six years. The frequency of IOPD in Japan was similar to that in the United States, where NBS for Pompe disease is recommended. This indicates that NBS for Pompe disease may also be useful in Japan. Therefore, it should be used over a wider region in Japan."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD), a lysosomal storage disease, is caused by mutations of the GAA gene, inducing deficiency in the acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). This enzymatic impairment causes glycogen burden in lysosomes and triggers cell malfunctions, especially in cardiac, smooth and skeletal muscle cells and motor neurons. To date, the only approved treatment available for PD is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) consisting of intravenous administration of <i>rh</i>GAA. The limitations of ERT have motivated the investigation of new therapies. Pharmacological chaperone (PC) therapy aims at restoring enzymatic activity through protein stabilization by ligand binding. PCs are divided into two classes: active site-specific chaperones (ASSCs) and the non-inhibitory PCs. In this review, we summarize the different pharmacological chaperones reported against PD by specifying their PC class and activity. An emphasis is placed on the recent use of these chaperones in combination with ERT."

It is linked to the pathogenic mutations in GAA gene, which leads to glycogen accumulation in various tissues. We describe the unusual clinical, biochemical, histopathological and genetic characteristics of 5 cases of LOPD. The first case had progressive anterior horn cell like disease (AHCD) that evolved later to classical limb girdle syndrome and respiratory failure, the second patient had rigid spine syndrome with gastrointestinal manifestations, the third had limb girdle weakness superimposed with episodic prolonged worsening and respiratory failure, the fourth had large fibre sensory neuropathy without primary muscle involvement and the fifth presented with classical limb girdle muscle weakness. Two homozygous missense mutations c.1461C > A (p.Phe487Leu) and c.1082C > T (p.Pro361Leu) in the GAA gene were identified in case 1 and 2 respectively. Case 3 was compound heterozygous with inframe c.1935_1940del (p.Val646_Cys647del) and an intronic splice effecting variant c.-32-13T > G. Compound heterozygous missense variants c.971C > T (p.Pro324Leu) and c.794G > A (p.Ser265Asn) were identified in case 4. Case 5 had a frameshift insertion c.1396dupG (p.Val466GlyfsTer40) and a synonymous splice affecting variant c.546G > T(p.Thr182=). We are describing for the first time from India on LOPD with unusual phenotypes identified.

The aims of this study were to analyze how these children are diagnosed, what clinical problems they have, and how phenotype is related to genotype. To accomplish this, we analyzed retrospectively data of 34 patients diagnosed after their first and before completion of their 18th birthday. Median age at diagnosis was 3.9 (range 1.1-17) years. Eight patients (23.5%) developed initial symptoms in the first year, 12 (35%) between 1 and 7 years, and 6 (18%) thereafter. Eight (23.5%) had no clinical symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Indications for diagnostics were a positive family history in three (9%), hyperCKemia in eight (23.5%), motor developmental delay in three (9%), and muscle weakness and/or pain in 17 (50%). Rare clinical signs were failure to thrive, recurrent diarrhea, and suspected hepatopathy with glycogen storage. Thirty-two different mutations were identified. Twenty-seven patients (79.5%) carried the milder c.32-13T > G mutation, known to be associated with a broad range of phenotypes. Three out of eight patients manifesting within the first year of life showed generalized muscle weakness, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and had to be ventilated during the course of disease, thereby demonstrating clinical overlap with infantile onset Pompe disease.These findings demonstrate that the phenotype of JOPD is broad and that the differential is not only restricted to neuromuscular disorders. Genotypic analysis was useful to delineate subjects with early onset JOPD from those with IOPD, but overall genotype-phenotype correlation was poor."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a severe disorder caused by loss of acid α-glucosidase (GAA), leading to glycogen accumulation in tissues and neuromuscular and cardiac dysfunction. Enzyme replacement therapy is the only available treatment. AT845 is an adeno-associated viral vector designed to express human GAA specifically in skeletal muscle and heart. Systemic administration of AT845 in Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> mice led to a dose-dependent increase in GAA activity, glycogen clearance in muscles and heart, and functional improvement. AT845 was tolerated in cynomolgus macaques at low doses, while high doses caused anti-GAA immune response, inflammation, and cardiac abnormalities resulting in unscheduled euthanasia of two animals. Conversely, a vector expressing the macaque GAA caused no detectable pathology, indicating that the toxicity observed with AT845 was an anti-GAA xenogeneic immune response. Western blot analysis showed abnormal processing of human GAA in cynomolgus muscle, adding to the species-specific effects of enzyme expression. Overall, these studies show that AAV-mediated GAA delivery to muscle is efficacious in Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> mice and highlight limitations in predicting the toxicity of AAV vectors encoding human proteins in non-human species."

Affected individuals cannot release glucose during fasting and accumulate excess glycogen and fat in the liver and kidney, putting them at risk of severe hypoglycaemia and secondary metabolic perturbations. Good glycaemic/metabolic control through strict dietary treatment and regular doses of uncooked cornstarch (UCCS) is essential for preventing hypoglycaemia and long-term complications. Dietary treatment has improved the prognosis for patients with GSDIa; however, the disease itself, its management and monitoring have significant physical, psychological and psychosocial burden on individuals and parents/caregivers. Hypoglycaemia risk persists if a single dose of UCCS is delayed/missed or in cases of gastrointestinal intolerance. UCCS therapy is imprecise, does not treat the cause of disease, may trigger secondary metabolic manifestations and may not prevent long-term complications. We review the importance of and challenges associated with achieving good glycaemic/metabolic control in individuals with GSDIa and how this should be balanced with age-specific psychosocial development towards independence, management of anxiety and preservation of quality of life (QoL). The unmet need for treatment strategies that address the cause of disease, restore glucose homeostasis, reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia/secondary metabolic perturbations and improve QoL is also discussed."

Evaluation included cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), 6-min walking test (6MWT), spirometry, motor function test (GMFM-88) and enzyme blood levels. Thirty-four CPETs (17 pre- and 17 two days-post ERT) over variable follow-up periods were performed in four patients. Two days following ERT, blood enzyme levels increased (median, 1.22 and 10.15 μmol/L/h (<i>p</i> = 0.003)). However, FEV1, FVC and GMFM-88, the median 6MWD and the peak VO<sub>2</sub> were unchanged. Long-term evaluations showed stabilization in young patients but progressive deterioration in adolescents. Clinical deterioration was associated with more pronounced deterioration in peak VO<sub>2</sub> followed in the decreasing order by 6MWD, FVC and GMFM-88. The peak VO<sub>2</sub> and 6MWD might serve as more sensitive markers to assess clinical deterioration. More studies are needed to clarify the sensitivity of the peak VO<sub>2</sub> and 6MWT for quantification of individualized response.

    "abstract": "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa has been found to improve outcomes in patients with classic infantile Pompe disease, who without treatment typically die before the age of 1 year. Variable responses to the standard recommended dosage have led to alternative dosing strategies. We aimed to assess the effect of real-world ERT regimens on survival and walking ability in these patients. In this observational cohort study, we obtained data collected as part of a collaborative study within the European Pompe Consortium on patients with classic infantile Pompe disease from France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands diagnosed between Oct 26, 1998 and March 8, 2019. Eligible patients had classic infantile Pompe disease with a disease onset and proven diagnosis before age 12 months, and a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A proven diagnosis of classic infantile Pompe disease was defined as a confirmed deficiency of α-glucosidase in leukocytes or lymphocytes, fibroblasts or muscle, or two pathogenic GAA variants in trans, or both. We collected data on demographics, GAA variants, ERT dosage, age at death, and walking ability. We analysed the effects of ERT dosage on survival and walking ability using Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier curves, and log-rank tests. We included 124 patients with classic infantile Pompe disease, of whom 116 were treated with ERT (median age at start of treatment 3·3 months [IQR 1·8-5·0, range 0·03-11·8]). During follow-up (mean duration 60·1 months [SD 57·3]; n=115), 36 (31%) of 116 patients died. 39 different ERT dosing regimens were applied. Among the 64 patients who remained on the same dosage, 16 (52%) of 31 patients on the standard dosage (20 mg/kg every other week), 12 (80%) of 15 patients on an intermediate dosage (20 mg/kg per week or 40 mg/kg every other week), and 16 (89%) of 18 patients on the high dosage (40 mg/kg per week) were alive at last follow-up. Survival was significantly improved in the high dosage group compared with the standard dosage group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·17 [95% CI 0·04-0·76], p=0·02). No significant difference in survival was identified between the intermediate dosage group and the standard dosage group (HR 0·44 [0·13-1·51], p=0·19). Of the 86 patients who reached 18 months of age, 44 (51%) learned to walk. Ten (53%) of 19 patients on the standard dosage regimen, six (67%) of nine patients on intermediate dosage regimens, and 14 (93%) of 15 patients on high dosage regimens learnt to walk, but the differences between groups were not statistically significant. Patients with classic infantile Pompe disease treated with the high ERT dosage of 40 mg/kg per week had significantly improved survival when compared with patients treated with the standard recommended ERT dosage of 20 mg/kg every other week. Based on these results, we suggest that the currently registered dosage should be reconsidered. Prinses Beatrix Spierfonds and Wishdom Foundation."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare disorder characterised by progressive loss of muscle and respiratory function due to acid α-glucosidase deficiency. Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human acid α-glucosidase, alglucosidase alfa, is the first approved treatment for the disease, but some patients do not respond, and many do not show a sustained benefit. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of an investigational two-component therapy (cipaglucosidase alfa, a novel recombinant human acid α-glucosidase, plus miglustat, an enzyme stabiliser) for late-onset Pompe disease. We did a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 trial at 62 neuromuscular and metabolic medical centres in 24 countries in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Europe. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older with late-onset Pompe disease, and had either been receiving alglucosidase alfa for at least 2 years or were enzyme replacement therapy-naive. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) using interactive response technology software, stratified by 6-min walk distance and previous enzyme replacement therapy status, to intravenous cipaglucosidase alfa (20 mg/kg) plus oral miglustat or to intravenous alglucosidase alfa (20 mg/kg) plus oral placebo once every 2 weeks for 52 weeks. Patients, investigators, and outcome assessors were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 52 in 6-min walk distance, assessed using a mixed-effect model for repeated measures analysis for comparison of superiority in the intention-to-treat population (all patients who received at least one dose of study drug). This study is now complete and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03729362. Between Dec 3, 2018, and Nov 26, 2019, 130 patients were screened for eligibility and 125 were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat (n=85) or alglucosidase alfa plus placebo (n=40). Two patients in the alglucosidase alfa plus placebo group did not receive any dose due to absence of genotype confirmation of late-onset Pompe disease and were excluded from analysis. Six patients discontinued (one in the alglucosidase alfa plus placebo group, five in the cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat group), and 117 completed the study. At week 52, mean change from baseline in 6-min walk distance was 20·8 m (SE 4·6) in the cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat group versus 7·2 m (6·6) in the alglucosidase alfa plus placebo group using last observation carried forward (between-group difference 13·6 m [95% CI -2·8 to 29·9]). 118 (96%) of 123 patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event during the study; the incidence was similar between the cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat group (n=81 [95%]) and the alglucosidase alfa plus placebo group (n=37 [97%]). The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were fall (25 [29%] patients in the cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat group vs 15 [39%] in the alglucosidase alfa plus placebo group), headache (20 [24%] vs 9 [24%]), nasopharyngitis (19 [22%] vs 3 [8%]), myalgia (14 [16%] vs 5 [13%]), and arthralgia (13 [15%]) vs 5 [13%]). 12 serious adverse events occurred in eight patients in the cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat group; only one event (anaphylaxis) was deemed related to study drug. One serious adverse event (stroke) occurred in the alglucosidase alfa plus placebo group, which was deemed unrelated to study drug. There were no deaths. Cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat did not achieve statistical superiority to alglucosidase alfa plus placebo for improving 6-min walk distance in our overall population of patients with late-onset Pompe disease. Further studies should investigate the longer-term safety and efficacy of cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat and whether this investigational two-component therapy might provide benefits, particularly in respiratory function and in patients who have been receiving enzyme replacement therapy for more than 2 years, as suggested by our secondary and subgroup analyses.

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disorder caused by deficiency of acid α-glucosidase (GAA) and accumulation of lysosomal glycogen. We assessed the safety and efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa, a recombinant human GAA enzyme replacement therapy specifically designed for enhanced mannose-6-phosphate-receptor targeting and enzyme uptake aimed at increased glycogen clearance, compared with the current approved standard of care, alglucosidase alfa, in patients with late-onset Pompe disease. We did a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial at 55 sites in 20 countries. We enrolled individuals (aged ≥3 years) with enzymatically confirmed late-onset Pompe disease who had never received treatment. We used a centralised treatment allocation system to randomly allocate participants to either avalglucosidase alfa or alglucosidase alfa. Participants and investigators were unaware of their treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 49 in upright forced vital capacity percent (FVC%) predicted. We used a hierarchical fixed sequential testing strategy, whereby non-inferiority of avalglucosidase alfa compared with alglucosidase alfa was assessed first, with a non-inferiority margin of 1·1. If non-inferiority was seen, then superiority was tested with a 5% significance level. The key secondary objective was effect on functional endurance, measured by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Safety was assessed, including treatment-emergent adverse events and infusion-associated reactions. The modified intent-to-treat population was the primary analysis population for all efficacy analyses. The safety population was the analysis population for safety analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02782741. We report results of the 49-week primary analysis period. Between Nov 2, 2016, and March 29, 2019, 100 participants were randomly allocated avalglucosidase alfa (n=51) or alglucosidase alfa (n=49). Treatment with avalglucosidase alfa resulted in a least-squares mean improvement in upright FVC% predicted of 2·89% (SE 0·88) compared with 0·46% (0·93) with alglucosidase alfa at week 49 (difference 2·43% [95% CI -0·13 to 4·99]). Non-inferiority was shown because the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference far exceeded the predefined non-inferiority margin but did not exclude 0 (p=0·0074). Superiority was not reached (p=0·063), so formal testing was stopped, as per the testing hierarchy. Improvements were also seen in the 6MWT with avalglucosidase alfa compared with alglucosidase alfa, with greater increases in distance covered (difference 30·01 m [95% CI 1·33 to 58·69]) and percent predicted (4·71% [0·25 to 9·17]). Treatment-emergent adverse events potentially related to treatment were reported in 23 (45%) of 51 participants in the avalglucosidase alfa group and in 24 (49%) of 49 in the alglucosidase alfa group, and infusion-associated reactions were reported in 13 (26%) participants in the avalglucosidase alfa group and 16 (33%) in the alglucosidase alfa group. Of the five trial withdrawals, all in the alglucosidase alfa group, four were due to adverse events, including two infusion-associated reactions. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in eight (16%) participants who received avalglucosidase alfa and in 12 (25%) who received alglucosidase alfa. One participant treated with alglucosidase alfa died because of acute myocardial infarction determined to be unrelated to treatment. Antidrug antibody responses were similar in both groups. High and persistent titres (≥12 800) and neutralising antibodies were more common with alglucosidase alfa (in 16 [33%] participants) than with avalglucosidase alfa (ten [20%]). We consider that this study provides evidence of clinically meaningful improvement with avalglucosidase alfa therapy over alglucosidase alfa in respiratory function, ambulation, and functional endurance, with no new safety signals reported. An open-label extended-treatment period is ongoing to confirm the long-term safety and efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa, with the aim for this therapy to become the new standard treatment in late-onset Pompe disease.

    "abstract": "The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialized cholinergic synaptic interface between a motor neuron and a skeletal muscle fiber that translates presynaptic electrical impulses into motor function. NMJ formation and maintenance require tightly regulated signaling and cellular communication among motor neurons, myogenic cells, and Schwann cells. Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) can result in loss of NMJ function and motor input leading to paralysis or even death. Although small animal models have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the NMJ structure and function, the complexities of studying this multi-tissue system <i>in vivo</i> and poor clinical outcomes of candidate therapies developed in small animal models has driven the need for <i>in vitro</i> models of functional human NMJ to complement animal studies. In this review, we discuss prevailing models of NMDs and highlight the current progress and ongoing challenges in developing human iPSC-derived (hiPSC) 3D cell culture models of functional NMJs. We first review <i>in vivo</i> development of motor neurons, skeletal muscle, Schwann cells, and the NMJ alongside current methods for directing the differentiation of relevant cell types from hiPSCs. We further compare the efficacy of modeling NMDs in animals and human cell culture systems in the context of five NMDs: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, and Pompe disease. Finally, we discuss further work necessary for hiPSC-derived NMJ models to function as effective personalized NMD platforms."

We sought to review the latest available evidence on the safety and efficacy of recombinant human GAA enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for late-onset PD (LOPD). We systematically searched the MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, and Cochrane databases for prospective clinical studies evaluating ERT for LOPD on pre-specified outcomes. A meta-analysis was also performed. Of 1601 articles identified, 22 were included. Studies were heterogeneous and with very low certainty of evidence for most outcomes. The following outcomes showed improvements associated with GAA ERT, over a mean follow-up of 32.5 months: distance walked in the 6-min walking test (6MWT) (mean change 35.7 m (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.78, 63.75)), physical domain of the SF-36 quality of life (QOL) questionnaire (mean change 1.96 (95% CI 0.33, 3.59)), and time on ventilation (TOV) (mean change -2.64 h (95% CI -5.28, 0.00)). There were no differences between the pre- and post-ERT period for functional vital capacity (FVC), Walton and Gardner-Medwin Scale score, upper-limb strength, or total SF-36 QOL score. Adverse events (AEs) after ERT were mild in most cases. Considering the limitations imposed by the rarity of PD, our data suggest that GAA ERT improves 6MWT, physical QOL, and TOV in LOPD patients. ERT was safe in the studied population. PROSPERO register: 135102."

PD is currently treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with intravenous infusions of recombinant human GAA (rhGAA). Although the introduction of ERT represents a breakthrough in the management of PD, the approach suffers from several shortcomings. Here, we developed a mouse model of PD to compare the efficacy of hepatic gene transfer with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors expressing secretable GAA with long-term ERT. Liver expression of GAA results in enhanced pharmacokinetics and uptake of the enzyme in peripheral tissues compared to ERT. Combination of gene transfer with pharmacological chaperones boosts GAA bioavailability, resulting in improved rescue of the PD phenotype. Scale-up of hepatic gene transfer to non-human primates also successfully results in enzyme secretion in blood and uptake in key target tissues, supporting the ongoing clinical translation of the approach."

    "abstract": "Genetic polymorphisms influencing muscle structure and metabolism may affect the phenotype of metabolic myopathies. We here analyze the possible influence of a wide panel of \"exercise genes\" on the severity and progression of respiratory dysfunction in late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). We stratified patients with comparable age and disease duration according to the severity of their respiratory phenotype, assessed by both upright FVC% and postural drop in FVC%. We included 43 patients with LOPD (25 males, age 50.8 ± 13.6 yr) with a 2-yr follow-up since the beginning of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Twenty-two patients showed a postural drop >25% T0, seven other patients developed it during the follow-up. We analyzed the relationship between the progression of respiratory dysfunction and genetic polymorphisms affecting muscle function and structure [angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), α-actinin 3 (ACTN3), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPR-α), angiotensin (AGT)], glycogen metabolism [glycogen synthase (GYS), glycogen synthase kinase-3 isoform β (GSK3β)], and autophagy [sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7)]. Individuals carrying two copies of the ACE D-allele shared a 24-fold increase in the risk of severe respiratory dysfunction and progression during the 2-yr follow-up. ACTN3-XX polymorphism was also associated with worse respiratory outcome. The study of exercise genes is of particular interest in respiratory muscles, due to their peculiar features, that is, continuous, low-intensity contraction and prominent recruitment of type I fibers. In line with previous observations on skeletal muscles, ACE-DD and ACTN3-XX genotypes were associated with indirect evidence of more severe respiratory phenotypes. On the contrary, polymorphisms related to autophagy and glycogen metabolism did not seem to influence respiratory muscles.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Previous reports evaluated the role of exercise genes in influencing skeletal muscle phenotype and response to ERT in LOPD. Here, we investigate the role of polymorphisms in several exercise gene, focusing on respiratory muscles. ACE-DD and ACTN3-XX polymorphisms, possibly influencing muscle properties and fiber composition, were associated with more severe respiratory phenotypes."

This study investigated whether daytime tests of respiratory muscle function and diaphragm ultrasound predict hypercapnia during sleep. <b>Methods:</b> Twenty-seven patients with genetic myopathies (myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 2, late-onset Pompe disease, facioscapulohumeral dystrophy; 48 ± 11 years) underwent overnight transcutaneous capnometry, spirometry, measurement of mouth occlusion pressures, and diaphragm ultrasound. <b>Results:</b> Sixteen out of 27 patients showed nocturnal hypercapnia (peak p<sub>tc</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> ≥ 50 mmHg for ≥ 30 min or increase in p<sub>tc</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> by 10 mmHg or more from the baseline value). In these patients, forced vital capacity (FVC; % predicted) and maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP; % of lower limit or normal or LLN) were significantly reduced compared to normocapnic individuals. Nocturnal hypercapnia was predicted by reduction in FVC of <60% [sensitivity, 1.0; area under the curve (AUC), 0.82] and MIP (%LLN) <120% (sensitivity, 0.83; AUC, 0.84), the latter reflecting that in patients with neuromuscular disease, pretest likelihood of abnormality is <i>per se</i> higher than in healthy subjects. Diaphragm excursion velocity during a sniff maneuver excluded nocturnal hypercapnia with high sensitivity (0.90) using a cutoff of 8.0 cm/s. <b>Conclusion:</b> In slowly progressive myopathies, nocturnal hypercapnia is predicted by FVC <60% or MIP <120% (LLN). As a novelty, nocturnal hypercapnia can be excluded with acceptable sensitivity by diaphragm excursion velocity >8.0 cm/s on diaphragm ultrasound."

Next-generation-sequencing was proved to be a valuable tool to unravel the characteristics of these individuals through their genetic heritage. Using the strictest criteria currently available for the validation of ancient DNA sequences, whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing were generated from the mummy remains of an Italian nobleman died almost 700 years ago, Cangrande della Scala. While its genome sequencing could not yield sufficient coverage for in depth investigation, exome sequencing could overcome the limitations of this approach to achieve significantly high coverage on coding regions, thus allowing to perform the first extensive exome analysis of a mummy genome. Similar to a standard \"clinical exome analysis\" conducted on modern DNA, an in-depth variant annotation, high-quality filtering and interpretation was performed, leading to the identification of a genotype associated with late-onset Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II). This genetic diagnosis was concordant with the limited clinical history available for Cangrande della Scala, who likely represents the earliest known case of this autosomal recessive metabolic disorder."

Therefore, we aimed to describe our diagnostic workflow for evaluating patients with this condition. We selected 83 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with persistent hyperCKemia for participation in this Italian multicenter study. Patients with facial involvement and distal or congenital myopathies were excluded, as were patients with suspected inflammatory myopathies or predominant respiratory or cardiac involvement. All patients underwent a neurological examination and nerve conduction and electromyography studies. The first step of the investigation included a screening for Pompe disease. We then evaluated the patients for myotonic dystrophy type II-related CCTG expansion and excluded patients with copy number variations in the DMD gene. Subsequently, the undiagnosed patients were investigated using a target gene panel that included 20 genes associated with isolated hyperCKemia. Using this approach, we established a definitive diagnosis in one third of the patients. The detection rate was higher in patients with severe hyperCKemia and abnormal electromyographic findings. We have described our diagnostic workflow for isolated hyperCKemia, which is based on electrodiagnostic data, biochemical screening, and first-line genetic investigations, followed by successive targeted sequencing panels.

This industry update covers the period 1-31 August 2021, and some examples of research and approvals for many other diseases excluding COVID-19 and the 'big three' are presented. There is a progressive trend of approvals of novel drug candidates and the proposal of new indications for the existing ones.

Information and analyses were sourced from scientific literature, regulatory and patent agencies, websites and press releases of the companies (and not based upon personal opinion). The main reason of leaving COVID-19 research outside the scope of this update is mainly due to the rapid growth and change in this field; some preliminary results require further research and scientists must be aware of the final impact that this research could have on public opinion. Moreover, as a result of disruptions to health care in the face of COVID-19, several research groups simply stopped their research in other diseases and, for that reason, it is imperative to sum up some important advances in other critical diseases and health areas."

As a retrospective study, we follow up with our five LOPD patients treated with Myozyme from 2012 to 2021 regularly, but with a focus on the whole airway abnormalities of these patients visualized through FB. The long-term clinical outcomes and relevant airway symptoms were assessed. Pulmonary function test and polysomnography were performed to evaluate the degree of respiratory compromise. All patients in the study had varying degrees of airway collapsibility, pulmonary complications, sleep apnea syndrome, and facial anomalies. Pulmonary function could preserve after Myozyme treatment, but potential deterioration thereafter. This is the first study that focuses on airway abnormalities and pulmonary complications in long-term treated LOPD patients using FB. Despite years of Myozyme treatment, we still observed airway abnormalities in these patients. In our series, the pulmonary complications seem more obvious than those observed in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease, which might be related to the late diagnosis and treatment. We might recommend that FB could provide dynamic evaluation and interventions of airway abnormalities simultaneously. Early diagnosis of respiratory dysfunction is a critical prognostic factor of the long-term outcome of treated LOPD patients."

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) is a rare, heterogeneous disease manifested by a range of symptoms varying in severity. Research establishing the frequency of these symptoms and their impact on patients' daily lives is limited. The objective of this study was to develop a conceptual model that captures the most relevant symptoms and functional limitations experienced by patients with LOPD, to inform the development of new patient-reported outcome (PRO) tools. A preliminary conceptual model was constructed following a literature review and revised through interviews with expert clinicians to identify important and relevant concepts regarding symptoms and impacts of LOPD. This preliminary model informed the development of a qualitative patient interview guide, which was used to gather the patient perspective on symptoms and impacts relating to LOPD or its treatment (including symptom/impact frequency and levels of disturbance). Patient interviews aided further refinement of the conceptual model. The findings from the patient interviews were triangulated with the literature review and clinician interviews to identify the most relevant and significant effects of LOPD from the patient perspective. Muscle weakness, fatigue, pain, and breathing difficulties (especially while lying down) were the most common and highly disturbing symptoms experienced by patients. Limitations associated with mobility (e.g., difficulty rising from a sitting position, getting up after bending) and activities of daily living, (e.g., reduced ability to participate in social/family activities or work/study) were the most frequently reported impacts with the highest levels of disturbance on the patient's daily life. These identified symptoms and impacts were included in the new conceptual model of disease. This qualitative patient interview study, also informed by a literature review and clinician interviews, identified the most frequent and relevant symptoms and the functional impact of LOPD on patients. The study interviews also captured the patient-preferred language to describe symptoms and impacts of LOPD. The results from this study can be used to develop future PRO instruments that are tailored to the specific symptoms and impacts experienced by patients with LOPD."

Given their rarity and complexity, neuromuscular diseases are often diagnosed with a very significant delay after which irreversible muscle damage may limit the efficacy of treatments when available. In this context, neonatal screening could constitute a solution for early detection and treatment. A systematic review of the literature in PubMed up to May 1, 2021, was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, including classical neuromuscular diseases and diseases with a clear peripheral nervous system involvement (including central nervous system disease with severe neuropathy). We found seven diseases for which newborn screening data were reported: spinal muscular atrophy (9), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (9), Pompe disease (8), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (5), Krabbe disease (4), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (1), metachromatic leukodystrophy (1). The future of newborn screening for neuromuscular disorders pass through a global technological switch, from a biochemical to a genetic-based approach.

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a metabolic myopathy due to acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency. In addition to glycogen storage, secondary dysregulation of cellular functions, such as autophagy and oxidative stress, contributes to the disease pathophysiology. We have tested whether oxidative stress impacts on enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA), currently the standard of care for Pompe disease patients, and whether correction of oxidative stress may be beneficial for rhGAA therapy. We found elevated oxidative stress levels in tissues from the Pompe disease murine model and in patients' cells. In cells, stress levels inversely correlated with the ability of rhGAA to correct the enzymatic deficiency. Antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine, idebenone, resveratrol, edaravone) improved alpha-glucosidase activity in rhGAA-treated cells, enhanced enzyme processing, and improved mannose-6-phosphate receptor localization. When co-administered with rhGAA, antioxidants improved alpha-glucosidase activity in tissues from the Pompe disease mouse model. These results indicate that oxidative stress impacts on the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy in Pompe disease and that manipulation of secondary abnormalities may represent a strategy to improve the efficacy of therapies for this disorder."

However, the minimal high-affinity M6P-containing <i>N</i>-glycan ligands remain to be identified and their efficient and site-selective conjugation to therapeutic lysosomal enzymes is a challenging task. We report here the chemical synthesis of truncated M6P-glycan oxazolines and their use for enzymatic glycan remodeling of recombinant human acid α-glucosidase (rhGAA), an enzyme used for treatment of Pompe disease which is a disorder caused by a deficiency of the glycogen-degrading lysosomal enzyme. Structure-activity relationship studies identified M6P tetrasaccharide oxazoline as the minimal substrate for enzymatic transglycosylation yielding high-affinity M6P glycan ligands for the CI-MPR. Taking advantage of the substrate specificity of endoglycosidases Endo-A and Endo-F3, we found that Endo-A and Endo-F3 could efficiently deglycosylate the respective high-mannose and complex type <i>N</i>-glycans in rhGAA and site-selectively transfer the synthetic M6P <i>N</i>-glycan to the deglycosylated rhGAA without product hydrolysis. This discovery enabled a highly efficient one-pot deglycosylation/transglycosylation strategy for site-selective M6P-glycan remodeling of rhGAA to obtain a more homogeneous product. The Endo-A and Endo-F3 remodeled rhGAAs maintained full enzyme activity and demonstrated 6- and 20-fold enhanced binding affinities for CI-MPR receptor, respectively. Using an <i>in vitro</i> cell model system for Pompe disease, we demonstrated that the M6P-glycan remodeled rhGAA greatly outperformed the commercial rhGAA (Lumizyme) and resulted in the reversal of cellular pathology. This study provides a general and efficient method for site-selective M6P-glycan remodeling of recombinant lysosomal enzymes to achieve enhanced M6P receptor binding and cellular uptake, which could lead to improved overall therapeutic efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy."

NBS technology cannot discern infantile-onset PD (IOPD) from later-onset PD (LOPD) without clinical follow-up. This study explores genetic health care practitioners' (HCPs) experiences and challenges providing NBS patient care throughout the US and their resultant opinions on NBS for PD. An online survey was distributed to genetic counselors, geneticists, NBS follow-up care coordinators, and nurse practitioners caring for patients with positive NBS results for PD. Analysis of 78 surveys revealed the majority of participating HCPs support inclusion of PD on NBS. Almost all HCPs (93.3%) feel their state has sufficient resources to provide follow-up medical care for IOPD; however, only three-fourths (74.6%) believed this for LOPD. Common barriers included time lag between NBS and confirmatory results, insurance difficulties for laboratory testing, and family difficulties in seeking medical care. HCPs more frequently encountered barriers providing care for LOPD than IOPD (53.9% LOPD identified ≥3 barriers, 31.1% IOPD). HCPs also believe creation of a population of presymptomatic individuals with LOPD creates a psychological burden on the family (87.3% agree/strongly agree), unnecessary medicalization of the child (63.5% agree/strongly agree), and parental hypervigilance (68.3% agree/strongly agree). Opinions were markedly divided on the use of reproductive benefit as a justification for NBS. Participants believe additional education for pediatricians and other specialists would be beneficial in providing care for patients with both IOPD and LOPD, in addition to the creation of evidence-based official guidelines for care and supportive resources for families with LOPD."

In recent years, the approval of disease-specific therapies and the rapid emergence of novel rapid diagnostic methods has opened, for a set of selected LSDs, the possibility for inclusion in extensive national newborn screening (NBS) programs. Herein, we evaluated the clinical utility and diagnostic validity of a targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) panel (called NBS_LSDs), designed ad hoc to scan the coding regions of six genes (<i>GBA</i>, <i>GAA</i>, <i>SMPD1</i>, <i>IDUA1</i>, <i>GLA</i>, <i>GALC</i>) relevant for a group of LSDs candidate for inclusion in national NBS programs (MPSI, Pompe, Fabry, Krabbe, Niemann Pick A-B and Gaucher diseases).

Analytical accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, as well as turnaround time and costs, were assessed. Results showed that the Ion AmpliSeq and Ion Chef System-based high-throughput NBS_LSDs tNGS panel is a fast, accurate, and cost-effective process. The introduction of this technology into routine NBS procedures as a second-tier test along with primary biochemical assays will allow facilitating the identification and management of selected LSDs and reducing diagnostic delay."

The only approved treatment is enzyme replacement therapy with the recombinant enzyme (rhGAA). Further approaches like pharmacological chaperone therapy, based on the stabilising effect induced by small molecules on the target enzyme, could be a promising strategy. However, most known chaperones could be limited by their potential inhibitory effects on patient's enzymes. Here we report on the discovery of novel chaperones for rhGAA, L- and D-carnitine, and the related compound acetyl-D-carnitine. These drugs stabilise the enzyme at pH and temperature without inhibiting the activity and acted synergistically with active-site directed pharmacological chaperones. Remarkably, they enhanced by 4-fold the acid <i>α</i>-glucosidase activity in fibroblasts from three Pompe patients with added rhGAA. This synergistic effect of L-carnitine and rhGAA has the potential to be translated into improved therapeutic efficacy of ERT in Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa (rhGAA) has changed the fatal course of infantile Pompe disease, however, development of anti rhGAA antibodies and infusion-associated reactions (IAR) restrict the tolerability and effectiveness of the treatment. We describe a successful concomitant immune tolerance induction (ITI) and desensitization protocols in a cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) negative 7-month-old male patient. At the age of 5 months and eighth dose of the ERT, the patient developed IAR and his rhGAA specific IgE was negative however, his rhGAA specific IgG titer was as high as 12,800. ITI therapy to suppress antibody formation and a desensitization protocol was devised to be given concomitantly. At the end of 5-week therapy, his fatigue and weakness improved profoundly and a control antidrug antibody level decreased at 800. At the time of the patient's follow up, he was still on ERT with desensitization at the age of 15 months without any reactions. This is the first report in the literature applying concomitant ITI and desensitization protocols in a CRIM negative infantile-onset Pompe disease patient successfully, hence the importance of the case."

    "abstract": "Children with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) demonstrate hypernasality. This study aimed to evaluate whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) training may reduce hypernasality in children with IOPD. Five children with IOPD were enrolled in a single-subject experimental design of type A-B-A'. The intervention comprised an 8-week, 6-day-per-week regimen of CPAP training at home. Participants continued traditional speech therapy once per week throughout the 24-week study duration. The outcome measurements included the degree of hypernasality (DH), the percentage of consonants correct (PCC), and the speech intelligibility score (SIS). C-statistic analysis with an α of 0.05 was used along with visual analysis to assess speech changes. Three patients completed the study. During the CPAP training phase, the DH, PCC, and SIS were significantly improved compared with the baseline (p < 0.05). At the follow-up phase, both DH and SIS were improved compared with the baseline (p < 0.05), but the PCC had returned to the baseline level. CPAP training demonstrated effectiveness in reducing nasal sounds in IOPD patients. Further studies training younger children with normal hearing may help elucidate the persistence of the effects in children with IOPD."

    "abstract": "Glycogenosis type II (GSDII), or Pompe disease (MIM 232300), is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal acid-α-glucosidase. Mutations in the GAA gene alter normal enzyme production and lead to progressive buildup of intralysosomal glycogen, which plays an essential role in the severity and progression of the disease. We report here the study of 76 patients from Spain with either infantile or late onset form of Pompe disease. The analysis consisted in the molecular study of exons and intron flanking fragments of GAA gene. We have identified 55 different molecular pathogenic variants, 12 of them not previously described. In addition, we have determined a frequency of 84.37% for the c.-32-13T>G mutation in patients with the late-onset form of the disease. Functional characterization of some splice mutations showed deleterious mechanisms on the processing of mRNA."

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional structures of proteins can provide important clues into the efficacy of personalized treatment. We perform a structural analysis of variants within three inherited lysosomal storage disorders, comparing variants responsive to pharmacological chaperone treatment to those unresponsive to such treatment. We find that predicted ΔΔG of mutation is higher on average for variants unresponsive to treatment, in the case of datasets for both Fabry disease and Pompe disease, in line with previous findings. Using both a single decision tree and an advanced machine learning approach based on the larger Fabry dataset, we correctly predict responsiveness of three Gaucher disease variants, and we provide predictions for untested variants. Many variants are predicted to be responsive to treatment, suggesting that drug-based treatments may be effective for a number of variants in Gaucher disease. In our analysis, we observe dependence on a topological feature reporting on contact arrangements which is likely connected to the order of folding of protein residues, and we provide a potential justification for this observation based on steady-state cellular kinetics."

    "abstract": "Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is commonly used for respiratory failure due to severe COVID-19 pneumonitis, including in patients deemed not likely to benefit from invasive mechanical ventilation (nIMV). Little evidence exists demonstrating superiority over conventional oxygen therapy, whilst ward-level delivery of CPAP presents practical challenges. We sought to compare clinical outcomes of oxygen therapy versus CPAP therapy in patients with COVID-19 who were nIMV. This retrospective multi-centre cohort evaluation included patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were nIMV, had a treatment escalation plan of ward-level care and clinical frailty scale ≤ 6. Recruitment occurred during the first two waves of the UK COVID-19 pandemic in 2020; from 1<sup>st</sup> March to May 31<sup>st</sup>, and from 1<sup>st</sup> September to 31<sup>st</sup> December. Patients given CPAP were compared to patients receiving oxygen therapy that required FiO<sub>2</sub> ≥0<sub>.</sub>4 for more than 12 hours at hospitals not providing ward-level CPAP. Logistic regression modelling was performed to compare 30-day mortality between treatment groups, accounting for important confounders and within-hospital clustering. Seven hospitals provided data for 479 patients during the UK COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Overall 30-day mortality was 75.6% in the oxygen group (186/246 patients) and 77.7% in the CPAP group (181/233 patients). A lack of evidence for a treatment effect persisted in the adjusted model (adjusted odds ratio 0.84 95% CI 0.57-1.23, p=0.37). 49.8% of patients receiving CPAP-therapy (118/237) chose to discontinue it. No survival difference was found between using oxygen alone or CPAP to treat patients with severe COVID-19 who were nIMV. A high patient-initiated discontinuation rate for CPAP suggests a significant treatment burden. Further reflection is warranted on the current treatment guidance and widespread application of CPAP in this setting. L Pearmain is supported by the MRC (MR/R00191X/1).

    "abstract": "Over 30 million people worldwide have taken a commercial at-home DNA test, because they were interested in their genetic ancestry, disease predisposition or inherited traits. Yet, these consumer DNA data are also increasingly used for a very different purpose: to identify suspects in criminal investigations. By matching a suspect's DNA with DNA from a suspect's distant relatives who have taken a commercial at-home DNA test, law enforcement can zero in on a perpetrator. Such forensic use of consumer DNA data has been performed in over 200 criminal investigations. However, this practice of so-called investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) raises ethical concerns. In this paper, we aim to broaden the bioethical analysis on IGG by showing the limitations of an individual-based model. We discuss two concerns central in the debate: privacy and informed consent. However, we argue that IGG raises pressing ethical concerns that extend beyond these individual-focused issues. The very nature of the genetic information entails that relatives may also be affected by the individual customer's choices. In this respect, we explore to what extent the ethical approach in the biomedical genetic context on consent and consequences for relatives can be helpful for the debate on IGG. We argue that an individual-based model has significant limitations in an IGG context. The ethical debate is further complicated by the international, transgenerational and commercial nature of IGG. We conclude that IGG should not only be approached as an individual but also-and perhaps primarily-as a collective issue."

    "abstract": "Measurement of alpha-glucosidase activity on dried blood spots has been the main method to screen for Pompe disease, but a paradigm shift has been observed in recent years with the incorporation of gene panels and exome sequencing in molecular diagnostic laboratories. An 89-gene panel has been available to Canadian physicians since 2017 and was analyzed in 2030 patients with a suspected muscle disease. Acid alpha-glucosidase activity was measured in parallel in dried blood spots from 1430 patients. Pompe disease was diagnosed in 14 patients, representing 0.69% of our cohort. In 7 other patients, low enzyme activities overlapping those of Pompe disease cases were attributable to the presence of pseudodeficiency alleles. Only two other patients had enzymatic activity in the Pompe disease range, and a single heterozygous pathogenic variant was identified. It is possible that a second variant could have been missed; we suggest that RNA analysis should be considered in such cases. With gene panel testing increasingly being performed as a first-tier analysis of patients with suspected muscle disorders, our study supports the relevance of performing reflex enzymatic activity assay in selected patients, such as those with a single <i>GAA</i> variant identified and those in whom the observed genotype is of uncertain clinical significance."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of rare diseases that cause progressive physical dysfunction and organ failure, which significantly affected patients' quality of life. The objective of this study was to explore the characteristics and usage of Enzyme Replacement Treatments (ERTs), which is the only specific therapy for LSDs, of patients with the four different LSDs (Gaucher, Fabry, Pompe disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis) in Shanghai, and then evaluate the economic burden and quality of life of these patients. A total of 31patients, involving 5, 14, 4 and 8 patients with Gaucher, Fabry, Pompe disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis, respectively, were included in analysis. The result showed that only five Gaucher disease (GD) patients in Shanghai used Imiglucerase in 2019, while the other 26 patients with the other three LSDs did not receive ERTs. The total health expenditure of GD patients was 2,273,000CNY on average mainly resulted by the high cost of Imiglucerase. The total health expenditure of the other 26 patients was 37,765CNY on average. Though the cost-sharing mechanism between basic medical insurance, charity fund and patients had been explored for Gaucher disease in Shanghai, the out-of-pocket part, which was 164,301 CNY, still laid a heavy economic burden on the patients and their families. The mean EQ-VAS score of GD patients was 76.4 ± 15.5, which was higher than that of the other three LSDs. It is recommended that the scope of drug reimbursement list and the reimbursement level should be further expanded and raised to help improve the living conditions of patients with LSDs."

    "abstract": "Bulbar and respiratory weakness occur commonly in children with Pompe disease and frequently lead to dysarthria. However, changes in vocal quality associated with this motor speech disorder are poorly described. The goal of this study was to characterize the vocal function of children with Pompe disease using auditory-perceptual and physiologic/acoustic methods. High-quality voice recordings were collected from 21 children with Pompe disease. The Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain (GRBAS) scale was used to assess voice quality and ratings were compared to physiologic/acoustic measurements collected during sustained phonation tasks, reading of a standard passage, and repetition of a short phrase at maximal volume. Based on ratings of grade, dysphonia was present in 90% of participants and was most commonly rated as mild or moderate in severity. Duration of sustained phonation tasks was reduced and shimmer was increased in comparison to published reference values for children without dysphonia. Specific measures of loudness were found to have statistically significant relationships with perceptual ratings of grade, breathiness, asthenia, and strain. Our data suggest that dysphonia is common in children with Pompe disease and primarily reflects impairments in respiratory and laryngeal function; however, the primary cause of dysphonia remains unclear. Future studies should seek to quantify the relative contribution of deficits in individual speech subsystems on voice quality and motor speech performance more broadly."

Phenotypic variation for other common GAA genotypes remains largely unexplored. Here, we analyzed variation in age at symptom onset for the most common GAA genotypes using the updated and extended Pompe GAA variant database. Patients with the c.2647-7G > A/null genotype invariably presented symptoms at adulthood, while the c.-32-13T > G/null, c.546G > T/null, c.1076-22T > G/null, c.2238G > C/null, and c.2173C > T/null genotypes led to presentations from early childhood up to late adulthood. The c.1309C > T/null genotype was associated with onset at early to late childhood. Symptom onset shifted toward higher ages in homozygous patients. These findings indicate that a broad variation in symptom onset occurs for various common GAA genotypes, suggesting the presence of modifying factors. We identified three new compound heterozygous c.-32-13T > G/null patients who carried the genetic modifier c.510C > T and who showed symptom onset at childhood. While c.510C > T acted by lowering GAA enzyme activity, other putative genetic modifiers did not at the group level, suggesting that these act in trans on processes downstream of GAA enzyme activity."

Patients were evaluated at baseline, 12 months and 24 months. MUS, sEIM and hEIM were compared with the clinical data. Five patients were given hEIM devices to perform measurements at home. QMUS and hEIM had good reliability as measures of muscle structure and conduction properties. Home, patient-performed hEIM measurements did not differ significantly from those performed in the clinic setting. Thirteen patients completed all follow-up measures. Most measures did not change over the study period, however, vastus lateralis echointensity increased 27%, a sign of declining muscle health. Additionally, significant correlations between QMUS, hEIM and measures of muscle strength and function were present. QMUS and hEIM may provide useful outcome measures for future studies in LOPD with hEIM providing an opportunity to collect data at home.

    "abstract": "Lysosomal diseases are a class of genetic disorders predominantly caused by loss of lysosomal hydrolases, leading to lysosomal and cellular dysfunction. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), where recombinant enzyme is given intravenously, internalized by cells, and trafficked to the lysosome, has been applied to treat several lysosomal diseases. However, current ERT regimens do not correct disease phenotypes in all affected organs because the biodistribution of enzyme uptake does not match that of the affected cells that require the enzyme. We present here targeted ERT, an approach that utilizes antibody-enzyme fusion proteins to target the enzyme to specific cell types. The antibody moiety recognizes transmembrane proteins involved in lysosomal trafficking and that are also preferentially expressed in those cells most affected in disease. Using Pompe disease (PD) as an example, we show that targeted ERT is superior to ERT in treating the skeletal muscle phenotypes of PD mice both as a protein replacement therapeutic and as a gene therapy."

To understand the extent and the effects of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT; alglucosidase alfa) in Pompe disease, we studied the histopathology (entire GI tract) in Pompe mice (GAAKO 6<sup>neo</sup>/6<sup>neo</sup>). To determine the disease burden in patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), we used Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurements Information System (PROMIS)-GI symptom scales and a GI-focused medical history. Pompe mice showed early, extensive, and progressive glycogen accumulation throughout the GI tract. Long-term ERT (6 months) was more effective to clear the glycogen accumulation than short-term ERT (5 weeks). GI manifestations were highly prevalent and severe, presented early in life, and were not fully amenable to ERT in patients with LOPD (<i>n</i> = 58; age range: 18-79 years, median age: 51.55 years; 35 females; 53 on ERT). GI manifestations cause a significant disease burden on adults with LOPD, and should be evaluated during routine clinical visits, using quantitative tools (PROMIS-GI measures).

    "abstract": "Following clinical indications, the laboratory diagnosis of the inherited metabolic myopathy, Pompe disease (PD), typically begins with demonstrating a reduction in acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), the enzyme required for lysosomal glycogen degradation. Although simple in concept, a major challenge is defining reference intervals, as even carriers can have reduced GAA, and pseudodeficiencies complicate interpretation. Here, we developed a mass spectrometric assay for quantification of a urinary glycogen metabolite (tetrasaccharide) and reported on its utility as a confirmatory test for PD in a diagnostic laboratory. Using two age-related reference intervals, eight returned tetrasaccharide concentrations above the calculated reference interval but did not have PD, highlighting non-specificity. However, retrospective analysis revealed elevated tetrasaccharide in seven infantile-onset (IOPD) cases and sixteen late-onset (LOPD) cases, and normal concentrations in one heterozygote. Prospective tetrasaccharide analysis in nine individuals with reduced GAA confirmed IOPD in one, LOPD in six and identified two heterozygotes. Using this metabolite as a biomarker of therapeutic response was not overly informative; although most patients showed an initial drop following therapy initiation, tetrasaccharide concentrations fluctuated considerably and remained above reference intervals in all patients. While useful as a confirmation of PD, its utility as a biomarker for monitoring treatment warrants further investigation."

For this, <i>GAA</i> variants in Korean and Japanese patients reported in previous studies and in patients reported in the Pompe disease <i>GAA</i> variant database were analyzed as a model. In addition, <i>GAA</i> variants in the Korean Reference Genome Database (KRGDB), the Japanese Multi Omics Reference Panel (jMorp), and the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) were analyzed. Overall, approximately 50% of the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (PLPVs) found in unaffected carriers were also found in real patients with Pompe disease (Koreans, 57.1%; Japanese, 46.2%). In addition, there was a moderate positive correlation (Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.45-0.69) between the proportion of certain PLPVs in patients and the minor allele frequency of their variants in a general population database.

Hearing impairment (HI) is one of the clinical sequelae observed in long-term survivors. However, the benefits of early ERT for hearing outcomes have not yet been reported. This study aimed to investigate the impact of early ERT on IOPD patients. This retrospective longitudinal study recruited IOPD patients who were referred by newborn screening for confirmatory diagnosis based on our rapid diagnostic criteria and received early ERT treatment between January 1, 2010, and January 31, 2018. The hearing test battery included a tympanogram, otoacoustic emission, auditory brainstem evoked response (ABR), pure-tone audiometry or conditioned play audiometry. Nineteen patients with IOPD were identified, 6 of whom had hearing impairment (HI); 1 had conductive HI, 2 had sensorineural HI (one had bilateral mild HI and one had mild HI in a single ear) and 1 had moderate mixed-type HI. Two patients failed the newborn screening test and had mild HI in the ABR. The mean age of the initial time to ERT was 11.05 ± 4.31 days, and the HI rate was 31.6% (6/19). Our study is the largest cohort to show the characteristic hearing outcomes of IOPD patients after ERT. Early ERT within 2 weeks after birth may contribute to better hearing outcomes. Clinicians should be vigilant in testing for the hearing issues associated with IOPD and should intervene early if any HI is detected."

    "abstract": "Quantitative MRI is an increasingly used method to monitor disease progression in muscular disorders due to its ability to measure changes in muscle fat content (reported as fat fraction) over a short period. Being able to objectively measure such changes is crucial for the development of new treatments in clinical trials. However, the analysis of the images involved continues to be a daunting task because of the time needed. Whether a more specific analysis selecting individual muscles or a global one analyzing the whole thigh or compartments could be a suitable alternative has only been marginally studied. In our study we compare three methods of analysis of 2-point-dixon images in a cohort of 34 patients with late onset Pompe disease followed over a period of one year. We measured fat fraction on MRIs obtained at baseline and at year 1, and we calculated the increment of fat fraction. We correlated the results obtained with the results of muscle function tests to investigate whether the three methods of analysis were equivalent or not. We observed significant differences between the three methods in the estimation of the fat fraction at both baseline and year 1, but no difference was found in the increment in fat fraction between baseline and year 1. When we correlated the fat fraction obtained with each method and the muscle function tests, we found a significant correlation with most tests in all three methods, although in most comparisons the highest correlation coefficient was found with the analysis of individual muscles. We conclude that the fastest strategy of analysis assessing compartments or the whole thigh could be reliable for certain cohorts of patients where the variable to study is the fat increment. In other sorts of studies, an individual muscle approach seems the most reliable technique."

    "abstract": "Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is a glycogen storage disease caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Treatment with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA, alglucosidase alfa) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) significantly improves clinical outcomes; however, many IOPD children treated with rhGAA develop anti-drug antibodies (ADA) that render the therapy ineffective. Antibodies to rhGAA are driven by T cell responses to sequences in rhGAA that differ from the individuals' native <i>GAA</i> (nGAA). The goal of this study was to develop a tool for personalized immunogenicity risk assessment (PIMA) that quantifies T cell epitopes that differ between nGAA and rhGAA using information about an individual's native GAA gene and their HLA DR haplotype, and to use this information to predict the risk of developing ADA. Four versions of PIMA have been developed. They use EpiMatrix, a computational tool for T cell epitope identification, combined with an HLA-restricted epitope-specific scoring feature (iTEM), to assess ADA risk. One version of PIMA also integrates JanusMatrix, a Treg epitope prediction tool to identify putative immunomodulatory (regulatory) T cell epitopes in self-proteins. Using the JanusMatrix-adjusted version of PIMA in a logistic regression model with data from 48 cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM)-positive IOPD subjects, those with scores greater than 10 were 4-fold more likely to develop ADA (p<0.03) than those that had scores less than 10. We also confirmed the hypothesis that some GAA epitopes are immunomodulatory. Twenty-one epitopes were tested, of which four were determined to have an immunomodulatory effect on T effector response <i>in vitro</i>. The implementation of PIMA V3J on a secure-access website would allow clinicians to input the individual HLA DR haplotype of their IOPD patient and the GAA pathogenic variants associated with each GAA allele to calculate the patient's relative risk of developing ADA, enhancing clinical decision-making prior to initiating treatment with ERT. A better understanding of immunogenicity risk will allow the implementation of targeted immunomodulatory approaches in ERT-naïve settings, especially in CRIM-positive patients, which may in turn improve the overall clinical outcomes by minimizing the development of ADA. The PIMA approach may also be useful for other types of enzyme or factor replacement therapies."

In some cases, testing reveals difficult-to-evaluate structural differences, candidate variants that do not fully explain the phenotype, single pathogenic variants in recessive disorders, or no variants in genes of interest. Thus, there is a need for better tools to identify a precise genetic diagnosis in individuals when conventional testing approaches have been exhausted. We performed targeted long-read sequencing (T-LRS) using adaptive sampling on the Oxford Nanopore platform on 40 individuals, 10 of whom lacked a complete molecular diagnosis. We computationally targeted up to 151 Mbp of sequence per individual and searched for pathogenic substitutions, structural variants, and methylation differences using a single data source. We detected all genomic aberrations-including single-nucleotide variants, copy number changes, repeat expansions, and methylation differences-identified by prior clinical testing. In 8/8 individuals with complex structural rearrangements, T-LRS enabled more precise resolution of the mutation, leading to changes in clinical management in one case. In ten individuals with suspected Mendelian conditions lacking a precise genetic diagnosis, T-LRS identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in six and variants of uncertain significance in two others. T-LRS accurately identifies pathogenic structural variants, resolves complex rearrangements, and identifies Mendelian variants not detected by other technologies. T-LRS represents an efficient and cost-effective strategy to evaluate high-priority genes and regions or complex clinical testing results."

    "title": "Crohn disease-like enterocolitis remission after empagliflozin treatment in a child with glycogen storage disease type Ib: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Besides major clinical/biochemical features, neutropenia and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) constitute common complications of Glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSD Ib). However, their management is still challenging. Although previous reports have shown benefit of empagliflozin administration on neutropenia, no follow-up data on bowel (macro/microscopic) morphology are available. We herein present for the first time longitudinal assessment of bowel morphology in a GSD Ib child suffering from Crohn disease-like enterocolitis treated with empagliflozin. A 14-year-old boy with GSD Ib and severe IBD was (off-label) treated with empagliflozin (20 mg/day) after informed oral and written consent was obtained from the patient's parents. No adverse events were noted. Clinical symptoms and stool frequency improved within the first week of treatment. Pediatric Crohn disease activity index (PCDAI) normalised within the first month of treatment. Abdomen magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 3 months after treatment initiation showed dramatic decrease in disease activity and length. Similar findings were reported on histology at 5.5 months. At 7.5 months hemoglobin levels normalised and fecal calprotectin almost normalised. Improved neutrophil count, metabolic control and quality of life were also noted. G-CSF dose was decreased by 33% and the patient was partly weaned from tube feeding. This is the first report presenting extensive gastrointestinal morphology follow-up in a GSD Ib patient receiving empagliflozin. The present case suggests that empagliflozin can be safe and effective in inducing IBD remission in GSD Ib patients and can even postpone surgery. Future studies are required to confirm its effect over time and assess its benefit in various disease stages. The development of an international collaborating networks for systematic data collection is worthy."

    "title": "Quantitative Muscle MRI in Patients with Neuromuscular Diseases-Association of Muscle Proton Density Fat Fraction with Semi-Quantitative Grading of Fatty Infiltration and Muscle Strength at the Thigh Region.",
    "abstract": "(1) Background and Purpose: The skeletal muscles of patients suffering from neuromuscular diseases (NMD) are affected by atrophy, hypertrophy, fatty infiltration, and edematous changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important tool for diagnosis and monitoring. Concerning fatty infiltration, T<sub>1</sub>-weighted or T<sub>2</sub>-weighted DIXON turbo spin echo (TSE) sequences enable a qualitative assessment of muscle involvement. To achieve higher comparability, semi-quantitative grading scales, such as the four-point Mercuri scale, are commonly applied. However, the evaluation remains investigator-dependent. Therefore, effort is being invested to develop quantitative MRI techniques for determination of imaging markers such as the proton density fat fraction (PDFF). The present work aims to assess the diagnostic value of PDFF in correlation to Mercuri grading and clinically determined muscle strength in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A), and adult Pompe disease. (2) Methods: T<sub>2</sub>-weighted two-dimensional (2D) DIXON TSE and chemical shift encoding-based water-fat MRI were acquired in 13 patients (DM2: <i>n</i> = 5; LGMD2A: <i>n</i> = 5; Pompe disease: <i>n</i> = 3). Nine different thigh muscles were rated in all patients according to the Mercuri grading and segmented to extract PDFF values. Muscle strength was assessed according to the British Medical Research Council (BMRC) scale. For correlation analyses between Mercuri grading, muscle strength, and PDFF, the Spearman correlation coefficient (r<sub>s</sub>) was computed. (3) Results: Mean PDFF values ranged from 7% to 37% in adults with Pompe disease and DM2 and up to 79% in LGMD2A patients. In all three groups, a strong correlation of the Mercuri grading and PDFF values was observed for almost all muscles (<i>r<sub>s</sub></i> > 0.70, <i>p</i> < 0.05). PDFF values correlated significantly to muscle strength for muscle groups responsible for knee flexion (<i>r<sub>s</sub></i> = -0.80, <i>p</i> < 0.01). (4) Conclusion: In the small, investigated patient cohort, PDFF offers similar diagnostic precision as the clinically established Mercuri grading. Based on these preliminary data, PDFF could be further considered as an MRI-based biomarker in the assessment of fatty infiltration of muscle tissue in NMD. Further studies with larger patient cohorts are needed to advance PDFF as an MRI-based biomarker in NMD, with advantages such as its greater dynamic range, enabling the assessment of subtler changes, the amplified objectivity, and the potential of direct correlation to muscle function for selected muscles."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by a mutation in the acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) gene. Patients with late-onset PD retain some GAA activity and present symptoms later in life, with fatality mainly associated with respiratory failure. This case study presents diaphragm electrophysiology and a histological analysis of the brainstem, spinal cord, and diaphragm, from a male PD patient diagnosed with late-onset PD at age 35. The patient was wheelchair dependent by age 38, required nocturnal ventilation at age 40, 24-h noninvasive ventilation by age 43, and passed away from respiratory failure at age 54. Diaphragm electromyography recorded using indwelling \"pacing\" wires showed asynchronous bursting between the left and right diaphragm during brief periods of independent breathing. The synchrony declined over a 4-yr period preceding respiratory failure. Histological assessment indicated motoneuron atrophy in the medulla and rostral spinal cord. Hypoglossal (soma size: 421 ± 159 µm<sup>2</sup>) and cervical motoneurons (soma size: 487 ± 189 µm<sup>2</sup>) had an atrophied, elongated appearance. In contrast, lumbar (soma size: 1,363 ± 677 µm<sup>2</sup>) and sacral motoneurons (soma size: 1,411 ± 633 µm<sup>2</sup>) had the ballooned morphology typical of early-onset PD. Diaphragm histology indicated loss of myofibers. These results are consistent with neuromuscular degeneration and the concept that effective PD therapy will need to target the central nervous system, in addition to skeletal and cardiac muscle.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This case study offered a unique opportunity to investigate longitudinal changes in phrenic neurophysiology in an individual with severe, ventilator-dependent, late-onset Pompe disease. Additional diaphragm and neural tissue histology upon autopsy confirmed significant neuromuscular degeneration, and it provided novel insights regarding rostral to caudal variability in the neuropathology. These findings suggest that a successful treatment approach for ventilator-dependent Pompe disease should target the central nervous system, in addition to skeletal muscle."

    "abstract": "The goal of newborn screening is to enhance the outcome of individuals with serious, treatable disorders through early, pre-symptomatic detection. The lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) comprise a group of more than 50 diseases with a combined frequency of approximately 1:7000. With the availability of existing and new enzyme replacement therapies, small molecule treatments and gene therapies, there is increasing interest in screening newborns for LSDs with the goal of reducing disease-related morbidity and mortality through early detection. Novel screening methods are being developed, including efforts to enhance accuracy of screening using an array of multi-tiered, genomic, statistical, and bioinformatic approaches. While NBS data for Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, Krabbe disease, MPS I, and Pompe disease has demonstrated the feasibility of widespread screening, it has also highlighted some of the complexities of screening for LSDs. These include the identification of infants with later-onset, untreatable, and uncertain phenotypes, raising interesting ethical concerns that should be addressed as part of the NBS implementation process. Taken together, these efforts will provide critical, detailed data to help guide objective, ethically sensitive decision-making about NBS for LSDs."

Between 2008 and 2020, our center received 149 GHI referrals for genetic testing. Genetic analysis utilized a combination of candidate gene sequencing, whole exome sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization, and a targeted whole genome short stature gene panel. Genetic diagnoses were identified in 80/149 subjects (54%) with 45/80 (56%) having known GH-IGF-I axis defects (GHR n = 40, IGFALS n = 4, IGFIR n = 1).

Identify postural abnormalities in a homogeneous group of LOPD patients using 3D Stereophotogrammetry (St) and x-Ray (xR). Seven LOPD siblings were recruited. They were assessed by clinical scales and, in upright posture, using xR and 3D-St with a new marker set protocol. Fourteen healthy individuals, age and sex-matched, were used as controls for St-parameters; normative xR-values were found in literature. LOPD patients showed a significant weakness of trunk and tibialis anterior muscles. Statistical analysis of St-parameters showed a larger ankle, knee, elbow, dorsal, S2-C7, heel-S2-C7, heel-S2-nasion angles and a lower sagittal vertical axis (SVA) than controls.xR-analysis highlighted an absence of scoliosis and a lower occipito-cervical, C2-C7 cervical and Cobb dorsal angles, and a trend to lower lumbar lordosis and SVA compared to normal values. Significant correlation was found in dorsal and lumbar angles calculated using xR-markers placed on spiny apophysis, xR-centre of vertebral bodies, Cobb-method and St-markers. This is the first quantitative study of postural abnormalities in LOPD patients using 3D-St and xR, highlighting sagittal standing alignment changes, difficult to assess to direct exam.Our new St-protocol showed a high reliability compared to xR. Further studies on larger population of LOPD might confirm the usefulness of these instrumental methods for monitoring disease course."

Owing to the rarity of these diseases, the prevalence of lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan is unknown. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide survey to estimate the number of patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan. A nationwide survey was conducted following the \"Manual of nationwide epidemiological survey for understanding patient number and clinical epidemiology of rare diseases (3rd version)\". A questionnaire asking for detailed information, such as disease phenotypes and medical history, was created and sent to 504 institutions with doctors who have experience in treating patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders. Result A total of 303 completed questionnaires were collected from 504 institutions (response rate: 60.1%). The number of patients was estimated by calculating the rate/frequency of overlap. The estimated number of patients was 1658 (±264.8) for Fabry disease, 72 (±11.3) for mucopolysaccharidosis I, 275 (±49.9) for mucopolysaccharidosis II, 211 (±31.3) for Gaucher disease, 124 (±25.8) for Pompe disease, 83 (±44.3) for metachromatic leukodystrophy, 57 (±9.4) for Niemann-Pick type C, and 262 (±42.3) for adrenoleukodystrophy. In addition the birth prevalence was calculated using the estimated number of patients and birth year data for each disease, and was 1.25 for Fabry disease, 0.09 for mucopolysaccharidosis I, 0.38 for mucopolysaccharidosis II, 0.19 for Gaucher disease, 0.14 for Pompe disease, 0.16 for metachromatic leukodystrophy, 0.16 for Niemann-Pick type C, and 0.20 for adrenoleukodystrophy. Among the diseases analyzed, the disease with the highest prevalence was Fabry disease, followed by mucopolysaccharidosis II, adrenoleukodystrophy, Gaucher disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy. In particular, the high prevalence of mucopolysaccharidosis II and Gaucher disease type II was a feature characteristic of Japan. We estimated the number of patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan. The details of the age at diagnosis and treatment methods for each disease were clarified, and will be useful for the early diagnosis of these patients and to provide appropriate treatments. Furthermore, our results suggest that supportive care and the development of an environment that can provide optimal medical care is important in the future."

    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD Ia) is characterized by severe fasting hypoglycemia. The clinical management includes the administration of uncooked cornstarch (UCCS). Although such a diet approach is effective in achieving euglycemia, its impact on the quality of life of patients should be considered. In vitro analyses suggest a longer release of glucose when using sweet manioc starch (SMS). We compared the efficacy and safety of the administration of SMS and UCCS during a short-fasting challenge in patients with GSD Ia in a randomized, triple-blind, phase I/II, cross-over study. GSD Ia patients aged ≥ 16 years and treated with UCCS were enrolled. Participants were hospitalized for two consecutive nights, receiving UCCS or SMS in each night. After the administration of the starches, glucose, lactate and insulin levels were measured in 1-h interval throughout the hospitalization period. The procedures were interrupted after 10 h of fasting or in a hypoglycemic episode (< 3.88 mmol/L). Eleven individuals (mean age: 21.6 ± 4.3 years; all presenting body mass index > 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participated in the study. The average fasting period was 8.2 ± 2.0 h for SMS and 7.7 ± 2.3 h for UCCS (p = 0.04). SMS maintained euglycemia for a greater period over UCCS. Increased lactate concentrations were detected even in absence of hypoglycemia, not being influenced by the different starches investigated (p = 0.17). No significant difference was found in total cholesterol, HDL, triglycerides and uric acid levels in both arms. None of the patients showed severe adverse events. SMS appears to be non-inferior to UCCS in the maintenance of euglycemia, thus emerging as a promising alternative to the treatment of GSD Ia."

The aim was to assess regional and proximo-distal PDFF variations at the thigh in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A), and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) as compared to healthy controls. Seven patients (n=2 DM2, n=2 LGMD2A, n=3 LOPD) and 20 controls were recruited. A 3D-spoiled gradient echo sequence was used to scan the thigh musculature. Muscles were manually segmented to generate mean muscle PDFF. In all three disease entities, there was an increase in muscle fat replacement compared to healthy controls. However, within each disease group, there were patients with a shorter time since symptom onset that only showed mild PDFF elevation (range, 10% to 20%) compared to controls (P≤0.05), whereas patients with a longer period since symptom onset showed a more severe grade of fat replacement with a range of 50% to 70% (P<0.01). Increased PDFF of around 5% was observed for vastus medialis, semimembranosus and gracilis muscles in advanced compared to early DM2. LGMD2A_1 showed an early disease stage with predominantly mild PDFF elevations over all muscles and levels (10.9%±7.1%) compared to controls. The quadriceps, gracilis and biceps femoris muscles showed the highest difference between LGMD2A_1 with 5 years since symptom onset (average PDFF 11.1%±6.9%) compared to LGMD2A_2 with 32 years since symptom onset (average PDFF 66.3%±6.3%). For LOPD patients, overall PDFF elevations were observed in all major hip flexors and extensors (range, 25.8% to 30.8%) compared to controls (range, 1.7% to 2.3%, P<0.05). Proximal-to-distal PDFF highly varied within and between diseases and within controls. The intra-reader reliability was high (reproducibility coefficient ≤2.19%). By quantitatively measuring muscle fat infiltration at the thigh, we identified candidate muscles for disease monitoring due to their gradual PDFF elevation with longer disease duration. Regional variation between proximal, central, and distal muscle PDFF was high and is important to consider when performing longitudinal MRI follow-ups in the clinical setting or in longitudinal studies."

Depending on residual enzyme activity, the disease manifests two distinct phenotypes. In this study, we assess an enzymatic and genetic analysis of Hungarian patients with Pompe disease. Twenty-four patients diagnosed with Pompe disease were included. Enzyme activity of acid-α-glucosidase was measured by mass spectrometry. Sanger sequencing and an MLPA of the GAA gene were performed in all patients. Twenty (83.33%) patients were classified as having late-onset Pompe disease and four (16.66%) had infantile-onset Pompe disease. Fifteen different pathogenic GAA variants were detected. The most common finding was the c.-32-13 T > G splice site alteration. Comparing the α-glucosidase enzyme activity of homozygous cases to the compound heterozygous cases of the c.-32-13 T > G disease-causing variant, the mean GAA activity in homozygous cases was significantly higher. The lowest enzyme activity was found in cases where the c.-32-13 T > G variant was not present. The localization of the identified sequence variations in regions encoding the crucial protein domains of GAA correlates with severe effects on enzyme activity. A better understanding of the impact of pathogenic gene variations may help earlier initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) if subtle symptoms occur. Further information on the effect of GAA gene variation on the efficacy of treatment and the extent of immune response to ERT would be of importance for optimal disease management and designing effective treatment plans."

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is an inherited autosomal recessive progressive metabolic myopathy that presents in the first year of life to adulthood. Clinical presentation is heterogeneous, differential diagnosis is challenging, and diagnostic delay is common. One challenge to differential diagnosis is the overlap of clinical features with those encountered in other forms of acquired/hereditary myopathy. Tongue weakness and imaging abnormalities are increasingly recognized in LOPD. In order to explore the diagnostic potential of tongue involvement in LOPD, we assessed tongue structure and function in 70 subjects, including 10 with LOPD naive to treatment, 30 with other acquired/hereditary myopathy, and 30 controls with neuropathy. Tongue strength was assessed with both manual and quantitative muscle testing. Ultrasound (US) was used to assess tongue overall appearance, echointensity, and thickness. Differences in tongue strength, qualitative appearance, echointensity, and thickness between LOPD subjects and neuropathic controls were statistically significant. Greater tongue involvement was observed in LOPD subjects compared to those with other acquired/hereditary myopathies, based on statistically significant decreases in quantitative tongue strength and sonographic muscle thickness. These findings provide additional evidence for tongue involvement in LOPD characterized by weakness and sonographic abnormalities suggestive of fibrofatty replacement and atrophy. Findings of quantitative tongue weakness and/or atrophy may aid differentiation of LOPD from other acquired/hereditary myopathies. Additionally, our experiences in this study reveal US to be an effective, efficient imaging modality to allow quantitative assessment of the lingual musculature at the point of care."

PGM1 deficiency (OMIM: 614921) was initially defined as a glycogen storage disorder (type XIV), and later re-classified as a PGM1-congenital disorder of glycosylation (PGM1-CDG). Serum transferrin (Tf) glycan isoform analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is used as a primary diagnostic screen tool, and reveals a very unique CDG profile described as a mixture of CDG-type I and CDG-type II patterns. Oral d-galactose supplementation shows significant clinical and metabolic improvements, which are indicated by the Tf glycan isoform normalization over time in patients with PGM1-CDG. Thus, there is a need for biomarkers to guide d-galactose dosage in patients in order to maintain effective and safe drug levels. Here, we present a simplified algorithm called PGM1-CDG Treatment Monitoring Index (PGM1-TMI) for assessing the response of PGM1-CDG patients to d-galactose supplementation. For our single-center cohort of 16 PGM1-CDG patients, the Tf glycan profile analysis provided the biochemical diagnosis in all of them. In addition, the PGM1-TMI was reduced in PGM1-CDG patients under d-galactose supplementation as compared with their corresponding values before treatment, indicating that glycosylation proceeds towards normalization. PGM1-TMI allows tracking Tf glycan isoform normalization over time when the patients are on d-galactose supplementation."

Due to the emergence of a disease modifying treatment with recombinant GAA there has been a large increase in studies of late onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) during the last decade. The present study evaluates muscle quality in 10 patients with LOPD receiving treatment with enzyme replacement therapy and in 10 age and gender matched healthy controls applying T<sub>1</sub>-weighted Dixon MR imaging and isokinetic dynamometry. Muscle quality was determined by muscle strength in relation to muscle size (contractile cross-sectional area, CSA) and to muscle quality (fat fraction). A follow-up evaluation of the patients was performed after 8-12 months. Patient evaluations also included: six-minute walking test (6MWT), forced vital capacity, manual muscle testing and SF-36 questionnaire. Fat fraction of knee flexors (0.15 vs 0.07, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and hip muscles (0.11 vs 0.07, <i>p</i> < 0.05) were higher in patients than controls. In patients, contractile CSA correlated with muscle strength (knee flexors: <i>r</i> = 0.86, knee extensors: <i>r</i> = 0.88, hip extensors: <i>r</i> = 0.83, <i>p</i> < 0.05). No correlation was found between fat fraction and muscle strength. The fat fraction of thigh muscles did not correlate with scores from the clinical tests nor did it correlate with the 6MWT. During follow-up, the contractile CSA of the knee extensors increased by 2%. No other statistically significant change was observed. Quantitative MRI reflects muscle function in patients with LOPD, but larger long-term studies are needed to evaluate its utility in detecting changes over time."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). On cellular level, there is lysosomal-bound and free accumulation of glycogen and subsequent damage of organelles and organs. The most severe affected tissues are skeletal muscles and heart. The only available treatment to date is an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa, a recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) modified with mannose-6-phosphate (M6P), which is internalized via M6P-mediated endocytosis. There is an unmet need to improve this type of therapy, especially in regard to skeletal muscle. Using different tissue culture models, we recently provided evidence that a moss-derived nonphosphorylated rhGAA (moss-GAA), carrying a glycosylation with terminal <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine residues (GnGn), might have the potential to improve targeting of skeletal muscle. Now, we present a pilot treatment of <i>Gaa</i> <sup>-/-</sup> mice with moss-GAA. We investigated general effects as well as the uptake into different organs following short-term treatment. Our results do confirm that moss-GAA reaches the target disease organs and thus might have the potential to be an alternative or complementary ERT to the existing one."

    "abstract": "Population studies point to regional and ethnicity-specific differences in genetic predisposition for some lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of the three treatable forms of lysosomal storage disorders (Gaucher disease [GD], Pompe disease [PD], and Fabry disease [FD]) in a cohort of mostly urban-dwelling individuals of African ancestry, a previously unknown genetic landscape for LSDs. Large-scale selective multistep biochemical and genetic screening was performed in patients seeking healthcare for various health concerns. Fluorimetric enzyme assays for GD, PD, and FD were performed on dried blood spots. Targeted gene sequencing was performed on samples that showed significantly lower enzyme activities (<10% of control mean) after two tiers of enzymatic screening. A total of 5287 unique samples representing a cross section of patients who visited Howard University Hospital and College of Medicine from 2015 to 2017 were included in the study. Study samples were obtained from a population where ~90% reported as African-American, ~5% Hispanic, and <5% Caucasian or other. Regarding GD, three subjects had either homozygous or heterozygous mutations in the <i>GBA</i> gene. As to PD, eight subjects were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for <i>GAA</i> mutations, including three novel mutations: (a) c.472 A > G; p.T158A, (b) c.503G > T; p.R168L, (c) c.1985del. Regarding FD, two subjects had pathogenic <i>GLA</i> mutations, and four had single nucleotide polymorphisms in the 5'UTR, previously implicated in modulating gene expression. The findings highlight a higher incidence of abnormal enzyme levels and pathogenic mutations in the target population reflecting ancestry-based specific genotype and phenotype variations."

    "abstract": "Newborn screening and therapies for Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II, acid maltase deficiency) will continue to expand in the future. It is thus important to determine whether enzyme activity or type of pathogenic genetic variant in GAA can best predict phenotypic severity, particularly the presence of infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) versus late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). We performed a retrospective analysis of 23 participants with genetically-confirmed cases of Pompe disease. The following data were collected: clinical details including presence or absence of cardiomyopathy, enzyme activity levels, and features of GAA variants including exon versus intron location and splice site versus non-splice site. Several combinations of GAA variant types for individual participants had significant associations with disease subtype, cardiomyopathy, age at diagnosis, gross motor function scale (GMFS), and stability of body weight. The presence of at least one splice site variant (c.546 G > C/p.T182 = , c.1076-22 T > G, c.2646 + 2 T > A, and the classic c.-32-13T > G variant) was associated with LOPD, while the presence of non-splice site variants on both alleles was associated with IOPD. Enzyme activity levels in isolation were not sufficient to predict disease subtype or other major clinical features. To extend the findings of prior studies, we found that multiple types of splice site variants beyond the classic c.-32-13T > G variant are often associated with a milder phenotype. Enzyme activity levels continue to have utility for supporting the diagnosis when the genetic variants are ambiguous. It is important for newly diagnosed patients with Pompe disease to have complete genetic, cardiac, and neurological evaluations."

    "abstract": "Acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) is a lysosomal glycogen-catabolizing enzyme, the deficiency of which leads to Pompe disease. Pompe disease can be treated with systemic recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), but the current standard of care exhibits poor uptake in skeletal muscles, limiting its clinical efficacy. Furthermore, it is unclear how the specific cellular processing steps of GAA after delivery to lysosomes impact its efficacy. GAA undergoes both proteolytic cleavage and glycan trimming within the endolysosomal pathway, yielding an enzyme that is more efficient in hydrolyzing its natural substrate, glycogen. Here, we developed a tool kit of modified rhGAAs that allowed us to dissect the individual contributions of glycan trimming and proteolysis on maturation-associated increases in glycogen hydrolysis using in vitro and in cellulo enzyme processing, glycopeptide analysis by MS, and high-pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection for enzyme kinetics. Chemical modifications of terminal sialic acids on N-glycans blocked sialidase activity in vitro and in cellulo, thereby preventing downstream glycan trimming without affecting proteolysis. This sialidase-resistant rhGAA displayed only partial activation after endolysosomal processing, as evidenced by reduced catalytic efficiency. We also generated enzymatically deglycosylated rhGAA that was shown to be partially activated despite not undergoing proteolytic processing. Taken together, these data suggest that an optimal rhGAA ERT would require both N-glycan and proteolytic processing to attain the most efficient enzyme for glycogen hydrolysis and treatment of Pompe disease. Future studies should examine the amenability of next-generation ERTs to both types of cellular processing."

While enzyme replacement therapy using recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) can significantly improve patient outcomes, detailed disease mechanisms and incomplete therapeutic effects require further studies. Here we report a three-dimensional primary human skeletal muscle (\"myobundle\") model of infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) that recapitulates hallmark pathological features including reduced GAA enzyme activity, elevated glycogen content and lysosome abundance, and increased sensitivity of muscle contractile function to metabolic stress. In vitro treatment of IOPD myobundles with rhGAA or adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated hGAA expression yields increased GAA activity and robust glycogen clearance, but no improvements in stress-induced functional deficits. We also apply RNA sequencing analysis to the quadriceps of untreated and AAV-treated GAA<sup>-/-</sup> mice and wild-type controls to establish a Pompe disease-specific transcriptional signature and reveal novel disease pathways. The mouse-derived signature is enriched in the transcriptomic profile of IOPD vs. healthy myobundles and partially reversed by in vitro rhGAA treatment, further confirming the utility of the human myobundle model for studies of Pompe disease and therapy."

A cooperative study of a clinical group on LOPD monitored age, sex, BMI, Gardner-Medwin-Walton scale and six minute walking test (6MWT). The only clinical parameters that were significantly associated with a Responder category were the pre-ERT walking distance (p<0.035) and the use of regular diet, exercise or both (p<0.029).

By their involvement, patients can become active participants in therapeutic developments and their observations can be utilized in determining the unmet needs and priorities in clinical research. This is especially true in rare diseases such as Pompe disease. Pompe disease is a genetically determined lysosomal storage disease featuring severe limb-girdle and axial muscle weakness accompanied with respiratory insufficiency, in which enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) now has been available for 15 years. In our present study, patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) for individuals affected with Pompe disease were developed which included questionnaires assessing general quality of life (EuroQoL, EQ-5D, SF36), daily activities and motor performance (Fatigue Severity Score, R-PAct-Scale, Rotterdam and Bartel disability scale). Data were collected for three subsequent years. The PROM questionnaires were a good complement to the physician-recorded condition assessment, and on certain aspects only PROMs provided information (e.g. fatigue in excess of patients' objective muscle weakness; deteriorating social activities despite stagnant physical abilities; significant individual differences in certain domains). The psychological effects of disease burden were also reflected in PROMs. In addition to medical examination and certain endpoints monitored by physicians, patient perspectives need to be taken into account when assessing the effectiveness of new, innovative treatments. With involvement of patients, information can be obtained that might remain uncovered during regular medical visits, although it is essential in determining the directions and priorities of clinical research. For all orphan medicines we emphasize to include patients in a compulsory manner to obtain general and disease-specific multidimensional outcome measures and use them as a quality indicator to monitor treatment effectiveness."

Newborn screening (NBS) for several LSDs has become available in recent years due to advances in technology and treatment availability. While early initiation of treatment is lifesaving for those with infantile presentations, controversy continues regarding diagnosis of milder, later-onset diseases in infancy, including creation of pre-symptomatic populations of 'patients-in-waiting', the potential for medicalization, stigmatization, and/or discrimination. In-depth interviews were conducted with 36 adults [11 with Fabry disease (FD), 8 with Gaucher disease (GD), and 17 with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD)], to determine their perspectives on NBS for their respective conditions. Thirty-four of 36 participants were in favor of NBS; both participants not in favor had GD1. Emergent themes influencing participants favorably toward NBS included earlier age of onset, a long diagnostic odyssey, less efficacious treatment, and the desire to have made different life decisions (e.g., relationships, career, or lifestyle) with the knowledge of their diagnosis. Concerns about insurance discrimination and psychological or physical burdens were associated with less favorable opinions of NBS. The ability for parents to make future reproductive decisions based their child's NBS result was considered favorably by some participants and unfavorably by others. Participants' specific condition (GD1, FD, or LOPD) contributed to these experiences differently. Participants with LOPD and FD favored NBS to initiate earlier treatment and prevent irreversible organ damage, whereas fewer patients with GD1 mentioned this benefit. Participants with LOPD had the longest diagnostic odyssey, while those with FD were more likely to report feeling misunderstood and experiencing accusations of malingering, both contributing to favorable views of NBS. Results expand prior quantitative findings by illuminating how participants' lived experiences can shape opinions about NBS. By understanding how currently affected individuals perceive the lifelong impact of a NBS result, genetic counselors can provide better anticipatory guidance to the parents of individuals diagnosed with a later-onset LSD by NBS."

As the first national survey on patients with late-onset PD (LOPD) in China, this study investigated the quality of life (QOL) of adult patients with LOPD in China and explored its contributors. Data were derived from a nation-based, cross-sectional, self-response survey on rare diseases (RDs) in early 2018. Answers from 68 adult Chinese patients with LOPD were used for data analysis. QOL was measured using the World Health Organization Quality of Life: Brief Version. Covariates included age, gender, education, employment, reliance on assistive devices, medication history, social support, and disease economic burden. Data were analyzed using linear regression in R. For adult patients with LOPD, the average scores and standard deviations (SD) of the four dimensions of QOL were physical health = 33.77 (SD = 18.28), psychological health = 43.81 (SD = 21.70), environmental health = 39.43 (SD = 16.93), and social relationship = 46.20 (SD = 19.76); the scoring for each dimension was evaluated on a scale of 0 to 100. At the significance level of p < 0.05, with increasing age, the patients experienced a significant decrease in physical health QOL (β = - 0.75) and environmental health QOL (β = - 0.79). Those who relied heavily on assistive devices had lower perceived physical health (β = - 17.8), psychological health (β = - 22.76), environmental health (β = - 17.8), and social relationships (β = - 22.12) than those who did not. A one-unit increase in the amount of social support, as a form of social interaction, led to a significant increase in physical health (β = 0.28), psychological health (β = 0.71), environmental health (β = 0.72), and social relationships (β = 0.70). Adult Chinese patients with LOPD had a lower physical health and QOL compared to their counterparts with other RDs. Being employed was found to affect the QOL of adult Chinese patients with LOPD in almost all dimensions. Encouraging adult Chinese patients with LOPD to be socially active and help them become more involved in social life might improve their QOL."

Their frequency is very low and they are considered rare diseases. Except for X-linked type IX, the different types are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In this study we reviewed the literature from 1977 to 2020 concerning GSDs, biomarkers, and metabolic imbalances in the symptoms of some GSDs. Most of the reported studies were performed with very few patients. Classification of emerging biomarkers between different types of diseases (hepatics GSDs, McArdle and PDs and other possible biomarkers) was done for better understanding. Calprotectin for hepatics GSDs and urinary glucose tetrasaccharide for Pompe disease have been approved for clinical use, and most of the markers mentioned in this review only need clinical validation, as a final step for their routine use. Most of the possible biomarkers are implied in hepatocellular adenomas, cardiomyopathies, in malfunction of skeletal muscle, in growth retardation, neutropenia, osteopenia and bowel inflammation. However, a few markers have lost interest due to a great variability of results, which is the case of biotinidase, actin alpha 2, smooth muscle, aorta and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4. This is the first review published on emerging biomarkers with a potential application to GSDs."

However, few studies have explored racial differences among highly susceptible subpopulations, such as renal transplant recipients (RTRs). Despite improvements in quality of life after transplantation, CVD remains the major cause of mortality, especially among Black recipients. This study aimed to evaluate potential racial differences in the association between long-term levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and the risk of all-cause, total CVD, and coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality among RTRs. This retrospective study consists of 93,857 non-smoking adults who received a renal transplant between 2001 and 2015. Time-dependent Cox regression was used to assess the association between annual concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and mortality risk. In the multivariable-adjusted models, a 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels found increased risk of all-cause (HR = 3.45, 95% CI: 3.08-3.78), CVD (HR = 2.38, 95% CI: 1.94-2.92), and CHD mortality (HR = 3.10, 95% CI: 1.96-4.90).

We obtained brain tissue from symptomatic mouse models of Gaucher, Fabry, Sandhoff, Niemann-Pick A (NPA), Hurler, Pompe and Niemann-Pick C (NPC) diseases and assessed for the presence of Lewy body-like pathology (proteinase K-resistant α-synuclein and tau aggregates) and neuroinflammation (microglial Iba1 and astrocytic GFAP) by immunofluorescence. All seven LSD models exhibited evidence of proteinopathy and/or inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). However, these phenotypes were divergent. Gaucher and Fabry mouse models displayed proteinase K-resistant α-synuclein and tau aggregates but no neuroinflammation; whereas Sandhoff, NPA and NPC showed marked neuroinflammation and no overt proteinopathy. Pompe disease animals uniquely displayed widespread distribution of tau aggregates accompanied by moderate microglial activation. Hurler mice also demonstrated proteinopathy and microglial activation. The present study demonstrated additional links between LSDs and pathogenic phenotypes that are hallmarks of synucleinopathies. The data suggest that lysosomal dysregulation can contribute to brain region-specific protein aggregation and induce widespread neuroinflammation in the brain. However, only a few LSD models examined exhibited phenotypes consistent with synucleinopathies. While no model can recapitulate the complexity of PD, they can enable the study of specific pathways and mechanisms contributing to disease pathophysiology. The present study provides evidence that there are existing, previously unutilized mouse models that can be employed to study pathogenic mechanisms and gain insights into potential PD subtypes, helping to determine if they are amenable to pathway-specific therapeutic interventions."

Pompe disease experts from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland discussed in two consensus meetings in 2019 and 2020 requirements for home infusion therapy, adequate execution of treatment, and the legal situation for delegating physicians. Home infusion therapy is principally feasible for patients with Pompe disease if certain preconditions are fulfilled, but the decision to implement has to be made on an individual basis. The treating physician delegates the execution of ERT <i>ad personam</i> to nursing staff but retains full legal responsibility. Home infusion therapy has to be carried out by specially trained and qualified staff. Infusion-related risks comprise mainly allergic reactions, and adequate medical treatment must be warranted. In German-speaking countries, clear rules for conducting home infusion therapy are needed to reduce psychosocial stress for patients with Pompe disease, and providing legal certainty for delegating physicians."

A lack of GAA results in an accumulation of glycogen in cardiac and skeletal muscle, as well as in motor neurons. The only FDA approved treatment for Pompe disease-an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)-increases survival of patients, but has unmasked previously unrecognized clinical manifestations of Pompe disease. These clinical signs and symptoms include tracheo-bronchomalacia, vascular aneurysms, and gastro-intestinal discomfort. Together, these previously unrecognized pathologies indicate that GAA-deficiency impacts smooth muscle in addition to skeletal and cardiac muscle. Thus, we sought to characterize smooth muscle pathology in the airway, vascular, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary in the Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model. Increased levels of glycogen were present in smooth muscle cells of the aorta, trachea, esophagus, stomach, and bladder of Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> mice, compared to wild type mice. In addition, there was an increased abundance of both lysosome membrane protein (LAMP1) and autophagosome membrane protein (LC3) indicating vacuolar accumulation in several tissues. Taken together, we show that GAA deficiency results in subsequent pathology in smooth muscle cells, which may lead to life-threatening complications if not properly treated."

Therefore, we conduct a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of the literature to evaluate the efficacy of ERT in LOPD patients considering the walking distance, respiratory function and muscle strength. Particularly, six-minute walk test (6MWT), forced vital capacity (FVC), medical research council (MRC) grading, quantitative muscle testing (QMT), and quick motor function test (QMFT) were outcomes of interest. Overall, 619 studies were identified in PubMed, EMBASE and by manual search on July 18th, 2020. After an initial assessment, 16 studies were included in the meta-analysis, containing clinical data from 589 patients with LOPD. For the 6MWT, 419 patients were analyzed. Walking distance improved on average, 32.2 m greater during the observed period (p = 0.0003), compared to the distance at the baseline. The meta-analysis did not show any improvement in FVC and only a tendency towards better muscle strength after treatment with ERT, but the difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, the available data showed that ERT has a significant beneficial efficacy in the improvement of walking distance in LOPD patients and a non-significant improvement of muscle strength. No improvement in respiratory capacity was found. More prospective and controlled trials are needed to demonstrate a clear clinical benefit of ERT."

In a prospective cohort study, we compared responses to a single bout of resistance exercise by serum markers of muscle damage and quantitative muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients (n=12) and age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n=12). Participants performed 50 maximal effort concentric knee flexions on a dynamometer. Twenty-four hours after exercise, levels of serum creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and myoglobin increased in controls. In contrast, only myoglobin level increased in patients. All elevated serum markers declined by 48 hours after exercise in both groups. Mild soreness developed at 24 hours, which disappeared at 48 hours in both groups. In controls, MRI R2* relaxation rate reduced immediately and 24 hours after exercise, indicating increased water content and muscle perfusion. In patients, exercise had no effect on R2* values. The resistance exercise did not induce acute strength deficit in patients, rather, patients increased their strength by 24 hours. When serum marker changes were normalized to the magnitude of knee flexor tension developed during exercise, lactate dehydrogenase response was greater in patients. Late-onset Pompe disease did not exacerbate exercise-induced muscle damage, however, lactate dehydrogenase may be monitored to screen high responders during high intensity resistance exercise interventions."

We disclosed a heterogeneous pattern of myopathic impairment, associated, among others, with cardiac defects, intracranial vessels abnormality, osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, obesity and adverse response to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). We identified deleterious variants in the genes involved in autophagy, immunity and bone metabolism, which contributed to the severity of the clinical symptoms observed in the LOPD patients.

Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is characterized by progressive proximal and axial muscle weakness and atrophy, causing respiratory failure. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), based on recombinant human GAA infusions, is the only available treatment; however, the efficacy of ERT is variable. Here we address the question whether proteins at variance in LOPD muscle of patients before and after 1 year of ERT, compared withhealthy age-matched subjects (CTR), reveal a specific signature. Proteins extracted from skeletal muscle of LOPD patients and CTR were analyzed by combining gel based (two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis) and label-free (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) proteomic approaches, and ingenuity pathway analysis. Upstream regulators targeting autophagy and lysosomal tethering were assessed by immunoblotting. 178 proteins were changed in abundance in LOPD patients, 47 of them recovered normal level after ERT. Defects in oxidative metabolism, muscle contractile protein regulation, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and membrane reorganization persisted. Metabolic changes, ER stress and UPR (unfolded protein response) contribute to muscle proteostasis dysregulation with active membrane remodeling (high levels of LC3BII/LC3BI) and accumulation of p62, suggesting imbalance in the autophagic process. Active lysosome biogenesis characterizes both LOPD PRE and POST, unparalleled by molecules involved in lysosome tethering (VAMP8, SNAP29, STX17, and GORASP2) and BNIP3. In conclusion this study reveals a specific signature that suggests ERT prolongation and molecular targets to ameliorate patient's outcome."

    "title": "Magnetization Transfer Ratio in Lower Limbs of Late Onset Pompe Patients Correlates With Intramuscular Fat Fraction and Muscle Function Tests.",
    "abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> Magnetization transfer (MT) imaging exploits the interaction between bulk water protons and protons contained in macromolecules to induce signal changes through a special radiofrequency pulse. MT detects muscle damage in patients with neuromuscular conditions, such as limb-girdle muscular dystrophies or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which are characterized by progressive fiber loss and replacement by fatty tissue. In Pompe disease, in which there is, in addition, an accumulation of glycogen inside the muscle fibers, MT has not been tested yet. Our aim is to estimate MT ratio (MTR) in the skeletal muscle of these patients and correlate it with intramuscular fat fraction (FF) and results of muscle function tests. <b>Methods:</b> We obtained two-point axial Dixon and Dixon-MT sequences of the right thigh on a 1.5 Teslas MRI scanner in 60 individuals, including 29 late onset Pompe disease patients, 2 patients with McArdle disease, and 29 age and sex matched healthy controls. FF and MTR were estimated. Muscle function using several muscle function tests, including quantification of muscle strength, timed test quality of life scales, conventional spirometry obtaining forced vital capacity while sitting and in the supine position, were assessed in all patients. <b>Results:</b> MTR was significantly lower in Pompe patients compared with controls (45.5 ± 8.5 vs. 51.7 ± 2.3, Student <i>T</i>-test, <i>p</i> < 0.05). There was a negative correlation between the MTR and FF muscles studied (correlation coefficient: -0.65, Spearman test: <i>p</i> < 0.05). MTR correlated with most of the muscle function test results. We analyzed if there was any difference in MTR values between Pompe patients and healthy controls in those muscles that did not have an increase in fat, a measure that could be related to the presence of glycogen in skeletal muscles, but we did not identify significant differences except in the adductor magnus muscle (48.4 ± 3.6 in Pompe vs. 51 ± 1.3 in healthy controls, Student <i>T</i>-test = 0.023). <b>Conclusions:</b> MTR is a sensitive tool to identify muscle loss in patients with Pompe disease and shows a good correlation with muscle function tests. Therefore, the MT technique can be useful in monitoring muscle degeneration in Pompe disease in clinical trials or natural history studies."

The serum creatine kinase level was not elevated, and muscle biopsy showed no specific change. Genetic analysis revealed a novel homozygous variant c.227T>C (p.Phe76Ser) in the SELENON gene, and she was suspected to have selenoprotein-related myopathy, which is reported to develop in childhood. Selenoprotein-related myopathy should be considered as a differential diagnosis in aged patients presenting with respiratory failure of unknown origin."

    "abstract": "We evaluated the clinical histories, motor and pulmonary functions, cardiac phenotypes and GAA genotypes of an Indian cohort of twenty patients with late onset Pompe disease (LOPD) in this multi-centre study. A mean age at onset of symptoms and diagnosis of 9.9 ± 9.7 years and 15.8 ± 12.1 years respectively was identified. All patients had lower extremity limb-girdle muscle weakness. Seven required ventilatory support and seven used mobility assists. Of the four who used both assists, two received ventilatory support prior to wheelchair use. Cardiac involvement was seen in eight patients with various combinations of left ventricular hypertrophy, tricuspid regurgitation, cardiomyopathy, dilated ventricles with biventricular dysfunction and aortic regurgitation. Amongst 20 biochemically diagnosed patients (low residual GAA enzyme activity) GAA genotypes of 19 patients identified homozygous variants in eight and compound heterozygous in 11: 27 missense, 3 nonsense, 2 initiator codon, 3 splice site and one deletion. Nine variants in 7 patients were novel. The leaky Caucasian, splice site LOPD variant, c.-32-13T>G mutation was absent. This first study from India provides an insight into a more severe LOPD phenotype with earlier disease onset at 9.9 years compared to 33.3 years in Caucasian patients, and cardiac involvement more than previously reported. The need for improvement in awareness and diagnosis of LOPD in India is highlighted."

    "abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> Pompe disease is a rare genetic disease produced by mutations in the GAA gene leading to progressive skeletal and respiratory muscle weakness. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is useful to identify fatty replacement in skeletal muscles of late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) patients. Previous studies have shown that replacement by fat correlates with worse results of muscle function tests. Our aim was to investigate if fat replacement of muscles involved in the ventilation process correlated with results of the spirometry and predicted respiratory muscle impairment in LOPD patients over time. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> We studied a cohort of 36 LOPD patients followed up annually in our center for a period of 4 years. We quantified muscle fat replacement using Mercuri score of the thoracic paraspinal and abdominal muscles and the pillars of the diaphragm. We correlated the combined Mercuri scores of these areas with spirometry results and the need of respiratory support. <b>Results:</b> We found a statistically significant correlation (Spearman test, <i>p</i> < 0.05; coefficient of correlation > 0.6) between forced vital capacity seated and lying and fat fraction score of all muscle groups studied. The group of patients who needed respiratory support had higher fat fraction scores than patients not requiring ventilatory support. Higher fat replacement in these areas correlated with worse progression in spirometry values over time. <b>Conclusions:</b> Fat replacement of paraspinal, abdominal, and trunk muscles correlates with results of spirometry and is able to predict worsening in respiratory muscle function tests that could lead to an emerging ventilatory dysfunction. Therefore, the identification of fat replacement in these muscle groups should lead to a closer monitorization of patients. Radiologic evaluation of diaphragm pillars in T1-weighted imaging axial sequences could also be helpful to predict respiratory insufficiency."

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a rare disease, defined as a progressive accumulation of lysosomal glycogen resulting in muscle weakness and respiratory problems. Anecdotally, individuals often have difficulties walking, yet, there is no three-dimensional data supporting these claims. We aimed to assess walking patterns in individuals with LOPD and compare with healthy individuals. Kinematic, kinetic and spatiotemporal data were compared during walking at a self-selected speed between individuals with LOPD (n = 12) and healthy controls (n = 12). Gait profile scores and movement analysis profiles were also determined to indicate gait quality. In comparison with healthy individuals, the LOPD group demonstrated greater thoracic sway (96%), hip adduction angles (56%) and pelvic range of motion (77%) and reduced hip extensor moments (36%). Greater group variance for the LOPD group were also observed. Individuals with LOPD had a slower (15%) walking speed and reduced cadence (7%). Gait profile scores were 37% greater in the LOPD group compared to the healthy group. Proximal muscular weakness associated with LOPD disease is likely to have resulted in a myopathic gait pattern, slower selected walking speeds and deviations in gait patterns. Although individuals with LOPD presented with some common characteristics, greater variability in gait patterns is likely to be a result of wide variability in phenotype spectrum observed with LOPD. This is the first study to examine walking in individuals with LOPD using instrumented gait analysis and provides an understanding of LOPD on walking function which can help orientate physiotherapy treatment for individuals with LOPD."

Pompe disease (PD), an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder due to a defect of the lysosomal enzyme α-glucosidase (GAA), presents some secondary symptoms that are related to neuromuscular transmission dysfunction, resulting in endurance and strength failure. In order to evaluate whether 3,4-DAPP could have a beneficial effect on this pathology, we took advantage of a transient zebrafish PD model that we previously generated and characterized. We investigated presynaptic and postsynaptic structures, NMJs at the electron microscopy level, and zebrafish behavior, before and after treatment with 3,4-DAPP. After drug administration, we observed an increase in the number of acetylcholine receptors an increment in the percentage of NMJs with normal structure and amelioration in embryo behavior, with recovery of typical movements that were lost in the embryo PD model. Our results revealed early NMJ impairment in Pompe zebrafish model with improvement after administration of 3,4-DAPP, suggesting its potential use as symptomatic drug in patients with Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Metabolic myopathies are a heterogenous group of muscle diseases typically characterized by exercise intolerance, myalgia and progressive muscle weakness. Effective treatments for some of these diseases are available, but while our understanding of the pathogenesis of metabolic myopathies related to glycogen storage, lipid metabolism and β-oxidation is well established, evidence linking treatments with the precise causative genetic defect is lacking. The objective of this study was to collate all published evidence on pharmacological therapies for the aforementioned metabolic myopathies and link this to the genetic mutation in a format amenable to databasing for further computational use in line with the principles of the \"treatabolome\" project. A systematic literature review was conducted to retrieve all levels of evidence examining the therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological treatments on metabolic myopathies related to glycogen storage and lipid metabolism. A key inclusion criterion was the availability of the genetic variant of the treated patients in order to link treatment outcome with the genetic defect. Of the 1,085 articles initially identified, 268 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 87 were carried over into the final data extraction. The most studied metabolic myopathies were Pompe disease (45 articles), multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency related to mutations in the ETFDH gene (15 articles) and systemic primary carnitine deficiency (8 articles). The most studied therapeutic management strategies for these diseases were enzyme replacement therapy, riboflavin, and carnitine supplementation, respectively. This systematic review provides evidence for treatments of metabolic myopathies linked with the genetic defect in a computationally accessible format suitable for databasing in the treatabolome system, which will enable clinicians to acquire evidence on appropriate therapeutic options for their patient at the time of diagnosis."

DPP-IV (also known as CD26 lymphocyte T surface antigen) is a transmembrane protein showing protease activity. This enzyme displays various functions in the organism and plays an important role in multiple processes like glucose metabolism, nociception, cell-adhesion, psychoneuroendocrine regulation, immune response and cardiovascular adaptation. In order to evaluate DPP-IV in lysosomal storage diseases (LSD), we examined its activity in plasma samples from 307 patients affected with 24 different LSDs and in 75 control persons. Our results revealed elevated DPP-IV activity especially in individuals affected with mucolipidosis II/III, alpha-mannosidosis, and mucopolysaccharidoses types III, II, and I (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In other LSDs the DPP-IV activity was still significantly increased, but to a lesser extent. In patients with Gaucher disease, ceroid lipofuscinosis type 1 (CLN1), Niemann-Pick disease type C and A, Krabbe and Pompe diseases, gangliosidosis GM2 and metachromatic leukodystrophy discreet or no changes in DPP-IV activity were observed. DPP-IV may serve as a first-tier diagnostic procedure or additional biochemical analysis in recognizing patients with some LSDs. DPP-IV may become an object of basic research for a better understanding of LSDs."

All patients presented symptoms before the age of 18 years. Each diagnosis was further confirmed by GAA enzyme activity and GAA variants. The carrier rate of GAA varients was calculated based on variants detected by whole exon sequencing among 2 395 healthy children in Guangzhou. <b>Results:</b> Among the 57 PD patients (including male 26, female 31),twenty-eight patients with infantile onset PD (IOPD) presented with progressive general muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. The mean ages of symptom onset and diagnosis were (2.5±1.4) and (5.0±3.0) months, respectively. Twenty-six cases died in the first year after birth.Twenty-three patients with late onset PD (LOPD) presented with progressive muscle weakness. Seven of them had respiratory failure at diagnosis. The mean ages of symptom onset and diagnosis were (12.0±5.0) and (17.0±7.5) years, respectively. Six children with atypical IOPD showed motor delay, muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. Their diagnosis was confirmed at 2.5-7.0 years of age. Among the 57 patients, 47 different variants were identified in the GAA gene. Three variants: c.797C>T, c.1109G>A and c.1757C>T were novel. c.1935C>A (25/114, 21.9%) and c.2238G>C (15/114, 13.2%) were the most common variants, detected in 57.1% of IOPD and 65.2% (15/23) of LOPD patients, respectively. Among the 28 IOPD patients, 26 cases (92.9%) carried at least one missense variant which indicated positive cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM). The carrier rate of pathogenic variants in GAA gene among healthy children was 24/2 395. The estimated incidence of PD in this population is about 1/40 000. The frequencies of pseudodeficiency variants c.1726G>A and c.2065G>A homozygotes were 26.3% (15/57) and 35.1% (20/57) in PD patients, which were significantly higher than those (1.7% (40/2 395) and 3.9% (94/2 395)) in healthy children (χ²=151.2, 121.9; both <i>P</i><0.01). <b>Conclusions:</b> PD presents as a spectrum, some as atypical IOPD. The c.1935C>A and c.2238G>C are common variants, correlated with IOPD and LOPD respectively. The c.796C>T and c.1082C>T are usually found in atypical IOPD. The majority of IOPD patients is predicted to be CRIM positive. The estimated incidence of PD is about 1/40 000."

We profiled the metabolites from 43 patients with low- and high-grade meningiomas. Tumour specimens were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis; 270 metabolites were identified and clustered with the AutoPipe algorithm. We observed two distinct clusters marked by alterations in glycine/serine and choline/tryptophan metabolism. Glycine/serine cluster showed significantly lower WHO grades and proliferation rates. Also progression-free survival was significantly longer in the glycine/serine cluster. Our findings suggest that alterations in glycine/serine metabolism are associated with lower proliferation and more recurrent tumours. Altered choline/tryptophan metabolism was associated with increases proliferation, and recurrence. Our results suggest that tumour malignancy can be reflected by metabolic alterations, which may support histological classifications to predict the clinical outcome of patients with meningiomas."

In recent years there have been substantial advances in supportive care and drug treatment for some LSDs, leading to improved patient survival, as seen in Gaucher, Pompe and Fabry disease and some Mucopolysaccharidoses; however, many symptoms still persist. Thus it is now even more important to improve patients' quality of life and reduce symptoms and comorbidities. One potential way of achieving this goal is through adjunct nutritional therapy, which is challenging as patients may be overweight with associated consequences, or malnourished, or underweight. Furthermore, drugs used to treat LSDs can modify the metabolic status and needs of patients. There are currently not enough data to make specific dietary recommendations for individual LSDs; however, suggestions can be made for managing clinical manifestations of the diseases, as well as treatment-associated adverse events. The metabolic and nutritional status of adult patients must be regularly assessed and individualized dietary plans may be created to cater to a patient's specific needs. Damage to the autophagic process is a common feature in LSDs that is potentially sensitive to dietary manipulation and needs to be assessed in clinical studies."

    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease (GSD) type Ia is a glycogenesis disorder with long-term complications such as hepatomegaly and renal dysfunction and is caused by congenital loss of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) expression. G6Pase is essential for the final step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, and its deficiency causes clinical hypoglycemia in the fasting state during infancy. Contrastingly, patients also show blood glucose trends and glucose intolerance similar to those in type II diabetes. Owing to the contrasting presentation of hypoglycemia with glucose intolerance, glucose control in patients remains a challenge, requiring management of both fasting hypoglycemia and post-prandial hyperglycemia. The patient was a 45-year old Asian (Japanese) woman who showed disease onset at 3 years of age, when hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly were observed, and GDS type Ia was diagnosed by the lack of G6Pase activity. Over the past 45 years, she presented hyperglycemia and dumping syndrome like symptoms (a feeling of fullness, even after eating just a small amount, abdominal cramping, nausea, sweating, flushing, or light-headedness and rapid heartbeat) at 2 hours after food intake. Her liver and kidney dysfunction also worsened over time. Treatment with exercise combined with a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor and an alpha glucosidase inhibitor alleviated her glucose intolerance and dumping syndrome-like symptoms, without increasing hypoglycemic events. This case suggests SGLT2 inhibitor as a promising candidate for treating glucose intolerance in GSD type Ia without worsening of hypoglycemia."

Pompe disease manifests with a broad spectrum of disease severity, ranging from severe infantile-onset diseases such as hypotonia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to late-onset diseases such as myopathy and respiratory compromise. The diagnosis requires demonstration of deficiency of the lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme, which can be assayed in dried blood spot or liquid blood samples, together with supportive biomarker tests, and confirmed with molecular genetic analysis. Targeted screening of at-risk populations and universal newborn screening can result in earlier diagnosis and enable earlier treatment initiation, which result in the potential improvement of clinical outcomes. Disease-modifying treatment with enzyme replacement therapy has partially altered the natural history of the disease, but more efficacious novel therapies are under evaluation including second-generation enzyme replacement therapies, molecular chaperones and gene therapy approaches. Long-term survivors with Pompe disease are now manifesting novel aspects of the disease including widespread vascular disease, smooth muscle and central nervous system involvement, and these emerging phenotypes will require additional specific therapeutic approaches."

    "title": "Standardized nursing management of enzyme replacement therapy for late-onset Pompe disease.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease or glycogen storage disease type II is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme a-glucosidase. Although enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with 2 weekly intervals following was considered an effective treatment for Pompe disease in 2006, few patients can afford to receive treatment in China because of the high cost. This study aimed to examine the standard management of enzyme replacement therapy for late-onset Pompe disease among patients over the age of 14 years from a nursing perspective in order to assess operating procedures. ERT injection fluid dispensing and infusion procedures using different methods were analyzed and compared in 3 patients with advanced Pompe disease for forming standard operation procedures. In addition, the impact of different methods on time consumption was analyzed by 1-way analysis of variance. There were significant differences in time consumption between different dispensing and infusion methods. The time of dispensing and infusing the injection fluids using the cooperative method was 15.97 minutes shorter than that using the conventional method (95% CI: 4.51-27.43, P = .012); the time using the modified method was 20.93 minutes shorter than that using the conventional method (95% CI: 9.47-32.39, P = .012); and there was no significant difference between the cooperative and modified methods (P = .431). Enzyme replacement therapy entails frequent treatment and strict nursing requirements related to the intravenous infusion process. In this context, a standard operating procedure can be used to control nursing times and labor costs effectively while ensuring a safe and effective infusion process."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is one of the few neuromuscular diseases with an approved drug therapy, which has been available since 2006. Our study aimed to determine the real-world long-term efficacy and safety of alglucosidase alfa. This multicenter retrospective study (NCT02824068) collected data from adult Pompe disease patients receiving ERT for at least 3 years. Demographics and baseline characteristics, muscle strength, lung function (FVC), walking capability (6MWT), and safety were assessed once a year. Evaluation was done on the group and individual levels, using quantitative linear models (t test) and general univariate linear models (ANOVA). Sixty-eight adult Pompe disease patients from four countries (Spain, Taiwan, Italy, Germany (STIG)) participated. The mean follow-up was 7.03 years ± 2.98. At group level in all outcome measures, an initial improvement followed by a secondary decline was observed. After 10 years, the 6MWT<sub>%pred</sub> showed the most sustained positive effect (p = 0.304). The MRC<sub>%max</sub> remained stable with a mild decline (p = 0.131), however, FVC<sub>%pred</sub> deteriorated significantly (p < 0.001) by 14.93% over 10 years of ERT. The progression rate of FVC<sub>%pred</sub> under ERT could be explained in most of the patients (83.5%) by the disease severity at baseline. Furthermore, our study shows a decline in the FVC combined with an increase in non-invasive and invasive ventilation requirements in adult Pompe disease patients over time. The STIG real-world study confirms an initial efficacy of ERT in the first years with a secondary sustained decline in multiple outcome measures. Further efforts are required to establish a more valid long-term monitoring and improved therapies."

    "title": "[The Newborn Screening Program in Italy: Comparison with Europe and other Countries.].",
    "abstract": "In Italy, since 2016, extended neonatal screening has been mandatory throughout the country for about 40 inherited metabolic diseases. The law contains indications on: the list of pathologies, the information and consent, the methods of collecting and sending samples, the newborn screening system with the elements of its organization, appointed to guarantee the entire path of newborn screening, from the level I test to taking charge of the confirmed positive newborn, the communication and recall procedures for diagnostic confirmation and patient management, training and information initiatives, as well as the criteria for allocating the allocation. Extended neonatal screening has introduced new issues in diagnosis, choice of decision levels, and metabolic disease panels to screen. Of particular relevance in order to a strong reduction of false positives, was the introduction of the second-tier test for some diseases such as leucinosis, isovaleric acidemia, methylmalonic aciduria. As regards the diseases to be screened, the Italian situation differs greatly from what happens in Europe where in the majority of member states there is no legislation / law governing this preventive pediatric service; screening is almost always on a voluntary basis (with the collection of written informed consent from both parents) and applied on the basis of health guidelines or recommendations. In the world, the most complete panel is the US one (RUSP, Recommended Uniform Screening Panel) which currently contains 62 pathologies, 35 of which are defined as core panels and 27 as secondary panels. As the name implies, it is a panel that the US Health Resources and Services Administration -HRSA- recommends that it be applied by every State and that includes new screening in some areas including Pompe disease and MPS I, creatine deficiency. In conclusion, extended neonatal screening represents a real revolution in the metabolic field offering newborns an early diagnosis combined with effective therapeutic treatments capable of radically changing the course of these serious diseases."

A total of 41 CRIM-negative IPD patients were evaluated. Among patients who were treated with ERT + ITI (n = 30), those who were invasive ventilator-free at baseline and had ≥6 months of follow-up were stratified based on age at treatment initiation: (1) early (≤4 weeks), (2) intermediate (>4 and ≤15 weeks), and (3) late (>15 weeks). A historical cohort of 11 CRIM-negative patients with IPD treated with ERT monotherapy served as an additional comparator group. Twenty patients were included; five, seven, and eight in early, intermediate, and late treatment groups, respectively. Genotypes were similar across the three groups. Early-treated patients showed significant improvements in left ventricular mass index, motor and pulmonary outcomes, as well as biomarkers creatine kinase and urinary glucose tetrasaccharide, compared with those treated later. Our preliminary data suggest that early treatment with ERT + ITI can transform the long-term CRIM-negative IPD phenotype, which represents the most severe end of the Pompe disease spectrum."

    "abstract": "Since the introduction of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa, there has been increased survival in patients with Pompe disease. It is essential to characterize and quantify the burden of disease in these patients. Here, we report a measure of muscle fat infiltration in children with infantile and pediatric late-onset Pompe disease (IPD and LOPD, respectively) to better understand the extent of muscle involvement. Eleven pediatric patients with Pompe disease (five IPD, six LOPD), ages 7-17 years, received whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WBMRI), muscle strength testing using the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale, functional assessment using gait, stairs, gowers, chair (GSGC), and urine glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc<sub>4</sub>) testing. The intramuscular fat seen on WBMRI was quantified using proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and correlated to appropriate muscle strength and functional tests, and urine Glc<sub>4</sub>. Patients with IPD, although younger, had higher mean PDFF values than LOPD patients (11.61% vs 8.52%). Significant correlation existed between PDFF and the GSGC assessment (<i>r</i> = .9273, <i>P</i> = .0003). Moderate correlation existed between PDFF and mMRC (<i>r</i> = -.667, <i>P</i> = .0831), and PDFF and urine Glc<sub>4</sub> (<i>r</i> = .6121, <i>P</i> = .0667). Anterior tibialis was in the top quartile of muscle involvement for patients with LOPD. In the past, physical therapy assessments alone have been used to track disease progression. Here, we show the clinical utility of WBMRI in quantifying muscle involvement in children with Pompe disease, especially regarding the novel involvement of anterior tibialis in children with LOPD, to better assess baseline muscle burden and mapping disease progression in children treated with ERT."

    "abstract": "Late-onset myopathies are not well-defined since there is no clear definition of 'late onset'. For practical reasons we decided to use the age of 40 years as a cut-off. There are diseases which only manifest as late onset myopathy (inclusion body myositis, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy and axial myopathy). In addition, there are diseases with a wide range of onset including 'late onset' muscle weakness. Well-known and rather frequently occurring examples are Becker muscular dystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, Pompe disease, myotonic dystrophy type 2, and anoctamin-5-related distal myopathy. The above-mentioned diseases will be discussed in detail including clinical presentation - which can sometimes lead someone astray - and diagnostic tools based on real cases taken from the author's practice. Where appropriate a differential diagnosis is provided. Next generation sequencing (NGS) may speed up the diagnostic process in hereditary myopathies, but still there are diseases, e.g. with expansion repeats, deletions, etc, in which NGS is as yet not very helpful."

    "abstract": "Late onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a slowly progressive metabolic myopathy with variable clinical severity. The advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has modified the natural course of the disease, though the treatment effect on adult patients is modest compared to infants with the classic form. This study aims to describe the long-term clinical outcome of the Greek LOPD cohort, as assessed by 6 min walk test, muscle strength using MRC grading scale and spirometry. ERT efficacy was estimated using statistical methodology that is novel in the context of Pompe disease, which at the same time is well-suited to longitudinal studies with small samples and missing data (local non-linear regression analysis). Improvement over baseline was significant at 1 year for motor performance and muscle strength (p < 0.05), and at 2 years for FVC-U and FVC-S (p < 0.05). A subgroup analysis showed that the onset of the disease before adulthood (18 years), a male gender, and a latency of more than 2 years between the onset of symptoms and ERT administration are unfavorable prognostic factors. Conclusively, this study presents longitudinal data from the Greek LOPD cohort supporting previous observations, that therapeutic delay is related to worse prognosis and treatment effects may decline after several years of ERT."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder due to deficient activity of the acid alpha glucosidase enzyme (GAA). As a consequence of the enzymatic defect, undigested glycogen accumulates within lysosomes. Most patients affected by the late-onset (LO) phenotype carry in at least one allele the c.-32-13T>G variant, which leads to exon 2 exclusion from the pre-mRNA. These patients display a variable and suboptimal response to enzyme replacement therapy. To identify novel therapeutic approaches, we developed a fluorescent GAA exon 2 splicing assay and screened a library of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compounds. This led to the identification of several drugs able to restore normal splicing. Among these, we further validated the effects of the iron chelator deferoxamine (Defe) in c.-32-13T>G fibroblasts. Defe treatment resulted in a 2-fold increase of GAA exon 2 inclusion and a 40% increase in enzymatic activity. Preliminary results suggest that this effect is mediated by the regulation of iron availability, at least partially. RNA-seq experiments also showed that Defe might shift the balance of splicing factor levels toward a profile promoting GAA exon 2 inclusion. This work provides the basis for drug repurposing and development of new chemically modified molecules aimed at improving the clinical outcome in LO-PD patients."

    "abstract": "Oligosaccharidoses are storage disorders due to enzymatic defects involved in the breakdown of the oligosaccharidic component of glycosylated proteins. The defect cause the accumulation of oligosaccharides (OS) and, depending on the lacking enzyme, results in characteristic profiles which are helpful for the diagnosis. We developed a new tandem mass spectrometry method for the screening of urinary OS which was applied to identify a large panel of storage disorders. The method was set-up in urine and dried urine spots (DUS). Samples were analysed, without derivatization and using maltoheptaose as internal standard, by UHPLC-MS/MS with MRM acquisition of target OS transitions, including Glc4, the biomarker of Pompe disease. The chromatographic run was < 30 min. Samples from patients with known storage disorders were used for clinical validation. The method allowed to confirm the diagnosis of oligosaccharidoses (sialidosis, α-/β-mannosidosis, fucosidosis, aspartylglucosaminuria) and of GM1 and GM2 (Sandhoff type) gangliosidosis, by detecting specific OS profiles. In other storage disorders (mucolipidosis II and III, mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB) the analyisis revealed abnormal OS excretion with non-specific profiles. Besides Pompe disease, the tetrasaccharide Glc4 was increased also in disorders of autophagy (Vici syndrome, Yunis-Varon syndrome, and Danon disease) presenting cardiomuscular involvement with glycogen storage. Overall, results showed a clear separation between patients and controls, both in urine and in DUS. This new UHPLC/MS-MS method, which is suitable for rapid and easy screening of OS in urine and DUS, expands the detection of storage disorders from oligosaccharidoses to other diseases, including the novel category of inherited disorders of autophagy."

    "title": "Chest MRI to diagnose early diaphragmatic weakness in Pompe disease.",
    "abstract": "In Pompe disease, an inherited metabolic muscle disorder, severe diaphragmatic weakness often occurs. Enzyme replacement treatment is relatively ineffective for respiratory function, possibly because of irreversible damage to the diaphragm early in the disease course. Mildly impaired diaphragmatic function may not be recognized by spirometry, which is commonly used to study respiratory function. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to identify early signs of diaphragmatic weakness in Pompe patients using chest MRI. Pompe patients covering the spectrum of disease severity, and sex and age matched healthy controls were prospectively included and studied using spirometry-controlled sagittal MR images of both mid-hemidiaphragms during forced inspiration. The motions of the diaphragm and thoracic wall were evaluated by measuring thoracic cranial-caudal and anterior-posterior distance ratios between inspiration and expiration. The diaphragm shape was evaluated by measuring the height of the diaphragm curvature. We used multiple linear regression analysis to compare different groups. We included 22 Pompe patients with decreased spirometry results (forced vital capacity in supine position < 80% predicted); 13 Pompe patients with normal spirometry results (forced vital capacity in supine position ≥ 80% predicted) and 18 healthy controls. The mean cranial-caudal ratio was only 1.32 in patients with decreased spirometry results, 1.60 in patients with normal spirometry results and 1.72 in healthy controls (p < 0.001). Anterior-posterior ratios showed no significant differences. The mean height ratios of the diaphragm curvature were 1.41 in patients with decreased spirometry results, 1.08 in patients with normal spirometry results and 0.82 in healthy controls (p = 0.001), indicating an increased curvature of the diaphragm during inspiration in Pompe patients. Even in early-stage Pompe disease, when spirometry results are still within normal range, the motion of the diaphragm is already reduced and the shape is more curved during inspiration. MRI can be used to detect early signs of diaphragmatic weakness in patients with Pompe disease, which might help to select patients for early intervention to prevent possible irreversible damage to the diaphragm."

Glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII) caused by lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency is the best-characterised AVM. This study aimed to investigate the mutational profiling of seven neuromuscular outpatients sharing clinical, myopathological and biochemical findings with AVMs. We applied a diagnostic protocol, recently published by our research group for suspected late-onset GSDII (LO-GSDII), including counting PAS-positive lymphocytes on blood smears, dried blood spot (DBS)-GAA, muscle biopsy histological and immunofluorescence studies, GAA activity assay and expression studies on muscle homogenate, GAA sequencing, GAA multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and whole exome sequencing (WES). The patients had a limb girdle-like muscular pattern with persistent hyperCKaemia; vacuolated PAS-positive lymphocytes, glycogen accumulation and impaired autophagy at muscle biopsy. Decreased GAA activity was also measured. While GAA sequencing identified no pathogenic mutations, WES approach allowed us to identify for each patient an unexpected mutational pattern in genes cooperating in lysosomal-autophagic machinery, some of which have never been linked to human diseases. Our data suggest that reduced GAA activity may occur in any condition of impaired autophagy and that WES approach is advisable in all genetically undefined cases of autophagic myopathy. Therefore, deficiency of GAA activity and PAS-positive lymphocytes should be considered as AVM markers together with LC3/p62-positive autophagic vacuoles."

While being a hallmark in classic infantile Pompe disease, cardiac involvement in non-classic Pompe disease seems rare. Vascular abnormalities, such as aneurysms and arterial dolichoectasia, likely caused by glycogen accumulation in arterial walls, have been reported in non-classic Pompe patients. With this first systematic review on cardiovascular disease in non-classic Pompe disease, we aim to gain insight in the prevalence and etiology of cardiovascular disease in these patients. Forty-eight studies (eight case-control studies, 15 cohort studies and 25 case reports/series) were included. Fourteen studies reported cardiac findings, 25 studies described vascular findings, and nine studies reported both cardiac and vascular findings. Severe cardiac involvement in non-classic Pompe disease patients has rarely been reported, particularly in adult-onset patients carrying the common IVS1 mutation. There are indications that intracranial dolichoectasia and aneurysms are more prevalent in non-classic Pompe patients compared to the general population. To further investigate the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in non-classic Pompe patients, larger case-control studies that also study established cardiovascular risk factors should be conducted."

Due to the low prevalence and therefore limited disease awareness as well as the fact that LSD patients present with unspecific symptoms the final diagnosis is often made after a long delay. The aim of this German-wide survey was to characterize the period between onset of symptoms and final diagnosis regarding e.g. self-perceived health, symptom burden and false diagnoses for patients with selected LSDs (Fabry disease (FD), Gaucher disease (GD) and Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II). The study was conducted as a telephone based cross-sectional survey. All patients living in Germany with a confirmed diagnosis of FD, GD or MPS II were eligible to participate. The questionnaire was provided in advance in order to enable the participants to prepare for the interview. Only descriptive analyses were carried out. Single analyses were not carried out for all three patient groups due low case numbers. Of the overall population, 39 patients have been diagnosed with FD, 19 with GD and 11 with MPS II with the majority of patients being index patients. The majority of FD patients reported their current health status as \"satisfactory\" or better (79.5%). Self-perceived health status was observed to be at least stable or improving for the majority of FD patients compared to the year prior to diagnosis. The most frequently reported symptoms for patients with FD were paraesthesias (51.3%), whereas patients with GD reported a tendency for bleeding, blue spots or coagulation disorder (63.2%) as well as hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly (63.2%) as the most commonly appearing symptoms. The number of patients reporting misdiagnoses was n = 5 (13.5%) for patients with FD and n = 5 (27.8%) for patients with GD. The median duration of the diagnostic delay was 21.0 years for FD, 20.0 years for GD and 2.0 years for MPS II. This study showed that self-perceived status of health for patients might improve once the final correct diagnoses has been made and specific treatment was available. Furthermore, it was observed that diagnostic delay is still high in Germany for a relevant proportion of affected patients. Further challenges in the future will still be to increase awareness for these diseases across the entire healthcare sector to minimize the diagnostic delay."

Acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency leads to abnormal glycogen accumulation in patient cells. Given the increasing evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in classic infantile Pompe disease, we used neural stem cells, differentiated from patient induced pluripotent stem cells, to model the neuronal phenotype of Pompe disease. These Pompe neural stem cells exhibited disease-related phenotypes including glycogen accumulation, increased lysosomal staining, and secondary lipid buildup. These morphological phenotypes in patient neural stem cells provided a tool for drug efficacy evaluation. Two potential therapeutic agents, hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and δ-tocopherol, were tested along with recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) in this cell-based Pompe model. Treatment with rhGAA reduced LysoTracker staining in Pompe neural stem cells, indicating reduced lysosome size. Additionally, treatment of diseased neural stem cells with the combination of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and δ-tocopherol significantly reduced the disease phenotypes. These results demonstrated patient-derived Pompe neural stem cells could be used as a model to study disease pathogenesis, to evaluate drug efficacy, and to screen compounds for drug discovery in the context of correcting CNS defects."

It is generally classified based on the age of onset as infantile (IOPD) presenting during the first year of life, and late onset (LOPD) when it presents afterwards. In our study, a cohort of 13,627 samples were tested between January 2017 and December 2018 for acid-α-glucosidase (GAA, EC 3.2.1.20) deficiency either by fluorometry or tandem mass spectrometry (MS). Testing was performed for patients who displayed conditions of unknown etiology, e.g., CK elevations or cardiomyopathy, in the case of infantile patients. On average 8% of samples showed activity below the reference range and were further assessed by another enzyme activity measurement or molecular genetic analysis. Pre-analytical conditions, like proper drying, greatly affect enzyme activity, and should be assessed with measurement of reference enzyme(s). In conclusion, at-risk testing can provide a good first step for the future introduction of newborn screening for Pompe disease. It yields immediate benefits for the patients regarding the availability and timeliness of the diagnosis. In addition, the laboratory can introduce the required methodology and gain insights in the evaluation of results in a lower throughput environment. Finally, awareness of such a rare condition is increased tremendously among local physicians which can aid in the introduction newborn screening."

While therapeutic expression of the episomal rAAV-G6PC clinical vector is stable in mice, the long-term durability of expression in humans is currently being established. Here we evaluated CRISPR/Cas9-based in vivo genome editing technology to correct a prevalent pathogenic human variant, G6PC-p.R83C. We have generated a homozygous G6pc-R83C mouse strain and shown that the G6pc-R83C mice manifest impaired glucose homeostasis and frequent hypoglycemic seizures, mimicking the pathophysiology of GSD-Ia patients. We then used a CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing system to treat newborn G6pc-R83C mice and showed that the treated mice grew normally to age 16 weeks without hypoglycemia seizures. The treated G6pc-R83C mice, expressing ≥ 3% of normal hepatic G6Pase-α activity, maintained glucose homeostasis, displayed normalized blood metabolites, and could sustain 24 h of fasting. Taken together, we have developed a second-generation therapy in which in vivo correction of a pathogenic G6PC-p.R83C variant in its native genetic locus could lead to potentially permanent, durable, long-term correction of the GSD-Ia phenotype."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), which number over fifty, are monogenically inherited and caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins that are involved in lysosomal function. Lack of the functional protein results in storage of a distinctive material within the lysosomes, which for years was thought to determine the pathophysiology of the disorder. However, our current view posits that the primary storage material disrupts the normal role of the lysosome in the autophagic pathway resulting in the secondary storage of autophagic debris. It is this \"collateral damage\" which is common to the LSDs but nonetheless intricately nuanced in each. We have selected five LSDs resulting from defective proteins that govern widely different lysosomal functions including glycogen degradation (Pompe), lysosomal transport (Cystinosis), lysosomal trafficking (Danon), glycolipid degradation (Gaucher) and an unidentified function (Batten) and argue that despite the disparate functions, these proteins, when mutant, all impair the autophagic process uniquely."

Clinical symptoms include skeletal myopathy, respiratory failure, and cardiac hypertrophy. We studied plasma proteomic and lipidomic profiles in 12 PD patients compared to age-matched controls. The proteomic profiles were analyzed by nLC-MS/MS SWATH method. Wide-targeted lipidomic analysis was performed by LC-IMS/MS, allowing to quantify >1100 lipid species, spanning 13 classes. Significant differences were found for 16 proteins, with four showing the most relevant changes (GPLD1, PON1, LDHB, PKM). Lipidomic analysis showed elevated levels of three phosphatidylcholines and of the free fatty acid 22:4, and reduced levels of six lysophosphatidylcholines. Up-regulated glycolytic enzymes (LDHB and PKM) are involved in autophagy and glycogen metabolism, while down-regulated PON1 and GPLD1 combined with lipidomic data indicate an abnormal phospholipid metabolism. Reduced GPLD1 and dysregulation of lipids with acyl-chains characteristic of GPI-anchor structure suggest the potential involvement of GPI-anchor system in PD. Results of proteomic analysis displayed the involvement of multiple cellular functions affecting inflammatory, immune and antioxidant responses, autophagy, Ca<sup>2+</sup> -homeostasis, and cell adhesion. The combined multi-omic approach revealed new biosignatures in PD, providing novel insights in disease pathophysiology with potential future clinical application."

    "title": "Benign or not benign? Deep phenotyping of liver Glycogen Storage Disease IX.",
    "abstract": "Liver Glycogen Storage Disease Type IX (GSD IX) is one of the most common forms of GSD. It is caused by a deficiency in enzyme phosphorylase kinase (PhK), a complex, hetero-tetrameric enzyme comprised of four subunits - α, β, γ, and δ - each with tissue specific isoforms encoded by different genes. Until the recent availability of gene panels and exome sequencing, the diagnosis of liver GSD IX did not allow for differentiation of these subtypes. This study presents the first comprehensive literature review for liver GSD IX subtypes - GSD IX α2, β, and γ2. We aim to better characterize the natural history of liver GSD IX and further investigate if there are subtype-specific differences in clinical presentation. A comprehensive literature review was performed with the help of a medical librarian at Duke University Medical Center to gather all published patients of liver GSD IX. Our refined search yielded 74 articles total. Available patient data were compiled into an excel spreadsheet. Data were analyzed via descriptive statistics. The number of patients with specific symptoms were individually summed and reported as a percentage of the total number of patients for which data were available or were averaged and reported as a mean numerical value. Published pathology reports were scored using the International Association of the Study of the Liver Scale. There were a total of 183 GSD IX α2 patients, 17 GSD IX β patients, and 30 GSD IX γ2 patients. Average age at diagnosis was 4 years for GSD IX α2 patients, 2.34 years for GSD IX β patients, and 1.81 years for GSD IX γ2 patients. Hepatomegaly was reported in 164/176 (93.2%) of GSD IX α2 patients, 16/17 (94.1%) of GSD IX β patients, and 30/30 (100%) of GSD IX γ2 patients. Fasting hypoglycemia was reported in 53/121 (43.8%) of GSD IX α2 patients, 8/16 (50%) of GSD IX β patients, and 18/19 (94.7%) of GSD IX γ2 patients. Liver biopsy pathology reports were available and interpreted for 46 GSD IX α2 patients, 3 GSD IX β patients, and 24 GSD IX γ2 patients. 22/46 (47.8%) GSD IX α2 patients, 1/3 (33.3%) GSD IX β patients, and 23/24 (95.8%) GSD IX γ2 patients with available pathology reports documented either some degree of fibrosis or cirrhosis. Our comprehensive review demonstrates quantitatively that the clinical presentation of GSD IX γ2 patients is more severe than that of GSD IX α2 or β patients. However, our study also shows the existence of a severe phenotype in GSD IX α2, evidenced by early onset liver pathology in conjunction with clinical symptoms. There is need for a more robust natural history study to better understand the variability in liver pathophysiology within liver GSD IX; in addition, further study of mutations and gene mapping could bring a better understanding of the relationship between genotype and clinical presentation."

    "title": "Nanotechnology-based approaches for treating lysosomal storage disorders, a focus on Fabry disease.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of rare diseases in which the defect of a lysosomal protein results in a pathogenic accumulation of nonmetabolized products within the cells. The main treatment for LSDs is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), consisting in the exogenous administration a recombinant protein to replace the defective one. Although several diseases such as Gaucher, Fabry, and Pompe are treated following this approach, ERT is limited to LSDs without severe neuronal affectation because recombinant enzymes do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, ERT shows additional drawbacks, including enzyme low half-life, poor bioavailability, and immunogenic responses. In this scenario, nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems (DDS) have been proposed as solution to overcome these limitations and improve the efficacy of ERT. The present review summarizes distinct approaches followed by our group and collaborators on the use of DDS for restoring lysosomal enzymes in disease-affected cells. During the last decade, we have been exploring different synthetic nanoparticles, from electrolytic complexes, to liposomes and aggresomes, for the delivery of α-galactosidase A (GLA) enzyme. Studies were mainly conducted on Fabry disease models, but results can be also extrapolated to other LSDs, as well as to other diseases treated with alternative therapeutic proteins. The advantages and disadvantages of different DDS, the difficulties from working with very labile and highly glycosylated enzymes and the relevance of using appropriate targeting moieties is thoroughly discussed. Finally, the use of natural DDS, namely extracellular vesicles (EVs) is also introduced. This article is categorized under: Therapeutic Approaches and Drug Discovery > Nanomedicine for Neurological Disease Therapeutic Approaches and Drug Discovery > Nanomedicine for Cardiovascular Disease Therapeutic Approaches and Drug Discovery > Emerging Technologies."

Herein, we aimed to investigate the etiology of muscle disease in 24 consecutive Greek patients with myopathy suspected to be genetic in origin, based on clinical presentation and laboratory and electrophysiological findings and absence of known acquired causes of myopathy. Of these, 16 patients (8 females, median 24 years-old, range 7 to 67 years-old) were diagnosed by Whole Exome Sequencing as suffering from a specific type of inherited muscle disorder. Specifically, we have identified causative variants in 6 limb-girdle muscular dystrophy genes (6 patients; <i>ANO5</i>, <i>CAPN3</i>, <i>DYSF</i>, <i>ISPD</i>, <i>LAMA2</i>, <i>SGCA</i>), 3 metabolic myopathy genes (4 patients; <i>CPT2</i>, <i>ETFDH</i>, <i>GAA</i>), 1 congenital myotonia gene (1 patient; <i>CLCN1</i>), 1 mitochondrial myopathy gene (1 patient; <i>MT-TE</i>) and 3 other myopathy-associated genes (4 patients; <i>CAV3</i>, <i>LMNA</i>, <i>MYOT</i>). In 6 additional family members affected by myopathy, we reached genetic diagnosis following identification of a causative variant in an index patient. In our patients, genetic diagnosis ended a lengthy diagnostic process and, in the case of Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency and Pompe's disease, it enabled specific treatment to be initiated. These results further expand the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of inherited myopathies."

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) remains challenging due to wide clinical, biochemical and molecular heterogeneity. The study applies a combined biochemical and genetic approach to diagnose symptomatic Indian patients of Pompe, Fabry, Gaucher and Hurler disease to generate a comprehensive dataset of pathogenic variants for these disorders. Symptomatic patients were biochemically diagnosed by fluorometric methods and molecular confirmation was carried out by gene sequencing. Genetic variants were analyzed according to the ACMG/AMP 2015 variant interpretation guidelines. Amongst the 2181 suspected patients, 285 (13%) were biochemically diagnosed. Of these, 22.5% (64/285) diagnosed with Pompe disease harboured c.1933G>A, c.1A>G, c.1927G>A and c.2783G>C as common and 10 novel pathogenic variants while 7.4% (21/285) patients diagnosed with Fabry disease carried c.851T>C, c.902G>A, c.905A>C and c.1212_1234del as frequent disease-causing variants along with 7 novel pathogenic variants. As many as 48.4% (138/285) patients were diagnosed with Gaucher disease and had c.1448T>C as the most common pathogenic variant followed by c.1342G>C and c.754T>C with 7 previously unreported disease-causing variants and in the 21.7% (62/285) diagnosed cases of Hurler disease, c.1469T>C, c.754delC c.568_581del and c.1898C>T were identified as the most common causative variants along with 21 novel pathogenic variants. This comprehensive data set of disease-causing frequent and novel pathogenic variants reported for the first time in such a large patient cohort for each of these four LSDs from the Indian sub-continent, along with their biochemical and clinical spectrum will contribute towards providing definitive diagnosis and treatment, identifying carrier status, as well as in counselling prenatal cases to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with these disorders."

    "abstract": "Compound heterozygous recessive or polygenic diseases could be addressed through gene correction of multiple alleles. However, targeting of multiple alleles using genome editors could lead to mixed genotypes and adverse events that amplify during tissue morphogenesis. Here we demonstrate that Cas9-ribonucleoprotein-based genome editors can correct two distinct mutant alleles within a single human cell precisely. Gene-corrected cells in an induced pluripotent stem cell model of Pompe disease expressed the corrected transcript from both corrected alleles, leading to enzymatic cross-correction of diseased cells. Using a quantitative in silico model for the in vivo delivery of genome editors into the developing human infant liver, we identify progenitor targeting, delivery efficiencies, and suppression of imprecise editing outcomes at the on-target site as key design parameters that control the efficacy of various therapeutic strategies. This work establishes that precise gene editing to correct multiple distinct gene variants could be highly efficacious if designed appropriately."

We evaluated factors associated with change in emphysema and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) in participants with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This retrospective study included individuals participating in the COPD Genetic Epidemiology study who completed the 5-year follow-up, including inspiratory and expiratory computed tomography (CT) and spirometry. All paired CT scans were analyzed using micro-mapping, which classifies individual voxels as emphysema or functional small airway disease (fSAD). Presence and progression of emphysema and FEV<sub>1</sub> were determined based on comparison to nonsmoker values. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify clinical parameters associated with disease progression. A total of 3088 participants were included with a mean ± SD age of 60.7±8.9 years, including 72 nonsmokers. In all Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages, the presence of emphysema at baseline was associated with emphysema progression (odds ratio [OR]: GOLD 0: 4.32; preserved ratio-impaired spirometry [PRISm]; 5.73; GOLD 1: 5.16; GOLD 2: 5.69; GOLD 3/4: 5.55; all <i>p</i> ≤0.01). If there was no emphysema at baseline, the amount of fSAD at baseline was associated with emphysema progression (OR for 1% increase: GOLD 0: 1.06; PRISm: 1.20; GOLD 1: 1.7; GOLD 3/4: 1.08; all <i>p</i> ≤ 0.03).In 1735 participants without spirometric COPD, progression in emphysema occurred in 105 (6.1%) participants and only 21 (1.2%) had progression in both emphysema and FEV<sub>1</sub>. The presence of emphysema is an important predictor of emphysema progression. In patients without emphysema, fSAD is associated with the development of emphysema.

    "abstract": "To estimate health and economic outcomes associated with newborn screening (NBS) for infantile-onset Pompe disease in the United States. A decision analytic microsimulation model simulated health and economic outcomes of a birth cohort of 4 million children in the United States. Universal NBS and treatment was compared with clinical identification and treatment of infantile-onset Pompe disease. Main outcomes were projected cases identified, costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) over the life course. Universal NBS for Pompe disease and confirmatory testing was estimated to cost an additional $26 million annually. Additional medication costs associated with earlier treatment initiation were $181 million; however, $8 million in medical care costs for other services were averted due to delayed disease progression. Infants with screened and treated infantile-onset Pompe disease experienced an average lifetime increase of 11.66 QALYs compared with clinical detection. The ICER was $379,000/QALY from a societal perspective and $408,000/QALY from the health-care perspective. Results were sensitive to the cost of enzyme replacement therapy. Newborn screening for Pompe disease results in substantial health gains for individuals with infantile-onset Pompe disease, but with additional costs."

    "abstract": "In studies on the degradation of glycogen by rhGAA, a glycosylated protein core material was found which consists of about 5-6% of the total starting glycogen. There was an additional 25% of the glycogen unaccounted for based on glucose released. After incubation of glycogen with rhGAA until no more glucose was released, no other carbohydrate was detected on HPAEC-PAD. Several oligosaccharides are then detectable if the medium is first boiled in 0.1 N HCl or incubated with trypsin. It is present in serum either in an HCl extract or in a trypsin digest. The characteristics of the in vivo serum material are identical to the material in the in vitro incubation medium. One oligosaccharide cannot be further degraded by rhGAA, from the incubation medium as well as from serum co-elute on HPAEC-PAD. Several masked oligosaccharides in serum contain <i>m</i>-inositol, <i>e</i>-inositol, and sorbitol as the major carbohydrates. The presence of this glycosylated protein in serum is a fraction of glycogen that is degraded outside the lysosome and the cell. The glycosylated protein in the serum is not present in the serum of Pompe mice not on ERT, but it is present in the serum of Pompe disease patients who are on ERT, so it is a biomarker of GAA degradation of lysosomal glycogen."

Our goal was to determine for the first time the clinical- and gene-variant spectrum of genetic myopathies in a substantial cohort study of the Indian subcontinent. <b>Methods:</b> In this cohort study, we performed the first large clinical exome sequencing (ES) study with phenotype correlation on 207 clinically well-characterized inherited myopathy-suspected patients from the Indian subcontinent with diverse ethnicities. <b>Results:</b> Clinical-correlation driven definitive molecular diagnosis was established in 49% (101 cases; 95% CI, 42-56%) of patients with the major contributing pathogenicity in either of three genes, <i>GNE</i> (28%; GNE-myopathy), <i>DYSF</i> (25%; Dysferlinopathy), and <i>CAPN3</i> (19%; Calpainopathy). We identified 65 variant alleles comprising 37 unique variants in these three major genes. Seventy-eight percent of the <i>DYSF</i> patients were homozygous for the detected pathogenic variant, suggesting the need for carrier-testing for autosomal-recessive disorders like Dysferlinopathy that are common in India. We describe the observed clinical spectrum of myopathies including uncommon and rare subtypes in India: Sarcoglycanopathies (<i>SGCA/B/D/G</i>), Collagenopathy (<i>COL6A1/2/3</i>), Anoctaminopathy (<i>ANO5</i>), telethoninopathy (<i>TCAP</i>), Pompe-disease (<i>GAA</i>), Myoadenylate-deaminase-deficiency-myopathy (<i>AMPD1</i>), myotilinopathy (<i>MYOT</i>), laminopathy (<i>LMNA</i>), HSP40-proteinopathy (<i>DNAJB6</i>), Emery-Dreifuss-muscular-dystrophy (<i>EMD</i>), Filaminopathy (<i>FLNC</i>), TRIM32-proteinopathy (<i>TRIM32</i>), POMT1-proteinopathy (<i>POMT1</i>), and Merosin-deficiency-congenital-muscular-dystrophy-type-1 (<i>LAMA2</i>). Thirteen patients harbored pathogenic variants in >1 gene and had unusual clinical features suggesting a possible role of synergistic-heterozygosity/digenic-contribution to disease presentation and progression. <b>Conclusions:</b> Application of clinically correlated ES to myopathy diagnosis has improved our understanding of the clinical and genetic spectrum of different subtypes and their overlaps in Indian patients. This, in turn, will enhance the global gene-variant-disease databases by including data from developing countries/continents for more efficient clinically driven molecular diagnostics."

The goal of this study is to evaluate practices of state health departments in regards to screening methods and follow-up data collected. We conducted online surveys and phone questionnaires to determine each U.S. state's practices for screening and follow-up of positive newborn screens. We report the first snapshot of practices for NBS for the LSDs included on the RUSP. All 50 U.S. states responded to our survey. The majority of U.S. states are not currently screening for Pompe disease and MPSI as of March 2020, but this number will increase to 38 states in the coming 1-3 years based on survey results.

Results for all enzymes are integrated using the multivariate pattern recognition software called Collaborative Laboratory Integrated Reports (CLIR) to assess the risk for disease. Results after one year of screening using the new algorithm are compared to the prior year of screening without consideration of the additional enzymes and use of CLIR.

Facial muscle weakness and altered craniofacial growth are very common in Pompe disease children. In this paper we describe the orofacial features in two children affected by GSDII and illustrate a multidisciplinary approach that involved enzyme replace therapy, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and pediatric dentistry with 5-year follow-up. Two Infantile Pompe Disease children were examined by a pediatric dentist at the age of 4 and 5 years old respectively. The orofacial examination showed typical facies with similar features: hypotonia of facial and tongue muscles, lip incompetence, narrow palate with reduction in transversal dimension of the upper dental arch, macroglossia, low position of the tip of the tongue, concave profile, Class III malocclusion with hypoplasia of maxillary-malar area and mandibular prognathism. Myofunctional therapy and orthodontic treatment consisted in oral muscle exercises associated to intraoral and extraoral orthodontic devices. NIV facial mask was substituted with a nasal pillow mask in order to avoid external pressure on the mid-face which negatively influences craniofacial growth. This paper evidences that the pediatric dentist plays an important role in craniofacial growth control, oral function rehabilitation and, therefore, in the improvement of the quality of life of Pompe children and their families. Therefore an early pediatric dental evalutation should be included in the multidisciplinary management of children suffering from Infantile Pompe Disease."

Since each neuromuscular disease presents a specific pattern of muscle involvement, the recommended analysis is assumed to be the muscle-by-muscle approach. We, therefore, performed a comparative analysis of different segmentation approaches, including global muscle segmentation, to determine the best strategy for evaluating disease progression. In 102 patients (21 immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy/IMNM, 21 inclusion body myositis/IBM, 10 GNE myopathy/GNEM, 19 Duchenne muscular dystrophy/DMD, 12 dysferlinopathy/DYSF, 7 limb-girdle muscular dystrophy/LGMD2I, 7 Pompe disease, 5 spinal muscular atrophy/SMA), two MRI scans were obtained at a 1-year interval in thighs and lower legs. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn in individual muscles, muscle groups, and the global muscle segment. Standardized response means (SRMs) were determined to assess sensitivity to change in fat fraction (ΔFat%) in individual muscles, muscle groups, weighted combinations of muscles and muscle groups, and in the global muscle segment. Global muscle segmentation gave high SRMs for ΔFat% in thigh and lower leg for IMNM, DYSF, LGMD2I, DMD, SMA, and Pompe disease, and only in lower leg for GNEM and thigh for IBM. Global muscle segment Fat% showed to be sensitive to change in most investigated neuromuscular disorders. As compared to individual muscle drawing, it is a faster and an easier approach to assess disease progression. The use of individual muscle ROIs, however, is still of interest for exploring selective muscle involvement. • MRI-based evaluation of fatty replacement in muscles is used as an outcome measure in the assessment of 1-year disease progression in 8 different neuromuscular diseases. • Different segmentation approaches, including global muscle segmentation, were evaluated for determining 1-year fat fraction changes in lower limb skeletal muscles. • Global muscle segment fat fraction has shown to be sensitive to change in lower leg and thigh in most of the investigated neuromuscular diseases."

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a rare autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease that results in accumulation of glycogen in muscle cells causing muscular weakness. It causes a progressive proximal myopathy, accompanied by respiratory muscle weakness, which can lead to ventilatory failure. In untreated LOPD, the most common cause of death is respiratory failure. Patients suffering from respiratory compromise may present with symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) before overt signs of respiratory failure. Diaphragm weakness leads to nocturnal hypoventilation, which can result in sleep disruption. Both subjective and objective sleep quality can be impaired with associated excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Health-related quality of life worsens as sleep disturbance increases. The mainstay of treatment for SDB and respiratory failure in LOPD is non-invasive ventilation (NIV), which aims to ensure adequate ventilation, particularly during sleep, and prevent acute hypercapnic failure. These patients are at risk of acute deterioration due to lower respiratory tract infections; effective secretion clearance and vaccination against common pathogens is an important facet of care. Whilst disease-modifying enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) delays progression of locomotor dysfunction and prolongs life, its effect on respiratory function and SDB remains unclear. There are no data demonstrating the impact of ERT on sleep quality or SDB."

The intravenous infusion of recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) rescues the muscle pathologies in PD but does not treat the CNS because rhGAA does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To understand the CNS pathologies in PD, control and PD mice were followed and analyzed at 9 and 18 months with brain structural and ultrastructural studies. T2-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed the progressive dilatation of the lateral ventricles and thinning of the corpus callosum in PD mice. Electron microscopy (EM) studies at the genu of the corpus callosum revealed glycogen accumulation, an increase in nerve fiber size variation, a decrease in the g-ratio (axon diameter/total fiber diameter), and myelin sheath decompaction. The morphology of oligodendrocytes was normal. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies at the corpus callosum revealed an increase in axial diffusivity (AD) and mean diffusivity (MD) more significantly in 9-month-old PD mice. The current study suggests that axon degeneration and axon loss occur in aged PD mice and are probably caused by glycogen accumulation in neurons. A drug crossing the BBB or a treatment for directly targeting the brain might be necessary in PD."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) comprise a rare and heterogeneous group of nearly 50 heritable metabolic disorders caused by mutations in proteins critical for cellular lysosomal function. Defects in the activity of these proteins in multiple organs leads to progressive intra-lysosomal accumulation of specific substrates, resulting in disruption of cellular functions, extracellular inflammatory responses, tissue damage and organ dysfunction. The classification and clinical presentation of different LSD are dependent on the type of accumulated substrate. Some clinical signs and symptoms are common across multiple LSD, while others are more specific to a particular syndrome. Due to the rarity and wide clinical diversity of LSD, identification and diagnosis can be challenging, and in many cases diagnosis is delayed for months or years. Treatments, such as enzyme replacement therapy, haemopoietic stem cell transplantation and substrate reduction therapy, are now available for some of the LSD. For maximum effect, therapy must be initiated prior to the occurrence of irreversible tissue damage, highlighting the importance of prompt diagnosis. Herein, we discuss the clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of four of the treatable LSD: Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, Pompe disease, and two of the mucopolysaccharidoses (I and II). For each disease, we present illustrative case studies to help increase awareness of their clinical presentation and possible treatment outcomes."

Transient low-dose methotrexate (TLD-MTX) as a prophylactic ITI regimen, when administered concurrently with ERT, induces long-lived reduction of ADA to recombinant human alglucosidase alfa (rhGAA) in mice. In current clinical practice, a prophylactic ITI protocol that includes TLD-MTX, rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin (optional), successfully induced lasting control of ADA to rhGAA in high-risk, cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM)-negative infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) patients. More recently, evaluation of TLD-MTX demonstrated benefit in CRIM-positive IOPD patients. To more clearly understand the mechanism for the effectiveness of TLD-MTX, non-targeted transcriptional and proteomic screens were conducted and revealed up-regulation of erythropoiesis signatures. Confirmatory studies showed transiently larger spleens by weight, increased spleen cellularity and that following an initial reduction of mature red blood cells (RBCs) in the bone marrow and blood, a significant expansion of Ter-119<sup>+</sup> CD71<sup>+</sup> immature RBCs was observed in spleen and blood of mice. Histology sections revealed increased nucleated cells, including hematopoietic precursors, in the splenic red pulp of these mice. This study demonstrated that TLD-MTX induced a transient reduction of mature RBCs in the blood and immature RBCs in the bone marrow followed by significant enrichment of immature, nucleated RBCs in the spleen and blood during the time of immune tolerance induction, which suggested modulation of erythropoiesis may be associated with the induction of immune tolerance to rhGAA."

    "abstract": "Pennsylvania started newborn screening for Pompe disease in February 2016. Between February 2016 and December 2019, 531,139 newborns were screened. Alpha-Glucosidase (GAA) enzyme activity is measured by flow-injection tandem mass spectrometry (FIA/MS/MS) and full sequencing of the GAA gene is performed as a second-tier test in all newborns with low GAA enzyme activity [<2.10 micromole/L/h]. A total of 115 newborns had low GAA enzyme activity and abnormal genetic testing and were referred to metabolic centers. Two newborns were diagnosed with Infantile Onset Pompe Disease (IOPD), and 31 newborns were confirmed to have Late Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD). The incidence of IOPD + LOPD was 1:16,095. A total of 30 patients were compound heterozygous for one pathogenic and one variant of unknown significance (VUS) mutation or two VUS mutations and were defined as suspected LOPD. The incidence of IOPD + LOPD + suspected LOPD was 1: 8431 in PA. We also found 35 carriers, 15 pseudodeficiency carriers, and 2 false positive newborns."

    "abstract": "Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hATTRPN) is an autosomal dominant multi-organ disorder manifesting in the third to fifth decade with the key clinical features of distal and painful sensory loss of the lower limbs and autonomic dysregulation. Motor neuropathy and cardiomyopathy evolve in the course of the disease. Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disease leading to decreased levels of lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase and proximal muscle weakness. We report the clinical features and diagnostic workup in the rare case of a patient with ATTR amyloidosis and late-onset Pompe disease, both genetically confirmed. We performed a detailed clinical assessment, exome sequencing, and biochemical measurements. The patient presented with a distal, painful hypaesthesia of both legs, a cardiomyopathy, and a muscle weakness in the form of a girdle-type pattern of the arms and legs at the beginning and a spreading to distal muscle groups in the course of disease. This study highlights the importance of searching for co-occurrence of rare monogenetic neuromuscular diseases, especially in cases in which all clinical features can be readily explained by a single gene defect."

    "abstract": "DNA variants affecting mRNA expression and processing in genetic diseases are often missed or poorly characterized. We previously reported a generic assay to identify variants that affect mRNA expression and splicing in Pompe disease, a monogenic disorder caused by deficiency of acid α-glucosidase (GAA). However, this assay could miss mRNA that is subjected to degradation. Here, we inhibited mRNA degradation using cycloheximide and performed unbiased splicing analysis of all GAA exons using exon flanking RT-PCR and exon internal RT-qPCR. In four patients that were suspected of harboring splicing variants but for which aberrant splicing could not be detected in normally growing cells, we detected a total of 10 novel splicing events in cells treated with cycloheximide. In addition, we found that sequences of GAA introns 6 and 12 were naturally included in a subset of transcripts from patients and healthy controls, indicating inefficient canonical splicing. Identification of aberrant splicing caused by the common Asian variant c.546G>T allowed the development of an antisense oligonucleotide that promoted canonical GAA pre-mRNA splicing and elevated GAA enzymatic activity. Our results indicate that this extended generic splicing assay allows the detection of aberrant splicing in cases of mRNA degradation to enable functional analysis of unknown splicing variants and the development of targeted treatment options."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a lysosomal and neuromuscular disorder caused by deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), and causes classic infantile, childhood onset, or adulthood onset phenotypes. The biochemical diagnosis is based on GAA activity assays in dried blood spots, leukocytes, or fibroblasts. Diagnosis can be complicated by the existence of pseudodeficiencies, i.e., GAA variants that lower GAA activity but do not cause Pompe disease. A large-scale comparison between these assays for patient samples, including exceptions and borderline cases, along with clinical diagnoses has not been reported so far. Here we analyzed GAA activity in a total of 1709 diagnostic cases over the past 28 years using a total of 2591 analyses and we confirmed the clinical diagnosis in 174 patients. We compared the following assays: leukocytes using glycogen or 4MUG as substrate, fibroblasts using 4MUG as substrate, and dried blood spots using 4MUG as substrate. In 794 individuals, two or more assays were performed. We found that phenotypes could only be distinguished using fibroblasts with 4MUG as substrate. Pseudodeficiencies caused by the GAA2 allele could be ruled out using 4MUG rather than glycogen as substrate in leukocytes or fibroblasts. The Asian pseudodeficiency could only be ruled out in fibroblasts using 4MUG as substrate. We conclude that fibroblasts using 4MUG as substrate provides the most reliable assay for biochemical diagnosis and can serve to validate results from leukocytes or dried blood spots."

There is an approved therapy based on enzymatic replacement that has modified disease progression. Several reports describing muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of Pompe patients have been published. Most of the studies have focused on late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) and identified a characteristic pattern of muscle involvement useful for the diagnosis. In addition, quantitative MRI studies have shown a progressive increase in fat in skeletal muscles of LOPD over time and they are increasingly considered a good tool to monitor progression of the disease. The studies performed in infantile-onset Pompe disease patients have shown less consistent changes. Other more sophisticated muscle MRI sequences, such as diffusion tensor imaging or glycogen spectroscopy, have also been used in Pompe patients and have shown promising results."

    "abstract": "To determine the carrier frequency and pathogenic variants of common genetic disorders in the north Indian population by using next generation sequencing (NGS). After pre-test counselling, 200 unrelated individuals (including 88 couples) were screened for pathogenic variants in 88 genes by NGS technology. The variants were classified as per American College of Medical Genetics criteria. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were subjected to thorough literature-based curation in addition to the regular filters. Variants of unknown significance were not reported. Individuals were counselled explaining the implications of the results, and cascade screening was advised when necessary. Of the 200 participants, 52 (26%) were found to be carrier of one or more disorders. Twelve individuals were identified to be carriers for congenital deafness, giving a carrier frequency of one in 17 for one of the four genes tested (SLC26A4, GJB2, TMPRSS3 and TMC1 in decreasing order). Nine individuals were observed to be carriers for cystic fibrosis, with a frequency of one in 22. Three individuals were detected to be carriers for Pompe disease (frequency one in 67). None of the 88 couples screened were found to be carriers for the same disorder. The pathogenic variants observed in many disorders (such as deafness, cystic fibrosis, Pompe disease, Canavan disease, primary hyperoxaluria, junctional epidermolysis bullosa, galactosemia, medium chain acyl CoA deficiency etc.) were different from those commonly observed in the West. A higher carrier frequency for genetic deafness, cystic fibrosis and Pompe disease was unexpected, and contrary to the generally held view about their prevalence in Asian Indians. In spite of the small sample size, this study would suggest that population-based carrier screening panels for India would differ from those in the West, and need to be selected with due care. Testing should comprise the study of all the coding exons with its boundaries in the genes through NGS, as all the variants are not well characterized. Only study of entire coding regions in the genes will detect carriers with adequate efficiency, in order to reduce the burden of genetic disorders in India and other resource poor countries."

    "abstract": "To address progressive respiratory muscle weakness in late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), we developed a 12-week respiratory muscle training (RMT) program. In this exploratory, double-blind, randomized control trial, 22 adults with LOPD were randomized to RMT or sham-RMT. The primary outcome was maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP). Secondary and exploratory outcomes included maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), peak cough flow, diaphragm ultrasound, polysomnography, patient-reported outcomes, and measures of gross motor function. MIP increased 7.6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (15.9) in the treatment group and 2.7 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (7.6) in the control group (P = 0.4670). MEP increased 14.0 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (25.9) in the treatment group and 0.0 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (12.0) in the control group (P = 0.1854). The only statistically significant differences in secondary/exploratory outcomes were improvements in time to climb 4 steps (P = 0.0346) and daytime sleepiness (P = 0.0160). The magnitude of changes in MIP and MEP in the treatment group were consistent with our pilot findings but did not achieve statistical significance in comparison to controls. Explanations for this include inadequate power and baseline differences in subject characteristics between groups. Additionally, control group subjects appeared to exhibit an active response to sham-RMT and therefore sham-RMT may not be an optimal control condition for RMT in LOPD."

Two methods for NBS for Pompe disease by measuring acid α-glucosidase in dried blood spots on filter paper were developed in an international collaborative research effort led by Genzyme. Both methods were used successfully in NBS pilot programs to demonstrate the feasibility of NBS for Pompe disease. Since 2009, all babies born in Taiwan have been screened for Pompe disease. Pompe disease was added to the Recommended Uniform (Newborn) Screening Panel in the United States in 2015. NBS for Pompe disease is possible because of the unprecedented and selfless collaborations of countless international experts who shared their thoughts and data freely with the common goal of establishing NBS for Pompe disease expeditiously."

    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease type II (also known as Pompe disease (PD)) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by defects in α-glucosidase (AαGlu), resulting in lysosomal glycogen accumulation in skeletal and heart muscles. Accumulation and tissue damage rates depend on residual enzyme activity. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) should be started before symptoms are apparent in order to achieve optimal outcomes. Early initiation of ERT in infantile-onset PD improves survival, reduces the need for ventilation, results in earlier independent walking, and enhances patient quality of life. Newborn screening (NBS) is the optimal approach for early diagnosis and treatment of PD. In NBS for PD, measurement of AαGlu enzyme activity in dried blood spots (DBSs) is conducted using fluorometry, tandem mass spectrometry, or digital microfluidic fluorometry. The presence of pseudodeficiency alleles, which are frequent in Asian populations, interferes with NBS for PD, and current NBS systems cannot discriminate between pseudodeficiency and cases with PD or potential PD. The combination of <i>GAA</i> gene analysis with NBS is essential for definitive diagnoses of PD. In this review, we introduce our experiences and discuss NBS programs for PD implemented in various countries."

Since 2015, the National Taiwan University NBS Center has changed the method for Pompe disease NBS from fluorometric assay to tandem mass assay. From 2016 to 2019, 14 newborns were reported as high-risk for Pompe disease at a median age of 9 days (range 6-13), and 18 were with a borderline risk at a median age of 13 days (9-28). None of the borderline risks were IOPD patients. Among the 14 at a high-risk of Pompe disease, four were found to have cardiomyopathy, and six were classified as potential late-onset Pompe disease. The four classic IOPD newborns, three of the four having at least one allele of the cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM)-positive variant, started enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) at a median age of 9 days (8-14). Western Blot analysis and whole gene sequencing confirmed the CRIM-positive status in all cases. Here, we focus on the patient without the known CRIM-positive variant. Doing ERT before knowing the CRIM status created a dilemma in the decision and was discussed in detail. Our Pompe disease screening and diagnostic program successfully detected and treated patients with IOPD in time. However, the timely exclusion of a CRIM-negative status, which is rare in the Chinese population, is still a challenging task."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme deficiency, resulting in muscle and neuron intralysosomal glycogen storage. Clinical symptoms vary from the severe, infantile-onset form with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, gross motor delay, and early death from respiratory insufficiency; to a late-onset form with variable onset of proximal muscle weakness and progressive respiratory insufficiency. Newborn screening programs have been instituted to presymptomatically identify neonates with infantile-onset Pompe disease for early initiation of treatment. However, infants with late-onset Pompe disease are also identified, leaving families and physicians in a state of uncertainty regarding prognosis, necessity, and timing of treatment initiation. This report presents a 31 5/7 weeks' gestational age premature infant flagged positive for Pompe disease with low dried blood spot GAA activity; sequencing identified biparental c.-32-13T>G/c.29delA <i>GAA</i> variants predicting late-onset Pompe disease. The infant's parents' initial reactions to the positive newborn screen, subsequent experience during confirmatory testing, and post-confirmation reflections are also reported. While uncertainties regarding natural history and prognosis of presymptomatically-identified late-onset Pompe disease infants will be elucidated with additional experience, suggestions for education of first-line providers are provided to accurately communicate results and compassionately counsel families regarding anxiety-provoking positive newborn screen results."

The c.-32-13T>G variant was the most common pathogenic mutation reported. African American and Asian/Pacific Islander newborns had higher allele frequencies for both pathogenic and pseudodeficiency variants. After the first year of Pompe disease screening in California, the disease distribution in the population is now better understood. With the ongoing long-term follow-up system currently in place, our understanding of the complex genotype-phenotype relationships will become more evident in the future, and this should help us better understand the clinical significance of identified cases."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a rare, autosomal-recessively inherited deficiency in the enzyme acid α-glucosidase. It is a spectrum disorder; age at symptom onset and rate of deterioration can vary considerably. In affected infants prognosis is poor, such that without treatment most infants die within the first year of life. To lose a baby in their first year of life to a rare disease causes much regret, guilt, and loneliness to parents, family, and friends. To lose a baby needlessly when there is an effective treatment amplifies this sadness. With so little experience of rare disease in the community, once a baby transfers to their home they are subject to a very uncertain and unyielding diagnostic journey while their symptomology progresses and their health deteriorates. With a rare disease like PD, the best opportunity to diagnose a baby is at birth. PD is not yet included in the current newborn screening (NBS) panel in Australia. Should it be? In late 2018 the Australian Pompe Association applied to the Australian Standing committee on Newborn Screening to have PD included. The application was not upheld. Here we provide an overview of the rationale for NBS, drawing on the scientific literature and perspectives from The Australian Pompe Association, its patients and their families. In doing so, we hope to bring a new voice to this very important debate."

The late-onset form of the disease (LOPD) is considered a multisystemic disorder which could involve vascular system with cerebrovascular abnormalities such as intracranial aneurysms or dolichoectasia. Intracranial aneurysm rupture may represent a life-threatening emergency. A possible treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) should consider both aneurysm-related (aneurysmal size, shape, localization, numbers and hemodynamic factors) and patient-related risk factors (patient's age and sex, hypertension, smoke exposure). Moreover, UIAs management of LOPD patients needs also to take into account the altered blood vessels integrity and elasticity, whose consistency is likely weakened by the deficient GAA activity as a further potential risk factor. We herein present our approach for of UIAs management in three patients with LOPD. Among them, only one patient with a left saccular UIA of the anterior communicating artery, after careful consideration of risk factors, underwent the endovascular treatment. The other two patients were scheduled for a 1-year follow-up, according to radiological, clinical, and risk evaluation features. Finally, we would like to suggest some general recommendations for UIAs management. In particular, if no risk factors are identified, a cautious yearly follow-up is suggested; otherwise, if risk factors are present, endovascular treatment should be considered."

The late-onset form of the disease (LOPD) causes primarily progressive muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) introduced in 2006, showed mild improvement or stabilization of the symptoms although long-term data are limited. Aim of the study was to describe the progression of body composition and walking ability in LOPD patients receiving ERT consistently for 9 years. Lean body mass, bone mineral density, body fat and 6 min walking distance were assessed in three male and three female LOPD patients (height 165.8 ± 11.2 cm, age 42.3 ± 11.8yrs, body mass 71.1 ± 20.8 kg, at study entry), every three years, for 9 years since ERT initiation (T0, T3, T6, T9). Total body and upper extremities' lean mass remained unchanged (<i>p</i> < 0.05), but it was decreased for the lower extremities (T3:13.06 ± 3.848 kg vs. T9:11.63 ± 3.49 kg, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Lean body mass was not significantly different after 9 years of ERT compared to before the ERT initiation (T0 to T9). Bone mineral density remained unchanged. Percent body fat increased (T0:39.1 ± 10.3%, vs. T9:43.1 ± 10.4%, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Six minute walking distance tended to increase after 3 years of ERT and decreased gradually thereafter, with no difference between T0-T9. Lean mass of the lower extremities adjusted for body weight was significantly correlated with 6 min walking distance (<i>r</i> = 0.712, <i>p</i> < 0.05). The current data show that enzyme replacement therapy may preserve lean body mass, bone mineral density and walking capacity in LOPD patients."

Available Gaa knock-out (KO) mouse models do not accurately mimic PD, particularly its highly impaired respiratory phenotype. Here we developed a new mouse model of PD crossing Gaa KO<sup>B6;129</sup> with DBA2/J mice. We subsequently treated Gaa KO<sup>DBA2/J</sup> mice with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors expressing a secretable form of GAA (secGAA). Male Gaa KO<sup>DBA2/J</sup> mice present most of the key features of the human disease, including early lethality, severe respiratory impairment, cardiac hypertrophy and muscle weakness. Transcriptome analyses of Gaa KO<sup>DBA2/J</sup>, compared to the parental Gaa KO<sup>B6;129</sup> mice, revealed a profoundly impaired gene signature in the spinal cord and a similarly deregulated gene expression in skeletal muscle. Muscle and spinal cord transcriptome changes, biochemical defects, respiratory and muscle function in the Gaa KO<sup>DBA2/J</sup> model were significantly improved upon gene therapy with AAV vectors expressing secGAA. These data show that the genetic background impacts on the severity of respiratory function and neuroglial spinal cord defects in the Gaa KO mouse model of PD. Our findings have implications for PD prognosis and treatment, show novel molecular pathophysiology mechanisms of the disease and provide a unique model to study PD respiratory defects, which majorly affect patients.

However, Patient-Reported Outcomes that can be widely applicable for use in patient-focused drug development or clinical trial designs are not yet validated for all diseases. The aim of this study report was to provide supportive evidence of the construct and content validity of selected Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) questionnaires compared with other disease-relevant clinical outcome measures, including the 6-Minute Walk Distance, forced vital capacity, and Manual Muscle Test, in late-onset Pompe disease and to provide supportive evidence that the selected PROMIS measures are relevant and important to these patients. Thirty patients with late-onset Pompe disease completed five PROMIS questionnaires that were chosen based on patient and provider feedback, along with discussion with key opinion leaders who are experts in Pompe disease. The Amicus Pompe Patient Advisory Board also provided patient experience feedback using the PROMIS questionnaires. Clinical outcome measures (6-Minute Walk Distance, forced vital capacity, and Manual Muscle Test) were collected at the Duke University Pompe Disease Clinical Research Program during a single visit. The Patient Advisory Board rated the questionnaires as representative of an unmet need. Correlation data demonstrated moderate to strong correlations of PROMIS questionnaires with the specified clinical outcome measures (6-Minute Walk Distance, forced vital capacity, and Manual Muscle Test). These data supported the construct and content validity of the PROMIS questionnaires because they confirmed the motor signs and symptoms of functional disability observed in patients with Pompe disease. The correlations indicate that the clinical outcome measures assess important concepts related to patient-reported experiences. The Patient Advisory Board findings suggest that the selected PROMIS questionnaires are meaningful and address important concepts to patients with Pompe disease. The data were collected from a small number of patients at a single time point; further studies are needed with additional PROMIS questionnaires, which should include measures of motor function and health-related quality of life, in a larger number of patients followed up longitudinally."

Both parents were found to be carriers of the c.2560C>T (p.Arg854X) variant through prenatal carrier screening. Fetal echocardiogram at 31 weeks of gestation showed left ventricular hypertrophy. An echocardiogram on the 1st day of life revealed marked biventricular hypertrophy. Physical exam was significant for macroglossia and hypotonia. A short course of Prophylactic ITI with rituximab, methotrexate, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in conjunction with ERT at a dose of 20 mg/kg every other week was started on day 2 of life. The patient completed the ITI protocol safely and complete B-cell recovery, based on CD19 count, was noted by 3 months of age. The patient never developed anti-rhGAA IgG antibodies to ERT. Vaccinations were initiated at 9 months of age, with adequate response noted. Complete recovery of cardiac function and left ventricular mass was seen by 11 weeks of age. At 8 months of age, the patient developmentally measured at 75-90% on the Alberta Infant Motor Scale, walked at 11 months and continues to develop age-appropriately at 50 months of age based on the Early Learning Accomplishment Profile. ERT dosing was increased to 40 mg/kg every 2 weeks at 32 months of age and frequency increased to 40 mg/kg every week at 47 months of age. Patient continues to have undetectable antibody titers, most recently at age 50 months and urine Hex4 has remained normal. To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful early ERT and ITI in a prenatally diagnosed CRIM-negative IPD patient and the youngest IPD patient to receive ITI safely. With the addition of Pompe disease to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel(RUSP) and its addition to multiple state newborn screening programs, our case highlights the benefits of early diagnosis and timely initiation of treatment in babies with Pompe disease, who represent the most severe end of the disease spectrum."

Cardiac disease is particularly important in some group of LSDs as glycogen storage diseases (Pompe), mucopolysaccharidoses and in glycosphingolipidoses (Anderson-Fabry disease and less frequently Gaucher disease). Various cardiac manifestations may be observed including hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease and valvular disease. The availability of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has changed the natural history of some LSDs such as Pompe disease, thanks to the significant effects on cardiological involvement. In other LSDs such as MPSs or Fabry disease, ERT has been shown to stabilize or slow the progression of heart damage. This imposes the need for a timely diagnosis that allows a rapid onset of ERT."

    "abstract": "To evaluate safety, dose response, and preliminary efficacy of <i>reldesemtiv</i> over 12 weeks in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). <i>Methods:</i> Patients (≤2 years since diagnosis) with slow upright vital capacity (SVC) of ≥60% were randomized 1:1:1:1 to <i>reldesemtiv</i> 150, 300, or 450 mg twice daily (bid) or placebo; active treatment was 12 weeks with 4-week follow-up. Primary endpoint was change in percent predicted SVC at 12 weeks; secondary measures included ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) and muscle strength mega-score. <i>Results:</i> Patients (<i>N</i> = 458) were enrolled; 85% completed 12-week treatment. The primary analysis failed to reach statistical significance (<i>p</i> = 0.11); secondary endpoints showed no statistically significant effects (ALSFRS-R, <i>p</i> = 0.09; muscle strength mega-score, <i>p</i> = 0.31). Post hoc analyses pooling all active <i>reldesemtiv</i>-treated patients compared against placebo showed trends toward benefit in all endpoints (progression rate for SVC, ALSFRS-R, and muscle strength mega-score (nominal p values of 0.10, 0.01 and 0.20 respectively)). <i>Reldesemtiv</i> was well tolerated, with nausea and fatigue being the most common side effects. A dose-dependent decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate was noted, and transaminase elevations were seen in approximately 5% of patients. Both hepatic and renal abnormalities trended toward resolution after study drug discontinuation. <i>Conclusions:</i> Although the primary efficacy analysis did not demonstrate statistical significance, there were trends favoring <i>reldesemtiv</i> for all three endpoints, with effect sizes generally regarded as clinically important. Tolerability was good; modest hepatic and renal abnormalities were reversible. The impact of <i>reldesemtiv</i> on patients with ALS should be assessed in a pivotal Phase 3 trial.

    "title": "Pompe Disease: New Developments in an Old Lysosomal Storage Disorder.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type II, is caused by the lack or deficiency of a single enzyme, lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase, leading to severe cardiac and skeletal muscle myopathy due to progressive accumulation of glycogen. The discovery that acid alpha-glucosidase resides in the lysosome gave rise to the concept of lysosomal storage diseases, and Pompe disease became the first among many monogenic diseases caused by loss of lysosomal enzyme activities. The only disease-specific treatment available for Pompe disease patients is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) which aims to halt the natural course of the illness. Both the success and limitations of ERT provided novel insights in the pathophysiology of the disease and motivated the scientific community to develop the next generation of therapies that have already progressed to the clinic."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders are characterised by the activation of brain-resident microglia cells and by the infiltration of peripheral T cells. However, their interplay in disease has not been clarified yet. It is difficult to investigate complex cellular dynamics in living animals, and simple two-dimensional (2D) cell culture models do not resemble the soft 3D structure of brain tissue. Therefore, we developed a biomimetic 3D in vitro culture system for co-cultivation of microglia and T cells. As the activation and/or migration of immune cells in the brain might be affected by components of the extracellular matrix, defined 3D fibrillar collagen I-based matrices were constructed and modified with hyaluronan and/or chondroitin sulphate, resembling aspects of brain extracellular matrix. Murine microglia and spleen-derived T cells were cultured alone or in co-culture on the constructed matrices. Microglia exhibited in vivo-like morphology and T cells showed enhanced survival when co-cultured with microglia or to a minor degree in the presence of glia-conditioned medium. The open and porous fibrillar structure of the matrix allowed for cell invasion and direct cell-cell interaction, with stronger invasion of T cells. Both cell types showed no dependence on the matrix modifications. Microglia could be activated on the matrices by lipopolysaccharide resulting in interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α secretion. The findings herein indicate that biomimetic 3D matrices allow for co-cultivation and activation of primary microglia and T cells and provide useful tools to study their interaction in vitro."

    "abstract": "The genetic diagnostics of inherited neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) is challenging due to their clinical and genetic heterogeneity. We launched an online survey within the EURO-NMD European Reference Network (ERN) to collect information about the availability/distribution of genetic testing across 61 ERN health care providers (HCPs). A 17 items questionnaire was designed to address methods used, the number of genetic tests available, the clinical pathway to access genetic testing, the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and participation to quality assessment schemes (QAs). A remarkable number of HCPs (49%) offers ≥ 500 genetic tests per year, 43,6% offers 100-500 genetic tests per year, and 7,2% ≤ 100 per year. NGS is used by 94% of centres, Sanger sequencing by 84%, MLPA by 66% and Southern blotting by 36%. The majority of centres (60%) offer NGS for all patients that fulfil criteria for NMD of genetic origin. Pipelines for NGS vary amongst centres, even within the same national system. Referral of patients to genetic laboratories by specialists was frequently reported (58%), and 65% of centres participates in genetic testing QAs. We specifically evaluated how many centres cover SMA, DMD, Pompe, LGMDs, and TTR genes/diseases genetic diagnosis, since these rare diseases benefit from personalised therapies. We used the Orphanet EUGT numbers, provided by 82% of HCPs. SMA, DMD, LGMD, TTR and GAA genes are covered by EUGTs although with different numbers and modalities. The number of genetic tests for NMDs offered across HCPs National Health systems is quite high, including routine techniques and NGS. The number and type of tests offered and the clinical practices differ among centres. We provided evidence that survey tools might be useful to learn about the state-of-the-art of ERN health-related activities and to foster harmonisation and standardisation of the complex care for the rare disease patients in the EU."

    "abstract": "Metabolic myopathies comprise a clinically etiological diverse group of disorders caused by defects in cellular energy metabolism including the breakdown of carbohydrates and fatty acids, which include glycogen storage diseases and fatty acid oxidation disorders. Their wide clinical spectrum ranges from infantile severe multisystemic disorders to adult-onset myopathies. To suspect in adults these disorders, clinical features such as exercise intolerance and recurrent myoglobinuria need investigation while another group presents fixed weakness and cardiomyopathy as a clinical pattern. In metabolic myopathies, clinical manifestations are important to guide diagnostic tests used in order to lead to the correct diagnosis. The authors searched in literature the most recent techniques developed. The authors present an overview of the most common phenotypes of Pompe disease and what is currently known about the mechanism of ERT treatment. The most common disorders of lipid metabolism are overviewed, with their possible dietary or supplementary treatments. The clinical suspicion is the clue to conduct in-depth investigations in suspected cases of metabolic myopathies that lead to the final diagnosis with biochemical molecular studies and often nowadays by the use of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to determine gene mutations."

We aimed to investigate the travel burden and its impact on clinical presentation in a large sample of patients with retinoblastoma from Africa and Europe. A cross-sectional analysis including 518 treatment-naïve patients with retinoblastoma residing in 40 European countries and 1024 treatment-naïve patients with retinoblastoma residing in 43 African countries. Capture rate was 42.2% of expected patients from Africa and 108.8% from Europe. African patients were older (95% CI -12.4 to -5.4, p<0.001), had fewer cases of familial retinoblastoma (95% CI 2.0 to 5.3, p<0.001) and presented with more advanced disease (95% CI 6.0 to 9.8, p<0.001); 43.4% and 15.4% of Africans had extraocular retinoblastoma and distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis, respectively, compared to 2.9% and 1.0% of the Europeans. To reach a retinoblastoma centre, European patients travelled 421.8 km compared to Africans who travelled 185.7 km (p<0.001). On regression analysis, lower-national income level, African residence and older age (p<0.001), but not travel distance (p=0.19), were risk factors for advanced disease. Fewer than half the expected number of patients with retinoblastoma presented to African referral centres in 2017, suggesting poor awareness or other barriers to access. Despite the relatively shorter distance travelled by African patients, they presented with later-stage disease. Health education about retinoblastoma is needed for carers and health workers in Africa in order to increase capture rate and promote early referral."

    "abstract": "There is limited data on pregnancy outcomes in Pompe Disease (PD) resulting from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. Late-onset PD is characterized by progressive proximal muscle weakness and decline of respiratory function secondary to the involvement of the respiratory muscles. In a cohort of twenty-five females, the effects of both PD on the course of pregnancy and the effects of pregnancy on PD were investigated. Reproductive history, course of pregnancy, use of Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), PD symptoms, and outcomes of each pregnancy were obtained through a questionnaire. Among 20 subjects that reported one or more pregnancies, one subject conceived while on ERT and continued therapy through two normal pregnancies with worsening of weakness during pregnancy and improvement postpartum. While fertility was not affected, pregnancy may worsen symptoms, or cause initial symptoms to arise. Complications with pregnancy or birth were not higher, except for an increase in the rate of stillbirths (3.8% compared to the national average of 0.2-0.7%). Given small sample size and possible bias of respondents being only women who have been pregnant, further data may be needed to better analyze the effects of pregnancy on PD, and the effects of ERT on pregnancy outcomes."

    "abstract": "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT; alglucosidase alfa) has improved the prospects for patients with classic infantile Pompe disease considerably. However, over time we noticed that many of these children exhibit distal muscle weakness at an early age, which is in contrast to the primarily proximal and axial muscle weakness in patients with late-onset Pompe disease. This was reason to study the prevalence and severity of distal muscle weakness, and the sequence of muscle involvement over time in patients that had learned to walk under ERT. In this prospective, single-center cohort study, we studied 16 classic infantile patients. We used video recordings that were made during regular standardized assessments to investigate distal muscle function (active dorsiflexion of the feet during walking; ability to use a pincer grasp/actively extend the fingers) and proximal muscle function (standing up from a supine position; raising the arms above the head). Median age at start of ERT was 3.2 months (0.1-5.8 months), median age at study end was 5.6 years (2.9-18.2 years). Six patients (6/16, 38%) initially had no evident signs of distal muscle weakness and developed a gait with active dorsiflexion of the feet. The other 10 patients never exhibited active dorsiflexion of the feet during walking. At study-end two patients showed no loss of distal muscle function. A subset of five patients (5/16, 31%) developed also weakness of the hands, particularly of the extensors of the 3rd and 4th digit. We found that the majority (14/16, 88%) of patients who had learned to walk exhibited distal muscle weakness of the lower extremities, while a subset (5/16, 31%) also developed weakness of the hands. The distal muscle weakness was often more serious than, and preceded the development of, the proximal muscle weakness."

This represents a limit for monitoring disease progression and perceived efficacy of symptomatic treatments. Our aim was to investigate whether PROs for activities of daily living designed for other neuromuscular diseases could be used in DM2. Sixty-six DM2 patients completed the following PROs: DM1-Activ-c, Rasch-built Pompe-specific activity (R-PAct) scale, McGill-pain questionnaire, fatigue and daytime sleepiness scale and Beck depression inventory (BDI-II). Clinical data and motor outcome measures (6-minutes walking test - 6MWT, manual muscle testing, quick motor function test and myotonia behavior scale) were collected as well. Patients underwent one visit at baseline and one after 10 months. Ceiling/flooring effects, criterion validity and discriminant validity were calculated. DM1-activ-c and R-PAct showed acceptable ceiling effects despite being built for myotonic dystrophy type 1 and Pompe disease, respectively. The difficulty hierarchy of the single items was better preserved in R-PAct than in DM1-Activ-c. Both tests showed excellent criterion validity highly correlating with 6MWT, quick motor function test, myalgia and disease duration. They could partially discriminate patients with different disability grades. These results suggest that DM1-Activ-c, slightly better than R-PAct, might be adopted for monitoring activities of daily living also in DM2, at least until disease-specific PROs will be available."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare, progressive metabolic myopathy. The aim of this study is to investigate the associations of physical outcomes with patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in late-onset Pompe disease. We included 121 Dutch adult patients with Pompe disease. Physical outcomes comprised muscle strength (manual muscle testing using Medical Research Council [MRC] grading, hand-held dynamometry [HHD]), walking ability (6-min walk test [6MWT]), and pulmonary function (forced vital capacity [FVC] in upright and supine positions). PROMs comprised quality of life (Short Form 36 health survey [SF-36]), participation (Rotterdam Handicap Scale [RHS]) and daily-life activities (Rasch-Built Pompe-Specific Activity [R-PAct] Scale). Analyses were cross-sectional: the time-point before, and closest to, start of Enzyme Replacement Therapy was chosen. Associations between PROMs and physical outcomes were investigated using linear regression models. RHS and R-PAct scores were better in patients with higher FVC supine and upright, HHD, MRC and 6MWT scores, accounting for the effect of sex, disease duration, use of wheelchair and ventilator support. While the SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) was correlated positively with FVC upright, HHD, MRC and 6MWT scores, there was no significant relationship between the SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) and any of the physical outcomes. Participation, daily-life activities, and the physical component of quality of life of adult Pompe patients are positively correlated to physical outcomes. This work serves as a first step towards assessing how changes over time in physical outcomes are related to changes in PROMs, and to define the minimal change in physical outcomes required to make an important difference for the patient."

In the context of cancer therapy, rituximab administration results in sustained B-cell depletion in 83% of patients for up to 26-39 weeks with B-cell reconstitution beginning at approximately 26 weeks post-treatment. The impact of rituximab on serum immunoglobulin levels is not well studied, available data suggest that rituximab can cause persistently low immunoglobulin levels and adversely impact vaccine responses. Data on a cohort of IPD patients who received a short-course of ITI with rituximab, methotrexate, and IVIG in the ERT-naïve setting and had ≥6 months of follow-up were retrospectively studied. B-cell quantitation, ANC, AST, ALT, immunization history, and vaccine titers after B-cell reconstitution were reviewed. Data were collected for 34 IPD patients (25 CRIM-negative and 9 CRIM-positive) with a median age at ERT initiation of 3.5 months (0.1-11.0 months). B-cell reconstitution, as measured by normalization of CD19%, was seen in all patients (<i>n</i> = 33) at a median time of 17 weeks range (11-55 weeks) post-rituximab. All maintained normal CD19% with the longest follow-up being 248 weeks post-rituximab. 30/34 (88%) maintained negative/low anti-rhGAA antibody titers, even with complete B-cell reconstitution. Infections during immunosuppression were reported in five CRIM-negative IPD patients, all resolved satisfactorily on antibiotics. There were no serious sequelae or deaths. Of the 31 evaluable patients, 27 were up to date on age-appropriate immunizations. Vaccine titers were available for 12 patients after B-cell reconstitution and adequate humoral response was observed in all except an inadequate response to the Pneumococcal vaccine (<i>n</i> = 2). These data show the benefits of short-course prophylactic ITI in IPD both in terms of safety and efficacy. Data presented here are from the youngest cohort of patients treated with rituximab and expands the evidence of its safety in the pediatric population."

It is caused by a deficiency in functioning of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase and leads to the accumulation of glycogen in the liver, heart, muscle, and other tissues. Myozyme is an effective drug, but it imposes a heavy financial burden on societies and healthcare systems. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the cost-effectiveness of Myozyme compared to conventional therapy for the treatment of IOPD. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane library databases were searched on December 2018 to identify the effectiveness of Myozyme versus conventional therapy. Then, a cost-effectiveness and a cost utility study were conducted in patients suffering from IOPD. In this cost effectiveness and cost utility analysis, Markov and decision tree models were used for modeling. Model parameters were obtained from international data, and the perspective of the payer was considered. Every cycle was one year; the model was run for 22 cycles. TreeAge pro 2011 was used for analysis. Finally, one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Two papers were included and 39 patients were evaluated as the treatment group in both studies. Results revealed the effectiveness of Myozyme. Results also revealed a wide range of adverse reactions. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) resulted in 4.21038 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) per $381,852. The incremental cost per QALY was $96,809 and the incremental cost per life years gained (LYG) was 74,429 over a 22-year time horizon. Sensitivity analysis indicated the robustness of the results. Myozyme is effective for IOPD and could increase the life expectancy of patients significantly. However, since the calculated incremental cost per QALY was 17 times higher than the GDP per capita of Iran, Myozyme is not cost effective in Iran."

Safety parameters. 14 participants completed the trial, VPA treatment was well tolerated; weight gain was the most frequently reported drug-related adverse event. There was no clinically meaningful change in any of the primary or secondary outcome measures including: VO<sub>2</sub>peak, 12 min walk test and muscle biopsy to look for a change in the number of phosphorylase positive fibres between baseline and 6 months of treatment. Although this was a small open label feasibility study, it suggests that a larger randomised controlled study of VPA, may not be worthwhile."

This study aimed at investigating the effect of hamamelitannin on glycogen synthesis in an insulin resistance model using L6 myotubes. Glucose uptake was determined using 2-deoxy-D-[1-<sup>3</sup>H] glucose and glycogen synthesis were also estimated in L6 myotubes. The expression levels of key genes and proteins involved in the insulin-signaling pathway were determined using real-time PCR and western blot techniques. The cells treated with various concentrations of hamamelitannin (20 µM to 100 µM) for 24 h showed that, the exposure of hamamelitannin was not cytotoxic to L6 myotubes. Further the 2-deoxy-D-[1-<sup>3</sup>H] glucose uptake assay was carried out in the presence of wortmannin and Genistein inhibitor for studying the GLUT-4 dependent cell surface recruitment. Hamamelitannin exhibited anti-diabetic activity by displaying a significant increase in glucose uptake (125.1%) and glycogen storage (8.7 mM) in a dose-dependent manner. The optimum concentration evincing maximum activity was found to be 100 µm. In addition, the expression of key genes and proteins involved in the insulin signaling pathway was studied to be upregulated by hamamelitannin treatment. Western blot analysis confirmed the translocation of GLUT-4 protein from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane. Therefore, it can be conceived that hamamelitannin exhibited an insulinomimetic effect by enhancing the glucose uptake and its further conversion into glycogen by regulating glucose metabolism."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of the acid α-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme. GAA deficiency induces progressive glycogen accumulation which leads to weakness of the respiratory muscle including the diaphragm. Pompe disease is one of the few myopathies, for which an established therapy is available. Thus, earlier detection of potential late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) and earlier intervention would have a significant clinical impact. Our hypothesis is that sleep problems including sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and clinical symptoms may indicate an early stage of LOPD since decreased respiratory muscle activity generally first presents during sleep. Thus, the aims of this prospective, multicenter observational cohort study in Japan (PSSAP-J) are to demonstrate a higher prevalence of LOPD in a sleep lab-based population (primary outcome), and to identify predictive factors for LOPD from findings in diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) and clinical symptoms (secondary outcomes). The study design is a prospective multicenter observational cohort study. Consecutive patients who present to sleep labs due to suspected SDB for an overnight PSG will be enrolled. All patients will be measured for creatine kinase, GAA activity, and if necessary, genetic analysis of GAA. Furthermore, chest X-ray, pulmonary function test, and arterial blood gas analysis will be collected. Then, prevalence and specific findings of LOPD will be assessed. Congenital myopathy shows a shift from slow-deep to rapid-shallow breathing during transition from wakefulness to sleep accompanying a symptom of waking with gasping (actual further results are pending). The distribution in respiratory physiology between during wakefulness and sleep specific to LOPD may provide insights into early-stage detection.

Another multiplex assay making use of immunocapture technology has also been proposed. To investigate the potential variability in performance of these analytical approaches, we implemented three high-throughput screening assays for the simultaneous screening for four lysosomal disorders: Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, and Pompe disease. These assays were tested in a prospective comparative effectiveness study using nearly 100,000 residual newborn dried blood spot specimens. In addition, 2nd tier enzyme assays and confirmatory molecular genetic testing were employed. Post-analytical interpretive tools were created using the software Collaborative Laboratory Integrated Reports (CLIR) to determine its ability to improve the performance of each assay vs. the traditional result interpretation based on analyte-specific reference ranges and cutoffs. This study showed that all three platforms have high sensitivity, and the application of CLIR tools markedly improves the performance of each platform while reducing the need for 2nd tier testing by 66% to 95%. Moreover, the addition of disease-specific biochemical 2nd tier tests ensures the lowest false positive rates and the highest positive predictive values for any platform."

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the findings for each behavior checklist.

The majority of children with Pompe exhibited age-appropriate behavior and emotional functioning on these standardized checklists. However, negative mood symptoms, learning problems, decreased participation in structured social activities, and attentional difficulties were more frequently reported in children with IPD in comparison to same-aged peers. Parents of children with LOPD reported fewer problematic behaviors but endorsed negative mood symptoms and difficulties with peer relations. Most children received accommodations in regular education classrooms at school. These standardized behavior checklists are useful screening tools for the early identification and treatment of behavior, emotional, and social concerns in children with Pompe disease."

In this truly unprecedented situation, the clinical management of neuromuscular patients during the COVID-19 epidemics - taking into account the related difficulties (patients who have suspended ERT, difficulty in contacting the doctors, etc.) - we propose to use a telemedicine device, i.e. the AIGkit application (AIGkit app), promoted and developed in 2018 by Fabrizio Seidita on behalf of the Italian Glycogenosis Association (AIG). The app was born to allow patients with Pompe disease to receive as far as possible continuous monitoring of their health. The support of all colleagues of the Italian Association for Myology (AIM) should extend its use to all NMD patients and beyond."

    "abstract": "Variants perturbing the normal splicing of pre-mRNA can lead to human diseases. The splice-altering effect and eventual consequence on gene function was sometimes uncertain and hinders a definitive molecular diagnosis. The impact of four rare intronic variants on splicing was analyzed through reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of mRNA derived from the peripheral blood of patients. The results were compared with in-silico prediction. Potential implication on molecular diagnosis was discussed. Four rare intronic variants of SLC9A6, DLG3, GAA, and OCRL were identified in patients with suspected disorders, respectively. Although these four variants were all predicted to alter splicing by in-silico tools, RT-PCR analysis of mRNA derived from peripheral blood showed these variants affected splicing in different ways: c.899+3_899+6del of SLC9A6 resulted in one-exon skipping and an out-of-frame transcript; c.905-2A > G of DLG3 resulted in a mix of in-frame transcripts; c.1195-11T > A of GAA resulted in the in-frame insertion of nine nucleotides; c.723-2A > C of OCRL resulted in one-exon skipping and in-frame deletion of 102 nucleotides. The consequence revealed by mRNA analysis is essential for accurate interpretation of pathogenicity. Four intronic variants all caused aberrant mRNA splicing. For intronic variants with uncertain impact on splicing, mRNA analysis is helpful for ascertainment of alternative splicing and accurate interpretation of pathogenicity."

    "title": "Lentiviral Hematopoietic Stem Cell Gene Therapy Rescues Clinical Phenotypes in a Murine Model of Pompe Disease.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by malfunctions of the acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme with a consequent toxic accumulation of glycogen in cells. Muscle wasting and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are the most common clinical signs that can lead to cardiac and respiratory failure within the first year of age in the more severe infantile forms. Currently available treatments have significant limitations and are not curative, highlighting a need for the development of alternative therapies. In this study, we investigated the use of a clinically relevant lentiviral vector to deliver systemically GAA through genetic modification of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The overexpression of GAA in human HSPCs did not exert any toxic effect on this cell population, which conserved its stem cell capacity in xenograft experiments. In a murine model of Pompe disease treated at young age, we observed phenotypic correction of heart and muscle function with a significant reduction of glycogen accumulation in tissues after 6 months of treatment. These findings suggest that lentiviral-mediated HSPC gene therapy can be a safe alternative therapy for Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the GAA gene, localized on chromosome 17 and encoding for acid alpha-1,4-glucosidase (GAA). Currently, more than 560 mutations spread throughout <i>GAA</i> gene have been reported. GAA catalyzes the hydrolysis of α-1,4 and α-1,6-glucosidic bonds of glycogen and its deficiency leads to lysosomal storage of glycogen in several tissues, particularly in muscle. PD is a chronic and progressive pathology usually characterized by limb-girdle muscle weakness and respiratory failure. PD is classified as infantile and childhood/adult forms. PD patients exhibit a multisystemic manifestation that depends on age of onset.Early diagnosis is essential to prevent or reduce the irreversible organ damage associated with PD progression. Here, we make an overview of PD focusing on pathogenesis, clinical phenotypes, molecular genetics, diagnosis, therapies, autophagy and the role of miRNAs as potential biomarkers for PD."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Early and precise diagnosis can be highly important for the treatment, genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis of this disease in potential candidates. Considering that Pompe disease studies have not been frequently conduced in China, to better understand the clinical course and molecular defects among this group, our study examined 21 Chinese patients with classic infantile Pompe disease. The median age of symptom onset in the patients was 2.5 months (0-7 months), and the median age of confirmed diagnosis was 5.6 months (2-12 months). GAA gene mutation analysis revealed 17 different mutations, two of which were novel (c.538C>A and c.2096T>C). The most frequent mutation in these patients was c.1935C>A, accounting for 40.5% (17/42 alleles) of the mutations. These results confirm the high prevalence of the c.1935C>A mutation in Chinese patients with classic infantile Pompe disease. Furthermore, identification of the novel alterations in the GAA gene will help to broaden the spectrum of the GAA mutations causing Pompe disease and to better understand the potential pathogenic role of each change."

Spirometry, MIP, MEP and capillary blood gas analysis were obtained from patients with confirmed neuromuscular disorders. We calculated regression analysis, sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. We enrolled 29 patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), 19 with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), and 24 with spinal muscular atrophy type 3. Moderate to high reduction in manometry was exclusively found in LOPD and DM1 patients. Significant associations were found between manometry and spirometry. Highest adjusted r<sup>2</sup> was found for MIP % predicted and forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted. Manometry predicted abnormal FVC and forced expiratory volume 1 s (FEV1). MEP > 80 cmH<sub>2</sub>O predicted normal FVC and FEV1, regardless of cut-off values. MIP and MEP did not positively predict alterations in capillary blood gas analysis. Disease-specific cut-offs of manometry did not increase the prediction rate of patients with abnormal FVC and FEV1. Predicted values should be calculated for a more comprehensive interpretation of manometry results. MIP and MEP can serve as a screening parameter for patients with neuromuscular disorders, but parallel testing of both MIP and MEP needs to be performed to increase the positive prediction probability across disease groups."

    "abstract": "Immune modulation with rituximab, methotrexate, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has shown great success in inducing immune tolerance in a large cohort of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)-naïve infantile Pompe disease patients. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, the principal mechanism by which rituximab depletes B-cells, requires CD20 binding by Fab'2 of rituximab on B-cells and the concomitant binding of its Fc region to Fc receptors on effector cells or to complement. To protect patients against microbial infections when using rituximab, IVIG was added to the immunomodulation regimen used in Pompe disease. Administration of IVIG can saturate neonatal Fc receptors (FcRn), which recycle endogenous as well as administered polyclonal/monoclonal antibodies via the binding of the Fc moiety to FcRn. As such, the administration of IVIG prior to rituximab, a chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody, may sharply reduce the half-life of rituximab and in turn, its efficacy. Based on this understanding, it is vital to understand the optimal timing of IVIG administration in relation to rituximab administration for the purposes of inducing immune tolerance."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease, a deficiency of glycogen-degrading lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), is a disabling multisystemic illness that invariably affects skeletal muscle in all patients. The patients still carry a heavy burden of the disease, despite the currently available enzyme replacement therapy. We have previously shown that progressive entrapment of glycogen in the lysosome in muscle sets in motion a whole series of \"extra-lysosomal\" events including defective autophagy and disruption of a variety of signaling pathways. Here, we report that metabolic abnormalities and energy deficit also contribute to the complexity of the pathogenic cascade. A decrease in the metabolites of the glycolytic pathway and a shift to lipids as the energy source are observed in the diseased muscle. We now demonstrate in a pre-clinical study that a recently developed replacement enzyme (recombinant human GAA; AT-GAA; Amicus Therapeutics) with much improved lysosome-targeting properties reversed or significantly improved all aspects of the disease pathogenesis, an outcome not observed with the current standard of care. The therapy was initiated in GAA-deficient mice with fully developed muscle pathology but without obvious clinical symptoms; this point deserves consideration."

PD has two forms, namely the infantile-onset and the late-onset form. In untreated cases, infantile-onset form usually leads to cardio-respiratory failure and death in the first year of life. Herein, we report a newborn with infantile-onset PD characterized by muscular hypotonia, respiratory distress, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly, elevated serum enzyme levels of aspartate aminotransferase of 117 IU/L (three times the normal value), alanine aminotransferase of 66 IU/L (1.8 times the normal value), lactate dehydrogenase of 558 IU/L (1.2 times the normal value), and creatine kinase >5,000 IU/L (16 times the normal value). Dried blood spot testing was performed and revealed decreased GAA enzymatic activity (0.07 nmol/mL/h, normal 0.93-7.33 nmol/mL/h). <i>GAA</i> gene analysis performed for confirming the diagnosis showed homozygous mutation c.896T >C (p.Leu299Pro). Initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) (ERT; 20 mg/kg, once every week) at 28 days of age resulted in weaning off from respiratory support within 1 week after treatment, normalization of cardiac abnormalities, and normal neuromotor development in the 16th month of age. Early diagnosis and early treatment with ERT, especially in the neonatal period, is of great importance to improve cardiac function and motor development in infantile-onset PD."

The quantitative mDTI-values axial diffusivity (λ<sub>1</sub> ), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) as well as fat-fraction were analyzed. 6-Minute Walk Test (6-MWT) data were correlated to diffusion metrics. We found that mDTI showed significant differences between LOPD and HC in diffusion parameters (P < .05). Thigh muscles with <10% fat-fraction showed significant differences in MD, RD, and λ<sub>1-3</sub> . MD positively correlated with 6-MWT (P = .06).

Patient demographics, average lengths of stay and legal frameworks also differ substantially. The lack of basic epidemiological information on forensic patients and of shared indicators on forensic care within Europe is an obstacle to comparative research. The reasons for such variation are not well understood. Experts from seventeen EU states submitted data on forensic bed prevalence rates, gender distributions and average length of stay in forensic in-patient facilities. Average length of stay and bed prevalence rates were examined for associations with country-level variables including Gross Domestic Product (GDP), expenditure on healthcare, prison population, general psychiatric bed prevalence rates and democracy index scores. The data demonstrated substantial differences between states. Average length of stay was approximately ten times greater in the Netherlands than Slovenia. In England and Wales, 18% of patients were female compared to 5% in Slovenia. There was a 17-fold difference in forensic bed rates per 100,000 between the Netherlands and Spain. Exploratory analyses suggested average length of stay was associated with GDP, expenditure on healthcare and democracy index scores. The data presented in this study represent the most recent overview of key epidemiological data in forensic services across seventeen EU states. However, systematically collected epidemiological data of good quality remain elusive in forensic psychiatry. States need to develop common definitions and recording practices and contribute to a publicly available database of such epidemiological indicators."

    "abstract": "Intracranial arterial dolichoectasia (IADE), also known as dilatative arteriopathy of the brain vessels, refers to an increase in the length and diameter of at least one intracranial artery, and accounts for approximately 12% of all patients with stroke. However, the association of IADE with stroke is usually unclear. Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is characterized by pathological changes in the small vessels. Clinically, patients with CSVD can be asymptomatic or present with stroke or cognitive decline. In the past 20 years, a series of studies have strongly promoted an understanding of the association between IADE and CSVD from clinical and pathological perspectives. It has been proposed that IADE and CSVD may be attributed to abnormal vascular remodeling driven by an abnormal matrix metalloproteinase/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase pathway. Also, IADErelated hemodynamic changes may result in initiation or progression of CSVD. Additionally, genetic factors are implicated in the pathogenesis of IADE and CSVD. Patients with Fabry's disease and late-onset Pompe's disease are prone to developing concomitant IADE and CSVD, and patients with collagen IV alpha 1 or 2 gene (COL4A1/COL4A2) and forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) variants present with IADE and CSVD. Race, strain, familial status, and vascular risk factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of IADE and CSVD. As well, experiments in mice have pointed to genetic strain as a predisposing factor for IADE and CSVD. However, there have been few direct genetic studies aimed towards determining the association between IADE and CSVD. In the future, more clinical and basic research studies are needed to elucidate the causal relationship between IADE and CSVD and the related molecular and genetic mechanisms."

The currently available murine model does not fully simulate human IOPD, displaying skeletal myopathy with late-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Bearing a Cre-LoxP induced exonic disruption of the murine Gaa gene, this model is also not amenable to genome-editing based therapeutic approaches. We report the early onset of severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a novel murine IOPD model generated utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 homology-directed recombination to harbor the orthologous Gaa mutation c.1826dupA (p.Y609*), which causes human IOPD. We demonstrate the dual sgRNA approach with a single-stranded oligonucleotide donor is highly specific for the Gaa<sup>c.1826</sup> locus without genomic off-target effects or rearrangements. Cardiac and skeletal muscle were deficient in Gaa mRNA and enzymatic activity and accumulated high levels of glycogen. The mice demonstrated skeletal muscle weakness but did not experience early mortality. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the CRISPR-Cas9 generated Gaa<sup>c.1826dupA</sup> murine model recapitulates hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle weakness of human IOPD, indicating its utility for evaluation of novel therapeutics."

In this paper, we are presenting the long term follow up of 13 adult onset cases treated more than 5 years. The longest follow up was 15 years. To evaluate the treatment efficacy, the 6 minutes walking test (6MWT) and the respiratory functions were monitored annually. The analysis revealed that at the beginning of ERT for 3-4 years the 6MWT had been generally increasing, then it declined, and after 10 years it was lower in 77% of the cases than it had been at the start of the treatment. In 23% of the cases the 6MWT increased during the follow up time. Only one of the patients become wheelchair dependent during the follow-up period. The respiratory function showed similar results especially in supine position. A high degree of variability was observed among patients in their responses to the treatment, which only partially associated with the antibody titer against the therapeutic protein. The efficacy of the ERT was associated with the type of the disease causing mutation, the baseline status of the disease, the lifestyle and the diet of the patient.

We previously reported full rescue of Pompe disease in symptomatic 4-month-old Gaa knockout (Gaa<sup>-/-</sup>) mice by adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated liver gene transfer of an engineered secretable form of GAA (secGAA). Here, we showed that hepatic expression of secGAA rescues the phenotype of 4-month-old Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> mice at vector doses at which the native form of GAA has little to no therapeutic effect. Based on these results, we then treated severely affected 9-month-old Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> mice with an AAV vector expressing secGAA and followed the animals for 9 months thereafter. AAV-treated Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed complete reversal of the Pompe phenotype, with rescue of glycogen accumulation in most tissues, including the central nervous system, and normalization of muscle strength. Transcriptomic profiling of skeletal muscle showed rescue of most altered pathways, including those involved in mitochondrial defects, a finding supported by structural and biochemical analyses, which also showed restoration of lysosomal function. Together, these results provide insight into the reversibility of advanced Pompe disease in the Gaa<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model via liver gene transfer of secGAA."

Longitudinal FVC data from LOPD (symptom onset > 12 months or ≤ 12 months without cardiomyopathy) patients were analyzed. Patients had to have baseline FVC (percent predicted upright) assessments at ERT start and ≥ 2 valid post-baseline assessments. Longitudinal analyses used linear mixed-regression models. Among 396 eligible patients, median baseline FVC was 66.9% (range 9.3-126.0). FVC remained stable during the 5-year follow-up (slope = - 0.17%, p = 0.21). Baseline FVC was lower among various subgroups, including patients who were male; older at ERT initiation; had a longer duration from symptom onset to ERT initiation; and had more advanced disease at baseline (based on respiratory support use, inability to ambulate, ambulation device use). Age at symptom onset was not associated with baseline degree of respiratory dysfunction. Differences between subgroups observed at baseline remained during follow-up. Shorter time from diagnosis to ERT initiation was associated with higher FVC after 5 years in all patients and the above subgroups using a cut-off of 1.7 years. FVC stability over 5 years suggests that respiratory function is preserved during long-term ERT in real-world settings. Early initiation of alglucosidase alfa was associated with preservation of FVC in LOPD patients with better respiratory function at the time of treatment initiation."

White matter (WM) hyperintense foci seen in the brain MRIs were systematically quantified using the Fazekas scale (FS) grading system with a novel approach: the individual FS scores from 10 anatomical areas were summed to yield a total FS score (range absent [0] to severe [30]) for each child. The FS scores were compared to developmental assessments of cognition and language obtained during the same time period. Mild to severe WM hyperintense foci were seen in 10/12 children with IPD (median age 10.6 years) with total FS scores ranging from 2 to 23. Periventricular, subcortical, and deep WM were involved. WM hyperintense foci were seen throughout the path of the corticospinal tracts in the brain in children with IPD. Two children with IPD had no WM hyperintense foci. Children with IPD had relative weaknesses in processing speed, fluid reasoning, visual perception, and receptive vocabulary. The 2 children with LOPD had no WM hyperintense foci, and high scores on most developmental assessments.

    "abstract": "Despite a wide clinical spectrum, the adult form of Pompe disease is the most common one, and represents more than 90% of diagnosed patients in France. Since the marketing of enzyme replacement therapy (alglucosidase alfa, Myozyme), all reports to date in adults demonstrated an improvement of the walking distance, and a trend toward stabilization of respiratory function, but the majority of these studies were less than 5 years of duration. We report here the findings from 158 treated patients included in the French Pompe Registry, who underwent regular clinical assessments based on commonly used standardized tests (6-minute walking test, MFM scale, sitting vital capacity, MIP and MEP). For longitudinal analyses, the linear mixed effects models were used to assess trends in primary endpoints over time under ERT. A two-phase model better described the changes in distance traveled in the 6-minute walk test and MFM. 6MWT showed an initial significant increase (1.4% ± 0.5/year) followed by a progressive decline (-2.3%/year), with a cut-off point at 2.2 years. A similar pattern was observed in total MFM score (6.6% ± 2.3/year followed by a - 1.1%/year decline after 0.5 years). A single-phase decline with a slope of -0.9 ± 0.1%/year (P < .001) was observed for FVC, and MEP remained stable over the all duration of follow-up. This study provides further evidence that ERT improves walking abilities and likely stabilizes respiratory function in adult patients with Pompe disease, with a ceiling effect for the 6MWT in the first 3 years of treatment."

    "abstract": "The development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) is a common cause for treatment failure and hypersensitivity reactions for many biologics. The focus of this review is the development of ImmTOR, a platform technology designed to prevent the formation of ADAs that can be applied broadly across a wide variety of biologics by inducing immunological tolerance with ImmTOR nanoparticles encapsulating rapamycin. The induction of tolerance is antigen-specific and dependent on the incorporation of rapamycin in nanoparticles and the presence of the antigen at the time of administration of ImmTOR. Evidence for the induction of specific immune tolerance vs. general immune suppression is supported by the findings that: (1) ImmTOR induces regulatory T cells specific to the co-administered antigen; (2) tolerance can be transferred by adoptive transfer of splenocytes from treated animals to naïve recipients; (3) the tolerance is durable to subsequent challenge with antigen alone; and (4) animals tolerized to a specific antigen are capable of responding to an unrelated antigen. ImmTOR nanoparticles can be added to new or existing biologics without the need to modify or reformulate the biologic drug. The ability of ImmTOR to mitigate the formation of ADAs has been demonstrated for coagulation factor VIII in a mouse model of hemophilia A, an anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis, pegylated uricase in hyperuricemic mice and in non-human primates, acid alpha-glucosidase in a mouse model of Pompe disease, recombinant immunotoxin in a mouse model of mesothelioma, and adeno-associated vectors in a model of repeat dosing of gene therapy vectors in mice and in non-human primates. Human proof-of concept for the mitigation of ADAs has been demonstrated with SEL-212, a combination product consisting of ImmTOR + pegadricase, a highly immunogenic enzyme therapy for the treatment of gout. ImmTOR represents a promising approach to preventing the formation of ADAs to a broad range of biologic drugs."

Six patients received 20 mg/kg eow and twelve 40 mg/kg/week. Five patients were cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM)-negative, two in the 20 mg, three in the 40 mg group. We compared (ventilator-free) survival, motor outcome, infusion associated reactions (IARs), and antibody formation. From 2012 on patients >2 months in the 40 mg group also received immunomodulation with rituximab, methotrexate, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)-naïve setting. Survival was 66% in the 20 mg group and 92% in the 40 mg group. Ventilator-free survival was 50% and 92%. Both CRIM-negative patients in the 20 mg group died, whereas all three are alive in the 40 mg group. In the 20 mg group, 67% learned to walk compared with 92% in the 40 mg group. At the age of 3 years, 33% and 92% were able to walk. Peak antibody titers ranged from 1:1250 to 1:31 250 in the 20 mg group and from 1:250 to 1:800 000 in the 40 mg group. Five patients of the 40 mg group of whom two CRIM-negative also received immunomodulation. B-cell recovery was observed between 5.7 and 7.9 months after the last dose of rituximab. After B-cell recovery titers of patients with and without immunomodulation were similar (ranges 1:6 250-1:800 000 and 1:250-1:781 250). This study shows that classic infantile patients treated with 40 mg/kg/week from the start to end have a better (ventilator-free) survival and motor outcome. Immunomodulation did not prevent antibody formation in our study."

    "abstract": "Late onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a lysosomal neuromuscular disorder which can progressively impair the patients' exercise tolerance, motor and respiratory functions, and quality of life. The available enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) does not completely counteract disease progression. We investigated the effect of exercise training alone, or associated with a high-protein diet, on the exercise tolerance, muscle and pulmonary functions, and quality of life of LOPD patients on long term ERT. The patients were asked to participate to a crossover randomized study comprehending a control period (free diet, no exercise) followed by 2 intervention periods: exercise or exercise + diet, each lasting 26 weeks and separated by 13 weeks washout periods. Exercise training included moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on a cycle ergometer, stretching and balance exercises, strength training. The diet was composed by 25-30% protein, 30-35% carbohydrate and 35-40% fat. Before and after each period patients were assessed for: exercise tolerance test on a cycle-ergometer, serum muscle enzymes, pulmonary function tests and SF36 questionnaire for quality of life. Compliance was evaluated by training and dietary diaries. Patients were contacted weekly by researchers to optimize adherence to treatments. Thirteen LOPD patients, median age 49 ± 11 years, under chronic ERT (median 6.0 ± 4.0 years) were recruited. Peak aerobic power (peak pulmonary O<sub>2</sub> uptake) decreased after control, whereas it increased after exercise, and more markedlyafter exercise + diet. Serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) significantly decreased after exercise + diet; both creatine kinase (CK) and LDH levels were significantly reduced after exercise + diet compared to exercise. Pulmonary function showed no changes after control and exercise, whereas a significant improvement of forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) was observed after exercise + diet. SF36 showed a slight improvement in the \"mental component\" scale after exercise, and a significant improvement in \"general health\" and \"vitality\" after exercise + diet. The compliance to prescriptions was higher than 70% for both diet and exercise. Exercise tolerance (as evaluated by peak aerobic power) showed a tendency to decrease in LOPD patients on long term ERT. Exercise training, particularly if combined with high-protein diet, could reverse this decrease and result in an improvement, which was accompanied by improved quality of life. The association of the two lifestyle interventions resulted also in a reduction of muscle enzyme levels and improved pulmonary function."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a rare autosomal recessive multi-systemic lysosomal storage disorder, caused by mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) gene located on 17q25.2-q25.3. It is one of about 50 rare genetic diseases categorized as lysosomal storage disorders. This disease is characterized by a range of different symptoms related to acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency. Mutation recognition in the GAA gene can be very significant for purposes such as therapeutic interference, early diagnosis and genotype-phenotype relationship. In the current study, peripheral blood samples were gathered from patients with PD and healthy members of three families. Enzymatic activity of GAA was checked. Then, mutation detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing of all exons in samples with decreased enzyme activity. The identified mutations were investigated using bioinformatics tools to predict possible effects on the protein product and also to compare the mutated sequence with near species. Three novel mutations (c.1966-1968delGAG, c.2011-2012delAT and c.1475-1481dupACCCCAC) were identified in the GAA gene. Assessment of the effects of these mutations on protein structure and function showed the possibility of harmful effects and their significant alterations in the protein structure. The three novel GAA gene mutations detected in this study expand the information about the molecular genetics of PD and can be used to helpdiagnosis and genetic counseling of affected families."

    "title": "Exocytosis of Progeny Infectious Varicella-Zoster Virus Particles via a Mannose-6-Phosphate Receptor Pathway without Xenophagy following Secondary Envelopment.",
    "abstract": "The literature on the egress of different herpesviruses after secondary envelopment is contradictory. In this report, we investigated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) egress in a cell line from a child with Pompe disease, a glycogen storage disease caused by a defect in the enzyme required for glycogen digestion. In Pompe cells, both the late autophagy pathway and the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) pathway are interrupted. We have postulated that intact autophagic flux is required for higher recoveries of VZV infectivity. To test that hypothesis, we infected Pompe cells and then assessed the VZV infectious cycle. We discovered that the infectious cycle in Pompe cells was remarkably different from that of either fibroblasts or melanoma cells. No large late endosomes filled with VZV particles were observed in Pompe cells; only individual viral particles in small vacuoles were seen. The distribution of the M6PR pathway (<i>trans</i>-Golgi network to late endosomes) was constrained in infected Pompe cells. When cells were analyzed with two different anti-M6PR antibodies, extensive colocalization of the major VZV glycoprotein gE (known to contain M6P residues) and the M6P receptor (M6PR) was documented in the viral highways at the surfaces of non-Pompe cells after maximum-intensity projection of confocal z-stacks, but neither gE nor the M6PR was seen in abundance at the surfaces of infected Pompe cells. Taken together, our results suggested that (i) Pompe cells lack a VZV trafficking pathway within M6PR-positive large endosomes and (ii) most infectious VZV particles in conventional cell substrates are transported via large M6PR-positive vacuoles without degradative xenophagy to the plasma membrane.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The long-term goal of this research has been to determine why VZV, when grown in cultured cells, invariably is more cell associated and has a lower titer than other alphaherpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) or pseudorabies virus (PRV). Data from both HSV1 and PRV laboratories have identified a Rab6 secretory pathway for the transport of single enveloped viral particles from the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network within small vacuoles to the plasma membrane. In contrast, after secondary envelopment in fibroblasts or melanoma cells, multiple infectious VZV particles accumulated within large M6PR-positive late endosomes that were not degraded en route to the plasma membrane. We propose that this M6PR pathway is most utilized in VZV infection and least utilized in HSV1 infection, with PRV's usage being closer to HSV1's usage. Supportive data from other VZV, PRV, and HSV1 laboratories about evidence for two egress pathways are included."

    "abstract": "Muscle disorders are characterized by differential involvement of various muscle groups. Among these, weakness predominantly affecting finger flexors is an uncommon pattern, most frequently found in sporadic inclusion-body myositis. This finding is particularly significant when the full range of histopathological findings of inclusion-body myositis is not found on muscle biopsy. Prominent finger flexor weakness, however, is also observed in other myopathies. It occurs commonly in myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2. In addition, individual reports and small case series have documented finger flexor weakness in sarcoid and amyloid myopathy, and in inherited myopathies caused by ACTA1, CRYAB, DMD, DYSF, FLNC, GAA, GNE, HNRNPDL, LAMA2, MYH7, and VCP mutations. Therefore, the finding of finger flexor weakness requires consideration of clinical, myopathological, genetic, electrodiagnostic, and sometimes muscle imaging findings to establish a diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of genetic disorders characterized by deficiency of specific lysosomal enzymes. In general, patients are clinically normal at birth, and progressively develop severe signs and symptoms. Diagnosis is usually made several years after onset of manifestations, preventing patients to have the benefits of the early treatment. Newborn screening programs are being considered for LSDs to allow early diagnosis and treatment. The present study evaluated the feasibility of a customized screening approach based on modified fluorometric assays with reduced amounts of reagents, substrates and samples for: mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type I (MPS I), MPS VI, Fabry, Gaucher, and Pompe diseases. We also evaluated the advantages of including blood chitotriosidase and urinary glycosaminoglycans in the protocol. By the measurement of the specific disease-associated enzymes (plus blood chitotriosidase and urinary glycosaminoglycans) we analyzed 834 de-identified DBS of unselected newborns. No positive case was detected, and the false-positive rates were low. Taking into consideration the limitations of this methodology, we believe that, after defining proper cutoffs, it could be a viable alternative to provide NBS for LSDs by laboratories that may not be able to afford the commercial methods available."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness. The disease is caused by mutations in the acid α-glucosidase (GAA) gene. Despite the currently available enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), roughly half of the infants with Pompe disease die before the age of 3 years. Limitations of ERT are immune responses to the recombinant enzyme, incomplete correction of the disease phenotype, lifelong administration, and inability of the enzyme to cross the blood-brain barrier. We previously reported normalization of glycogen in heart tissue and partial correction of the skeletal muscle phenotype by <i>ex vivo</i> hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy. In the present study, using a codon-optimized <i>GAA</i> (<i>GAAco</i>), the enzyme levels resulted in close to normalization of glycogen in heart, muscles, and brain, and in complete normalization of motor function. A large proportion of microglia in the brain was shown to be GAA positive. All astrocytes contained the enzyme, which is in line with mannose-6-phosphate receptor expression and the key role in glycogen storage and glucose metabolism. The lentiviral vector insertion site analysis confirmed no preference for integration near proto-oncogenes. This correction of murine Pompe disease warrants further development toward a cure of the human condition."

    "abstract": "The current phase I/II clinical trial for human glycogen storage disease type-Ia (GSD-Ia) (NCT03517085) uses a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector expressing a codon-optimized human glucose-6-phosphatase-α (G6Pase-α or G6PC). DNA sequence changes introduced by codon-optimization can negatively impact gene expression. We therefore generated a novel variant in which a single amino acid change, S298C, is introduced into the native human G6PC sequence. Short term gene transfer study in G6pc-/- mice showed that the rAAV-G6PC-S298C vector is 3-fold more efficacious than the native rAAV-G6PC vector. We have shown previously that restoring 3% of normal hepatic G6Pase-α activity in G6pc-/- mice prevents hepatocellular adenoma/carcinoma (HCA/HCC) development and that mice harboring <3% of normal hepatic G6Pase-α activity are at risk of tumor development. We have also shown that G6Pase-α deficiency leads to hepatic autophagy impairment that can contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. We now undertake a long-term (66-week) preclinical characterization of the rAAV-G6PC-S298C vector in GSD-Ia gene therapy. We show that the increased efficacy of rAAV-G6PC-S298C has enabled the G6pc-/- mice treated with a lower dose of this vector to survive long-term. We further show that mice expressing ≥3% of normal hepatic G6Pase-α activity do not develop hepatic tumors or autophagy impairment but mice expressing <3% of normal hepatic G6Pase-α activity display impaired hepatic autophagy with one developing HCA/HCC nodules. Our study shows that the rAAV-G6PC-S298C vector provides equal or greater efficacy to the codon optimization approach, offering a valuable alternative vector for clinical translation in human GSD-Ia."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are rare inherited metabolic diseases characterized by an abnormal accumulation of various toxic materials in the cells as a result of enzyme deficiencies leading to tissue and organ damage. Among clinical manifestations, cardiac diseases are particularly important in Pompe glycogen storage diseases (PD), in glycosphingolipidosis Fabry disease (FD), and mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). Here, we evaluated the occurrence of aortopathy in knock out (KO) mouse models of three different LSDs, including PD, FD, and MPS IIIB. We measured the aortic diameters in 15 KO male mice, 5 for each LSD: 5 GLA-/- mice for FD, 5 NAGLU-/- mice for MPS IIIB, 5 GAA-/- mice for PD, and 15 wild type (WT) mice: 5 for each strain. In order to compare the aortic parameters between KO and WT mice deriving from the same colonies, different diameters were echocardiographically measured: aortic annulus, aortic sinus, sino-tubular junction, ascending aorta, aortic arch and descending aorta. Storage material content and aortic defects of the KO mice were also analyzed by histology, when available. Compared to their correspondent WT mice: GAA-/- mice showed greater diameters of ascending aorta (1.61mm vs. 1.11mm, p-value = 0.01) and descending aorta (1.17mm vs 1.02mm, p-value 0.04); GLA-/- mice showed greater diameters of aortic annulus (1.35mm vs. 1.22mm, p-value = 0.01), sinus of Valsalva (1.6mm vs. 1.38mm, p-value<0.01), ascending aorta (1.57mm vs. 1.34mm, p-value<0.01), aortic arch (1.36mm vs. 1.22mm, p-value = 0.03) and descending aorta (1.29mm vs. 1.11mm, p-value<0.01); NAGLU-/- mice showed greater diameters of sinus of Valsalva (1.46mm vs. 1.31mm, p-value = 0.05), ascending aorta (1.42mm vs. 1.29mm, p-value<0.01), aortic arch (1.34mm vs. 1.28mm, p-value<0.01) and descending aorta (1.18mm vs. 1.1mm, p-value 0.01). We evaluated for the first time the aortic diameters in 3 LSD mouse models and identified different aortopathy patterns, in concordance with recent human findings. Our results are relevant in view of using KO mouse models for efficiently testing the efficacy of new therapies on distinct cardiovascular aspects of LSDs."

    "title": "Differential diagnosis of vacuolar myopathies in the NGS era.",
    "abstract": "Altered autophagy accompanied by abnormal autophagic (rimmed) vacuoles detectable by light and electron microscopy is a common denominator of many familial and sporadic non-inflammatory muscle diseases. Even in the era of next generation sequencing (NGS), late-onset vacuolar myopathies remain a diagnostic challenge. We identified 32 adult vacuolar myopathy patients from 30 unrelated families, studied their clinical, histopathological and ultrastructural characteristics and performed genetic testing in index patients and relatives using Sanger sequencing and NGS including whole exome sequencing (WES). We established a molecular genetic diagnosis in 17 patients. Pathogenic mutations were found in genes typically linked to vacuolar myopathy (GNE, LDB3/ZASP, MYOT, DES and GAA), but also in genes not regularly associated with severely altered autophagy (FKRP, DYSF, CAV3, COL6A2, GYG1 and TRIM32) and in the digenic facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy 2. Characteristic histopathological features including distinct patterns of myofibrillar disarray and evidence of exocytosis proved to be helpful to distinguish causes of vacuolar myopathies. Biopsy validated the pathogenicity of the novel mutations p.(Phe55*) and p.(Arg216*) in GYG1 and of the p.(Leu156Pro) TRIM32 mutation combined with compound heterozygous deletion of exon 2 of TRIM32 and expanded the phenotype of Ala93Thr-caveolinopathy and of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2i caused by FKRP mutation. In 15 patients no causal variants were detected by Sanger sequencing and NGS panel analysis. In 12 of these cases, WES was performed, but did not yield any definite mutation or likely candidate gene. In one of these patients with a family history of muscle weakness, the vacuolar myopathy was eventually linked to chloroquine therapy. Our study illustrates the wide phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity of vacuolar myopathies and validates the role of histopathology in assessing the pathogenicity of novel mutations detected by NGS. In a sizable portion of vacuolar myopathy cases, it remains to be shown whether the cause is hereditary or degenerative."

    "abstract": "Pompe Disease is a spectrum disorder with an evolving phenotype in which diagnostic delay is common. Contributing factors include the rarity of the disorder, its wide clinical spectrum, signs and symptoms that overlap with those of other neuromuscular disorders, variable diagnostic approaches, lack of awareness of the clinical manifestations and difficulties in completing the diagnostic inventory. International updates and recommendations have been published providing diagnostic guidelines and management criteria. However, questions remain in the Australian setting. A panel (two neurologists, one clinical geneticist) reviewed the literature, examined clinical questions of relevance to the Australian setting, and developed a framework for the guidance. A wider panel, comprising the initial panel plus eight additional members, critiqued the framework and contributed clinical guidance within the scope of their respective areas of clinical expertise. The resultant expert consensus recommendations build on currently available data to propose an appropriate management framework incorporating the diagnosis, classification, therapeutic approach, multidisciplinary care, and on-going monitoring of patients with Pompe Disease in the Australian setting. It is hoped that diagnostic delay can be reduced with appropriate recourse to evidence-based insights and practical advice on diagnosis and management tailored to the Australian setting."

The purpose of this study was to expand on existing data and present new findings of speech acoustic and physiologic outcomes in Pompe disease. A retrospective analysis was carried out on results of speech, language and oromotor tests carried out in 14 children diagnosed with Pompe disease. The assessment battery included standardized tests of language, picture naming, maximum performance tests, and oromotor resistance tasks. Speech production was scored with respect to intelligibility, hypernasality, and articulatory accuracy. Language delays ranged from mild to severe in 1/3 of the children. Reduced speech intelligibility, disordered articulation, and hypernasality were present in at least 2/3 of the children. Maximum performance tests all fell at least 1 SD below normative means. Significant correlations were identified between maximum phonation time and articulation and between the S/Z ratio and intelligibility. Positive correlations were also found between tongue strength and articulation. Results confirm previous reports of speech and language function in Pompe disease. Clinical acoustic measures provide important insights into the speech deficits in this group of children and suggest possible treatment strategies."

We report the clinical and biochemical outcomes of a cohort of IOPD patients identified through newborn screening, and evaluating the dosage effect. A retrospective observational study was designed to describe the long-term clinical and biochemical outcomes of a uniform cohort of IOPD patients who have been treated with high-dosage of ERT. Twenty-eight patients received alglucosidase alpha at either the labeled dosage followed by a high dosage (<i>n</i> = 23) or a high dosage exclusively (<i>n</i> = 5). At a median age of 8.3 years (0.8-17.3), 15 patients were walkers, 8 were weak walkers, and 5 were nonwalkers.

In patients with classical IOPD diagnosed through newborn screening, those late in ERT initiation (<i>p</i> = .006) or late in high-dosage ERT initiation (<i>p</i> = .044) had a higher risk of motor decline. At the latest assessment, both serum creatine kinase (CK) and urinary glucose tetrasaccharide (uGlc4) levels were lowest in the walkers. During follow up, the biomarker levels, once rose, never returned to normal. Low CK and uGlc4 levels were correlated with favorable response to ERT in IOPD patients, although CK may be more fluctuated than uGlc4. High-dose ERT instituted immediately at newborn screening seems to give the best outcome, and a dosage increase is necessary upon - or, even better, before - a rise in biomarker levels."

This represents a limit for the monitoring of disease progression and treatment response. Our aim was to identify the most appropriate OMs to be translated in clinical practice and clinical trials on DM2. This study has been registered on clinicaltrials.gov NCT03603171 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03603171). <b>Methods:</b> Sixty-six patients with genetically confirmed DM2 underwent a baseline and a follow-up visit after 1 year. The tested OMs included: hand opening time, pressure pain threshold (PPT), manual muscle testing (MMT), hand held dynamometry (HHD), scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), quantitative motor function test (QMFT), gait stairs Gowers chair (GSGC), 30-s sit to stand test, functional index 2 (FI-2) and 6MWT. The PROs included DM1-Active-C, Rasch-built Pompe-specific activity scale (R-Pact), fatigue and daytime sleepiness (FDSS), brief pain inventory short form (BPI-sf), myotonia behavior scale (MBS), and the McGill pain questionnaire. <b>Results:</b> All patients completed the MBS and the results correlated well with the hand-opening time. The PPT showed a low reliability, no correlation with pain questionnaires, and did not differentiate patients with or without myalgia. Both muscle strength assessments, MMT and HHD, showed good construct validity. The QMFT showed an acceptable ceiling effect (14.5%), good convergent and differential validity and performed overall better than GSGC. The SARA score showed high flooring effect and is not useful in DM2. 6MWT proved a valid outcome measure in DM2. The 30-s sit to stand is a feasible test with good convergent validity, showing a flooring effect of 20% as it cannot be used in more severely affected patients. The FI-2 is time-consuming and has a high ceiling effect. At the 1-year visit the only assessments able to detect a worsening of DM2 were HHD, QMFT, and 6MWT, which are the most sensitive to change, and therefore clinically meaningful OMs in DM2. <b>Conclusion:</b> The clinical meaningful motor outcome measures that best depict the multifaceted phenotype of DM2 and its slow progression are MBS, MMT, or HHD (depending on the clinical setting), QMFT, and the 6MWT."

However, this biomarker is inconstantly increased in mild forms and in some female patients. <i>Materials and</i> <i>Methods</i>: We applied a targeted proteomic approach to explore disease-related biological patterns that might explain the disease pathophysiology. Forty proteins, involved mainly in inflammatory and angiogenesis processes, were assessed in 69 plasma samples retrieved from the French Fabry cohort (FFABRY) and from 83 healthy subjects. For predictive performance assessment, we also included other LD samples (Gaucher, Pompe and Niemann Pick C). <i>Results</i>: The study yielded four discriminant proteins that include three angiogenesis proteins (fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC)) and one cytokine interleukin 7 (IL-7). A clear elevation of FGF2 and IL-7 concentrations was observed in FD compared to other LD samples. No correlation was observed between these proteins and globotriaosylsphingosine (LysoGb3). A significant correlation exists between IL-7 and residual enzyme activity in a non-classical phenotype. This highlights the orthogonal biological information yielded by these proteins that might help in stratifying Fabry patients. <i>Conclusion</i>: This work highlights the potential of using proteomics approaches in exploring FD and enhancing FD diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring performances."

    "abstract": "In France, the epidemic phase of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in February 2020 and resulted in the implementation of emergency measures and a degradation in the organization of neuromuscular reference centers. In this special context, the French Rare Health Care for Neuromuscular Diseases Network (FILNEMUS) has established guidance in an attempt to homogenize the management of neuromuscular (NM) patients within the French territory. Hospitalization should be reserved for emergencies, the conduct of treatments that cannot be postponed, check-ups for which the diagnostic delay may result in a loss of survival chance, and cardiorespiratory assessments for which the delay could be detrimental to the patient. A national strategy was adopted during a period of 1 to 2months concerning treatments usually administered in hospitalization. NM patients treated with steroid/immunosuppressants for a dysimmune pathology should continue all of their treatments in the absence of any manifestations suggestive of COVID-19. A frequently asked questions (FAQ) sheet has been compiled and updated on the FILNEMUS website. Various support systems for self-rehabilitation and guided exercises have been also provided on the website. In the context of NM diseases, particular attention must be paid to two experimental COVID-19 treatments, hydroxycholoroquine and azithromycin: risk of exacerbation of myasthenia gravis and QT prolongation in patients with pre-existing cardiac involvement. The unfavorable emergency context related to COVID-19 may specially affect the potential for intensive care admission (ICU) for people with NMD. In order to preserve the fairest medical decision, a multidisciplinary working group has listed the neuromuscular diseases with a good prognosis, usually eligible for resuscitation admission in ICU and, for other NM conditions, the positive criteria suggesting a good prognosis. Adaptation of the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) make it possible to limit nebulization and continue using NIV in ventilator-dependent patients."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is screened by a two tier newborn screening (NBS) algorithm, the first tier of which is an enzymatic assay performed on newborn dried blood spots (DBS). As first tier enzymatic screening tests have false positive results, an immediate second tier test on the same sample is critical in resolving newborn health status. Two methodologies have been proposed for second tier testing: (a) measurement of enzymatic activities such as of Creatine/Creatinine over alpha-glucosidase ratio, and (b) DNA sequencing (a molecular genetics approach), such as targeted next generation sequencing. (tNGS). In this review, we discuss the tNGS approach, as well as the challenges in providing second tier screening and follow-up care. While tNGS can predict genotype-phenotype effects when known, these advantages may be diminished when the variants are novel, of unknown significance or not discoverable by current test methodologies. Due to the fact that criticisms of screening algorithms that utilize tNGS are based on perceived complexities, including variant detection and interpretation, we clarify the actual limitations and present the rationale that supports optimizing a molecular genetic testing approach with tNGS. Second tier tNGS can benefit clinical decision-making through the use of the initial NBS DBS punch and rapid turn-around time methodology for tNGS, that includes copy number variant analysis, variant effect prediction, and variant 'cut-off' tools for the reduction of false positive results. The availability of DNA sequence data will contribute to the improved understanding of genotype-phenotype associations and application of treatment. The ultimate goal of second tier testing should enable the earliest possible diagnosis for the earliest initiation of the most effective clinical interventions in infants with PD."

    "abstract": "In late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), a lysosomal storage disorder with glycogen accumulation in several tissues, patients suffer from progressive skeletal muscle weakness. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) have rarely been reported. The aim of this study is to objectively assess LUTS in patients with LOPD for the first time using urodynamic studies and to determine differences between LOPD patients with and without LUTS. Eighteen patients with LOPD were recruited, of whom seven patients (38.9%) reported LUTS (both voiding and storage symptoms). Six of these patients underwent urodynamic studies. Medical histories and motor function tests were compared between the 7 patients with LUTS and the 11 patients without LUTS. The Student t test was used to determine an association between the two cohorts. In the seven LOPD patients with LUTS urodynamics revealed neurogenic dysfunction, underactive detrusor, and bladder outlet obstruction. These patients had suffered from clinical symptoms for a longer period of time before starting enzyme replacement therapy (P = .017) than patients without LUTS. They also scored more poorly on muscle function tests. Urodynamic results point to neurogenic causes for LUTS in LOPD, that is, neurogenic reflex bladder or impaired filling sensation. This could be due to glycogen accumulation in the urothelium and central nervous system. Patients with LUTS also seem to be more severely affected by LOPD than patients without LUTS. LUTS in LOPD requires early and specific treatment to limit the development of severe health problems. Urodynamic studies should be considered in assessing LUTS."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is caused by mutations in the GAA gene, resulting in deficient lysosomal acid-α-glucosidase activity in patients, and a progressive decline in mobility and respiratory function. Enzyme replacement therapy is one therapeutic option, but since not all patients respond to this treatment, alternative interventions should be considered. One GAA mutation, c.-32-13T > G, impacts upon normal exon 2 splicing and is found in two-thirds of late-onset cases. We and others have explored a therapeutic strategy using splice modulating phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers to enhance GAA exon 2 inclusion in the mature mRNA of patients with one c.-32-13T > G allele. We designed 20 oligomers and treated fibroblasts derived from five patients to identify an oligomer sequence that maximally increased enzyme activity in all fibroblasts. The most effective splice correcting oligomer was chosen to treat forced-myogenic cells, derived from fibroblasts from nine patients carrying the c.-32-13T > G mutation. After transfection, we show increased levels of the full-length GAA transcript, acid-α-glucosidase protein, and enzyme activity in all patients' myogenic cells, regardless of the nature of the mutation in the other allele. This data encourages the initiation of clinical trials to assess the therapeutic efficacy of this oligomer for those patients carrying the c.-32-13T > G mutation."

    "title": "Imbalanced cortisol concentrations in glycogen storage disease type I: evidence for a possible link between endocrine regulation and metabolic derangement.",
    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease type I (GSDI) is an inborn error of carbohydrate metabolism caused by mutations of either the G6PC gene (GSDIa) or the SLC37A4 gene (GSDIb). Glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) availability has been shown to modulate 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD1), an ER-bound enzyme catalyzing the local conversion of inactive cortisone into active cortisol. Adrenal cortex assessment has never been performed in GSDI. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the adrenal cortex hormones levels in GSDI patients. Seventeen GSDI (10 GSDIa and 7 GSDIb) patients and thirty-four age and sex-matched controls were enrolled. Baseline adrenal cortex hormones and biochemical markers of metabolic control serum levels were analyzed. Low dose ACTH stimulation test was also performed. Baseline cortisol serum levels were higher in GSDIa patients (p = 0.042) and lower in GSDIb patients (p = 0.041) than controls. GSDIa patients also showed higher peak cortisol response (p = 0.000) and Cortisol AUC (p = 0.029). In GSDIa patients, serum cholesterol (p = 0.000), triglycerides (p = 0.000), lactate (p = 0.000) and uric acid (p = 0.008) levels were higher and bicarbonate (p = 0.000) levels were lower than controls. In GSDIb patients, serum cholesterol levels (p = 0.016) were lower and lactate (p = 0.000) and uric acid (p = 0.000) levels were higher than controls. Baseline cortisol serum levels directly correlated with cholesterol (ρ = 0.65, p = 0.005) and triglycerides (ρ = 0.60, p = 0.012) serum levels in GSDI patients. The present study showed impaired cortisol levels in GSDI patients, with opposite trend between GSDIa and GSDIb. The otherwise preserved adrenal cortex function suggests that this finding might be secondary to local deregulation rather than hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction in GSDI patients. We hypothesize that 11βHSD1 might represent the link between endocrine regulation and metabolic derangement in GSDI, constituting new potential therapeutic target in GSDI patients."

    "abstract": "In the past decade, the number of genes linked to neuromuscular diseases of childhood has expanded dramatically, and this genetic information is forming the basis for gene-specific and even mutation-specific therapies. At the forefront of these advances are the two recently approved treatments for spinal muscular atrophy: one, an antisense oligonucleotide that modifies splicing of the SMN2 gene, and, the other, a gene therapy vector that delivers the <i>SMN1</i> gene to motor neurons, both of which are allowing patients to acquire developmental milestones previously unseen in this fatal disease. This review highlights these advances and emerging targeted therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and centronuclear myopathy, while also covering enzyme replacement therapy and small molecule-based targeted therapies for conditions such as Pompe's disease and congenital myasthenic syndromes. With these and other newer techniques for targeted correction of genetic defects, such as CRISPR/Cas9, there is now hope that treatments for many more genetic diseases of the nervous system will follow in the near future."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). The result of the GAA deficiency is a ubiquitous lysosomal and non-lysosomal accumulation of glycogen. The most affected tissues are heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and the nervous system. Replacement therapy with the currently approved enzyme relies on M6P-mediated endocytosis. However, therapeutic outcomes still leave room for improvement, especially with regard to skeletal muscles. We tested the uptake, activity, and effect on glucose metabolism of a non-phosphorylated recombinant human GAA produced in moss (moss-GAA). Three variants of moss-GAA differing in glycosylation pattern have been analyzed: two with terminal mannose residues in a paucimannosidic (Man3) or high-mannose (Man 5) configuration and one with terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues (GnGn). Compared to alglucosidase alfa the moss-GAA GnGn variant showed increased uptake in differentiated myotubes. Moreover, incubation of immortalized muscle cells of <i>Gaa</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice with moss-GAA GnGn led to similarly efficient clearance of accumulated glycogen as with alglucosidase alfa. These initial data suggest that M6P-residues might not always be necessary for the cellular uptake in enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and indicate the potential of moss-GAA GnGn as novel alternative drug for targeting skeletal muscle in Pompe patients."

Assessment of the drug pipeline through analysis of the FDA database for orphan drug designations with descriptive and comparative statistics. Between 1983 and 2019, 124 orphan drug designations were granted by the FDA for compounds intended to treat 28 lysosomal storage diseases. Orphan drug designations focused on Gaucher disease (N = 16), Pompe disease (N = 16), Fabry disease (N = 10), MPS II (N = 10), MPS I (N = 9), and MPS IIIA (N = 9), and included enzyme replacement therapies, gene therapies, and small molecules, and others. Twenty-three orphan drugs were approved for the treatment of 11 LSDs. Gaucher disease (N = 6), cystinosis (N = 5), Pompe disease (N = 3), and Fabry disease (N = 2) had multiple approvals, CLN2, LAL-D, MPS I, II, IVA, VI, and VII one approval each. This is an increase of nine more approved drugs and four more treatable LSDs (CLN2, MPS VII, LAL-D, and MPS IVA) since 2013. Mean time between orphan drug designation and FDA approval was 89.7 SD 55.00 (range 8-203, N = 23) months. The drug development pipeline for LSDs is growing and evolving, with increased focus on diverse small-molecule targets and gene therapy. CLN2 was the first and only LSD with an approved therapy directly targeted to the brain. Newly approved products included \"me-too\"-enzymes and innovative compounds such as the first pharmacological chaperone for the treatment of Fabry disease."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of about 50 inborn errors of metabolism characterized by the lysosomal accumulation of partially or non-degraded molecules due to mutations in proteins involved in the degradation of macromolecules, transport, lysosomal biogenesis or modulators of lysosomal environment. Significant advances have been achieved in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of LSDs patients. In terms of approved therapies, these include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), substrate reduction therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and pharmacological chaperone therapy. In this review, we summarize the Colombian experience in LSDs thorough the evidence published. We identified 113 articles published between 1995 and 2019 that included Colombian researchers or physicians, and which were mainly focused in Mucopolysaccharidoses, Pompe disease, Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, and Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. Most of these articles focused on basic research, clinical cases, and mutation reports. Noteworthy, implementation of the enzyme assay in dried blood samples, led to a 5-fold increase in the identification of LSD patients, suggesting that these disorders still remain undiagnosed in the country. We consider that the information presented in this review will contribute to the knowledge of a broad spectrum of LSDs in Colombia and will also contribute to the development of public policies and the identification of research opportunities."

    "abstract": "In Pompe disease, glycogen deposition results in an augmentation of blood flow and abnormal remodeling, with resultant weakening of the arterial walls, which may result in pathologic dilatation of the cerebral arteries. This complication is rare in patients with late-onset Pompe disease, but it has not been well-described in infantile-onset Pompe disease. The effect of enzyme replacement therapy on this process is not known. We examined clinical and imaging data on two patients who exhibit cerebrovascular arteriopathy: a 14-year-old boy with infantile-onset Pompe disease on enzyme replacement therapy and a 23-year-old woman with late-onset Pompe disease who was also receiving enzyme replacement therapy. Our 14-year-old patient exhibits cerebrovascular arteriopathy, primarily proximal and vertebrobasilar, while the 23-year-old patient has a more diffuse pattern. The 14-year-old patient is unique because cerebral dolichoectasias have not been described in infantile-onset Pompe disease. The 23-year-old patient is notable given the age and history of enzyme replacement therapy since age 15 years. Dilative cerebral arteriopathy in infantile-onset Pompe disease is novel and similarly atypical is the diffuse vascular dilation seen in our young patient with late-onset Pompe disease, both receiving enzyme replacement therapy. We should be cognizant of the risk of cerebrovascular disease in Pompe disease regardless of the disease variant and enzyme replacement therapy status."

LOPD is caused by mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) gene and treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). We studied the clinical, brain imaging, and genetic features of the Belgian cohort of late-onset Pompe disease patients (N = 52), and explored the sensitivity of different outcome measures, during a longitudinal period of 7 years (2010-2017), including the activity limitations ActivLim score, 6 min walking distance (6MWD), 10 m walk test (10MWT), MRC sum score, and forced vital capacity (FVC) sitting/supine. In Belgium, we calculated an LOPD prevalence of 3.9 per million. Mean age at onset of 52 LOPD patients was 28.9 years (SD: 15.8 y), ranging from 7 months to 68 years. Seventy-five percent (N = 39) of the patients initially presented with limb-girdle weakness, whereas in 13% (N = 7) respiratory symptoms were the only initial symptom. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was started in 37% (N = 19), at a mean age of 49.5 years (SD: 11.9 y), with a mean duration of 15 years (SD: 10.2 y) after symptom onset. Brain imaging revealed abnormalities in 25% (N = 8) of the patients, with the presence of small cerebral aneurysm(s) in two patients and a vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia in another two. Mean diagnostic delay was 12.9 years. All patients were compound heterozygotes with the most prevalent mutation being c.-32-13 T > G in 96%. We identified two novel mutations in GAA: c.1610_1611delA and c.186dup11. For the 6MWD, MRC sum score, FVC sitting and FVC supine, we measured a significant decrease over time (p = 0.0002, p = 0.0001, p = 0.0077, p = 0.0151), which was not revealed with the ActivLim score and 10MWT (p > 0.05). Awareness on LOPD should even be further increased because of the long diagnostic delay. The 6MWD, but not the ActivLim score, is a sensitive outcome measure to follow up LOPD patients."

Retrospective analyses of 12,028 pT2 patients that underwent radical prostatectomy between 2003 and 2016 and did not receive neo- or adjuvant treatments. Kaplan-Meier curves as well as multivariable Cox-regression analyses compared biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastatic progression (MP) and overall mortality (OM) between the 3 subcategories (pT2a, pT2b and pT2c). After surgery, 1,441 patients were classified as pT2a, 126 as pT2b and 10.495 as pT2c. Five-year BFS rates for pT2a, pT2b and pT2c were 92.0% vs. 97.4% vs. 88.0%. For the same groups, 5-year MP-FS rates were 99.5% vs. 100% vs. 99.0% and 5-year OS rates were 98.0% vs. 98.2% vs. 97.7%. In multivariable analyses pT2 substratification did not reach independent predictor status for biochemical recurrence, MP or overall mortality. Substratification of pT2 prostate cancer was not predictive for further disease progression. Therefore, removing the substages simplifies the staging system without loss of important information."

    "abstract": "Interpretation of genetic variants detected by sequencing of genomic DNA, which may cause splicing defects, regularly requires mRNA analysis. Usually, only bioinformatic testing is provided, because simple and non-invasive assay protocols are lacking. Furthermore, the detection of mis-splicing is often hampered by nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Starting from a case of Pompe disease with two potential splicing variants an assay for the analysis of splice defects in general was developed. We analyzed the transcripts from the gene of interest by standard methods after short-term culture of the patient's lymphocytes in the presence and absence of a NMD inhibitor. Variant and wild type transcript expression were quantified by allele specific PCR in the patient and both parents and the expression ratio with/without NMD inhibition was calculated for each transcript. NMD detection in lymphocytes was optimized and evaluated by analyzing a naturally occurring NMD transcript. Several compounds inhibited NMD successfully, including potential therapeutic agents. Sample storage for up to 4 days at room temperature prior to lymphocyte isolation did not affect results. In a proof of concept we identified two candidate variants as severe splicing variants in a patient with Pompe disease, but the strategy can also be used to screen for any mis-spliced transcripts prone to NMD. We developed a simple, non-invasive assay for the detection and characterization of potential splicing variants. This is essential, because early and near-term diagnosis and disease classification is required to facilitate therapy in many genetic diseases."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a glycogen storage disease caused by a deficiency in acid α-glucosidase (GAA), a hydrolase necessary for the degradation of lysosomal glycogen. This deficiency in GAA results in muscle and neuronal glycogen accumulation, which causes respiratory insufficiency. Pompe disease mouse models provide a means of assessing respiratory pathology and are important for pre-clinical studies of novel therapies that aim to treat respiratory dysfunction and improve quality of life. This review aims to compile and summarize existing manuscripts that characterize the respiratory phenotype of Pompe mouse models. Manuscripts included in this review were selected utilizing specific search terms and exclusion criteria. Analysis of these findings demonstrate that Pompe disease mouse models have respiratory physiological defects as well as pathologies in the diaphragm, tongue, higher-order respiratory control centers, phrenic and hypoglossal motor nuclei, phrenic and hypoglossal nerves, neuromuscular junctions, and airway smooth muscle. Overall, the culmination of these pathologies contributes to severe respiratory dysfunction, underscoring the importance of characterizing the respiratory phenotype while developing effective therapies for patients."

There are no specific treatments, and most male patients die from advanced heart failure during the second or third decade of life. DD is caused by mutations in the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (<i>LAMP2</i>) gene, a key mediator of autophagy. LAMP2 has three isoforms: LAMP2A, LAMP2B, and LAMP2C. LAMP2B is the predominant isoform expressed in cardiomyocytes. This study evaluates the efficacy of human <i>LAMP2B</i> gene transfer using a recombinant adeno-associated virus 9 carrying human LAMP2B (AAV9.LAMP2B) in a <i>Lamp2</i> knockout (KO) mouse, a DD model. AAV9.LAMP2B was intravenously injected into 2- and 6-month-old <i>Lamp2</i> KO male mice to assess efficacy in adolescent and adult phenotypes. <i>Lamp2</i> KO mice receiving AAV9.LAMP2B demonstrated dose-dependent restoration of human LAMP2B protein in the heart, liver, and skeletal muscle tissue. Impaired autophagic flux, evidenced by increased LC3-II, was abrogated by <i>LAMP2B</i> gene transfer in all tissues in both cohorts. Cardiac function was also improved, and transaminases were reduced in AAV9.LAMP2B-treated KO mice, indicating favorable effects on the heart and liver. Survival was also higher in the older cohort receiving high vector doses. No anti-LAMP2 antibodies were detected in mice that received AAV9.LAMP2B. In summary, <i>LAMP2B</i> gene transfer improves metabolic and physiologic function in a DD murine model, suggesting that a similar therapeutic approach may be effective for treating patients with this highly morbid disease."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate cVEP responses and to compare them with other structural and functional findings in young patients with DD. Thirty patients (8-28 years of age) with DD with or without a history of optic neuritis (ON) were investigated. Twenty-five eyes had at least one episode of ON (ON-group) and 35 eyes had no clinically evident episode of ON (nON-group). OCT imaging was performed using a high-resolution spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT), measuring retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. Pattern reversal electroretinography (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP) were recorded according to the ISCEV standard, and chromatic visual evoked potentials (cVEP) were recorded to isoluminant red-green (R-G) and blue-yellow (B-Y) 7° circle stimuli, composed of horizontal sinusoidal gratings with spatial frequency 2 cycles/°, 90% chromatic contrast and onset-offset (300:700 ms) mode of stimulation. Structural and functional measures were analyzed and compared between the groups. Both general (G) and temporal (T) RNFL thicknesses were reduced below normal limits in most of the eyes. However, in the ON-group (G: 77.5 ± 20.6, T: 51.4 ± 23.4 µm), the thinning was more significant (p < 0.001) than in the nON-group (G: 95.4 ± 12.1, T: 70.1 ± 11.5 µm). PERG N95 was within normal limits in the nON-group, while it was significantly more affected in the ON-group (7.4 ± 1.0 vs. 5.1 ± 2.0 μV; p < 0.0001). Similarly, also VEP P100 latency and amplitude showed a greater percentage of abnormality in the ON-group, the latency being longer (117.2 ± 16.9 vs. 99.4 ± 4.6 ms; p < 0.0001) and the amplitude lower (9.1 ± 5.1 vs. 16.4 ± 7.5 μV; p < 0.0001). The cVEP N-wave amplitude to R-G and B-Y stimuli was reduced below normal limits in both ON- and nON-groups; however, cVEP to B-Y stimulation were slightly more affected in the ON-group (4.0 ± 3.8 vs. 5.9 ± 3.3 µm; p = 0.02). A positive correlation between cVEP amplitude and RNFL thickness and between cVEP amplitude and PERG N95 amplitude, as well as a strong negative correlation between cVEP amplitude and P100 latency was observed. These findings demonstrate that cVEP indicate early abnormality of parvocellular pathway function in eyes with or without a history of optic neuritis and can be used together with other structural and functional parameters to evaluate visual pathway integrity of young patients with DD."

Accumulating evidence suggests that suppression of glycogen accumulation represents a potential therapeutic approach for treating these GSDs. Using a fluorescence polarization assay designed to screen for inhibitors of the key glycogen synthetic enzyme, glycogen synthase (GS), we identified a substituted imidazole, (<i>rac</i>)-2-methoxy-4-(1-(2-(1-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl)ethyl)-4-phenyl-1<i>H</i>-imidazol-5-yl)phenol (<b>H23</b>), as a first-in-class inhibitor for yeast GS 2 (yGsy2p).

The high conservation of residues between human and yeast GS in direct contact with <b>H23</b> informed the development of around 500 <b>H23</b> analogs. These analogs produced a structure-activity relationship profile that led to the identification of a substituted pyrazole, 4-(4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1<i>H</i>-pyrazol-5-yl)pyrogallol, with a 300-fold improved potency against human GS. These substituted pyrazoles possess a promising scaffold for drug development efforts targeting GS activity in GSDs associated with excess glycogen accumulation."

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the skeletal muscles produced by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. Enzymatic replacement therapy with recombinant human alpha-glucosidase seems to reduce the progression of the disease; although at the moment, it is not completely clear to what extent. Quantitative muscle magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is a good biomarker for the follow-up of fat replacement in neuromuscular disorders. The aim of this study was to describe the changes observed in fat replacement in skeletal muscles using qMRI in a cohort of LOPD patients followed prospectively. A total of 36 LOPD patients were seen once every year for 4 years. qMRI, several muscle function tests, spirometry, activities of daily living scales, and quality-of-life scales were performed on each visit. Muscle MRI consisted of two-point Dixon studies of the trunk and thigh muscles. Computer analysis of the images provided the percentage of muscle degenerated and replaced by fat in every muscle (known as fat fraction). Longitudinal analysis of the measures was performed using linear mixed models applying the Greenhouse-Geisser test. We detected a statistically significant and continuous increase in mean thigh fat fraction both in treated (+5.8% in 3 years) and in pre-symptomatic patients (+2.6% in 3years) (Greenhouse-Geisser p < 0.05). As an average, fat fraction increased by 1.9% per year in treated patients, compared with 0.8% in pre-symptomatic patients. Fat fraction significantly increased in every muscle of the thighs. We observed a significant correlation between changes observed in fat fraction in qMRI and changes observed in the results of the muscle function tests performed. Moreover, we identified that muscle performance and mean thigh fat fraction at baseline visit were independent parameters influencing fat fraction progression over 4 years (analysis of covariance, p < 0.05). Our study identifies that skeletal muscle fat fraction continues to increase in patients with LOPD despite the treatment with enzymatic replacement therapy. These results suggest that the process of muscle degeneration is not stopped by the treatment and could impact muscle function over the years. Hereby, we show that fat fraction along with muscle function tests can be considered a good outcome measures for clinical trials in LOPD patients."

    "abstract": "Clinical manifestations of the late-onset adult Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II) are heterogeneous. To identify genetic defects of a special patient population with cerebrovascular involvement as the main symptom, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis on a consanguineous Chinese family of total eight members including two Pompe siblings both had cerebral infarction. Two novel compound heterozygous variants were found in GAA gene: c.2238G>C in exon 16 and c.1388_1406del19 in exon 9 in the two patients. We verified the function of the two mutations in leading to defects in GAA protein expression and enzyme activity that are associated with autophagic impairment. We further performed a gut microbiome metagenomics analysis, found that the child's gut microbiome metagenome is very similar to his mother. Our finding enriches the gene mutation spectrum of Pompe disease, and identified the association of the two new mutations with autophagy impairment. Our data also indicates that gut microbiome could be shared within Pompe patient and cohabiting family members, and the abnormal microbiome may affect the blood biochemical index. Our study also highlights the importance of deep DNA sequencing in potential clinical applications."

    "title": "Mutations in GAA Gene in Tunisian Families with Infantile Onset Pompe Disease: Novel Mutation and Structural Modeling Investigations.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease, a rare, autosomal, recessive, inherited, lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by mutations in the acid α-glucosidase (GAA) gene leading to a deficiency of the lysosomal GAA enzyme. Some GAA mutations eliminate all enzymatic activities, causing severe infantile Pompe disease; others allow residual GAA activity and lead to middle adulthood forms. Here, we report a cohort of 12 patients, belonging to 11 unrelated families, with infantile Pompe disease. The mutational analysis of GAA gene revealed a novel c.1494G > A (p.Trp498X) mutation in one patient and three known mutatio,ns including the c.1497G > A (p.Trp499X) mutation, in two patients, the c.1927G > A (p.Gly643Arg) mutation in one patient and the common c.236_246del (p.Pro79ArgfsX13) mutation in eight patients. The high prevalence of c.236_246del mutation in our cohort (58%) was supported by the existence of a common founder ancestor that was confirmed by its segregation of similar SNPs haplotype, including four intragenic SNPs of GAA gene. In addition, a 3D structure model and a docking were generated for the mutant p.Gly643Arg using the crystal structure of human GAA as template and the 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-D-glucopyranoside as substrate. The results showed that the arginine at position 643 caused electrostatic changes in neighboring regions, leading to the repulsion between the amino acids located in the catalytic cavity of the GAA enzyme, thus restricting access to its substrate. These structural defects could cause the impairment of the transport and maturation previously reported for p.Gly643Arg mutation."

    "title": "Global Retinoblastoma Presentation and Analysis by National Income Level.",
    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of retinoblastoma, the most common intraocular cancer, can save both a child's life and vision. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that many children across the world are diagnosed late. To our knowledge, the clinical presentation of retinoblastoma has never been assessed on a global scale. To report the retinoblastoma stage at diagnosis in patients across the world during a single year, to investigate associations between clinical variables and national income level, and to investigate risk factors for advanced disease at diagnosis. A total of 278 retinoblastoma treatment centers were recruited from June 2017 through December 2018 to participate in a cross-sectional analysis of treatment-naive patients with retinoblastoma who were diagnosed in 2017. Age at presentation, proportion of familial history of retinoblastoma, and tumor stage and metastasis. The cohort included 4351 new patients from 153 countries; the median age at diagnosis was 30.5 (interquartile range, 18.3-45.9) months, and 1976 patients (45.4%) were female. Most patients (n = 3685 [84.7%]) were from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Globally, the most common indication for referral was leukocoria (n = 2638 [62.8%]), followed by strabismus (n = 429 [10.2%]) and proptosis (n = 309 [7.4%]). Patients from high-income countries (HICs) were diagnosed at a median age of 14.1 months, with 656 of 666 (98.5%) patients having intraocular retinoblastoma and 2 (0.3%) having metastasis. Patients from low-income countries were diagnosed at a median age of 30.5 months, with 256 of 521 (49.1%) having extraocular retinoblastoma and 94 of 498 (18.9%) having metastasis. Lower national income level was associated with older presentation age, higher proportion of locally advanced disease and distant metastasis, and smaller proportion of familial history of retinoblastoma. Advanced disease at diagnosis was more common in LMICs even after adjusting for age (odds ratio for low-income countries vs upper-middle-income countries and HICs, 17.92 [95% CI, 12.94-24.80], and for lower-middle-income countries vs upper-middle-income countries and HICs, 5.74 [95% CI, 4.30-7.68]). This study is estimated to have included more than half of all new retinoblastoma cases worldwide in 2017. Children from LMICs, where the main global retinoblastoma burden lies, presented at an older age with more advanced disease and demonstrated a smaller proportion of familial history of retinoblastoma, likely because many do not reach a childbearing age. Given that retinoblastoma is curable, these data are concerning and mandate intervention at national and international levels. Further studies are needed to investigate factors, other than age at presentation, that may be associated with advanced disease in LMICs."

    "title": "Novel <i>GAA</i> Variants and Mosaicism in Pompe Disease Identified by Extended Analyses of Patients with an Incomplete DNA Diagnosis.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the glycogen-hydrolyzing lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA), which leads to progressive muscle wasting. This autosomal-recessive disorder is the result of disease-associated variants located in the <i>GAA</i> gene. In the present study, we performed extended molecular diagnostic analysis to identify novel disease-associated variants in six suspected Pompe patients from four different families for which conventional diagnostic assays were insufficient. Additional assays, such as a generic-splicing assay, minigene analysis, SNP array analysis, and targeted Sanger sequencing, allowed the identification of an exonic deletion, a promoter deletion, and a novel splicing variant located in the 5' UTR. Furthermore, we describe the diagnostic process for an infantile patient with an atypical phenotype, consisting of left ventricular hypertrophy but no signs of muscle weakness or motor problems. This led to the identification of a genetic mosaicism for a very severe GAA variant caused by a segmental uniparental isodisomy (UPD). With this study, we aim to emphasize the need for additional analyses to detect new disease-associated <i>GAA</i> variants and non-Mendelian genotypes in Pompe disease where conventional DNA diagnostic assays are insufficient."

    "abstract": "Background Recently, urinary excretion of the tetrasaccharide 6-α-D-glucopyranosyl-maltotriose (Glc4) has been proposed as a marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of Pompe disease (PD). We aimed to determine the reference intervals and reliable decision-making levels of urine tetrasaccharide concentrations for the diagnosis of infantile- and late-onset Pompe patients in the Turkish population. Methods In this study, nine patients with PD (five of them with late-onset PD [LOPD]) and 226 healthy individuals (aged 0-64 years) were included. Urine Glc4 concentrations were determined using the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method. Results Our data showed that the urine tetrasaccharide levels decreased with age in healthy individuals (p < 0.001, r = -0.256). It was higher especially during the first year of life compared to that in the elder subjects. The tetrasaccharide level of Pompe patients was higher compared to that of healthy controls of the same age: 99 ± 68 mmol/mol creatinine for infantile onset vs. 4.0 ± 3.0 mmol/mol creatinine for healthy controls of the same age group and 12.1 ± 17.4 mmol/mol creatinine for late onset vs. 1.7±1.2 mmol/mol creatinine for healthy controls of the same age group. Conclusions The results of this study showed that the reference intervals of tetrasaccharide in urine changed over time; therefore, it is critically important to define age-based decision levels for the diagnosis of LOPD."

    "abstract": "The high cost of orphan drugs limits their access by many patients, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Many orphan drugs are off-patent without alternative generic or biosimilar versions available. Production of these drugs at the point-of-care, when feasible, could be a cost-effective alternative. The financial feasibility of this approach was estimated by setting up a small-scale production of recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA). The commercial version of rhGAA is Myozyme™, and Lumizyme™ in the United States, which is used to treat Pompe disease. The rhGAA was produced in CHO-K1 mammalian cells and purified using multiple purification steps to obtain a protein profile comparable to Myozyme™. The established small-scale production of rhGAA was used to obtain a realistic cost estimation for the magistral production of this biological drug. The treatment cost of rhGAA using bedside production was estimated at $3,484/gram, which is 71% lower than the commercial price of Myozyme ™. This study shows that bedside production might be a cost-effective approach to increase the access of patients to particular life-saving drugs."

The aim of this study was to describe current experiences with dietary lipid manipulations in hepatic GSD patients. An international study was set up to identify published and unpublished cases describing hepatic GSD patients with a dietary lipid manipulation. A literature search was performed according to the Cochrane Collaboration methodology through PubMed and EMBASE (up to December 2018). All delegates who attended the dietetics session at the IGSD2017, Groningen were invited to share unpublished cases. Due to multiple biases, only data on GSDIII were presented. A total of 28 cases with GSDIII and a dietary lipid manipulation were identified. Main indications were cardiomyopathy and/or myopathy. A high fat diet was the most common dietary lipid manipulation. A decline in creatine kinase concentrations (n = 19, P < .001) and a decrease in cardiac hypertrophy in paediatric GSDIIIa patients (n = 7, P < .01) were observed after the introduction with a high fat diet. This study presents an international cohort of GSDIII patients with different dietary lipid manipulations. High fat diet may be beneficial in paediatric GSDIIIa patients with cardiac hypertrophy, but careful long-term monitoring for potential complications is warranted, such as growth restriction, liver inflammation, and hepatocellular carcinoma development."

    "abstract": "We conducted a pilot newborn screening (NBS) study for Pompe disease (PD) and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) in the multiethnic population of Georgia. We screened 59,332 infants using a two-tier strategy of flow injection tandem mass spectrometry (FIA-MSMS) enzyme assays. The first tier of testing was a 2-plex assay measuring PD and MPS I enzyme activity, followed by a second-tier test with additional enzymes to improve specificity. Interpretation of results was performed using post-analytical tools created using Collaborative Laboratory Integrated Reports (CLIR). We identified a single case of infantile onset PD, two cases of late onset PD, and one pseudodeficiency. The positive predictive value (PPV) for PD screening during the study was 66.7%. No cases of MPS I were identified during the study period, but there were 2 confirmed cases of pseudodeficiency and 6 cases lost to follow up. The two-tier screening strategy was successful in reducing false positive results and allowed for the identification and early treatment of a case of infantile PD but the frequency of pseudodeficiency in MPS I is problematic. Molecular testing is required and should be covered by the screening program to avoid delays in case resolution."

A desensitisation protocol was tailored to our patient with the help of a multidisciplinary team including the allergist, geneticist, nurses and pharmacists. For our patient, desensitisation was successful using a multi-step three-fold dose escalation protocol.

    "abstract": "Background Pompe disease (PD) is an autosomal recessive metabolic myopathy with an average incidence of one in 40,000 live births. It has a variable age of onset and can be diagnosed within the first 3 months. Heart involvement and muscle weakness are its primary manifestations. Case presentation We describe two families affected by PD with two rare, novel variants. To date, pathogenic variants in acid α-glucosidase (GAA) alone have accounted for all cases of the disease. Both families were screened for pathogenic sequence variations. This study presents the implications of regulatory or modifier sequences in the disease pathogenesis for the first time. A homozygous missense p.Arg854Gln variant in family A and a single heterozygous variant (p.Asn925His) in family B were found to be segregating according to the disease phenotype. The variants were not detected in our in-house database comprising 50 whole-exome sequences of healthy individuals from a local unrelated Pakistani population. In silico analyses predicted that the variants would have deleterious effects on the protein structure. Conclusions The variants likely underlie the infantile-onset PD (IOPD) in these Pakistani families. The study expands the mutation spectrum of GAA associated with IOPD and highlights the insufficiency of screening the GAA coding sequence to determine the cause of IOPD. The work should be helpful in carrier identification, improving genetic counselling, and prenatal diagnosis."

In this study, rhGAAs were produced in transgenic rice cell suspension cultures under eight different conditions; untreated, 5 μM of 2-fluoro-l-fucose (2-FF), 50 μM of 2-FF, 100 μM of 2-FF, 100 μM of 2-FF + 0.5% Pluronic F-68 (PF-68), 100 μM of 2-FF + 0.05% Tween 20 (Tw 20), 0.5% PF-68, and 0.05% Tw 20. The N-glycans of eight rhGAAs were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and tandem mass spectrometry. The relative quantity (%) of each glycan was obtained from the corresponding UPLC peak area per the sum (100%) of individual UPLC peak area. Fifteen N-glycans, comprising seven core-fucosylated glycans (71.5%, sum of each relative quantities) that have immunogenicity-inducing potential, three de-core-fucosylated glycans (15.4%), and five non-core-fucosylated glycans (13.1%), were characterized with high mass accuracy and glycan-generated fragment ions. The increases or decreases of relative quantities of each glycan from seven rhGAAs were compared with those of untreated control. The percentages of the sum of the relative quantities of core-fucosylated glycans divided by the sums of those of de-core- (core-fucose removed) and non-core-fucosylated glycans were calculated, and the lowest percentage was obtained in 100 μM of 2-FF combined with 0.5% PF-68. These results indicate that the relative quantity of each glycan of rhGAA produced in rice cell suspension cultures is significantly affected by their culture condition. This study performed the comparison of the N-glycan profiles of rice cell-derived rhGAA to identify the core-fucosylated glycans using UPLC and tandem mass spectrometry."

Here we report the first 70,000 newborns screened for Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type 4A (Morquio syndrome) and other LSDs by an 8-plex assay including the original 4-plex LSD screening tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) assay for Pompe disease, Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, and MPS I disease. The additional reaction for MPS II, MPS 3B, MPS 4A, and MPS 6 enzymes was performed separately from the 4-plex reaction. The two reactions were quenched and extracted, then combined before carrying out a single 2-min UPLC-MS/MS analysis. From Mar. 2018 to Apr. 2019, 73,743 newborns were screened with the 8-plex LSD screening assay. The 8-plex assay revealed a better analytical precision than the previous 4-plex assay possibly because the 8-plex was carried out using UPLC-MS/MS. Six newborns were found to have low MPS-4A enzyme (N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase) activity and biallelic GALNS pathogenic mutations in trans; these patients are presumably affected with MPS4A, making an incidence of one in 12,291 (95% confident interval (CI): 5633-26,817). One mutation, c.857C > T (p.T286 M) of the GALNS gene, accounted 5 of the 12 mutated alleles. These newborns had immature vertebral bodies at 1 month of age, and one case was treated with elosulfase alfa 2 mg/kg/week starting from 4 months of age. Among other MPSs screened, one case of MPS I, 3 cases of MPS II, and 3 cases of MPS 3B were detected. One case of mucolipidosis type III was also diagnosed.

Routine newborn screening of MPS 4A and other LSDs were made possible by the 8-plex LSD screening assay.

    "abstract": "Background CT is used to quantify abnormal changes in the lung parenchyma of smokers that might overlap chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but studies on the progression of expiratory air trapping in smokers are scarce. Purpose To evaluate the relationship between longitudinal changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and CT-quantified emphysema and air trapping in smokers. Materials and Methods Cigarette smokers with and those without COPD participating in the multicenter observational COPDGene study were evaluated. Subjects underwent inspiratory and expiratory chest CT and spirometry at baseline and 5-year follow-up. Emphysema was quantified by using adjusted lung density (ALD). Air trapping was quantified by using mean lung density at expiratory CT and CT-measured functional residual capacity-to-total lung volume ratio. Linear models were used to regress quantitative CT measurements taken 5 years apart, and models were fit with and without adding FEV<sub>1</sub> as a predictor. Analyses were stratified by Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage (GOLD 0, no COPD; GOLD 1, mild COPD; GOLD 2, moderate COPD; GOLD 3, severe COPD; GOLD 4, very severe COPD). Subjects with preserved FEV<sub>1</sub>-to-forced vital capacity ratio and reduced FEV<sub>1</sub> percentage predicted were categorized as having preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm). Results A total of 4211 subjects (503 with PRISm; 2034 with GOLD 0, 388 with GOLD 1, 816 with GOLD 2, 381 with GOLD 3, 89 with GOLD 4) were evaluated. ALD decreased by 1.7 g/L (95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.5, -0.9) in subjects with GOLD 0 at baseline and by 5.3 g/L (95% CI: -6.2, -4.4) in those with GOLD 1-4 (<i>P</i> < .001 for both). When adjusted for changes in FEV<sub>1</sub>, corresponding numbers were -2.2 (95% CI: -3.0, -1.3) and -4.6 g/L (95% CI: -5.6, -3.4) (<i>P</i> < .001 for both). Progression in air trapping was identified only in GOLD stage 2-4. Approximately 33%-50% of changes in air trapping in GOLD stages 2-4 were accounted for by changes in FEV<sub>1</sub>. Conclusion CT measures of emphysema and air trapping increased over 5 years in smokers. Forced expiratory volume in one second accounted for less than 10% of emphysema progression and less than 50% of air trapping progression detected at CT. © RSNA, 2020 <i>Online supplemental material is available for this article.</i>"

This leads to a number of challenges, such as restricted mobility and respiratory difficulties. Currently there is no cure for these diseases. The purpose of this review is to present research that examines the effects of exercise in muscle and lower motor neuron diseases. Evidence indicates that moderate intensity aerobic- and strength exercise is advantageous for patients with muscle diseases, without causing harmful exercise-induced muscle damage. On the contrary, motor neuron diseases show a rather blunted response from exercise training. High-intensity training is a modality that seems safe and a promising exercise method, which may circumvent neural fatigue and provide effect to patients with motor neuron disease. Although we have come far in changing the view on exercise therapy in neuromuscular diseases to a positive one, much knowledge is still needed on what dose of time, intensity and duration should be implemented for different disease and how we should provide exercise therapy to very weak, non-ambulatory and wheelchair bound patients."

Our cohort of patients with IOPD at Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH) joined Taiwan Pompe newborn screening program from 2008, testing more than one million newborns until 2018. By 2010, we had established rapid diagnostic strategies. Now, the average age of ERT initiation starts at an average age of <10 days-old, the earliest group in the world. However, they still presented some airway problems. We present a retrospective study focused on airway abnormalities in these patients along 8 years of observation. Fifteen patients with IOPD, who received very early treatment at a mean age of 8.94 ± 3.75 days, underwent flexible bronchoscopy (FB) for dynamic assessment of the whole airway. Long-term clinical outcomes and relevant symptoms of the upper airway were assessed. All patients in the study had varying degrees of severity of upper airway abnormalities and speech disorders. The three oldest children (Age 94, 93, and 88 months, respectively) had poor movement of the vocal cords with reduced abduction and adduction and had silent aspiration of saliva through the glottis during respiration. This is the largest cohort study presented to date about airway abnormalities in very early treated patients with IOPD patients by FB. Despite very early treatment, we observed upper airway abnormalities in these IOPD patients. In IOPD, upper airway abnormalities seem inevitable over time. We suggest early and continuous monitoring for all IOPD patients, even with early and regular treatment."

    "abstract": "Interactions of hyaluronan (HA) and tumor and stromal cells are highly discussed as one of the major contributors in tumor progression and metastasis. The balance of HA in the tissue is highly regulated by two key enzyme classes; hyaluronan synthases (HAS) and hyaluronidases (HYAL). Current reports hint that the HA amount in the tissue is correlated with poor prognosis in melanoma, the most life-threatening skin tumor. In this work, we generated in vivo mouse models with low and high expression of Has2 and used the models for studying melanoma proliferation of the B78D14 melanoma cell line. We found that a strong reduction of HA amount in the skin was correlated to decreased tissue stiffness and a reduction in tumor weight. Since tumor cells have a direct contact to the HA in the tumor and at the stroma interface, we reconstituted different biomimetic in vitro models using fibroblasts derived from a mouse model to recapitulate melanoma cell behavior at the tumor boundary, namely, (i) decellularized fibroblast matrix (FbECM), (ii) fibroblast embedded into 3D collagen matrices (FbColl), and (iii) well-defined HA-functionalized 3D collagen matrices (HAColl). We found no considerable effect of high and low amounts of fibroblast-derived HA in the matrices on melanoma proliferation and invasion. However, HYAL1-treated FbECM and FbColl, as well as HAColl functionalized with low molecular weight HA (34 kDa) promoted proliferation and invasion of melanoma cells in a concentration dependent manner. Our results emphasize the molecular weight specific effects of HA in regulation of melanoma behavior and provide an alternative explanation for the in vivo observation of HA dependent tumor growth."

An important differential diagnosis among patients presenting with proximal muscle weakness (PMW) is late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), a rare neuromuscular glycogen storage disorder, which often presents with early respiratory insufficiency in addition to PMW. Patients with PMW, with or without respiratory symptoms, were included in this study of Latin American patients to evaluate the profile of variants for the included genes related to LGMD recessive (R) and LOPD and the frequency of variants in each gene among this patient population. Over 20 institutions across Latin America (Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, and Chile) enrolled 2103 individuals during 2016 and 2017. Nine autosomal recessive LGMDs and Pompe disease were investigated in a 10-gene panel (ANO5, CAPN3, DYSF, FKRP, GAA, SGCA, SGCB, SGCD, SGCG, TCAP) based on reported disease frequency in Latin America. Sequencing was performed with Illumina's NextSeq500 and variants were classified according to ACMG guidelines; pathogenic and likely pathogenic were treated as one category (P) and variants of unknown significance (VUS) are described. Genetic variants were identified in 55.8% of patients, with 16% receiving a definitive molecular diagnosis; 39.8% had VUS. Nine patients were identified with Pompe disease. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this targeted genetic panel and the importance of including Pompe disease in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with PMW."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is an autosomal recessive muscular disorder caused by deficiency of the glycogen hydrolytic enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA). The enzyme replacement therapy, currently the only available therapy for PD patients, is efficacious in improving cardiomyopathy in the infantile form, but not equally effective in the late onset cases with involvement of skeletal muscle. Correction of the skeletal muscle phenotype has indeed been challenging, probably due to concomitant dysfunctional autophagy. The increasing attention to the pathogenic mechanisms of PD and the search of new therapeutic strategies prompted us to generate and characterize a novel transient PD model, using zebrafish. Our model presented increased glycogen content, markedly altered motor behavior and increased lysosome content, in addition to altered expression of the autophagy-related transcripts and proteins Beclin1, p62 and Lc3b. Furthermore, the model was used to assess the beneficial effects of 3-bromopyruvic acid (3-BrPA). Treatment with 3-BrPA induced amelioration of the model phenotypes regarding glycogen storage, motility behavior and autophagy-related transcripts and proteins. Our zebrafish PD model recapitulates most of the defects observed in human patients, proving to be a powerful translational model. Moreover, 3-BrPA unveiled to be a promising compound for treatment of conditions with glycogen accumulation."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder with marked morbidity and mortality, if untreated. With the advent of enzyme replacement therapy, it is essential to identify the infantile-type as early as possible to mitigate the effects of the enzyme deficiency. Identification is possible prenatally with testing of both parents. More recently, many states have instituted newborn screening for this condition. We report a patient with infantile-onset Pompe disease with a normal paternal carrier genetic test, born prior to newborn screening for Pompe disease in the state of Michigan. The infant's father was retested once the infant was diagnosed with Pompe disease postnatally and noted to have a mutation conducive to Pompe disease. Providers should have a strong clinical suspicion for disorders even if prenatal parental carrier screening is normal. A normal parental prenatal test does not exclude the possibility that the fetus may be diagnosed with a disorder postnatally, and pediatricians may be faced with limitations in accuracy of parents' recollection of parental testing results."

Respiratory complications are not regarded as the principal problems of LSDs, but significantly impact morbidity. In this review, we focus on pulmonary complications observed in late-onset LSDs, their milder forms that are recognised in adulthood. We also discuss the effects of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on the respiratory system in patients with particular LSDs. We searched the PubMed database, retrieving research papers on pulmonary complications of LSDs currently treated with ERT (the conditions are abbreviated GD3; NPDB; LOPD; MPS I, II, IVA, VI; and FD) and the effects of such treatment. Although some studies indicated that ERT was helpful in terms of reducing chest computed tomography abnormalities, infection frequency and organomegaly, the data are not conclusive, and the mechanism of action of ERT in the respiratory system remains unclear for some LSDs including late-onset Pompe disease and Gaucher disease type III. The optimal timing of treatment for pre-symptomatic or symptomatic patients, treatment duration and whether such treatment modulates inflammation (as has been suggested in patients with Fabry disease), remain to be explored."

To implement this costly treatment in the Netherlands in the most sensible way, a multidisciplinary expert committee was installed. We evaluated decision making in adult patients in relation to the European POmpe Consortium stop criteria. Of 125 adult Pompe patients, 111 started treatment; subsequently treatment stopped in 24 patients (21%). In 10 patients, treatment was discontinued for medical or personal reasons, as defined in the six stop criteria (median treatment duration: 2.1 years, range: 0.3-14.6 years). Three of these patients continued follow-up (follow-up: 1.3-8.0 years), these patients did not display a more rapid decline after discontinuation. In 14 of 24 patients, therapy ended at time of death. In 10 patients death was related to Pompe disease (median treatment duration: 7.2 years, range: 0.4-10.3 years). All 10 patients were severely affected at start of treatment, treatment had elicited positive effects in eight. The European POmpe Consortium guidelines worked well in decision making on stopping treatment. However, (re)evaluation of the rationale for continuation of treatment in advanced disease stage is not addressed. We suggest to add this to the treatment evaluation and to handle treatment decisions in a multidisciplinary expert team."

AAV2/8-LSPhGAA (3 × 10<sup>10</sup> vector genomes [vg]/mouse) was administered to infant (2-week-old) or adult (2-month-old) GAA knockout mice. AAV vector transduction in adult mice significantly corrected GAA deficiency in the heart (p < 0.0001), diaphragm (p < 0.01), and quadriceps (p < 0.001) for >50 weeks. However, in infant mice, the same treatment only partially corrected GAA deficiency in the heart (p < 0.05), diaphragm (p < 0.05), and quadriceps (p < 0.05). The clearance of glycogen was much more efficient in adult mice compared with infant mice. Improved wire hang test latency was observed for treated adults (p < 0.05), but not for infant mice. Abnormal ventilation was corrected in both infant and adult mice. Vector-treated female mice demonstrated functional improvement, despite a lower degree of biochemical correction compared with male mice. The relative vector dose for infants was approximately 3-fold higher than adults, when normalized to body weight at the time of vector administration. Given these data, the dose requirement to achieve similar efficacy will be higher for the treatment of young patients."

Long-term follow-up of up to 18 years was obtained. We obtained physical therapy, lingual strength, biochemical, and pulmonary assessments as dose was escalated. Eleven patients with IPD (n = 7) or LOPD (n = 4) were treated with higher doses of up to 40 mg/kg weekly. There were improvements in gross motor function measure in 9/10 patients, in lingual strength in 6/6 patients, and in pulmonary function in 4/11. Significant reductions in urinary glucose tetrasaccharide, creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were observed at 40 mg/kg weekly compared with lower doses (p < 0.05). No safety or immunogenicity concerns were observed at higher doses. Higher rhGAA doses are safe, improve gross motor outcomes, lingual strength, pulmonary function measures, and biochemical markers in early-onset Pompe disease, and should be considered in patients with clinical and functional decline."

These now make it possible to generate targeted deletions, insertions, gene knock outs, and point variants; to modulate gene expression by targeting transcription factors or epigenetic machineries to DNA; or to target and modify RNA. Endogenous repair mechanisms are used to make the modifications required in DNA; they include non-homologous end joining, homology-directed repair, homology-independent targeted integration, microhomology-mediated end joining, base-excision repair, and mismatch repair. Off-target effects can be monitored using in silico prediction and sequencing and minimized using Cas proteins with higher accuracy, such as high-fidelity Cas9, enhanced-specificity Cas9, and hyperaccurate Cas9. Alternatives to Cas9 have been identified, including Cpf1, Cas12a, Cas12b, and smaller Cas9 orthologs such as CjCas9. Delivery of gene-editing components is performed ex vivo using standard techniques or in vivo using AAV, lipid nanoparticles, or cell-penetrating peptides. Clinical development of gene-editing technology is progressing in several fields, including immunotherapy in cancer treatment, antiviral therapy for HIV infection, and treatment of genetic disorders such as β-thalassemia, sickle cell disease, lysosomal storage disorders, and retinal dystrophy.

After analyzing the defined variables and response criteria, all patients presented full effectiveness after two or three years of follow-up except one of them that could not be evaluated. Given the effectiveness achieved, the hospital made full payment of all administered therapies. The implanted risk-sharing program is Spain's first published event of paying for clinical results using orphan drugs. Economic impact has been limited, and program implementation has gone through a complex process of formulation and management.

Subjects were divided into a younger (5-9 years) and older cohort (10-18 years) for the analysis. Upright and supine forced vital capacity (FVC), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) were analyzed. Fourteen patients, all cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM)-positive, met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Mean upright and supine FVC were 70.3% and 64.9% predicted, respectively, in the 5- to 9-year-old cohort; and 61.5% and 52.5% predicted, respectively, in the 10- to 18-year-old group. Individual patient trends showed stability in FVC overtime in six of the 14 patients. MIPs and MEPs were consistent with inspiratory and expiratory muscle weakness in the younger and older age group but did not decline with age. Data from this cohort of CRIM-positive patients with IPD showed that ERT is able to maintain respiratory function in a subgroup of patients whereas others had a steady decline. There was a statistically significant decline in FVC from the upright to a supine position in both the younger and older age groups of CRIM-positive ERT-treated patients. Before ERT, patients with IPD were unable to maintain independent ventilation beyond the first few years of life."

    "abstract": "Infantile onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is a rare and lethal genetic disorder caused by the deletion of the acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) gene. This gene encodes an essential lysosomal enzyme that converts glycogen to glucose. While enzyme replacement therapy helps some, our understanding of disease pathophysiology is limited. In this project we develop computer simulated stem cells (aiPSC) and differentiated skeletal muscle cells (aiSkMC) to empower IOPD research and drug discovery. Our Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform, DeepNEU v3.6 was used to generate aiPSC and aiSkMC simulations with and without GAA expression. These simulations were validated using peer reviewed results from the recent literature. Once the aiSkMC simulations (IOPD and WT) were validated they were used to evaluate calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function in IOPD. Lastly, we used aiSkMC IOPD simulations to identify known and novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. The aiSkMC simulations of IOPD correctly predicted genotypic and phenotypic features that were reported in recent literature. The probability that these features were accurately predicted by chance alone using the binomial test is 0.0025. The aiSkMC IOPD simulation correctly identified L-type calcium channels (VDCC) as a biomarker and confirmed the positive effects of calcium channel blockade (CCB) on calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function. These published data were extended by the aiSkMC simulations to identify calpain(s) as a novel potential biomarker and therapeutic target for IOPD. This is the first time that computer simulations of iPSC and differentiated skeletal muscle cells have been used to study IOPD. The simulations are robust and accurate based on available published literature. We also demonstrated that the IOPD simulations can be used for potential biomarker identification leading to targeted drug discovery. We will continue to explore the potential for calpain inhibitors with and without CCB as effective therapy for IOPD."

    "abstract": "Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is a life-threatening multi-organ disease caused by an inborn defect of lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (GAA), which can degrade glycogen into glucose. Lack of GAA causes abnormal accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes, particularly in the skeletal muscle, liver, and heart. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) is the only available treatment; however, its effect varies by organ. Thus, to fully understand the pathomechanism of IOPD, organ-specific disease models are necessary. We previously generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from three unrelated patients with IOPD and establish a skeletal muscle model of IOPD. Here, we used the same iPSC lines as the previous study and differentiated them into hepatocytes. As a result, hepatocytes differentiated from iPSC of IOPD patients showed abnormal accumulation of lysosomal glycogen, the hallmark of Pompe disease. Using this model, we also demonstrated that glycogen accumulation was dose-dependently restored by rhGAA treatment. In conclusion, we have successfully established an <i>in vitro</i> liver model of IOPD using patient-specific iPSCs. This model can be a platform to elucidate the underlying disease mechanism or to be applied to drug-screening. Moreover, our study also suggest that an iPSC-based approach is suitable for modeling of diseases that affect multiple organs like Pompe disease."

Twelve of 13 participants completed the study. No serious adverse events were related to albuterol, and transient minor drug-related adverse events included muscle spasms and tremors. For the albuterol group, forced vital capacity in the supine position increased by 10% (p < .005), and forced expiratory volume in one second increased by 8% (p < .05); the six-minute walk test increased 25 m (p < .05; excluding one participant unable to complete muscle function testing); the Gross Motor Function Measure increased by 8% (p < .005) with the greatest increases in the Standing (18%; p < .05) and Walking, Running, and Jumping (11%; p < .005) subtests. No significant improvements would be expected in patients with late-onset Pompe disease who were stably treated with enzyme replacement therapy. The placebo group demonstrated no significant increases in performance on any measure. These data support a potential benefit of extended-release albuterol as adjunctive therapy in carefully selected patients with late-onset Pompe disease based on ability to take albuterol on enzyme replacement therapy (NCT01885936)."

We evaluated LOPD (n = 7) and healthy controls (CON, n = 7) during pulmonary function tests, inspiratory endurance testing, dynamic kinematic MRI of the thorax, and ventilatory adjustments to single-breath inspiratory loads (inspiratory load compensation, ILC). We observed significantly lower static and dynamic respiratory function in LOPD. PI<sub>MAX</sub>, spirometry, endurance time, and maximal diaphragm descent were significantly correlated. During single-breath inspiratory loads, inspiratory time and airflow acceleration increased to preserve volume, and in LOPD, the response magnitudes correlated to maximal chest wall kinematics. The results indicate that changes in diaphragmatic motor function and strength among LOPD subjects could be detected through dynamic respiratory testing. We concluded that neuromuscular function significantly influenced breathing endurance, timing and loading compensations."

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), the only approved therapy for Pompe disease, improves muscle function by reducing glycogen accumulation but this approach entails several limitations including a short drug half-life and an antibody response that results in reduced efficacy. To address these limitations, new treatments such as gene therapy are under development to increase the intrinsic ability of the affected cells to produce GAA. Key components to gene therapy strategies include the choice of vector, promoter, and the route of administration. The efficacy of gene therapy depends on the ability of the vector to drive gene expression in the target tissue and also on the recipient's immune tolerance to the transgene protein. In this review, we discuss the preclinical and clinical studies that are paving the way for the development of a gene therapy strategy for patients with early and late onset Pompe disease as well as some of the challenges for advancing gene therapy."

The amount of fat seen on WBMRI was quantified using proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and correlated to appropriate muscle strength and functional tests. Nineteen patients with LOPD aged 10 to 67 years were followed for a 1 to 2 year duration. There was a small increase of 1.26% (±2.57%) in overall PDFF per year in patients on ERT. Muscle strength (mMRC) and functional testing (GSGC) correlated highly with PDFF (r = -.7596, P < .0001 and r = .8267, P < .0001, respectively). Time to carry out individual tasks of the GSGC also correlated highly with PDFF of the muscles involved. Glc4 levels were normal on most visits (27/39) despite varying severity of muscle weakness in patients. Muscle strength and GSGC scores correlate highly with PDFF values from WBMRI.

We compared the previous and updated SIPs. A two-wave pre-post multicountry survey was conducted among health care professionals (HCPs) who prescribed or monitored patients on alglucosidase alfa in the largest European Union (\"EU5\") countries and Poland. Wave (W) 2 started 15 months after completion of W1 and the implementation of the updated SIP. Changes between the waves were analysed. Forty-six HCPs (34 physicians/12 nurses) participated in W1 and 52 in W2 (42 physicians/10 nurses); 22 participated in both waves. Nonsignificant differences were observed between waves 1 and 2 for awareness (75.6% in W1 and 82.4% in W2) and receipt (77.7% in W1 and 74.5% in W2) of the SIP, reading (88.6% in W1 and 89.5% in W2) and usage (88.2% in W1 and 89.5% in W2) among receivers of the SIP, or the overall knowledge about immunological testing (61.1% in W1 vs 55.1% in W2). Frequency of performance of immunological testing was significantly higher in W2 than in W1 (50.3% vs 34.4%; P = .024) with a tendency for increases in the appropriate performance of all types of testing in W2. Both versions of the SIP showed relatively high awareness, receipt, reading, and usage, with an overall trend for most measures to improve numerically in W2. The updated SIP did not require further changes."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal glycogen-metabolizing enzyme, acid-alpha glucosidase (GAA). Tongue myofibers and hypoglossal motoneurons appear to be particularly susceptible in Pompe disease. Here we used intramuscular delivery of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) for targeted delivery of an enhanced form of GAA to tongue myofibers and motoneurons in 6-month-old Pompe (<i>Gaa</i> <sup><i>-/-</i></sup> ) mice. We hypothesized that addition of a glycosylation-independent lysosomal targeting tag to the protein would result in enhanced expression in tongue (hypoglossal) motoneurons when compared to the untagged GAA. Mice received an injection into the base of the tongue with AAV9 encoding either the tagged or untagged enzyme; tissues were harvested 4 months later. Both AAV9 constructs effectively drove GAA expression in lingual myofibers and hypoglossal motoneurons. However, mice treated with the AAV9 construct encoding the modified GAA enzyme had a >200% increase in the number of GAA-positive motoneurons as compared to the untagged GAA (p < 0.008). Our results confirm that tongue delivery of AAV9-encoding GAA can effectively target tongue myofibers and associated motoneurons in Pompe mice and indicate that the effectiveness of this approach can be improved by addition of the glycosylation-independent lysosomal targeting tag."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is caused by the deficiency of lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (GAA) leading to progressive myopathy. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human (rh) GAA has limitations, including inefficient uptake of rhGAA in skeletal muscle linked to low cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) expression. To test the hypothesis that antihypertensive agents causing muscle hypertrophy by increasing insulin-like growth factor 1 expression can increase CI-MPR-mediated uptake of recombinant enzyme with therapeutic effects in skeletal muscle. Three such agents were evaluated in mice with Pompe disease (carvedilol, losartan, and propranolol), either with or without concurrent ERT. Carvedilol, a selective β-blocker, increased muscle strength but reduced biochemical correction from ERT. Administration of drugs alone had minimal effect, with the exception of losartan that increased glycogen storage and mortality either by itself or in combination with ERT. The β-blocker carvedilol had beneficial effects during ERT in mice with Pompe disease, in comparison with propranolol or losartan. Caution is warranted when prescribing antihypertensive drugs in Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "To determine the effects of 10 years of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in adult patients with Pompe disease, focusing on individual variability in treatment response. In this prospective, multicenter cohort study, we studied 30 patients from the Netherlands and France who had started ERT during the only randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial with ERT in late-onset Pompe disease (NCT00158600) or its extension (NCT00455195) in 2005 to 2008. Main outcomes were walking ability (6-minute walk test [6MWT]), muscle strength (manual muscle testing using Medical Research Council [MRC] grading), and pulmonary function (forced vital capacity [FVC] in the upright and supine positions), assessed at 3- to 6-month intervals before and after the start of ERT. Data were analyzed with linear mixed-effects models for repeated measurements. Median follow-up duration on ERT was 9.8 years (interquartile range [IQR] 8.3-10.2 years). At the group level, baseline 6MWT was 49% of predicted (IQR 41%-60%) and had deteriorated by 22.2 percentage points (pp) at the 10-year treatment point (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Baseline FVC upright was 54% of predicted (IQR 47%-68%) and decreased by 11 pp over 10 years (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Effects of ERT on MRC sum score and FVC supine were similar. At the individual level, 93% of patients had initial benefit of ERT. Depending on the outcome measured, 35% to 63% of patients had a secondary decline after ≈3 to 5 years. Still, at 10 years of ERT, 52% had equal or better 6MWT and/or FVC upright compared to baseline. The majority of patients with Pompe disease benefit from long-term ERT, but many patients experience some secondary decline after ≈3 to 5 years. Individual variation, however, is considerable. This study provides Class IV evidence that for the majority of adults with Pompe disease, long-term ERT positively affects, or slows deterioration in, muscle strength, walking ability, and/or pulmonary function."

In this multicenter, cross-sectional study, we evaluated the records of 77 patients with IOPD to analyze their clinical course, outcomes, and factors influencing the outcomes. Of the 77 patients with IOPD, phenotype data were available in 59; 46 (78%) had the classic phenotype. Overall, 58 of 77 (75%) and 19 of 77 (25%) patients were symptomatic before and after age 6 months, respectively. Alpha-glucosidase gene variant analysis available for 48 patients (96 alleles) showed missense variants in 49 alleles. Cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status could be determined or predicted in 44 of 48 patients. In total, 32 of 44 patients (72%) were CRIM-positive, and 12 of 44 patients (27%) were CRIM-negative. Thirty-nine cases received enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT), alglucosidase alfa, and 38 patients never received ERT. Median age at initiation of ERT was 6.5 months. Response to ERT was better in babies who had CRIM-positive, non-classic IOPD. This study highlights the clinical spectrum of IOPD in India and provides an insight on various factors, such as undernutrition, feeding difficulties, and recurrent respiratory infection, as possible factors influencing clinical outcomes in these patients. The study also reiterates the importance of raising awareness among clinicians about the need for early diagnosis and timely treatment of IOPD."

Ambulatory boys with DMD receiving placebo in the phase 3 ataluren (N = 115) and tadalafil (N = 116) trials were included. The trials required at least 6 months of prior corticosteroid use and stable baseline dosing. Associations between corticosteroid use and 48-week changes in ambulatory function were estimated using mixed models.

    "abstract": "Alglucosidase alfa received marketing approval for the treatment of Pompe disease in Japan in 2007. We conducted a post-marketing surveillance study to monitor the long-term safety and efficacy of alglucosidase alfa therapy among Japanese patients with Pompe disease. The safety and efficacy outcomes were collected as real-world data for up to 9 years following the initiation of treatment with alglucosidase alfa, without any intervention to treatment strategies. The safety of the drug was assessed in 73 patients in terms of the rate of drug-related adverse events, infusion-associated reactions, and antibody titers. The efficacy was evaluated in 72 patients on the basis of subjective evaluation of their general condition after treatment, pulmonary function, 6-min walk test, and survival rate. Drug-related adverse events were observed in 29 of 73 (39.7%) cases, and the cumulative adverse event rate during the 9 years of the study was 45.7%. Immunoglobulin G antibodies against alglucosidase alfa were positive in 59 of 61 cases in which the titers were not correlated with drug-related adverse events or infusion-associated reactions. After the final dosing, the treating physicians determined that the disease was at least stabilized in 62 of 72 cases (86.1%), while the results of the physical function tests suggested that disease progression was actually not stopped completely. Survival of infantile-onset cases was sustained for 9 years. The drug was generally well tolerated, and treatment with alglucosidase alfa was able to suppress disease progression in the majority of Japanese patients with Pompe disease included in this study.

    "title": "Biomedical Implications of Autophagy in Macromolecule Storage Disorders.",
    "abstract": "An imbalance between the production and clearance of macromolecules such as proteins, lipids and carbohydrates can lead to a category of diseases broadly known as macromolecule storage disorders. These include, but not limited to, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease associated with accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins, Lafora and Pompe disease associated with glycogen accumulation, whilst lipid accumulation is characteristic to Niemann-Pick disease and Gaucher disease. One of the underlying factors contributing to the build-up of macromolecules in these storage disorders is the intracellular degradation pathway called autophagy. This process is the primary clearance route for unwanted macromolecules, either via bulk non-selective degradation, or selectively via aggrephagy, glycophagy and lipophagy. Since autophagy plays a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, cell viability and human health, malfunction of this process could be detrimental. Indeed, defective autophagy has been reported in a number of macromolecule storage disorders where autophagy is impaired at distinct stages, such as at the level of autophagosome formation, autophagosome maturation or improper lysosomal degradation of the autophagic cargo. Of biomedical relevance, autophagy is regulated by multiple signaling pathways that are amenable to chemical perturbations by small molecules. Induction of autophagy has been shown to improve cell viability and exert beneficial effects in experimental models of various macromolecule storage disorders where the lysosomal functionality is not overtly compromised. In this review, we will discuss the role of autophagy in certain macromolecule storage disorders and highlight the potential therapeutic benefits of autophagy enhancers in these pathological conditions."

To investigate the impact of PSM, its length, the focality, and the PSM Gleason, on biochemical recurrence (BCR) in organ-confined RP patients. Within a high-volume center database, we identified patients who harbored organ-confined (pathologic stage T2 disease) prostate cancer (PCa) at RP (2010-2016). Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariable Cox regression models were used to test the effect of the PSM on the BCR risk. Overall, 8770 patients were identified. Of those, 6.6% (n = 579) harbored PSM. BCR-free survival at 72 months after RP was 77.7% vs 89.0% for patients with vs without PSM (P < .001). BCR-free survival rates at 72 months were 77.4% vs 73.6% (P = .1) for unifocal vs multifocal PSM, 77.2% vs 71.8% (P = .03) for Gleason pattern 3 vs ≥4 at the margin and 88.4% vs 66.3% (P < .001) for <3 vs ≥3 mm length of margin. In multivariable Cox models PSM was an independent predictor for BCR (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.40, P < .001). However, in subgroups with PSM, only ≥3 mm PSM represented an independent predictor (HR = 1.93, P = .04), while focality and Gleason at the margin were no significant predictors. PSM represents an independent predictor for BCR in organ-confined PCa at RP. Moreover, Gleason ≥4 at the margin and ≥3 mm PSM length were associated with worse BCR-free survival. Closer surveillance of patients with organ-confined PCa at RP and PSM can help to identify those who qualify for early salvage radiotherapy."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is caused by pathogenic mutations in the alpha 1,4-glucosidase (GAA) gene and in patients with late onset Pome disease (LOPD), genotype-phenotype correlations are unpredictable. Skeletal muscle pathology includes glycogen accumulation and altered autophagy of various degrees. A correlation of the muscle morphology with clinical features and the genetic background in GAA may contribute to the understanding of the phenotypic variability. Muscle biopsies taken before enzyme replacement therapy were analysed from 53 patients with LOPD. On resin sections, glycogen accumulation, fibrosis, autophagic vacuoles and the degree of muscle damage (morphology-score) were analysed and the results were compared with clinical findings. Additional autophagy markers microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3, p62 and Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 were analysed on cryosections from 22 LOPD biopsies. The myopathology showed a high variability with, in most patients, a moderate glycogen accumulation and a low morphology-score. High morphology-scores were associated with increased fibrosis and autophagy highlighting the role of autophagy in severe stages of skeletal muscle damage. The morphology-score did not correlate with the patient's age at biopsy, disease duration, nor with the residual GAA enzyme activity or creatine-kinase levels. In 37 patients with LOPD, genetic analysis identified the most frequent mutation, c.-32-13T>G, in 95%, most commonly in combination with c.525delT (19%). No significant correlation was found between the different GAA genotypes and muscle morphology type. Muscle morphology in LOPD patients shows a high variability with, in most cases, moderate pathology. Increased pathology is associated with more fibrosis and autophagy."

Demographic profile and various factors under observation were recorded. Collected data was analysed using SPSS version 22. Among 89 enrolled patients F:M ratio was (1.28:1). The most common GSD was type I (71, 79.7%) followed by III (13, 14.6%), II (3, 3.3%), IV (1, 1.1%) and IX (1, 1.1%). The Abdominal distension was the most common presentation in 89.5% followed by hepatomegaly in 86.5%, diarrhoea in 41.6%, doll's like appearance in 31.5% and vomiting, acidotic breathing with convulsions in about 20% of children in GSD I.

Consistently raised liver enzymes (92%) and creatinine phosphokinase (100%) in addition to hypertriglyceridemia (69%) were seen in GSD III. The presence of enlarged hepatocytes with clearing of cells favour GSD1 showed in 79% of children while fibrosis and steatosis usually seen in GSD-III (14.6%). Hepatic glycogen storage diseases are serious health issues and should be excluded in any patient who present with hepatomegaly, short stature and hyperlipidaemia to decrease the disease mortality and morbidity."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (OMIM # 232300) is a glycogen storage disease caused by autosomal recessive mutations of the gene encoding alpha-1,4-glucosidase (GAA; EC 3.2.1.20). Despite the relatively effective employment of enzyme replacement therapy, some critical medical issues still exist in patients with this disease, including the persistence of abnormalities in the central nervous system (CNS), probably because of the inability of the recombinant GAA to pass through the blood-brain barrier. To address this issue, identification of more therapeutic agents that target the CNS of patients with Pompe disease may be required. In this study, we derived neuronal cells from Pompe disease-induced pluripotent stem cells (Pom-iPSCs) and proved that they are able to recapitulate the hallmark cellular and biochemical phenotypes of Pompe disease. Using the Pom-iPSC-derived neurons as an in vitro drug-testing model, we then identified three compounds, ebselen, wortmannin and PX-866, with therapeutic potential to alleviate Pompe disease-associated pathological phenotypes in the neurons derived from Pom-iPSCs. We confirmed that all three compounds were able to enhance the GAA activity in the Pom-iPSC-derived neurons. Moreover, they were able to enhance the GAA activity in several important internal organs of GAA-deficient mice when co-injected with recombinant human GAA, and we found that intraperitoneal injection of ebselen was able to promote the GAA activity of the GAA-heterozygous mouse brain. Our results prove the usefulness of Pom-iPSC-derived neuronal populations for identifying new compounds with therapeutic potential."

McArdle disease is caused by recessive mutations in the muscle glycogen phosphorylase (PYGM) gene leading to absence of PYGM enzyme in skeletal muscle and preventing access to energy from muscle glycogen stores. There is currently no cure for McArdle disease. Using a preclinical animal model, we aimed to identify a clinically translatable and relevant therapy for McArdle disease. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (rAAV8) to treat a murine model of McArdle disease via delivery of a functional copy of the disease-causing gene, Pygm. Intraperitoneal injection of rAAV8-Pygm at post-natal day 1-3 resulted in Pygm expression at 8 weeks of age, accompanied by improved skeletal muscle architecture, reduced accumulation of glycogen and restoration of voluntary running wheel activity to wild-type levels. We did not observe any adverse reaction to the treatment at 8 weeks post-injection. Thus, we have investigated a highly promising gene therapy for McArdle disease with a clear path to the ovine large animal model endemic to Western Australia and subsequently to patients."

The objective of the present study was to examine clinical and molecular characteristics of infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) in Thailand. Twelve patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) including 10 Thai and two other Asian ethnicities were enrolled. To examine the molecular characteristics of Pompe patients, GAA gene was analyzed by PCR amplification and direct Sanger-sequencing of 20 exons coding region. The novel mutations were transiently transfected in COS-7 cells for functional verification. The severity of the mutation was rated by study of the GAA enzyme activity detected in transfected cells and culture media, as well as the quantity and quality of the proper sized GAA protein demonstrated by western blot analysis. The GAA three dimensional structures were visualized by PyMol software tool. All patients had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, generalized muscle weakness, and undetectable or < 1% of GAA normal activity. Three patients received enzyme replacement therapy with variable outcome depending on the age of the start of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Seventeen pathogenic mutations including four novel variants: c.876C > G (p.Tyr292X), c.1226insG (p.Asp409GlyfsX95), c.1538G > A (p.Asp513Gly), c.1895 T > G (p.Leu632Arg), and a previously reported rare allele of unknown significance: c.781G > A (p.Ala261Thr) were identified. The rating system ranked p.Tyr292X, p. Asp513Gly and p. Leu632Arg as class \"B\" and p. Ala261Thr as class \"D\" or \"E\". These novel mutations were located in the N-terminal beta-sheet domain and the catalytic domain. The present study provides useful information on the mutations of GAA gene in the underrepresented population of Asia which are more diverse than previously described and showing the hotspots in exons 14 and 5, accounting for 62% of mutant alleles. Almost all mutations identified are in class A/B. These data can benefit rapid molecular diagnosis of IOPD and severity rating of the mutations can serve as a partial substitute for cross reactive immunological material (CRIM) study."

Yet underdiagnosing and substantial diagnostic delay are still frequent and the determinants of this are unknown. This study is the first to systematically investigate the diagnostic odyssey in Pompe disease from patients', parents', and physicians' perspectives. Patients with infantile or late onset Pompe disease, their parents as well as their metabolic experts were invited to fill in respective surveys. The survey addressed perceived disease symptoms at onset and during the course of the disease, specialties of involved physicians, activities of patient-initiated search for diagnosis and the perceived impact of time to diagnosis on outcome. Results of experts' and patients'/parents' surveys were compared and expressed by descriptive statistics. We collected data on 15 males and 17 females including 9 infantile and 23 late onset Pompe patients. All received the correct diagnosis at a metabolic or musculoskeletal expert center. Patients with direct referral to the expert center had the lowest diagnostic delay, while patients who were seen by several physicians, received the correct diagnosis after 44%-200% longer delay. The proportion of direct referral varied strongly between pediatricians (57%) and other disciplines (18%-36%). Our study highlights a substantially larger diagnostic delay in Pompe patients that are not directly referred to expert centers for diagnostic work. Our findings may be used to develop more successful strategies for early diagnosis. Diagnostic delay in Pompe disease is substantial particularly in patients that are not directly referred to expert centers for diagnostic workup, so facilitating direct referral may be a new strategy for early diagnosis."

We performed a prospective cohort study on the clinical features and progression over time of 33 patients with DM1 and pronounced, mostly asymmetric scapular winging or other forms of scapular dyskinesis. We also explored if scapular dyskinesis in DM1 has the same genetic background as in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 1 (FSHD1). The cohort included patients with congenital (n = 3), infantile (n = 6) and adult-onset DM1 (n = 24). Scapular girdle examination showed moderate shoulder girdle weakness (mean MRC 3) and atrophy of trapezius, infraspinatus, and rhomboid major, seemingly similar as in FSHD1. Shoulder abduction and forward flexion were limited (50-70°). In five patients, scapular dyskinesis was the initial disease symptom; in the others it appeared 1-24 years after disease onset. Follow-up data were available in 29 patients (mean 8 years) and showed mild to severe increase of scapular dyskinesis over time. In only three patients, DM1 coexisted with a FSHD mutation. In all other patients, FSHD was genetically excluded. DM2 was genetically excluded in nine patients. The clinical features of the patients with both DM1 and FSHD1 mutations were similar to those with DM1 only. Scapular dyskinesis can be considered to be part of DM1 in a small proportion of patients. In spite of the clinical overlap, FSHD can explain scapular dyskinesis only in a small minority. This study is expected to improve the recognition of shoulder girdle involvement in DM1, which will contribute to the management of these patients."

    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease type II (GSD II) is caused by acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency. Both infantile-onset and juvenile-onset GSD II lead to proximal muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency and require mechanical ventilation. However, GSD II is also independently associated with delayed weaning from mechanical ventilation. This study aimed to describe a comprehensive approach including sequential invasive-noninvasive mechanical ventilation weaning and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients with weaning difficulties. We studied six difficult-to-wean GSD II (three juvenile-onset, three infantile-onset) patients at the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University from October 2015 to December 2017. Difficulty in weaning was defined as follows: the need for more than three spontaneous breathing trials or more than 1 week to achieve successful weaning. All patients received comprehensive treatment including sequential invasive-noninvasive mechanical ventilation weaning, ERT and general treatment. Recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme therapy (20 mg/kg every 14 days) was used after diagnosis, and Patients 1-6 received ERT for 15.5, 4.5, 2, 2.5, 17, and 2 months, respectively. The therapeutic effect of the comprehensive treatment was observed. The patients' respiratory function and limb muscle strength improved after each ERT session. Patients who successfully completed a spontaneous breathing trial could proceed to extubation, and then start non-invasive ventilation. The patients' age range at initial mechanical ventilation was 3-47 (median 26.5) months, duration of invasive ventilation was 1-36 (median 2.75) months, and duration of noninvasive ventilation was 0-0.6 (median 0.05) month. The patients' nutritional status improved after enhanced nutritional support. Patients 2, 3, and 5 were successfully weaned off the ventilator. Patient 1 underwent tracheal intubation after six weaning failures, and Patients 4 and 6 died after therapy was abandoned by their parents. Male sex, GSD II type, and the presence of malnutrition and neurological impairment may predict poor respiratory outcomes. The above-described comprehensive sequential invasive-noninvasive mechanical ventilation weaning strategy may increase the success rate of weaning from mechanical ventilation."

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is the largest organ of human body with several important roles in everyday movement and metabolic homeostasis. The limited ability of small animal models of muscle disease to accurately predict drug efficacy and toxicity in humans has prompted the development in vitro models of human skeletal muscle that fatefully recapitulate cell and tissue level functions and drug responses. We first review methods for development of three-dimensional engineered muscle tissues and organ-on-a-chip microphysiological systems and discuss their potential utility in drug discovery research and development of new regenerative therapies. Furthermore, we describe strategies to increase the functional maturation of engineered muscle, and motivate the importance of incorporating multiple tissue types on the same chip to model organ cross-talk and generate more predictive drug development platforms. Finally, we review the ability of available in vitro systems to model diseases such as type II diabetes, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Pompe disease, and dysferlinopathy."

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) performing aerobic exercise with their insulin pump connected (pump on) vs pump disconnected (pump off) have an increased risk of hypoglycemia. It has not been examined whether this risk remains during high-intensity exercise. This study compared the effects of pump on (50% basal insulin at exercise onset) vs pump off (0% basal insulin at exercise onset) on glucose concentrations during intermittent high-intensity exercise in adults with T1D and on patients' own perspective of their glycemia. Twelve adults with T1D using insulin pump therapy completed two 40-min intermittent high-intensity exercise bouts. Insulin adjustments included: 1) pump set to 50% of usual basal rate (pump on) or 2) pump suspended (pump off) during exercise, in random order. Blood glucose was recorded every 10 min during exercise and, after providing subjects with an initial reference glucose value before exercise, participants were asked to estimate their glucose during exercise. Glucose levels were higher in pump off (8.1±1.3 mmol/L) vs pump on (7.4±2.1 mmol/L) at exercise start (p<0.05), but were similar by the end of exercise (p=0.9). During exercise, hypoglycemia incidence did not differ between conditions (1 of 12 for both). However, the percentage of time in hypoglycemia at 12 h after exercise was 5±8% vs 1±2% for pump on vs pump off, respectively (p=0.3). Participants were better able to estimate their own glucose during pump on vs pump off (r<sup>2</sup>=0.46 vs r<sup>2</sup>=0.11). Pump on vs pump off at exercise onset showed no significant differences in blood glucose concentrations during 40 min of intermittent high-intensity exercise."

    "title": "Systematic review of oral and craniofacial findings in patients with Fabry disease or Pompe disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease and Pompe disease are rare lysosomal storage disorders that belong to a heterogeneous group of more than 200 distinct inborn metabolic diseases. Mutations followed by loss of function of enzymes or transporters that are localised in the acidic environment of the lysosome may result in degradation of many substrates, such as glycosaminoglycans, glycosphingolipids, glycogen, cholesterol, oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and peptides, or the excretion of the products degraded by the lysosome. Our aim was to identify the oral signs and symptoms of Fabry disease and Pompe disease from a systematic review made using MEDLINE/PubMed, and a hand search for relevant articles, following the PRISMA guidelines. Both diseases show various craniofacial and oral changes, including supernumerary teeth, dental agenesis, angiokeratoma, and telangiectases in Fabry disease; and macroglossia, teeth fusion, and taurodontism in Pompe disease. Common clinical signs of Fabry disease include hyposalivation, hypohidrosis, and xerophthalmia, and a generally reduced physical resilience was apparent in patients with Pompe disease. Oral and craniofacial changes in patients with both diseases extend over their entire lifetime and can be detected even in an infant. Lysosomal storage diseases should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of relevant diverse symptoms, because treatment, when available, is most effective when started early. The main therapeutic concepts are enzymatic replacement for Pompe disease, whereas patients with Fabry disease require additional oral chaperone treatment or enzyme replacement."

The development of the Pompe model represented a new paradigm for the involvement of patients in new treatments-and also for scientists and pharmaceutical companies. It saw patients developing a sense of agency, of involvement in the process of treatment development rather than powerless recipients or (if lucky) occasional spectators. At the same time, as described below, it benefited the other partners in the process with the result that the different components of the model added up to more than the sum of their parts. However, in order for this to happen, each part had to undergo a transformation in mindset. The development of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Pompe disease represented a unique set of circumstances and individuals that helped to bring about this change and, in doing so, created a model that has had far wider applications."

Alglucosidase alfa enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using recombinant human GAA (rhGAA ERT) is the only approved treatment for Pompe disease. Alglucosidase alfa has provided irrefutable clinical benefits, but has not been an optimal treatment primarily due to poor drug targeting of ERT to skeletal muscles. Several critical factors contribute to this inefficiency. Some are inherent to the anatomy of the body that cannot be altered, while others may be addressed with better drug design and engineering. The knowledge gained from alglucosidase alfa ERT over the past 2 decades has allowed us to better understand the challenges that hinder its effectiveness. In this review, we detail the problems which must be overcome for improving drug targeting and clinical efficacy. These same issues may also impact therapeutic enzymes derived from gene therapies, and thus, have important implications for the development of next generation therapies for Pompe."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a neuromuscular disease caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase leading to lysosomal and cytoplasmic glycogen accumulation in neurons and striated muscle. In the decade since availability of first-generation enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) a better understanding of the clinical spectrum of disease has emerged. The most severe form of early onset disease is typically identified with symptoms in the first year of life, known as infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD). Infants are described at floppy babies with cardiac hypertrophy in the first few months of life. A milder form with late onset (LOPD) of symptoms is mostly free of cardiac involvement with slower rate of progression. Glycogen accumulation in the CNS and skeletal muscle is observed in both IOPD and LOPD. In both circumstances, multi-system disease (principally motoneuron and myopathy) leads to progressive weakness with associated respiratory and feeding difficulty. In IOPD the untreated natural history leads to cardiorespiratory failure and death in the first year of life. In the current era of ERT clinical outcomes are improved, yet, many patients have an incomplete response and a substantial unmet need remains. Since the neurological manifestations of the disease are not amenable to peripheral enzyme replacement, we set out to better understand the pathophysiology and potential for treatment of disease manifestations using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene transfer, with the first clinical gene therapy studies initiated by our group in 2006. This review focuses on the preclinical studies and clinical study findings which are pertinent to the development of a comprehensive gene therapy strategy for both IOPD and LOPD. Given the advent of newborn screening, a significant focus of our recent work has been to establish the basis for repeat administration of AAV vectors to enhance neuromuscular therapeutic efficacy over the life span."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid-alpha glucosidase (GAA). Pathogenic variants in the GAA gene lead to excessive accumulation of lysosomal glycogen primarily in the cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscles. There is growing evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in PD. Current research is focused on determining the true extent of CNS involvement, its effects on behavior and cognition, and effective therapies that would correct the disease in both muscle and the CNS. This review article summarizes the CNS findings in patients, highlights the importance of research on animal models, explores the probable success of gene therapy in reversing CNS pathologies as reported by some breakthrough preclinical studies, and emphasizes the need to follow patients and monitor for CNS involvement over time. Lessons learned from animal models (bench) and from the literature available to date on patients will guide future clinical trials in patients (bedside) with PD. Our preliminary studies in infantile PD show that some patients are susceptible to early and extensive CNS pathologies, as assessed by neuroimaging and developmental assessments. This article highlights the importance of neuroimaging which could serve as useful tools to diagnose and monitor certain CNS pathologies such as white matter hyperintense foci (WMF) in the brain. Longitudinal studies with large sample sizes are warranted at this time to better understand the emergence, progression and consequences of CNS involvement in patients with PD."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy for Pompe disease has advanced to early phase clinical trials, based upon proof-of-concept data indicating that gene therapy could surpass the benefits of the current standard of care, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). ERT requires frequent infusions of large quantities of recombinant human acid α-glucosidase (GAA), whereas gene therapy involves a single infusion of a vector that stably transduces tissues to continuously produce GAA. Liver-specific expression of GAA with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector established stable GAA secretion from the liver accompanied by receptor-mediated uptake of GAA, which corrected the deficiency of GAA and cleared the majority of accumulated glycogen in the heart and skeletal muscle. Liver depot gene therapy was equivalent to ERT at a dose of the AAV vector that could be administered in an early phase clinical trial. Furthermore, high-level expression of GAA has decreased glycogen stored in the brain. A unique advantage of liver-specific expression stems from the induction of immune tolerance to GAA following AAV vector administration, thereby suppressing anti-GAA antibodies that otherwise interfere with efficacy. A Phase I clinical trial of AAV vector-mediated liver depot gene therapy has been initiated based upon promising preclinical data (NCT03533673). Overall, gene therapy promises to address limits of currently available ERT, if clinical translation currently underway is successful."

Deficiency of GAA results in a severe, systemic disorder that, in its most severe form, can be fatal. About a decade ago, the prognosis of PD has changed dramatically with the marketing authorization of an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) based on recombinant GAA. Despite the breakthrough nature of ERT, long-term follow-up of both infantile and late-onset Pompe disease patients (IOPD and LOPD, respectively), revealed several limitations of the approach. In recent years several investigational therapies for PD have entered preclinical and clinical development, with a few next generation ERTs entering late-stage clinical development. Gene therapy holds the potential to change dramatically the way we treat PD, based on the ability to express the <i>Gaa</i> gene long-term, ideally driving enhanced therapeutic efficacy compared to ERT. Several gene therapy approaches to PD have been tested in preclinical animal models, with a handful of early phase clinical trials started or about to start. The complexity of PD and of the endpoints used to measure efficacy of investigational treatments remains a challenge, however the hope is for a future with more therapeutic options for both IOPD and LOPD patients."

The late onset form of Pompe disease (LOPD) is characterized by a progressive weakness of proximal and axial muscles, often mimicking limb-girdle muscular dystrophies or inflammatory myopathies, with respiratory distress mainly due to a diaphragmatic weakness. Diagnostic delay is still common, and clinicians need a high index of suspicion to recognize this condition because the disorder is quite rare, the clinical spectrum is wide, and signs and symptoms are not distinguishable from those in other neuromuscular disorders that present in a similar fashion. Diagnostic laboratory tests are quite fast and reliable to detect the enzymatic deficiency. Enzyme replacement therapy has been available for several years, and other new therapeutic strategies such as gene therapy are underway.

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase resulting in intralysosomal glycogen accumulation in multiple tissue types, especially cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa has led to improved clinical outcomes and prolonged survival in patients with Pompe disease. While ERT has changed the natural course of Pompe disease, with many long-term survivors, several factors affect the response to ERT. Previous studies in Pompe disease have shown that IgG antibodies to ERT can lead to a decline in muscle strength, pulmonary function, and overall and ventilator-free survival. Additionally, antibody responses to ERT can also cause hypersensitivity reactions. Various strategies to prevent or eliminate the IgG antibody response have been attempted in patients with Pompe disease. A detailed literature search was performed to compile data regarding the consequences of IgG antibodies, clinical approaches to prevent or eliminate IgG antibodies in patients with Pompe disease, and to expand our understanding of new modalities being developed in non-clinical settings. All qualifying articles describing the impact of IgG antibodies on the response to ERT, immunomodulation in patients with Pompe disease, and non-clinical settings identified via a PubMed database search were included in the review. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of combination- and single-agent therapies that have been investigated in the context of immune tolerance induction to ERT in Pompe disease to date. Immunomodulation strategies that successfully induce immune tolerance to ERT have improved overall survival, especially reflected in the decreased number of ventilator-dependent or deceased cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM)-negative infantile Pompe disease (IPD) patients due to development of IgG antibodies when treated with ERT alone. Immunomodulation in CRIM-positive patients at the time they receive ERT also results in a decrease in the development of IgG antibodies compared to cases treated with ERT alone. Lessons learned from current approaches, alongside results from trials of novel immunomodulation strategies, may provide important insights into the development of next-generation therapies."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is classified by age of onset, organ involvement, severity, and rate of progression in two main forms: the first one, infantile onset Pompe disease (IOPD), presents before the age of 12 months with generalized muscle weakness, hypotonia, respiratory distress, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as main clinical features. The second form, late onset Pompe disease (LOPD), is characterized by an onset at the age of 12 months to adulthood, hyperCKemia, and limb-girdle and axial muscle weakness, often complicated by respiratory muscles degeneration. In the last 10-15 years, an increasing interest in Pompe disease has led to multiple studies in an effort to clarify the emerging clinical aspects, to find out the best diagnostic tools to identify the disease as early as possible, and to offer new therapeutic options apart from enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Since 2006, ERT-the first treatment for Pompe disease-has been universally accepted in the majority of countries all over the world. Although for years Pompe disease has been primarily considered a muscle disorder, nowadays it is clear that the involvement of several other organs has changed the cultural approach to this entity which is now viewed as a multisystem disorder. The emerging clinical aspects have greatly expanded the spectrum of the disease manifestations. In fact, central, peripheral, and autonomous nervous systems are often involved; vascular malformations and heart involvement are frequently observed; musculoskeletal and bone changes as well as oro-gastrointestinal and urinary tract alterations have been better defined. A great deal of effort has been made to clarify the clinical aspects of Pompe disease, to raise awareness of the LOPD patients' problems and to improve their quality of life."

These outcomes led to the approval of ERT in 2006. Implementation of ERT has uncovered multisystemic character of IOPD, not known in the pre-ERT era. Although ERT has substantially improved the prognosis of IOPD, mortality is still considerable, and decline of motor function with time is frequent in long-term survivors.

    "abstract": "The current standard of care for Pompe disease (PD) is the administration of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Exercise and nutrition are often considered as complementary strategies rather than \"treatments\" <i>per se</i>. Nutritional assessment is important in patients with locomotor disability because the relative hypodynamia limits energy expenditure and thus the total amount of energy must be reduced to avoid obesity. A lower total energy intake often leads to lower protein and micronutrient intake. Consequently, ensuring that Pompe patients are tested for and replaced for deficiencies (protein, vitamin D, vitamin B12, etc.) is an important aspect of care. Furthermore, given the role of autophagy in the pathophysiology of PD and the fact that fasting induces autophagy, it is important that strategies such as nutritional timing and amino acid intake (L-arginine, L-leucine) be evaluated as therapies. Exercise interventions have been shown to improve six-minute walk testing distance by more than what was seen in the seminal ERT study in late-onset PD. Exercise therapy can also activate autophagy, and this is likely another component of its efficacy. The current review will evaluate the theoretical and practical aspects of nutrition and exercise as therapies for patients with PD."

This regenerative potential is often compromised under muscle-degenerative conditions. Consequently, the damage produced during degeneration is not efficiently repaired and the balance between repair and damage is lost. Here we review recent progress on the role of satellite cell-mediated repair in neuromuscular disorders with a focus on Pompe disease, an inherited metabolic myopathy caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha glucosidase (GAA). Studies performed in patient biopsies as well as in Pompe disease mouse models demonstrate that muscle regeneration activity is compromised despite progressing muscle damage. We describe disease-specific mechanisms of satellite cell dysfunction to highlight the differences between Pompe disease and muscle dystrophies. The mechanisms involved provide possible targets for therapy, such as modulation of autophagy, muscle exercise, and pharmacological modulation of satellite cell activation. Most of these approaches are still experimental, although promising in animal models, still warrant caution with respect to their safety and efficiency profile."

A growing body of evidence has connected this defect to the decline in muscle function and muscle resistance to the currently available treatment-enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Both induction and inhibition of autophagy have been tested in pre-clinical studies in a mouse model of the disease.

We report our experience with 18 adult patients (14 males/4 females) with Pompe disease, several of whom had unique findings and novel pathogenic variants. Patients ranged in ages from 22-74 years (mean 53.7 years) and were diagnosed at an age range of 11-65 years (mean 43.6 years), often after a history of progressive muscle disease of several years' duration. All 18 patients were treated with alglucosidase alfa (Lumizyme) and their response to treatment was monitored by measurements of their pulmonary function and muscle weakness, six-minute walk test (6MWT), and other functional studies. Genetic sequencing revealed that 16 out of 18 individuals had the common c.-32-13T>G splicing variant, and six patients, including two sibships had four novel pathogenic variants: c.1594G>A, c.2655_2656delCG, c.1951-1952delGGinsT, and c.1134C>G.

We analyzed the effect of low and intermediate antibody titers in clinical and radiological progression. There were no differences between the results of muscle function tests, spirometry or fat fraction analyzed using qMRI between patients with and without antibodies groups at baseline. Moreover, antibody titers did not influence muscle function test, spirometry results or qMRI results at year 1 visit. Most of the LOPD patients developed antibodies against ERT that persisted over time at low or intermediate levels.

Neither breed nor sex were significantly associated to the presence of the mutation. The prevalence informed in this study is similar to the average prevalence reported for Australian Brahmans.

We identified 14 microRNAs that showed different expression levels in serum samples of AOPD patients compared to controls. We validated these results in a larger cohort of patients and we found increased levels of three microRNAs, the so called dystromirs: miR-1-3p, miR-133a-3p, and miR-206. These microRNAs are involved in muscle regeneration and the expression of these was increased in patients' muscle biopsies. Significant correlations between microRNA levels and muscle function test were found. Serum expression levels of dystromirs may represent additional biomarkers for the follow-up of AOPD patients."

    "abstract": "Identification of variants in the acid α-glucosidase (GAA) gene in Pompe disease provides valuable insights and systematic overviews are needed. We report on the number, nature, frequency, and geographic distribution of GAA sequence variants listed in the Pompe Registry, a long-term, observational program and the largest global repository of Pompe disease data. Variant information was reviewed and compared with publicly available GAA databases/resources. Among 1,079 eligible patients, 2,075 GAA variants (80 unique novel) were reported. Variants were listed by groups representing Pompe disease phenotypes. Patients were classified as Group A: Symptom onset ≤ 12 months of age with cardiomyopathy; Group B: Symptom onset ≤ 12 years of age (includes patients with symptom onset ≤ 12 months of age without cardiomyopathy); or Group C: Symptom onset > 12 years of age. Likely impact of novel variants was predicted using bioinformatics algorithms. Variants were classified by pathogenicity using ACMG guidelines. Data reported from the Pompe Registry provide new information about the distribution of GAA variants globally and across the clinical spectrum, add to the number and diversity of GAA variants registered in public databases through published data sharing, provide a first indication of the severity of novel variants, and assist in diagnostic practice and outcome prediction."

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a rare genetic disorder due to the absence or deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme resulting in slowly progressing reduction of muscle strength, causing difficulties with mobility and respiration. Wearable technologies offer novel options to evaluate mobility in a real-world setting. LOPD patients self-reporting LOPD, ≥18 years, US residents, walking (with or without aid), and not on invasive ventilation were recruited for a 6- to 8-week wearable study via patient organizations. Eligible patients were shipped a wearable tracker (Fitbit One™) and completed self-assessment questionnaires. Mobility outcome measures were median step count and peak 1-min activity. In the analyses cohort (<i>N</i> = 29), engagement in data sharing was high (94% of patients uploaded data for more than half the study days). Mean age was 43 years, 90% were females, and 93% were diagnosed in adulthood. Mean delay in diagnosis was 10 years; most had disease onset for ≥10 years (55%); some required walking aid (17%) and breathing assistance (38%). Mean step count differed by age (20-39 years: 4071 vs. 40-69 years: 2394, <i>p</i> < 0.01), diagnostic delay (<10 years: 3584 vs. ≥10 years: 2232, <i>p</i> < 0.05), disease duration (<10 years: 4219 vs. ≥10 years: 2462, <i>p</i> < 0.05), and ambulatory status (aided: 1883 vs. unaided: 3408, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Patient-reported \"fatigue and pain\" score was inversely correlated with step count (Pearson's <i>r</i> = -0.42, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and peak 1-min activity (Pearson's <i>r</i> = -0.49, <i>p</i> < 0.01).

    "abstract": "<b><i>Background:</i></b> Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD Ia), also known as von Gierke disease, is the most common glycogen storage disorder. It is caused by the deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. The accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate leads to increased glycogen and triglyceride levels in the liver. Patients with GSD Ia can develop steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and increased risk for hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. We previously showed that animal models of GSD Ia had defective autophagy and dysfunctional mitochondria. In this study, we examined the effect of VK2809, a liver-specific thyroid hormone receptor β agonist, on hepatic steatosis, autophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis in a mouse model of GSD Ia. <b><i>Methods:</i></b><i>G6pc</i><sup>-/-</sup>-deficient (GSD Ia) mice were treated with VK2809 or vehicle control by daily intraperitoneal injection for four days. The hepatic triglyceride and glycogen were determined by biochemical assays. Autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis were measured by Western blotting for key autophagy and mitochondrial markers. <b><i>Results:</i></b> VK2809 treatment decreased hepatic mass and triglyceride content in GSD Ia mice. VK2809 stimulated hepatic autophagic flux as evidenced by increased microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3B-II), decreased p62 protein levels, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, enhancement of protein levels of ATG5-ATG12, and increased lysosomal protein expression. VK2809 also increased the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1α) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (<i>FGF21</i>), as well as mitochondrial biogenesis to promote mitochondrial β-oxidation. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> In summary, VK2809 treatment decreased hepatic triglyceride levels in GSD Ia mice through its simultaneous restoration of autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, and β-oxidation of fatty acids. Liver-specific thyromimetics represent a potential therapy for hepatosteatosis in GSD Ia as well as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease."

The Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI, /'kā-jē/) is a community experiment to objectively assess computational methods for predicting the phenotypic impacts of genomic variation. CAGI participants are provided genetic variants and make blind predictions of resulting phenotype. Independent assessors evaluate the predictions by comparing with experimental and clinical data. CAGI has completed five editions with the goals of establishing the state of art in genome interpretation and of encouraging new methodological developments. This special issue (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/10981004/2019/40/9) comprises reports from CAGI, focusing on the fifth edition that culminated in a conference that took place 5 to 7 July 2018. CAGI5 was comprised of 14 challenges and engaged hundreds of participants from a dozen countries. This edition had a notable increase in splicing and expression regulatory variant challenges, while also continuing challenges on clinical genomics, as well as complex disease datasets and missense variants in diseases ranging from cancer to Pompe disease to schizophrenia.

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) causes myopathy of skeletal and respiratory muscles, and phrenic nerve pathology putatively contributes to diaphragm weakness. The aim of this study was to investigate neural contributions to diaphragm dysfunction, usefulness of diaphragm ultrasound, and involvement of expiratory abdominal muscles in LOPD. Thirteen patients with LOPD (7 male, 51±17 years) and 13 age- and gender-matched controls underwent respiratory muscle strength testing, ultrasound evaluation of diaphragm excursion and thickness, cortical and cervical magnetic stimulation (MS) of the diaphragm with simultaneous recording of surface electromyogram and twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure (twPdi; n = 6), and MS of the abdominal muscles with recording of twitch gastric pressure (twPgas; n = 6). The following parameters were significantly reduced in LOPD patients versus controls: forced vital capacity (p<0.01), maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure (both p<0.001), diaphragm excursion velocity (p<0.05), diaphragm thickening ratio (1.8 ± 0.4 vs. 2.6 ± 0.6, p<0.01), twPdi following cervical MS (12.0 ± 6.2 vs. 19.4 ± 4.8 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, p<0.05), and twPgas following abdominal muscle stimulation (8.8 ± 8.1 vs. 34.6 ± 17.1 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, p<0.01). Diaphragm motor evoked potentials and compound muscle action potentials showed no between-group differences. In conclusion, phrenic nerve involvement in LOPD could not be electrophysiologically confirmed. Ultrasound supports assessment of diaphragm function. Abdominal expiratory muscles are functionally involved in LOPD."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a hereditary neuromuscular disorder attributed to acid α-glucosidase deficiency, and accurately identifying this disease is essential. Our aim was to discriminate normal muscles from neuropathic muscles in children affected by Pompe disease using a texture-feature parametric imaging method that simultaneously considers microstructure and macrostructure. The study included 22 children aged 0.02-54 months with Pompe disease and six healthy children aged 2-12 months with normal muscles. For each subject, transverse ultrasound images of the bilateral rectus femoris and sartorius muscles were obtained. Gray-level co-occurrence matrix-based Haralick's features were used for constructing parametric images and identifying neuropathic muscles: autocorrelation (AUT), contrast, energy (ENE), entropy (ENT), maximum probability (MAXP), variance (VAR), and cluster prominence (CPR). Stepwise regression was used in feature selection. The Fisher linear discriminant analysis was used for combination of the selected features to distinguish between normal and pathological muscles. The VAR and CPR were the optimal feature set for classifying normal and pathological rectus femoris muscles, whereas the ENE, VAR, and CPR were the optimal feature set for distinguishing between normal and pathological sartorius muscles. The two feature sets were combined to discriminate between children with and without neuropathic muscles affected by Pompe disease, achieving an accuracy of 94.6%, a specificity of 100%, a sensitivity of 93.2%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98 ± 0.02. The CPR for the rectus femoris muscles and the AUT, ENT, MAXP, and VAR for the sartorius muscles exhibited statistically significant differences in distinguishing between the infantile-onset Pompe disease and late-onset Pompe disease groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Texture-feature parametric imaging can be used to quantify and map tissue structures in skeletal muscles and distinguish between pathological and normal muscles in children or newborns."

    "abstract": "Adult-onset inherited errors of metabolism can be difficult to diagnose. Some cases of potentially treatable myopathy are caused by autosomal recessive acid α-1,4 glucosidase (acid maltase) deficiency (Pompé disease). This study investigated whether screening of asymptomatic patients with elevated creatine kinase (CK) could improve detection of Pompé disease. Pathology databases in six hospitals were used to identify patients with elevated CK results (>2× upper limit of normal). Patients were recalled for measurement of acid α-1,4 glucosidase activity in dried blood spot samples. Samples were obtained from 812 patients with elevated CK. Low α-glucosidase activity was found in 13 patients (1.6%). Patients with neutropaenia (n=4) or who declined further testing (n=1) were excluded. Confirmation plasma specimens were obtained from eight individuals (1%) for a white cell lysosomal enzyme panel, and three (0.4%) were confirmed to have low α-1,4-glucosidase activity. One patient was identified as a heterozygous carrier of an acid α-1,4 glucosidase c.-32-13 G>T mutation. Screening also identified one patient who was found to have undiagnosed Fabry disease and one patient with McArdle's disease. One patient later presented with Pompé's after an acute illness. Including the latent case, the frequency of cases at 0.12% was lower than the 2.5% found in studies of patients with raised CK from neurology clinics (p<0.001). Screening pathology databases for elevated CK may identify patients with inherited metabolic errors affecting muscle metabolism. However, the frequency of Pompé's disease identified from laboratory populations was less than that in patients referred for neurological investigation."

To address this need, we have developed a 12-week respiratory muscle training (RMT) program that provides calibrated, individualized, and progressive pressure-threshold resistance against inspiration and expiration. Our previous results suggest that our RMT regimen is safe, well-tolerated, and results in large increases in respiratory muscle strength. We now conduct an exploratory double-blind, randomized control trial (RCT) to determine: 1) utility and feasibility of sham-RMT as a control condition, 2) the clinically meaningful outcome measures for inclusion in a future efficacy trial. This manuscript provides comprehensive information regarding the design and methods used in our trial and will aid in the reporting and interpretation of our future findings. Twenty-eight adults with LOPD will be randomized (1:1) in blocks of 4 to RMT (treatment) or sham-RMT (control). Assessments will be conducted at pretest, posttest, 3-months detraining, and 6-months detraining. The primary outcome is maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP).

Exploratory outcomes include quantitative measures from polysomnography; patient reported measures of fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and sleep quality; and ultrasound measures of diaphragm thickness.

    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease II (GSDII), also called Pompe disease, is an autosomal recessive inherited disease caused by a defect in glycogen metabolism due to the deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) responsible for its degradation. So far, more than 500 sequence variants of the GAA gene have been reported but their possible involvement on the pre-messenger RNA splicing mechanism has not been extensively studied. In this work, we have investigated, by an in vitro functional assay, all putative splicing variants within GAA exon 2 and flanking introns. Our results show that many variants falling in the canonical splice site or the exon can induce GAA exon 2 skipping. In these cases, therefore, therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring protein folding of partially active mutated GAA proteins might not be sufficient. Regarding this issue, we have tested the effect of antisense oligonucleotides (AMOs) that were previously shown capable of rescuing splicing misregulation caused by the common c.-32-13T>G variant associated with the childhood/adult phenotype of GSDII. Interestingly, our results show that these AMOs are also quite effective in rescuing the splicing impairment of several exonic splicing variants, thus widening the potential use of these effectors for GSDII treatment."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA), resulting in systemic pathological glycogen accumulation. PD can present with cardiac, skeletal muscle, and central nervous system manifestations, as a continuum of phenotypes among two main forms: classical infantile-onset PD (IOPD) and late-onset PD (LOPD). IOPD is caused by severe GAA deficiency and presents at birth with cardiac hypertrophy, muscle hypotonia, and severe respiratory impairment, leading to premature death, if not treated. LOPD is characterized by levels of residual GAA activity up to ∼20% of normal and presents both in children and adults with a varied severity of muscle weakness and motor and respiratory deficit. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), based on repeated intravenous (i.v.) infusions of recombinant human GAA (rhGAA), represents the only available treatment for PD. Upon more than 10 years from its launch, it is becoming evident that ERT can extend the life span of IOPD and stabilize disease progression in LOPD; however, it does not represent a cure for PD. The limited uptake of the enzyme in key affected tissues and the high immunogenicity of rhGAA are some of the hurdles that limit ERT efficacy. GAA gene transfer with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors has been shown to reduce glycogen storage and improve the PD phenotype in preclinical studies following different approaches. Here, we present an overview of the different gene therapy approaches for PD, focusing on <i>in vivo</i> gene transfer with AAV vectors and discussing the potential opportunities and challenges in developing safe and effective gene therapies for the disease. Based on emerging safety and efficacy data from clinical trials for other protein deficiencies, <i>in vivo</i> gene therapy with AAV vectors appears to have the potential to provide a therapeutically relevant, stable source of GAA enzyme, which could be highly beneficial in PD."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a rare neuromuscular disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase.

As of today, enzyme replacement therapy represents the main therapeutic tool for PD. Rehabilitation is an integral part of a multidisciplinary approach to this pathology. The goal of the present review is to find scientific evidence for the rehabilitative approach to PD, with respect to both the infantile- and adult-onset forms. A systematic literature review was made using the following databases: Pubmed, Pedro, Cochrane Library, EDS Base Index, Trip, and Cinhal. Randomized controlled trials or cohort studies with a sample population of at least six subjects were retrieved. The PICO method was used to formulate the clinical query. The search resulted in 1665 articles. Of these, four cohort studies were subjected to the final phase of the review. Three studies regarded inspiratory muscle training with a threshold, while the fourth study analyzed the effectiveness of therapeutic, aerobic, and reinforcement exercises. Inspiratory muscle training with a threshold increases the pressures generated during inhalation. Aerobic exercise is capable of increasing patients' muscular endurance and performance. To date, however, rehabilitative treatment for patients with PD has no validation in evidencebased medicine. Further studies, possibly with a larger sample size and higher quality are necessary to confirm the effectiveness of rehabilitation in patients with PD."

The Danon disease, Fabry disease and Pompe disease, tuberous sclerosis, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), and mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome are genetic multisystem disorders which may involve pre-excitation, usually combined with cardiomyopathy. The anaesthetic management of the above syndromes may become quite challenging. We conducted a PubMed and manual literature search for all types of relevant publications; we identified 58 articles suitable to be included in the present review. According to the literature, a high index of suspicion for the possibility of pre-excitation is required, and anaesthetic drugs and adjuvants should be chosen carefully, in order to prevent or at least not facilitate arrhythmias associated with accessory pathways. The perioperative management should be further tailored to the specific abnormalities of each condition. Multidisciplinary consultation and care, according to the affected organs, are mandatory for a safe outcome. The anaesthetic plan should be focused on preoperative clinical optimization and on case-specific management, tailored to the various systems involved."

The current Pompe mutation database provides a severity rating of GAA variants based on in silico predictions and expression studies. Here, we extended the database with clinical information of reported phenotypes. We added additional in silico predictions for effects on splicing and protein function and for cross reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status, minor allele frequencies, and molecular analyses. We analyzed 867 patients and 562 GAA variants. Based on their combination with a GAA null allele (i.e., complete deficiency of GAA enzyme activity), 49% of the 422 disease-associated variants could be linked to classic infantile, childhood, or adult phenotypes. Predictions and immunoblot analyses identified 131 CRIM negative and 216 CRIM positive variants. While disease-associated missense variants were found throughout the GAA protein, they were enriched up to seven-fold in the catalytic site. Fifteen percent of disease-associated missense variants were predicted to affect splicing. This should be confirmed using splicing assays. Inclusion of clinical severity rating in the Pompe mutation database provides an invaluable tool for diagnosis, prognosis of disease progression, treatment regimens, and the future development of personalized medicine for Pompe disease."

We found that gene-specific features can improve the performance of existing impact prediction tools that mostly rely on general features for pathogenicity prediction. Majority of the poorly predicted mutants that lower wildtype GAA enzyme activity occurred on the surface of the GAA protein. We also found that gene-specific features were uncorrelated with existing methods and provided orthogonal information for interpreting the origin of pathogenicity, particular in variants that are poorly predicted by existing general methods. Specific variants in GAA, when investigated in the context of its protein structure, suggested gene-specific information like the disruption of local backbone torsional geometry and disruption of particular sidechain-sidechain hydrogen bonds as some potential sources for pathogenicity."

    "abstract": "The focus of this review is the development of gene therapy for glycogen storage diseases (GSDs). GSD results from the deficiency of specific enzymes involved in the storage and retrieval of glucose in the body. Broadly, GSDs can be divided into types that affect liver or muscle or both tissues. For example, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) deficiency in GSD type Ia (GSD Ia) affects primarily the liver and kidney, while acid α-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency in GSD II causes primarily muscle disease. The lack of specific therapy for the GSDs has driven efforts to develop new therapies for these conditions. Gene therapy needs to replace deficient enzymes in target tissues, which has guided the planning of gene therapy experiments. Gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors has demonstrated appropriate tropism for target tissues, including the liver, heart and skeletal muscle in animal models for GSD. AAV vectors transduced liver and kidney in GSD Ia and striated muscle in GSD II mice to replace the deficient enzyme in each disease. Gene therapy has been advanced to early phase clinical trials for the replacement of G6Pase in GSD Ia and GAA in GSD II (Pompe disease). Other GSDs have been treated in proof-of-concept studies, including GSD III, IV and V. The future of gene therapy appears promising for the GSDs, promising to provide more efficacious therapy for these disorders in the foreseeable future."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a fatal neuromuscular disorder caused by a deficiency in acid α-glucosidase, an enzyme responsible for glycogen degradation in the lysosome. Currently, the only approved treatment for Pompe disease is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which increases patient survival, but does not fully correct the skeletal muscle pathology. Skeletal muscle pathology is not corrected with ERT because low cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor abundance and autophagic accumulation inhibits the enzyme from reaching the lysosome. Thus, a therapy that more efficiently targets skeletal muscle pathology, such as adeno-associated virus (AAV), is needed for Pompe disease. The goal of this project was to deliver a rAAV9-coGAA vector driven by a tissue restrictive promoter will efficiently transduce skeletal muscle and correct autophagic accumulation. Thus, rAAV9-coGAA was intravenously delivered at three doses to 12-week old Gaa-/- mice. 1 month after injection, skeletal muscles were biochemically and histologically analyzed for autophagy-related markers. At the highest dose, GAA enzyme activity and vacuolization scores achieved therapeutic levels. In addition, resolution of autophagosome (AP) accumulation was seen by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis of autophagy-related proteins. Finally, mice treated at birth demonstrated persistence of GAA expression and resolution of lysosomes and APs compared to those treated at 3 months. In conclusion, a single systemic injection of rAAV9-coGAA ameliorates vacuolar accumulation and prevents autophagic dysregulation."

Recently, advanced technologies have greatly expanded preclinical and clinical research, and specific therapies have been developed. <b>Area covered</b>: We provide an overview of novel pharmacological approaches to the main NMDs, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), spina muscular atrophy (SMA), X-linked myotubular myopathy, Pompe disease (PD), and myotonic dystrophy type 1, with attention to both achievements and unresolved therapeutic challenges. We conducted a selected review of relevant publications in the last five years identified through PubMed and Scopus. Additional information was derived from the website of clinicaltrials.gov and from the authors' direct knowledge of research activities. <b>Expert Opinion</b>: For the first time, targeted therapies have received conditional regulatory approval and have been introduced into clinical care: enzyme replacement therapy for PD, gene expression modulation for DMD and SMA, and gene therapy for SMA. Though not curative, these treatments can improve functioning and increase survival. Issues still to be addressed include: early recognition, definition of new emerging phenotypes, development of more sensitive outcome measures, long-term risk-benefit estimates, high costs sustainability, and criteria for therapy initiation and discontinuation."

    "title": "Implementation of Second-Tier Tests in Newborn Screening for Lysosomal Disorders in North Eastern Italy.",
    "abstract": "The increasing availability of treatments and the importance of early intervention have stimulated interest in newborn screening for lysosomal storage diseases. Since 2015, 112,446 newborns in North Eastern Italy have been screened for four lysosomal disorders-mucopolysaccharidosis type I and Pompe, Fabry and Gaucher diseases-using a multiplexed tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) assay system. We recalled 138 neonates (0.12%) for collection of a second dried blood spot. Low activity was confirmed in 62 (0.06%), who underwent confirmatory testing. Twenty-five neonates (0.02%) were true positive: eight with Pompe disease; seven with Gaucher disease; eight with Fabry disease; and two with Mucopolysaccharidosis type I. The combined incidence of the four disorders was 1 in 4497 births. Except for Pompe disease, a second-tier test was implemented. We conclude that newborn screening for multiple lysosomal storage diseases combined with a second-tier test can largely eliminate false-positives and achieve rapid diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with rhGAA has improved clinical outcomes in infantile Pompe disease (IPD). A subset of CRIM-positive IPD patients develop high and sustained antibody titers (HSAT; ≥51,200) and/or sustained intermediate titer (SIT; ≥12,800 and <51,200), similar to CRIM-negative patients. To date there has been no systematic study to analyze the extent of IgG antibody response in CRIM-positive IPD. Such data would be critical and could serve as a comparator group for potential immune modulation approaches. A retrospective analysis of the dataset from the original rhGAA clinical trials final reports was conducted. CRIM-positive patients who received ERT monotherapy and had >6 months of antibody titer data available, were included in the study. Patients were classified based on their longitudinal antibody titers into HSAT, SIT, and low titer (LT; <12,800) groups. Of the 37 patients that met inclusion criteria, five (13%), seven (19%), and 25 (68%) developed HSAT, SIT, and LT, respectively. Median peak titers were 204,800 (51,200-409,600), 25,600 (12,800-51,200), and 800 (200-12,800) for HSAT, SIT, and LT groups, respectively. Median last titers were 102,400 (51,200-409,600), 1600 (200-25,600), and 400 (0-12,800) at median time since ERT initiation of 94 weeks (64-155 weeks), 104 weeks (86-144 weeks), and 130 weeks (38-182 weeks) for HSAT, SIT, and LT groups, respectively. 32% (12/37) of CRIM-positive IPD patients developed HSAT/SIT which may lead to limited ERT response and clinical decline. Further Studies are needed to identify CRIM-positive IPD patients at risk of developing HSAT/SIT, especially with the addition of Pompe disease to the newborn screening."

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a rare, metabolic disease primarily affecting the musculoskeletal and respiratory systems. Forced vital capacity (FVC) is commonly used to measure pulmonary function; however, associations between FVC and other LOPD outcomes remain unclear. A systematic literature review was conducted on November 2015, updated September 2016 and supplemented with clinical trial data from the sponsor. Outcomes included: 6-min walk test distance (6MWT), FVC, maximal inspiratory/expiratory pressure (MIP/MEP), Medical Research Council-skeletal muscle strength score (MRC), 36-item short-form survey-physical component score (SF-36), Rotterdam Handicap Scale (RHS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and survival. Individual patient data meta-analysis was used for cross-sectional analyses and longitudinal analyses to determine associations between percent of predicted FVC and LOPD measures and outcomes. Fifteen studies were selected. From cross-sectional analyses, FVC and MRC were most strongly associated. Specifically, patients with 10% higher FVC (a round number for illustrative purposes only) were associated with a 4.72% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.37, 6.07) higher MRC score, indicating a positive association. Similarly, slopes for the 6MWT and SF-36 relative to a 10% higher FVC were estimated at 33.2 meters (95% CI 24.0, 42.4) and 1.2% (95% CI 0.24, 2.16%), respectively. From longitudinal analyses, a 10% incremental increase in predicted FVC was associated with an average increase of 4.12% in MRC score (95% CI 1.29, 6.95), 35.6 m in the 6MWT (95% CI 19.9, 51.6), and 1.34% in SF-36 (95% CI 0.08, 2.60). There was insufficient data to conduct analyses for RHS, FSS and survival. FVC is positively associated with LOPD measures and outcomes across multiple domains. Additionally, longitudinal changes in FVC are positively associated with changes in the 6MWT, MRC and SF-36."

Treatment with recombinant human alglucosidase alfa is available as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Recently progressive white matter lesions (WML) have been observed as a new phenotype in CIOPD patients on treatment with ERT. To investigate the impact of disease and ERT for the development of WML in LOPD. WML were analysed in 19 treated LOPD patients and compared with findings of 38 matched controls. Patients median age was 54.4 years (range 19 to 82 years) with median disease duration of 7 years (range 2 to 40 years). Median ERT duration was 63 months (range 9 to 135 months). Grading of WML by Fazekas Score was not different in LOPD patients and controls: Mean of total Fazekas score in LOPD was 2.42 ± 2.40 and in controls 1.60 ± 2.64; p = 0.68. Also volume of WML was similar in patients and controls (mean 5.27 ml ± 5.88 and 7.89 ml ± 11.40 respectively, p = 0.35). Total Fazekas grade correlated directly with the age in LOPD patients (r = 0.60; p = 0.007) and in controls (r = 0.32; p = 0.04). There was a negative correlation of ERT duration and total Fazekas grade (r = -0.41; p = 0.04). The study suggests that WML in LOPD mainly result from concomitant cerebrovascular risk factors rather than from the Pompe disease itself."

Because of the remarkable success of this therapy, enormous effort and resource has gone into developing other ERTs, for Gaucher (where three different enzyme preparations have now been approved) and for other LSDs. We now have more than 10 years of clinical experience in using ERT to treat Gaucher, Fabry, Pompe and MPS I, II, and VI.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in bioengineering have enabled cell culture systems that more closely mimic the native cellular environment. Here, we demonstrated that human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived myogenic progenitors formed highly-aligned myotubes and contracted when seeded on two-dimensional micropatterned platforms. The differentiated cells showed clear nuclear alignment and formed elongated myotubes dependent on the width of the micropatterned lanes. Topographical cues from micropatterning and physiological substrate stiffness improved the formation of well-aligned and multinucleated myotubes similar to myofibers. These aligned myotubes exhibited spontaneous contractions specifically along the long axis of the pattern. Notably, the micropatterned platforms developed bundle-like myotubes using patient-derived iPSCs with a background of Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II) and even enhanced the disease phenotype as shown through the specific pathology of abnormal lysosome accumulations. A highly-aligned formation of matured myotubes holds great potential in further understanding the process of human muscle development, as well as advancing in vitro pharmacological studies for skeletal muscle diseases."

    "abstract": "Subjects with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) typically present as slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness. Respiratory muscle weakness and diaphragmatic paralysis are common features, and may be the initial manifestation of the disease. There is often a poor correlation between the severity of limb and respiratory muscle weakness. Early clinical observations about disproportionate hypercapnia to the respiratory muscular weakness in late-onset Pompe disease were recognized and will be discussed with special reference to blunted respiratory drive, and the connections between early clinical observations, respiratory functional studies and anatomical findings. According to new evidence about blunted respiratory drive in Pompe disease, it is necessary to rethink what is meant by \"asymptomatic Pompe disease\" and propose a new phenotype with its therapeutic implications. The conceptual model of the mechanisms leading to respiratory failure in this disease could be considered according to these new findings. It may broaden the diagnostic spectrum of the adult forms and warrants a closer interaction between neurologists and pulmonologists. The recognition of this new phenotype of predominant central alveolar hypoventilation in Pompe disease will improve the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ventilatory failure and could lead to improved future therapeutic strategies."

In this article, we discuss complexities associated with NBS processes in the United States, with a focus on challenges in neuromuscular disorders. As new interventions for neuromuscular disorders become available, the clinical community must prepare to overcome the challenges of adding new diseases to screening panels and understand the rigorous evidence review at the federal level and the complex process of state-level implementation. In this regard, NBS programs for Pompe disease and spinal muscular atrophy can guide the path of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and other neuromuscular disorders as future candidates for NBS. The availability of advanced screening methods, the emergence of effective treatment, and the support of professional organizations may facilitate the expansion of NBS, such that an increasing number of infants can be identified in the newborn period who will benefit from life-saving interventions."

We aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the substantial advancement of brain imaging in neuromuscular diseases by consulting the main libraries (<i>Pubmed, Scopus</i> and <i>Google Scholar</i>) including the more common forms of muscular dystrophies such as dystrophinopathies, dystroglycanopathies, myotonic dystrophies, facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, congenital myotonia, and congenital myopathies. A consistent, widespread cortical and subcortical involvement of grey and white matter was found. Abnormalities in the functional connectivity in brain networks and metabolic alterations were observed with positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Pathological brain changes with cognitive dysfunction seemed to be frequently associated in NMDs. In particular, in congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs), skeletal muscular weakness, severe hypotonia, WM abnormalities, ventricular dilatation and abnormalities in cerebral gyration were observed. In dystroglycanopathy 2I subtype (LGMD2I), adult patients showed subcortical atrophy and a WM periventricular involvement, moderate ventriculomegaly, and enlargement of subarachnoid spaces. Correlations with clinical features have been observed with brain imaging characteristics and alterations were prominent in congenital or childhood onset cases. In myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) symptoms seem to be less severe than in type 1 (DM1). In Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD, BMD) cortical atrophy is associated with minimal ventricular dilatation and WM abnormalities. Late-onset glycogenosis type II (GSD II) or Pompe infantile forms are characterized by delayed myelination. Only in a few cases of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) central nervous system involvement has been described and associated with executive functions impairment."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterised by limb-girdle myopathy and respiratory weakness in the late-onset form (LOPD). Various mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase gene lead to toxic lysosomal and extra-lysosomal glycogen accumulation in all organs due to ineffective glycogen clearance by the encoded enzyme. Only one randomized trial demonstrated beneficial effects of respiratory function and meters walked in the 6-min walking test with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). These results were confirmed in several retrospective and prospective observations and in meta-analyses. Due to a potential lifelong therapy, moderate efficacy and high treatment costs time of ERT initiation and cessation is an ongoing matter of debate. So far, several national and international recommendations have been published with different criteria concerning diagnosis, initiation and cessation of ERT in LOPD. We therefore formally analysed recent published recommendations and consensus statements of LOPD using diagnostic nodes (DODES) as a special software tool. With DODES, an objective analysis becomes possible if the content of the recommendations is represented as algorithms using cross-compatible elements. This analysis formally disclosed both, areas of great heterogeneity and concordance for the diagnosis and management of LOPD and paved the way for a Pompe disease burden scale focussing on ERT initiation. According to this investigation further clinical research should concentrate on ERT in pre-symptomatic and severely affected LOPD patients and on cessation criteria for ERT as these issues are areas of international uncertainty and discordance."

We investigated the origin of a rapidly emerging and severe weakness of the foot dorsiflexors in a 7-year-old boy after 6.5 years of enzyme replacement therapy. Electroneurography yielded normal findings except low compound muscle action potentials of the extensor digitorum brevis muscles after stimulation of the peroneal nerves. Electromyography of the tibial muscle demonstrated a myopathic pattern. Tibial muscle, sural nerve, and skin biopsy showed a myopathy with empty and glycogen containing vacuoles, a mild loss of myelinated and unmyelinated axons, and a moderately reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density. These findings provide evidence for a severe distal muscle involvement and a mild sensory neuropathy evolving during the course of disease after long-term enzyme replacement therapy, thereby expanding the new emerging phenotype of infantile onset Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "Reported recommendations against prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening may have negatively affected the rates of newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa). To investigate the annual rate of newly diagnosed mPCa and changes in disease characteristic at presentation over time in a large North American patient cohort. Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (2004-2014) we identified 12 939 patients newly diagnosed with mPCa. We used LOWESS to plot the annual trends for age, PSA (<50, 50-98, and >98ng/ml), clinical T stage (T1, T2, and T3-4), biopsy Gleason score ([GS] ≤6, 7, and 8-10), and M1a, M1b, and M1c substages. Multivariable logistic regression was used to test the effect of more contemporary year of diagnosis (YOD; 2014) on PSA, cT stage, GS, and M substage distributions. Multivariable linear regression was used to test the effect of more contemporary YOD on patient age. Between 2004 and 2014, the age-adjusted incidence of newly diagnosed mPCa increased from 1.9 to 2.4 cases per 100 000 population (odds ratio [OR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-1.44; p<0.0001). Rates of cT1 (from 23% to 37%; OR 1.85; p<0.0001), GS 8-10 (from 67% to 85%; OR 2.62; p<0.0001), and M1a disease (from 4.5% to 6.0%; OR 2.16; p=0.006) increased. Conversely, patient age at initial mPCa diagnosis decreased from 71 to 68 yr (coefficient -0.14; p<0.001). The PSA level at diagnosis remained stable over time. A limitation is the lack of detail on the distribution of metastatic disease. The rate of newly diagnosed mPCa increased by 25% over the past decade and the age at initial presentation decreased. These observations may be indicative of diagnostic delays related to less frequent PSA screening. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations against prostate cancer screening might have indirectly caused an increase in the rate of newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer."

Here, we summarized this screening program and described the results of the GAA gene analysis. From April 2013 to November 2016, 103,204 newborns were screened; 71 had low acid alpha-glucosidase (AαGlu) activity. GAA sequencing showed that 32 (45.1%) and 37 (52.1%) of these newborns were homozygous and heterozygous for pseudodeficiency alleles c.[1726G>A; 2965G>A], respectively. Moreover, 24 of 32 newborns with homozygous c.[1726G>A; 2965G>A] alleles had no mutations, and the other eight had one mutation each. Thirty-five of 37 newborns with heterozygous c.[1726G>A; 2965G>A] alleles had one mutation, and the other two had two mutations each. Only one newborn who had two mutations did not harbor c.[1726G>A; 2965G>A] alleles. Thus, it was difficult to distinguish newborns with c.[1726G>A; 2965G>A] alleles from newborns with pre-symptomatic Pompe disease using AαGlu assays in DBSs or fibroblasts; GAA gene sequencing was necessary. Seventy-one newborns had 50 variants, including 21 mutations or predictably pathogenic variants, and 29 polymorphisms or predictably non-pathogenic variants. Four of 21 mutations or predictably pathogenic variants and four of 29 polymorphisms or predictably non-pathogenic variants were novel. No infantile-onset Pompe disease was detected, and three newborns were diagnosed with potential late-onset Pompe disease. In the literature, 156 variants have been reported for 296 patients from 277 families in 41 articles from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China. Our results provide insights into GAA gene mutation profiles and the relationship between GAA and Pompe disease in Asian populations."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare, severe neuromuscular disease with high mortality and substantial clinical and humanistic burden. However, the economic burden of Pompe disease and the health economic value of its treatments are not well understood. The objectives of this systematic review were to characterize the health economic evidence on Pompe disease, including healthcare resource use and costs (direct and indirect), health utilities, and the cost-effectiveness of current treatments used to manage patients with Pompe disease. A systematic search of MEDLINE<sup>®</sup> and Embase<sup>®</sup> was performed to retrieve publications on the health economics of Pompe disease. Publications were screened according to predefined criteria, extracted, and quality assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were narratively synthesized. Eight publications evaluated patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) (two studies), late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) (four studies), or both (two studies). In IOPD, total cost of supportive therapy (excluding treatment) was €32,871 (equivalent to US$41,667 when adjusted for currency and inflation to 2017 US dollars) over a life expectancy of 0.4 years. In adult LOPD, the average annual cost per patient of supportive therapy was €22,475 (adjusted $28,489). Resource use in LOPD was high, with nursing home admissions accounting for 19% of annual direct medical costs. Health economic evaluations estimating incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT) versus supportive therapy ranged from £109,991 (adjusted, $186,851) per QALY gained in Columbia to €1,043,868 (adjusted, $1,323,207) in the Netherlands. Despite a full systematic literature search, only eight relevant publications were identified, most of which were of relatively poor quality. However, a significant economic burden of Pompe disease on patients, families, healthcare systems, and society was found, with the majority of costs driven by the only currently approved treatment, ERT. Health economic evaluations of ERT versus supportive therapy vary significantly, with the majority well above willingness-to-pay thresholds. New therapies and approaches to care are needed to address the persistent and lifelong economic burden of Pompe disease and the large incremental cost-effectiveness ratios observed."

    "abstract": "High-fat (HF) and rapid digestive (RD) carbohydrate diets during pregnancy promote excessive adipogenesis in offspring. This effect can be corrected by diets with similar glycemic loads, but low rates of carbohydrate digestion. However, the effects of these diets on metabolic programming in the livers of offspring, and the liver metabolism contributions to adipogenesis, remain to be addressed. In this study, pregnant insulin-resistant rats were fed high-fat diets with similar glycemic loads but different rates of carbohydrate digestion, High Fat-Rapid Digestive (HF-RD) diet or High Fat-Slow Digestive (HF-SD) diet. Offspring were fed a standard diet for 10 weeks, and the impact of these diets on the metabolic and signaling pathways involved in liver fat synthesis and storage of offspring were analyzed, including liver lipidomics, glycogen and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism key enzymes and signaling pathways. Livers from animals whose mothers were fed an HF-RD diet showed higher saturated triacylglycerol deposits with lower carbon numbers and double bond contents compared with the HF-SD group. Moreover, the HF-RD group exhibited enhanced glucose transporter 2, pyruvate kinase (PK), acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid (FA) synthase expression, and a decrease in pyruvate carboxylase (PyC) expression leading to an altered liver lipid profile. These parameters were normalized in the HF-SD group. The changes in lipogenic enzyme expression were parallel to changes in AktPKB phosphorylation status and nuclear expression in carbohydrate-response element and sterol regulatory element binding proteins. In conclusion, an HF-RD diet during pregnancy translates to changes in liver signaling and metabolic pathways in offspring, enhancing liver lipid storage and synthesis, and therefore non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk. These changes can be corrected by feeding an HF-SD diet during pregnancy."

A powerful tool for the diagnosis of the disease could reduce the \"diagnostic odyssey\" for affected families, leading to an appropriate genetic counseling and a better outcome for current therapies, since enzyme replacement therapies have been approved in Brazil for Gaucher, Fabry, and Pompe diseases, and are under development for Niemann-Pick Type B. However, application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology in the clinical diagnostic setting requires a previous validation phase. Here, we assessed the application of this technology as a fast, accurate, and cost-effective method to determine genetic diagnosis in selected LSDs. We have designed two panels for testing simultaneously 11 genes known to harbor casual mutations of LSDs. A cohort of 58 patients was used to validate those two panels, and the clinical utility of these gene panels was tested in four novel cases. We report the assessment of a NGS approach as a new tool in the diagnosis of LSDs in our service."

    "title": "Strategies for the Induction of Immune Tolerance to Enzyme Replacement Therapy in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I.",
    "abstract": "Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase is an established treatment for Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), but its efficacy may be limited by the development of anti-drug antibodies, which inhibit cellular uptake of the enzyme. In a related disorder, infantile Pompe disease, immune tolerance induction with low-dose, short-course methotrexate appears to reduce antibody formation. We investigated a similar regimen using oral methotrexate in three MPS I patients. All patients developed anti-laronidase immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies, and they had clinically relevant levels of cellular uptake inhibition. We then explored several immune tolerance induction strategies in MPS I mice: (1) methotrexate, (2) combination of non-depleting anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies, (3) methotrexate with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 monoclonals, (4) anti-CD4 monoclonal, and (5) anti-CD8 monoclonal. Treated mice received 10 weekly laronidase injections, and laronidase was delivered with adjuvant on day 49 to further challenge the immune system. Most regimens were only partially effective at reducing antibody responses, but two courses of non-depleting anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) ablated immune responses to laronidase in seven of eight MPS I mice (87.5%), even after adjuvant stimulation. Immune tolerance induction with methotrexate does not appear to be effective in MPS I patients, but use of non-depleting anti-CD4 monoclonal is a promising strategy."

    "abstract": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness, respiratory muscle dysfunction, and minor cardiac involvement. Although in LOPD, as in other neuromuscular diseases, controlled low impact sub-maximal aerobic exercise and functional ability exercise can improve general functioning and quality of life, as well as respiratory rehabilitation, the bulk of evidence on that is weak and guidelines are lacking. To date, there is no specific focus on rehabilitation issues in clinical recommendations for the care of patients with Pompe disease, and standard practice predominantly follows general recommendation guidelines for neuromuscular diseases. The Italian Association of Myology, the Italian Association of Pulmonologists, the Italian Society of Neurorehabilitation, and the Italian Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, have endorsed a project to formulate recommendations on practical, technical, and, whenever possible, disease-specific guidance on rehabilitation procedures in LOPD, with specific reference to the Italian scenario. In this first paper, we review available evidence on the role of rehabilitation in LOPD patients, particularly addressing the unmet needs in the management of motor and respiratory function for these patients."

This is the first report of Chinese patients from the global Pompe Registry. Chinese patients enrolled in the Registry ( ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT00231400) between Jan 2013 and 2 Sep 2016 with late onset Pompe disease (LOPD; presentation after 12 months of age or presentation at ≤12 months without cardiomyopathy) were included. Data analyses were descriptive. Of the 59 Chinese patients included, 86.4% had never received enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). The age at symptom onset and diagnosis was 14.9 (12.35) and 22.1 (10.08) years, which is younger than previous reports of LOPD patients from the rest of the world (28.4 [18.86] and 34.9 [20.03], respectively). The most common diagnosis methods were enzyme assay (79.7%) and/or DNA analysis (61.0%). Of the 36 patients diagnosed using DNA analysis, 31 had standardized variant data and among these patients the most common mutations were c.2238G > C (n = 18, 58.1%) and c.2662G > T (n = 5, 16.1%). Chinese LOPD patients appeared to have worse lung function versus patients from the rest of the world, indicated by lower forced vital capacity (37.2 [14.00]% vs. 63.5 [26.71]%) and maximal expiratory and inspiratory pressure (27.9 [13.54] vs. 51.0 [38.66] cm H<sub>2</sub>O, and 29.4 [12.04] vs. 70.5 [52.78] cm H<sub>2</sub>O). Compared with patients from the rest of the world, Chinese patients with LOPD appeared to have younger age at symptom onset and diagnosis, lower lung function, and the majority had not received ERT. The most common mutations were c.2238G > C and c.2662G > T."

    "abstract": "Age is an important prognostic factor for functional and oncological outcomes after radical prostatectomy (RP). Considering the long life-expectancy of young patients (≤ 45 years), it remains important to examine their outcomes. Of 16.049 patients who underwent RP between 01/2006 and 12/2014 at the Martini-Klinik Prostate Cancer Center, 119 (0.7%) were ≤ 45. Known prognosticators were compared according to patient age at RP (categorical as ≤ 45, > 45 and ≤ 65, > 65 years). Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox-regressions analyzed oncological outcomes [biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival and metastasis-free survival (MFS)]. Logistic regressions were used for functional outcome. Urinary continence (UC) was defined as the use of 0 or 1 safety pad/day and potency as an IIEF-5 score of ≥ 18. Compared to their older counterparts, patients ≤ 45 years had more favorable tumor characteristics. Of all patients aged ≤ 45 years, 89% underwent bilateral and 9.3% unilateral nerve-sparing procedure. Five year BCR-free survival and MFS were 80.2% and 98.7% for patients ≤ 45 years, 72.8% and 95.0% for patients > 45 and ≤ 65 years and 70.5% and 94.9% for patients > 65 years. For the same groups, 1-year UC-rates were 97.4%, 89.4%, and 84.7% while 1.3%, 8.2%, and 11.6% used 1-2 pads/24 h. At 1-year, 75.6%, 58.6%, and 45.3% of preoperatively potent patients who underwent bilateral nerve-sparing were considered potent. Younger age was an independent predictor of favorable functional outcome also in multivariable analysis. Patients aged ≤ 45 years had more favorable tumor characteristics and oncological outcomes. Moreover, younger patients should be counseled about the excellent postoperative continence and potency rates."

    "abstract": "Neonatal screening for Pompe disease is complicated by difficulties in predicting symptom onset in patients with the common c.-32-13T>G (IVS1) variant/null (i.e. fully deleterious) acid α-glucosidase (GAA) genotype. This splicing variant occurs in 90% of Caucasian late onset patients, and is associated with a broad range of symptom onset. We analyzed a cohort of 143 compound heterozygous and 10 homozygous IVS1 patients, and we assessed ages at symptom onset, the presence of cis-acting single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and performed splicing analysis and enzyme activity assays. In compound heterozygous IVS1 patients, the synonymous variant c.510C>T was uniquely present on the IVS1 allele in 9/33 (27%) patients with childhood onset, but was absent from 110 patients with onset in adulthood. GAA enzyme activity was lower in fibroblasts from patients who contained c.510C>T than it was in patients without c.510C>T. By reducing the extent of leaky wild-type splicing, c.510C>T modulated aberrant splicing caused by the IVS1 variant. The deleterious effect of c.510C>T was also found in muscle cells, the main target cells in Pompe disease. In homozygous IVS1 patients, the c.510C>T variant was absent in 4/4 (100%) asymptomatic individuals and present in 3/6 (50%) symptomatic patients. In cells from homozygous IVS1 patients, c.510C>T caused reduced leaky wild-type splicing. c.510C>T is a genetic modifier in compound heterozygous and homozygous IVS1 patients. This finding is important for neonatal screening programs for Pompe disease.

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether immunomodulation can eliminate high sustained antibody levels, and thereby improve clinical outcome in classic infantile Pompe patients receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA). Three patients (two cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) negative) with high sustained antibodies received a three-week treatment protocol with Rituximab and Bortezomib, followed by daily Rapamycin and monthly IVIG. Patients received 40 mg/kg/week rhGAA. Antibody titers were measured using ELISA. Neutralizing effects on cellular uptake were determined. Clinical efficacy was measured in terms of (ventilator-free) survival, reduction in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and improvement in motor function. Before immunomodulation anti-rhGAA antibody titers ranged from 1:156,250 to 1:781,250 and at last assessment from 1:31,250 to 1:156,250. Neutralizing effects of anti-rhGAA antibody titers (observed in two patients) disappeared. Infusion-associated reactions were no longer present. Immunomodulation resulted in substantial increases of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and creatine kinase levels. The two CRIM-negative patients who could walk at start of immunomodulation maintained their ability to walk; the patient who had lost this ability did not regain it. To some extent, the immunomodulation protocol used in our study reduced antibody titers, but it did not eliminate them. Overall, there have been few reports on secondary immunomodulation, and various protocols have been applied. Future research should seek to identify the most successful immunomodulation protocol in patients with high sustained titers."

    "abstract": "Abnormally activated mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been reported in several model animals with inherited metabolic myopathies (IMMs). However, the profiles of mTOR pathway in skeletal muscles from patients are still unknown. This study aimed to analyze the activity of mTOR pathway in IMMs muscles. We collected muscle samples from 25 patients with mitochondrial myopathy (MM), lipid storage disease (LSD) or Pompe disease (PD). To evaluate the activity of mTOR pathway in muscle specimens, phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (p-S6) and p70S6 kinase (p-p70S6K) were analyzed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Western blotting results showed that p-p70S6K/p70S6K in muscles from LSD and MM was up-regulated when compared with normal controls (NC) (NC vs. LSD, U = 2.000, P = 0.024; NC vs. MM: U = 6.000, P = 0.043). Likewise, p-S6/S6 was also up-regulated in muscles from all three subgroups of IMMs (NC vs. LSD, U = 0.000, P = 0.006; NC vs. PD, U = 0.000, P = 0.006; NC vs. MM, U = 1.000, P = 0.007). Immunohistochemical study revealed that p-S6 was mainly expressed in fibers with metabolic defect. In MM muscles, most p-S6 positive fibers showed cytochrome C oxidase (COX) deficiency (U = 5.000, P = 0.001). In LSD and PD muscles, p-S6 was mainly overexpressed in fibers with intramuscular vacuoles containing lipid droplets (U = 0.000, P = 0.002) or basophilic materials (U = 0.000, P = 0.002). The mTOR pathway might be activated in myofibers with various metabolic defects, which might provide evidence for mTOR inhibition therapy in human IMMs."

The exact role of these antibodies in modulating efficacy of ERT in this group of patients is still not fully understood. To assess whether anti rh-GAA antibodies interfere with ERT efficacy, we studied a large Italian cohort of LOPD patients. We analyzed clinical findings and performed serial measurements of IgG anti rh-GAA antibody titers from 64 LOPD patients treated with ERT. The first examination (T0) was completed on average at 17.56 months after starting ERT, while the follow-up (T1) was collected on average at 38.5 months. Differences in T0-T1 delta of the six-minute walking test (6MWT), MRC sum score (MRC), gait, stairs and chair performance (GSGC) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were considered and then related to the antibody titers. Almost 22% of the patients never developed antibodies against GAA, while 78.1% had a positive titer (31.2% patients developed a low titer, 43.8% a medium titer and 3.1% a high titer). No statistical significance was found in relating the T0-T1 delta differences and antibody titers, except for MRC sum score values in a subgroup of patients treated < 36 months, in which those with a null antibody titer showed a greater clinical improvement than patients with a positive titer. Our results confirm that in a large cohort of LOPD patients, anti rh-GAA antibody generation did not significantly affect either clinical outcome or ERT efficacy. However, in the first 36 months of treatment, a possible interference of low-medium antibody titers with the clinical status could be present. Therefore, a careful and regular evaluation of antibody titers, especially in cases with evidence of clinical decline despite ERT, should be performed."

Since an LOPD muscle biopsy could be unspecific or even normal, the purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of LOPD in patients with non-diagnostic muscle biopsies. Six hundred biopsies were recorded at the Neuromuscular Tissue Bank of the University of Ljubljana for the period 2004-2014. All adult patients with non-diagnostic muscle biopsies were invited to the National Slovenian Neuromuscular Centre for dried blood spot testing for LOPD. A total of 90 patients (56% of those invited) responded. No patient with LOPD was found. A total of 49 patients (54%) had fixed muscle weakness, 31 (34%) had mild symptoms and no weakness and 10 (11%) had asymptomatic hyperCKemia. Ventilatory insufficiency associated with proximal muscle weakness was found in two patients (2%). No patients exhibited vacuolar myopathy, globular accumulations of glycogen or regions of increased acid phosphatase activity within the sarcoplasm. The study results do not support the hypothesis that LOPD is underestimated in Slovenian patients with non-diagnostic muscle biopsies; this could be consistent with the fact that LOPD is of low prevalence in Slovenia, as is the case in the populations of Finland, French-speaking Belgium, west Sweden and west Denmark."

In this study, unreported N-glycans containing O-acetylated SA in Myozyme and the relative quantities of total glycans were investigated using liquid chromatography (LC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using alglucosidase alfa, a recombinant human GAA (rhGAA), is the only approved treatment for Pompe disease. Although alglucosidase alfa has provided clinical benefits, its poor targeting to key disease-relevant skeletal muscles results in suboptimal efficacy. We are developing an rhGAA, ATB200 (Amicus proprietary rhGAA), with high levels of mannose-6-phosphate that are required for efficient cellular uptake and lysosomal trafficking. When administered in combination with the pharmacological chaperone AT2221 (miglustat), which stabilizes the enzyme and improves its pharmacokinetic properties, ATB200/AT2221 was substantially more potent than alglucosidase alfa in a mouse model of Pompe disease. The new investigational therapy is more effective at reversing the primary abnormality - intralysosomal glycogen accumulation - in multiple muscles. Furthermore, unlike the current standard of care, ATB200/AT2221 dramatically reduces autophagic buildup, a major secondary defect in the diseased muscles. The reversal of lysosomal and autophagic pathologies leads to improved muscle function. These data demonstrate the superiority of ATB200/AT2221 over the currently approved ERT in the murine model."

One case underwent ophthalmic examination including slit-lamp exam, fundus imaging, visual field testing, and electroretinogram. In molecular biological study, relative messenger RNA expression levels of three splicing variants of <i>Lamp2</i> or <i>LAMP2</i> in wild type mouse retina and retinal pigment epithelium, human retinal pigment epithelium cell line adult retinal pigment epithelium-19 were quantified. LAMP2 was knocked down by small interfering RNA in adult retinal pigment epithelium-19 and its effect to LC3, an autophagy marker, was assessed by Western blotting. Intracellular localization of LAMP2 and LC3 in untreated and LAMP2-knocked-down adult retinal pigment epithelium-19 was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Our case manifested cone dystrophy in both eyes. In mice, expression of <i>Lamp2a</i> and <i>Lamp2b</i> was significantly higher in retinal pigment epithelium than that in neural retina. Expression of <i>Lamp2a</i> and <i>Lamp2b</i> were significantly higher than that of <i>Lamp2c</i> in mouse retinal pigment epithelium. Adult retinal pigment epithelium-19 cells showed similar LAMP2 expression pattern to mouse retinal pigment epithelium. LAMP2 knockdown in adult retinal pigment epithelium-19 reduced LC3-II amount and the number and size of autophagosome.

Respiratory derangement can be the first indication of LOPD, but the diagnosis may be difficult for pneumologists. We hypothesize that assessing the GAA activity in suspected patients by a dried blood spot (DBS) may help the diagnosis of LOPD in the pneumological setting. We performed a multicenter DBS survey of patients with suspected LOPD according to a predefined clinical algorithm. From February 2015 to December 2017, 140 patients (57 ± 16 yrs., 80 males) were recruited in 19 Italian pneumological units. The DBS test was performed by a drop of blood collected on absorbent paper. Patients with GAA activity < 2.6 μmol/L/h were considered positive. A second DBS test was performed in the patients positive to the first assay. Patients testing positive at the re-test underwent a skeletal muscle biopsy to determine the GAA enzymatic activity. 75 recruited subjects had outpatient access, 65 subjects were admitted for an acute respiratory failure episode. Two patients tested positive in both the first and second DBS test (1.4% prevalence), and the LOPD diagnosis was confirmed through histology, with patients demonstrating a deficient GAA muscle activity (3.6 and 9.1 pmol/min/mg). A further five subjects were positive in the first DBS test but were not confirmed at re-test. The two positive cases were both diagnosed after hospitalization for acute respiratory failure and need of noninvasive ventilation. Most of the recruited patients had reduced maximal respiratory pressures (MIP 50 ± 27% and MEP 55 ± 27% predicted), restrictive pattern (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC 81.3 ± 13.6) and hypoxaemia (PaO<sub>2</sub> 70.9 ± 14.5 mmHg). Respiratory symptoms were present in all the patients, but only 48.6% of them showed muscle weakness in the pelvic girdle and/or in the scapular girdle (35.7%). DBS GAA activity test may be a powerful screening tool among pneumologists, particularly in the acute setting. A simple clinical algorithm may aid in the selection of patients on which to administer the DBS test."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease, a severe and often fatal neuromuscular disorder, is caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). The disease is characterized by the accumulation of excess glycogen in the heart, skeletal muscle, and CNS. Currently approved enzyme replacement therapy or experimental adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy has little effect on CNS correction. Here we demonstrate that a newly developed AAV-PHP.B vector can robustly transduce both the CNS and skeletal muscles in GAA-knockout (GAAKO) mice. A single intravenous injection of an AAV-PHP.B vector expressing human GAA under the control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer-chicken β-actin (CB) promoter into 2-week-old GAAKO mice resulted in widespread GAA expression in the affected tissues. Glycogen contents were reduced to wild-type levels in the brain and heart, and they were significantly decreased in skeletal muscle by the AAV treatment. The histological assay showed no visible glycogen in any region of the brain and spinal cord of AAV-treated mice. In this study, we describe a set of behavioral tests that can detect early neurological deficits linked to extensive lysosomal glycogen accumulation in the CNS of untreated GAAKO mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the therapy can help prevent the development of these abnormalities."

Long-acting selective β2 receptor agonists previously enhanced the CI-MPR expression in muscle. In this study we have evaluated the selective β2 agonist salmeterol in GAA knockout mice in combination with an AAV vector expressing human GAA specifically in the liver. Quadriceps glycogen content was significantly decreased by administration of the AAV vector with salmeterol, in comparison with the AAV vector alone (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Importantly, glycogen content of the quadriceps was reduced to its lowest level by the combination of AAV vector and salmeterol administration. Rotarod testing revealed significant improvement following treatment, in comparison with untreated mice, and salmeterol improved wirehang performance. Salmeterol treatment decreased abnormalities of autophagy in the quadriceps, as shown be lower LC3 and p62. Vector administration reduced the abnormal vacuolization and accumulation of nuclei in skeletal muscle. Thus, salmeterol could be further developed as adjunctive therapy to improve the efficacy of liver depot gene therapy for Pompe disease."

Baseline inspiration, follow-up inspiration and follow-up expiration images were spatially registered to baseline expiration so that each voxel had correspondences across all time points and respiratory phases. Voxel-wise Parametric Response Mapping (PRM) was then generated for the baseline and follow-up scans. PRM classifies lung as normal, functional small airway disease (PRM<sup>fSAD</sup>), and emphysema (PRM<sup>EMPH</sup>). Subjects with low baseline PRM<sup>fSAD</sup> and PRM<sup>EMPH</sup> predominantly had an increase in PRM<sup>fSAD</sup> on follow-up; those with higher baseline PRM<sup>fSAD</sup> and PRM<sup>EMPH</sup> mostly had increases in PRM<sup>EMPH</sup>. For GOLD 0 participants (n = 419), mean 5-year increases in PRM<sup>fSAD</sup> and PRM<sup>EMPH</sup> were 0.3% for both; for GOLD 1-4 participants (n = 306), they were 0.6% and 1.6%, respectively.

A voxel-wise longitudinal PRM analytic approach can identify patterns of disease progression in smokers with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

    "title": "The impact of Pompe disease on smooth muscle: a review.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease (OMIM 232300) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding acid α-glucosidase (GAA) (EC 3.2.1.20), the enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing lysosomal glycogen. The primary cellular pathology is lysosomal glycogen accumulation in cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and motor neurons, which ultimately results in cardiorespiratory failure. However, the severity of pathology and its impact on clinical outcomes are poorly described in smooth muscle. The advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in 2006 has improved clinical outcomes in infantile-onset Pompe disease patients. Although ERT increases patient life expectancy and ventilator free survival, it is not entirely curative. Persistent motor neuron pathology and weakness of respiratory muscles, including airway smooth muscles, contribute to the need for mechanical ventilation by some patients on ERT. Some patients on ERT continue to experience life-threatening pathology to vascular smooth muscle, such as aneurysms or dissections within the aorta and cerebral arteries. Better characterization of the disease impact on smooth muscle will inform treatment development and help anticipate later complications. This review summarizes the published knowledge of smooth muscle pathology associated with Pompe disease in animal models and in patients."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a metabolic myopathy, due to deficiency of alpha glucosidase, with a wide clinical spectrum. Enzyme replacement therapy is the only available treatment to improve morbidity and mortality, especially in infantile-onset form. However, some patients experience infusion-associated reactions, which may restrict their access to this treatment. We report on two patients (respectively 12 and 3 months old) with infantile-onset Pompe disease and severe cardiomyopathy, that presented with severe reactions during infusion of enzyme replacement therapy and were successfully desensitized with a new individualized protocol. Our protocol, using microdilution and a premedication with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and tranexamic acid, seems safe and effective and it may allow the continuation of therapy in Pompe patients resulting in the reduction of morbidity and mortality related to this disease."

    "abstract": "This multicenter/multinational, open-label, ascending-dose study (NCT01898364) evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and exploratory efficacy of repeat-dose avalglucosidase alfa (neoGAA), a second-generation, recombinant acid α-glucosidase replacement therapy, in late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). Patients ≥18 years, alglucosidase alfa naïve (Naïve) or previously receiving alglucosidase alfa for ≥9 months (Switch), with baseline FVC ≥50% predicted and independently ambulatory, received every-other-week avalglucosidase alfa 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg over 24 weeks. 9/10 Naïve and 12/14 Switch patients completed the study. Avalglucosidase alfa was well-tolerated; no deaths/life-threatening serious adverse events (SAEs). One Naïve patient withdrew for study drug-related SAEs (respiratory distress/chest discomfort). Infusion-associated reactions (IARs) affected 8 patients. Most treatment-emergent AEs/IARs were non-serious with mild-to-moderate intensity. At screening, 5 Switch patients tested positive for anti-avalglucosidase alfa antibodies; on-treatment, 2 Switch and 9 Naïve patients seroconverted. Post-infusion, avalglucosidase alfa plasma concentrations declined monoexponentially (t<sub>1/2z</sub>∼1.0 h). AUC was 5-6 × higher in the 20 vs 5 mg/kg group. Pharmacokinetics were similar between Switch and Naïve groups and over time. Baseline quadriceps muscle glycogen was low (∼6%) in most patients, generally remaining unchanged thereafter. Exploratory efficacy parameters (pulmonary function/functional capacity) generally remained stable or improved. Avalglucosidase alfa's well-tolerated safety profile and exploratory efficacy results support further avalglucosidase alfa development."

    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease type II, or Pompe disease, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). We performed genetic analysis to confirm the diagnosis of Pompe disease in a 61-year-old patient with progressive weakness in extremities, severe Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome, a significant reduction of alpha-glucosidase in liquid sample of peripheral blood and muscular biopsy diagnosis. GAA gene sequencing showed the patient is homozygous for the splice-site mutation c.1194+5G>A, considered as nonpathogenic in Pompe Center mutation database. Further molecular RNA characterization of GAA transcripts allowed us to identify abnormal processing of pre-mRNA, leading to aberrant transcripts and a significant reduction of GAA mRNA levels. Our results indicate that c.1194+5G>A is a pathogenic splice-site mutation and should be considered as such for diagnostic purposes. This study emphasizes the potential role of functional studies to determine the consequences of mutations with no evident pathogenicity."

We studied serum concentrations of TGFβ, PDGF-BB, PDGF-AA and CTGF growth factors in 37 adult onset Pompe patients and 45 controls. Moreover, all patients performed several muscle function tests, conventional spirometry, and quantitative muscle MRI using 3-point Dixon. We observed a statistically significant change in the serum concentration of each growth factor in patients compared to controls. However, only PDGF-BB levels were able to differentiate between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, suggesting its potential role in the follow-up of asymptomatic patients. Moreover, our results point to a dysregulation of muscle regeneration as an additional pathomechanism of Pompe disease."

    "abstract": "The objective of this research was to determine the effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy for juvenile-onset Pompe disease (patients aged 2 to 18 years at symptom onset) by systematic review. A systematic search was conducted according to a protocol designed a priori of bibliographic databases and search engines. Studies selected according to pre-specified criteria were assessed for quality and risk of bias using standardised appraisal tools. Data were reported according to PRISMA conventions (Liberati et al. in PLoS Med 6:e1000100, 2009) and synthesised using GRADE (Guyatt et al. in J Clin Epidemiol 64:380-382, 2011). Of 2537 titles screened, 1 case series and 16 case reports met the inclusion criteria. No studies reported on the impact of enzyme replacement therapy on the survival of juvenile-onset patients. Low level evidence found that respiratory function may improve or be maintained in the early months of therapy. Improved muscle function in the first 6 to 12 months was also suggested, but results may be confounded by natural development. Patients with less severe baseline status and treated at a younger age showed more response than patients with more severe baseline status, treated as adults. Interpretation of the findings was hindered by the lack of good quality evidence. The available data suggests that some JOPD patients may benefit in the short term from ERT through improved muscle strength and a reduced need for assisted ventilation. A focus by clinicians on improved and more consistent evidence collection, and use of study designs tailored to rare conditions, would provide more definitive results."

We encountered 4 cases with apparent homozygosity for a disease-causing sequence variant that could be traced to one parent only. In addition, in a young child with cardiomyopathy, in the absence of other symptoms, a diagnosis of Pompe disease was considered. Remarkably, he presented with different enzymatic and genotypic features between leukocytes and skin fibroblasts. All cases were examined with microsatellite markers and SNP genotyping arrays. We identified one case of total uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 17 leading to Pompe disease and three cases of segmental uniparental isodisomy (UPiD) causing Hurler-(4p) or Pompe disease (17q). One Pompe patient with unusual combinations of features was shown to have a mosaic segmental UPiD of chromosome 17q. The chromosome 17 UPD cases amount to 11% of our diagnostic cohort of homozygous Pompe patients (plus one case of pseudoheterozygosity) where segregation analysis was possible. We conclude that inclusion of parental DNA is mandatory for reliable DNA diagnostics. Mild or unusual phenotypes of AR diseases should alert physicians to the possibility of mosaic segmental UPiD. SNP genotyping arrays are used in diagnostic workup of patients with developmental delay. Our results show that even small Regions of Homozygosity that include telomeric areas are worth reporting, regardless of the imprinting status of the chromosome, as they might indicate segmental UPiD."

    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease type-Ia (GSD-Ia), caused by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase-α (G6Pase-α or G6PC), is characterized by impaired glucose homeostasis with a hallmark hypoglycemia, following a short fast. We have shown that G6pc-deficient (G6pc-/-) mice treated with recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors expressing either wild-type (WT) (rAAV-hG6PC-WT) or codon-optimized (co) (rAAV-co-hG6PC) human (h) G6Pase-α maintain glucose homeostasis if they restore ≥3% of normal hepatic G6Pase-α activity. The co vector, which has a higher potency, is currently being used in a phase I/II clinical trial for human GSD-Ia (NCT03517085). While routinely used in clinical therapies, co vectors may not always be optimal. Codon-optimization can impact RNA secondary structure, change RNA/DNA protein-binding sites, affect protein conformation and function, and alter posttranscriptional modifications that may reduce potency or efficacy. We therefore sought to develop alternative approaches to increase the potency of the G6PC gene transfer vectors. Using an evolutionary sequence analysis, we identified a Ser-298 to Cys-298 substitution naturally found in canine, mouse, rat, and several primate G6Pase-α isozymes, that when incorporated into the WT hG6Pase-α sequence, markedly enhanced enzymatic activity. Using G6pc-/- mice, we show that the efficacy of the rAAV-hG6PC-S298C vector was 3-fold higher than that of the rAAV-hG6PC-WT vector. The rAAV-hG6PC-S298C vector with increased efficacy, that minimizes the potential problems associated with codon-optimization, offers a valuable vector for clinical translation in human GSD-Ia."

Assessing individual risk for ADA development is notoriously difficult in (CRIM-positive) patients expressing endogenous GAA. The individualized T cell epitope measure (iTEM) scoring method predicts patient-specific risk of developing ADA against therapeutic recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) using individualized HLA-binding predictions and GAA genotype. CRIM-negative patients were six times more likely to develop high ADA titers than CRIM-positive patients in this retrospective study, whereas patients with high GAA-iTEM scores were 50 times more likely to develop high ADA titers than patients with low GAA-iTEM scores. This approach identifies high-risk IOPD patients requiring immune tolerance induction therapy to prevent significant ADA response to rhGAA leading to a poor clinical outcome and can assess ADA risk in patients receiving replacement therapy for other enzyme or blood factor deficiency disorders."

This study aimed to (1) estimate health utilities for three rare conditions currently recommended for newborn screening at the state or federal level, and (2) estimate the disutility, or spillover, experienced by parents of patients diagnosed with a rare, heritable disorder. A stated-preference survey using a time trade-off approach elicited health utilities for Krabbe disease, phenylketonuria, and Pompe disease at varying stages (mild, moderate, severe) and onset of disease symptoms (infancy, childhood, and adulthood). We recruited respondents from a nationally representative community sample (n = 862). Respondents valued disease specific health states in three consecutive question frames: (1) adult health state (> = 18 years of age), (2) child health state (< 18 years of age), and (3) as a parent of a child with a condition (parent spillover state). Corresponding mean utilities were calculated for plausible disease states in adulthood and childhood. Mean disutility was estimated for parental spillover. Predictors of utilities were evaluated using a negative binomial regression model. More severe conditions and infant health states received lower estimated utility and greater estimated disutility among parents. Conditions with the lowest estimated health utilities were severe infantile Pompe disease (0.40, CI: 0.34-0.46) and infantile Krabbe disease (0.37, CI: 0.32-0.43). Disutility was evident for all conditions evaluated (range: 0.07-0.19). Rare childhood conditions are associated with substantial estimated losses in quality of life. Evidence of disutility among parents further warrants the inclusion of spillover effects in cost-effectiveness analyses. Continued research is needed to assess and measure the effects of childhood disease from a family perspective."

We examined 2000 smokers and 46 never-smokers who returned for a 5-year follow-up visit in the COPDGene-study. Multivariable regression analyses were performed at visit 1 to associate airway wall thickness (expressed as Pi10) with percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>%-predicted), 6-min walking distance (6MWD), and St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Longitudinal analyses were performed to assess the effect of smoking cessation on Pi10 using linear mixed models. A higher Pi10 was significantly associated with worse FEV<sub>1</sub>%-predicted, 6MWD, and SGRQ in all GOLD-stages. Longitudinal analyses showed that subjects that quit smoking significantly decreased in Pi10 (ΔPi10 = -0.18 mm, p < 0.001). Subjects that started smoking had a significant increase in Pi10 (ΔPi10 = 0.14 mm, p < 0.001). Pi10 is a clinically relevant biomarker of smoking-related airway injury in smokers with and without COPD. The change in Pi10 with change in smoking status suggests that it can quantify a reversible component of smoking-related airway inflammation."

This study aimed to determine age-standardised prevalence of genetic muscle disorders through a nationwide, epidemiological study across the lifespan using the capture-recapture method. Adults and children with a confirmed clinical or molecular diagnosis of a genetic muscle disorder, resident in New Zealand on April 1, 2015 were identified using multiple overlapping sources. Genetic muscle disorders included the muscular dystrophies, congenital myopathies, ion channel myopathies, GNE myopathy, and Pompe disease. Prevalence per 100,000 persons by age, sex, disorder, ethnicity and geographical region with 95% CIs was calculated using Poisson distribution. Direct standardisation was applied to age-standardise prevalence to the world population. Completeness of case ascertainment was determined using capture-recapture modelling. Age standardised minimal point prevalence of all genetic muscle disorders was 22.3 per 100,000 (95% CI 19.5-25.6). Prevalence in Europeans of 24.4 per 100,000, (95% CI 21.1-28.3) was twice that observed in NZ's other 3 main ethnic groups; Māori (12.6 per 100,000, 95% CI 7.8-20.5), Pasifika (11.0 per 100,000, 95% CI 5.4-23.3), and Asian (9.13 per 100,000, 95% CI 5.0-17.8). Crude prevalence of myotonic dystrophy was 3 times higher in Europeans (10.5 per 100,000, 9.4-11.8) than Māori and Pasifika (2.5 per 100,000, 95% CI 1.5-4.2 and 0.7 per 100,000, 95% CI 0.1-2.7 respectively). There were considerable regional variations in prevalence, although there was no significant association with social deprivation. The final capture-recapture model, with the least deviance, estimated the study ascertained 99.2% of diagnosed cases. Ethnic and regional differences in the prevalence of genetic muscle disorders need to be considered in service delivery planning, evaluation, and decision making."

    "abstract": "Individuals with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) and the common c.-32-13 T > G variant are widely thought to have milder, adult-onset disease. This belief, and the consequent low suspicion of clinical involvement in children, has led to delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation in patients with early onset of symptoms. Previous reports of LOPD in children do not include description of the early-onset phenotype. This description of signs and symptoms, some of which are subtle and less known, is important to facilitate prompt identification and appropriate treatment in symptomatic children. Retrospective chart review of a cohort of 84 LOPD patients with the c.-32-13 T > G variant was conducted to identify patients diagnosed clinically (as opposed to through newborn screening) who had clinically documented symptom-onset within the first two years of life. Four patients had early onset of symptoms, with age at onset ranging from 10 days to 20 months. Initial symptoms included delay in achievement of gross motor milestones, signs of proximal muscle weakness, swallow and feeding difficulties, and sleep apnea. Early and characteristic alterations in posture and movement were identified in all patients. Age at diagnosis ranged from 10 months to 26 months. Median age at enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) initiation was 23.5 months. Despite ERT, progression of musculoskeletal involvement and residual muscle weakness was evident in all patients, as evidenced by ptosis, myopathic facies, scoliosis, lumbar lordosis, scapular winging, and trunk and lower extremity weakness. Standardized functional assessments showed gross motor function below age level as measured by the Alberta Infant Motor Scales, the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2, the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition, and the six-minute walk test. Onset of symptoms including delay in achievement of gross motor milestones, signs of proximal muscle weakness, swallow and feeding difficulties, and sleep apnea in the first two years of life is not uncommon in individuals with LOPD and the c.-32-13 T > G variant. Patients with early-onset disease appear to have a more, rapid and severe progression of disease with persistent residual muscle deficits which partially improve with higher doses of ERT. Careful evaluation for specific and characteristic patterns of posture and movement in patients with this variant is necessary to identify those who have early onset of disease. Increased awareness of the early-onset signs and symptoms may also enable early identification of disease onset in children who are diagnosed through newborn screening."

The purpose of this narrative review is to treat the different types of respiratory manifestations in LSD, with particular attention being paid to the main molecular pathways known so far to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. A literature search was conducted using the Medline/PubMed and EMBASE databases to identify studies, from 1968 through to November 2018, that investigated the respiratory manifestations and molecular pathways affected in LSD. Pulmonary involvement includes interstitial lung disease in Gaucher's disease and Niemann-Pick disease, obstructive airway disease in Fabry disease and ventilatory disorders with chronic respiratory failure in Pompe disease due to diaphragmatic and abdominal wall muscle weakness. In mucopolysaccharidosis and mucolipidoses, respiratory symptoms usually manifest early in life and are secondary to anatomical malformations, particularly of the trachea and chest wall, and to accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the upper and lower airways, causing, for example, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Although the molecular pathways involved vary, ranging from lipid to glycogen and glycosaminoglycans accumulation, some clinical manifestations and therapeutic approaches are common among diseases, suggesting that lysosomal storage and subsequent cellular toxicity are the common endpoints."

    "abstract": "In 2016, the EveryLife Foundation for Rare Diseases, in partnership with Dr Pan, who is a pediatrician and state senator in California, launched legislation to advance and expand newborn screening. Researchers have shown that newborn screening can be cost-effective and can greatly improve health outcomes for patients with rare diseases. However, adding additional diseases in newborn screening is a long process, requiring legislative approval in addition to new state funding. Such process delays can lead to protracted diagnostic odysseys for patients, especially those with rare diseases. These delays can result in irreversible morbidity and, in some cases, early mortality for patients. To improve this process, legislation known as Senate Bill 1095 was introduced to require California to adhere to the latest federal recommendations for newborn screening within 2 years. We provide insight and describe the process of advancing state legislation, coalition building, and managing opposition. Senate Bill 1095 would become law in 2016, requiring California to screen for 2 new rare diseases by August 2018: mucopolysaccharidosis type I and Pompe disease.

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) comprise a group of diseases caused by a deficiency of lysosomal enzymes, membrane transporters or other proteins involved in lysosomal biology. Lysosomal storage disorders result from an accumulation of specific substrates, due to the inability to break them down. The diseases are classified according to the type of material that is accumulated; for example, lipid storage disorders, mucopolysaccharidoses and glycoproteinoses. Cardiac disease is particularly important in lysosomal glycogen storage diseases (Pompe and Danon disease), mucopolysaccharidoses and in glycosphingolipidoses (Anderson-Fabry disease). Various disease manifestations may be observed including hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease and valvular diseases. Endomyocardial biopsies can play an important role in the diagnosis of these diseases. Microscopic features along with ancillary tests like special stains and ultrastructural studies help in the diagnosis of these disorders. Diagnosis is further confirmed based upon enzymatic and molecular genetic analysis. Emerging evidence suggests that Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) substantially improves many of the features of the disease, including some aspects of cardiac involvement. The identification of these disorders is important due to the availability of ERT, the need for family screening, as well as appropriate patient management and counseling."

    "abstract": "Hepatocyte-restricted, AAV-mediated gene transfer is being used to provide sustained, tolerogenic transgene expression in gene therapy. However, given the episomal status of the AAV genome, this approach cannot be applied to pediatric disorders when hepatocyte proliferation may result in significant loss of therapeutic efficacy over time. In addition, many multi-systemic diseases require widespread expression of the therapeutic transgene that, when provided with ubiquitous or tissue-specific non-hepatic promoters, often results in anti-transgene immunity. Here we have developed tandem promoter monocistronic expression cassettes that, packaged in a single AAV, provide combined hepatic and extra-hepatic tissue-specific transgene expression and prevent anti-transgene immunity. We validated our approach in infantile Pompe disease, a prototype disease caused by lack of the ubiquitous enzyme acid-alpha-glucosidase (GAA), presenting multi-systemic manifestations and detrimental anti-GAA immunity. We showed that the use of efficient tandem promoters prevents immune responses to GAA following systemic AAV gene transfer in immunocompetent Gaa-/- mice. Then we demonstrated that neonatal gene therapy with either AAV8 or AAV9 in Gaa-/- mice resulted in persistent therapeutic efficacy when using a tandem liver-muscle promoter (LiMP) that provided high and persistent transgene expression in non-dividing extra-hepatic tissues. In conclusion, the tandem promoter design overcomes important limitations of AAV-mediated gene transfer and can be beneficial when treating pediatric conditions requiring persistent multi-systemic transgene expression and prevention of anti-transgene immunity."

Main outcomes were diagnostic yield, gene-variant spectrum, and LGMD subtypes' prevalence in a large US LGMD-suspected population. Molecular diagnosis was established in 27% (1259 cases; 95% CI, 26-29%) of the patients with major contributing genes to LGMD phenotypes being: <i>CAPN3</i>(17%), <i>DYSF</i>(16%), <i>FKRP</i>(9%) and <i>ANO5</i>(7%). We observed an increased prevalence of genetically confirmed late-onset Pompe disease, <i>DNAJB6-</i>associated LGMD subtype1E and <i>CAPN3</i>-associated autosomal-dominant LGMDs. Interestingly, we identified a high prevalence of patients with pathogenic variants in more than one LGMD gene suggesting possible synergistic heterozygosity/digenic/multigenic contribution to disease presentation/progression that needs consideration as a part of diagnostic modality. Overall, this study has improved our understanding of the relative prevalence of different LGMD subtypes, their respective genetic etiology, and the changing paradigm of their inheritance modes and novel mechanisms that will allow for improved timely treatment, management, and enrolment of molecularly diagnosed individuals in clinical trials."

    "title": "Improvement in Cardiac Function With Enzyme Replacement Therapy in a Patient With Infantile-Onset Pompe Disease.",
    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder that results from an inborn error of metabolism involving abnormal glycogen storage. Infantile-onset Pompe disease is the most severe phenotype, and enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa (Lumizyme) improves medical and functional outcomes in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease. We report the case of a patient with infantile-onset Pompe disease who presented with severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, systolic and diastolic cardiac dysfunction, and hypotonia. She experienced significant improvement in cardiac systolic function while receiving enzyme replacement therapy. Typically, patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease and severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are not as responsive to enzyme replacement therapy as patients with mild or no hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We demonstrated the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy in a patient with severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) through newborn screening (NBS) has been adapted widely. The National Taiwan University Hospital Newborn Screening Center launched the four-plex tandem mass spectrometry LSD newborn screening test in 2015. The test determined activities of acid α-glucosidase (GAA; Pompe), acid α-galactosidase (GLA; Fabry), acid β-glucocerebrosidase (ABG; Gaucher), and acid α-l-iduronidase (IDUA; MPS-I) in dried blood spots (DBS). Through 2017, 64,148 newborns were screened for these four LSDs. The screening algorithm includes enzyme activity/ratio as the cutoffs for the first screening test and a second-tier test for Pompe disease screening. The second-tier Pompe disease screening test measured activity inhibition by acarbose. Twenty-nine newborns required a confirmatory test; six were confirmed to have Pompe disease, and nine were confirmed to have Fabry disease. The screen-positive rate for Pompe disease was 0.031%. Therefore, in Pompe disease newborn screening, a validated 2nd tier test is necessary to decrease false positives."

    "title": "The ACE I/D polymorphism does not explain heterogeneity of natural course and response to enzyme replacement therapy in Pompe disease.",
    "abstract": "The majority of children and adults with Pompe disease in the population of European descent carry the leaky splicing GAA variant c.-32-13T>G (IVS1) in combination with a fully deleterious GAA variant on the second allele. The phenotypic spectrum of this patient group is exceptionally broad, with symptom onset ranging from early infancy to late adulthood. In addition, the response to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) varies between patients. The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) has been suggested to be a modifier of disease onset and/or response to ERT. Here, we have investigated the effect of the ACE I/D polymorphism in a relatively large cohort of 131 children and adults with Pompe disease, of whom 112 were followed during treatment with ERT for 5 years. We assessed the use of wheelchair and mechanical ventilation, muscle strength assessed via manual muscle testing and hand-held dynamometry (HHD), distance walked on the six-minute walk test (6MWT), forced vital capacity (FVC) in sitting and supine position and daily-life activities assessed by R-PAct. Cross sectional analysis at first visit showed no differences between the genotypes with respect to age at first symptoms, diagnosis, wheelchair use, or ventilator use. Also response to ERT over 5 years assessed by linear mixed model analyses showed no significant differences between ACE groups for any of the outcome measures. The patient cohort contained 24 families with 54 siblings. Differences in ACE genotype could neither explain inter nor intra familial differences. We conclude that the ACE I/D polymorphism does not explain the large variation in disease severity and response to ERT observed among Pompe patients with the same c.-32-13T>G GAA variant."

    "abstract": "Regulation of α-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) and its inhibitors is of great interest to researchers due to its clinical relevance as a target enzyme for the treatment of α-glucosidase-mediated diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and Pompe disease. In this study, we conducted a phloroglucinol-induced inhibition kinetics assay and performed computational molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to assess binding manner in α-glucosidase. The results showed that phloroglucinol reversibly inhibited α-glucosidase in a dose-dependent but non-competitive manner (K<sub>i</sub>=2.07±0.16mM). Interestingly, the maximum peak wavelength and the hydrophobic surface remained unchanged during the inhibition reaction, with computational MD simulations further revealing that phloroglucinol bound in front of the active site pocket rather than in the α-glucosidase active site. Therefore, we speculate that phloroglucinol-specific inhibition is mild and the inhibitor likely binds to a single binding site near but not in the active site. Our study provided insight into the effects and mechanisms associated with a mild inhibitor of α-glucosidase activity and promotes fundamental research and potential applications of inhibitors for treatment of α-glucosidase-mediated clinical disease."

    "abstract": "Disaccharidase deficiencies are reportedly underdiagnosed in pediatric populations. Though typically thought to cause diarrheal disease, they can also be a cause of abdominal pain and dyspepsia, and patients diagnosed with these functional disorders may actually have associated enzyme deficiencies. While the effects of lactose deficiency have been widely studied, sucrase, maltase, and isomaltase are less frequently considered when approaching a patient with an apparent functional abdominal pain disorder. This review seeks to provide an up-to-date narrative on the current scientific literature on the possible role of sucrase, maltase, and isomaltase deficiency in pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorders."

    "abstract": "A 70-year-old female presented with a three-year history of evolving macroglossia causing dysphagia and dysarthria, with proximal muscle weakness. Given the classic physical finding of macroglossia, the patient underwent extensive evaluation for amyloidosis which proved to be negative apart from a bone marrow biopsy which stained positive for transthyretin without amino acid sequence abnormality, thus giving wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis. Since the wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis could not entirely explain her clinical presentation and evaluation, further studies were conducted in a sequential manner, thus leading to a diagnosis of Pompe disease explaining her presenting signs and symptoms including her macroglossia. Through this fascinating case, we attempt to highlight the approach for the diagnoses of two rare diseases in a patient by emphasizing the importance of having a broad differential diagnosis when presented with findings which may have been thought as pathognomonic for certain diseases."

    "title": "An update on diagnosis and therapy of metabolic myopathies.",
    "abstract": "Metabolic myopathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by inherited defects of enzymatic pathways involved in muscle fiber energetics. Diagnosing metabolic myopathies requires a thoroughly taken individual and family history, a meticulous neurologic exam, exercise tests, blood and urine tests, needle-electromyography, nerve-conduction studies, muscle biopsy, targeted genetic tests, or next-generation sequencing. There is limited evidence from the literature to guide treatment of metabolic myopathies. Treatment is largely limited to non-invasive/invasive symptomatic measures. However, promising results have been achieved with enzyme replacement therapy in Pompe disease (GSD-II). Primary coenzyme-Q deficiency responds favorably to coenzyme-Q supplementation. MNGIE responds to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, orthotopic liver transplantation, and carrier erythrocyte entrapped thymidine phosphorylase enzyme therapy. MADD may respond to riboflavin. Areas covered: This review aims to summarize and discuss recent findings and new insights concerning diagnosis and treatment of metabolic myopathies. Expert commentary: Except for GSD-II, coenzyme-Q deficiency, and MNGIE, treatment of metabolic myopathies is usually palliative and supportive (non-invasive or invasive). Non-invasive symptomatic treatment includes physiotherapy, diet, administration of drugs, conservative orthopedic measures, and respiratory non-invasive support. Important is the avoidance of triggers for episodic forms of fatty acid oxidation disorders. Invasive measures include orthopedic surgery and invasive mechanical ventilation."

    "title": "Cardiac Phenotypes in Hereditary Muscle Disorders: JACC State-of-the-Art Review.",
    "abstract": "Hereditary muscular diseases commonly involve the heart. Cardiac manifestations encompass a spectrum of phenotypes, including both cardiomyopathies and rhythm disorders. Common biomarkers suggesting cardiomuscular diseases include increased circulating creatine kinase and/or lactic acid levels or disease-specific metabolic indicators. Cardiac and extra-cardiac traits, imaging tests, family studies, and genetic testing provide precise diagnoses. Cardiac phenotypes are mainly dilated and hypokinetic in dystrophinopathies, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophies, and limb girdle muscular dystrophies; hypertrophic in Friedreich ataxia, mitochondrial diseases, glycogen storage diseases, and fatty acid oxidation disorders; and restrictive in myofibrillar myopathies. Left ventricular noncompaction is variably associated with the different myopathies. Conduction defects and arrhythmias constitute a major phenotype in myotonic dystrophies and skeletal muscle channelopathies. Although the actual cardiac management is rarely based on the cause, the cardiac phenotypes need precise characterization because they are often the only or the predominant manifestations and the prognostic determinants of many hereditary muscle disorders."

    "title": "Early higher dosage of alglucosidase alpha in classic Pompe disease.",
    "abstract": "Background With conventional enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), the clinical prognosis of classic Pompe disease is often unsatisfactory. About half the patients treated with ERT at the recommended dosage (20 mg/kg every other week) require ventilatory support within the first years of life. The heterogeneous response to ERT has been related to different factors, including cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status and age at ERT initiation. Early treatment with a standard dosage of ERT improves clinical outcome and avoids mechanical ventilation in CRIM-positive patients detected at newborn screening, not preventing persistent hyperCKemia and muscle weakness. Later treatment with higher dosages of ERT was shown to provide similar benefits in CRIM-positive patients. Here, we report the clinical and biochemical outcomes of six patients with classic Pompe disease treated with different dosages of alglucosidase alpha at different ages. Methods A standard dosage of ERT was employed in five patients, sharing a poor prognosis after transient clinical improvements, even in the case of early treatment (four died at 22.2±11.9 months and one survived but required tracheostomy and gastrostomy). Early higher dosage of alglucosidase alpha (40 mg/kg/week from 14 days) was administered to one CRIM-positive patient with fetal persistent bradycardia. Results Early higher dosage of alclucosidase alpha not only achieved normal neuromotor development but also the full correction of biochemical markers of muscle damage until 3 years of age, an unmet target with the standard dosage. Speech delay was not prevented by this approach. Conclusions We suggest that early treatment with a higher dosage of ERT may further improve clinical prognosis in classic Pompe disease."

    "title": "Safety and efficacy of short- and long-term inspiratory muscle training in late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD): a pilot study.",
    "abstract": "In patients with late-onset Pompe disease, progressive respiratory muscle weakness with predominantly diaphragmatic involvement is a frequent finding at later stages of the disease. Respiratory muscle training (RMT) is an established therapy option for patients with several neuromuscular disorders including Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Forced voluntary muscle contractions of inspiration and/or expiration muscles enhance ventilation by increasing respiratory coordination, endurance, and strength. Efficacy of RMT in LOPD is rarely examined, and the clinical studies performed are difficult to compare because of different training programs and protocols. This impedes a useful statement and recommendation about the safety and efficacy of respiratory muscle training. We conducted a monocentric unblinded single-arm pilot study in patients with LOPD to evaluate the safety and efficacy of inspiratory muscle training (IMT). The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of a 6-week repetitive IMT with a gradual increase of inspiratory resistance, measured by MIP (maximum inspiratory pressure) in the upright position. For statistical analysis, we used an A-B-C single subject design. The 6-week training-period A was followed by a 6-week non-training period B and an optional training period of 40 weeks in period C. The total study duration for the periods A, B and C was 52 weeks. Throughout the study, spirometry assessments (FCV, FEV1) and measurements of respiratory strength (MIP, MEP) were performed at defined time points, as well as capillary oximetry and capnometry, motor function test and patient's questionnaires for quality of life and dyspnea, measured by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and MMRC-Dyspnea scale. For the cross-sectional comparison, a paired two-sided t test, and for the longitudinal comparison, a two-sample, two-sided t test were used. When data were not normally distributed, a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was added. Finally, the annual decline in FVC and FEV1 before and after IMT was compared. 11 subjects were included in this pilot study. Overall, IMT was well tolerated. In four subjects, a total of six adverse events related to the study procedures were noticed. Training compliance was excellent in the first weeks of training, but declined continuously in the extension period. There was a significant increase in our primary outcome measure MIP within the 6-week period of frequent IMT with a mean of 15.7% (p =0.024; d =0.402). A significant increase was also seen after week 52 by a mean of + 26.4% (mean + 13.4 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, p =0.001, d =0.636). In the 6-week non-training interim-period (period B), the values remained stable, and there was no clinically meaningful decline in secondary outcome measures. The increase in MIP did not have any effect on secondary outcome measures like spirometry tests (FVC, FEV1), capillary blood gas analysis, motor function tests, patient's perceived quality of life or any significant change in dyspnea score. Frequent IMT improves MIP and thereby stabilizes and decelerates the decline of the diaphragm strength. The gradual increase of inspiratory resistance is well tolerated without any increase of side effects, as long as IMT is supervised and resistance is individually adjusted to the patient's perceived grade of exhaustion. Although we could not detect a significant impact on secondary outcome measures, IMT should be offered to all LOPD patients, especially to those who demonstrate a progressive decline in respiratory muscle function or are unable to receive ERT."

    "title": "Vacuolated PAS-Positive Lymphocytes on Blood Smear: An Easy Screening Tool and a Possible Biomarker for Monitoring Therapeutic Responses in Late Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD).",
    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Primary aim was to investigate the diagnostic value of PAS-positive vacuolated lymphocytes on blood smear in Late Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) patients and, secondly, to evaluate its potential utility in monitoring treatment effects. <b>Methods:</b> We examined blood smear of 26 LOPD patients. We evaluated 10 treated and 16 untreated LOPD patients. Among the latter group, 7 patients later initiated ERT and were tested again 6 months after start. Blood smear was also sampled from 82 controls and 19 patients with other muscle glycogenoses (MGSDs). PAS staining was used to evaluate: (1) presence of lymphocytes with glycogen-filled vacuoles, (2) quantification of vacuolated lymphocytes. <b>Results:</b> We found that PAS-positive lymphocytes were significantly higher in LOPD patients than in controls or other MGSDs (<i>p</i> < 0.05 and <i>p</i> < 0.001, respectively). ROC curve for discriminating between untreated LOPD patients and controls yielded an AUC of 1.00 (95%CI 1.00-1.00; <i>p</i> < 0.0001). PAS-positive lymphocyte cutoff level of >10 yielded sensitivity of 100% (95%CI 78-100%), specificity of 100% (95%CI 96-100%), and positive predictive value of 100%. Patients studied before and after ERT showed a dramatic decrease of PAS-positive vacuolated lymphocytes number (<i>p</i> = 0.016). In other MGSDs, PAS-positive lymphocytes were significantly lower that untreated LOPD patients but higher than controls. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our data suggest that the Blood Smear Examination (BSE) for PAS-positive lymphocytes quantification could be used as a simple and sensitive test for a quick screening of suspected Pompe disease. The quantification of vacuolated lymphocytes appears to be also a valuable tool for monitoring the efficacy of treatment in LOPD patients."
