    "title": "Generation and Characterization of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Astrocytes Lacking Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a leading inherited cause of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, has been studied extensively using rodent models. More recently, human stem cell-derived model systems have also been used to gain mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of FXS. However, these studies have focused almost exclusively on neurons. Further, despite growing evidence for a key role of glia in neuronal function in health and disease, little is known about how human astrocytes are affected by FXS. Therefore, in this study, we successfully developed a protocol that captures key spatiotemporal milestones of brain development and aligns with the process of gliogenesis as well. Together this offers a useful framework for studying neurodevelopmental disorders. First, we patterned the human induced pluripotent stem cells into the neuroectodermal lineage with dual Suppressor of Mothers against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) inhibition and small molecules. Subsequently, we utilized specific growth factors and cytokines to generate control (CTRL) and FXS patient-derived astrocytic progenitor cells (APCs). Treatment of APCs with ciliary neurotrophic factor, a differentiating cytokine, regulated and drove the progenitor cells towards astrocytic maturation, yielding forebrain-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing astrocytes. We found that these astrocytes are functional, as evidenced by their calcium responses to ATP application, and they exhibit dysregulated glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism in FXS. Taken together, these findings provide a useful experimental platform of human origin for the investigation of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous consequences of alterations in astrocytic function caused by neurodevelopmental disorders."

    "title": "Quality of life outcomes and predictors for youth with intellectual disability and rare diseases.",
    "abstract": "The concept of quality of Life (QoL) has become particularly relevant in the field of intellectual disability (ID). However, the existing scientific literature on QoL of people with ID and rare diseases (RDs) is very limited. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze individual QoL of children and youth with RDs and to evaluate the impact of personal and contextual factors on their QoL. The sample was composed of 114 Spanish participants with ID and RDs, aged between 4 and 21 years. The KidsLife Scale was applied. This instrument includes 96 items, third-person formulated, organized across eight QOL domains: physical wellbeing, material wellbeing, emotional wellbeing, interpersonal relationships, social inclusion, rights and personal development. Descriptive statistics were calculated and correlation coefficients and multiple linear regression were computed. The most elevated scores were achieved in physical well-being and material wellbeing, whereas the lowest scores were shown in social inclusion and self-determination domains. Sex, level of support needs, percentage of disability and size of the organization were predictive factors of QoL scores. These outcomes shed light into priority areas and predictors that should be considered in the development of individualized supports, organizational approaches and policy initiatives intended to promote the QoL of children and youth with RDs and ID."

    "title": "Hyper-extralemniscal model of Fragile X syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Auditory hypersensitivity is a well-established phenotype of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), but how it relates to neurobehavioral biomarkers remains poorly understood. To offer an integrated model, we propose a dual thalamic framework with hypo-lemniscal (LEM) and hyper-extralemniscal (EXLEM) thalamic models. Traditional FXS studies may have been conflating LEM and EXLEM systems, misrepresenting the origins of the hypersensitivity. We hypothesize that hyper-EXLEM pathology impacts FXS symptoms more. To test this hypothesis, we first review the dual thalamic systems and then demonstrate the hypo-LEM and hyper-EXLEM models in individuals with FXS. We use a 40 Hz auditory steady-state response (ie LEM responses) paradigm with relatively long (1.5 to 3 s) stimulus and interstimulus intervals to evoke N1/P2 as Vertex Potentials (VPs, ie EXLEM responses) for onset and offset of the stimulus. We analyzed electroencephaogram (EEG) responses from 29 FXS and 33 healthy comparison individuals. Results showed lower intertrial coherence (ITC) in FXS, consistent with hypo-LEM predictions, and larger vertex potentials consistent with hyper-EXLEM predictions. Correlation analyses revealed that enhanced VPs classified FXS males more sensitively than ITC. These findings indicate that hyperreactivity of the EXLEM system is more dominantly related to FXS, which can provide a more accurate account for guiding diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

    "title": "Orchestrating Neural Development Through mRNA Translation Regulation.",
    "abstract": "Neural development is a highly intricate process that relies on the precise regulation of gene expression. While a significant focus has been placed on understanding the transcriptional control of brain development, the regulation of mRNA translation plays a fundamental role in controlling gene expression. mRNA translation in subcellular compartments distant from the cell body, such as neuronal growth cones and astrocytic processes, allows for a rapid response to the local environment. Thus, the regulation of mRNA translation influences neurodevelopmental mechanisms such as cell fate decisions, neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation, and axon guidance. As such, the dysregulation of mRNA translation can have profound consequences for neural development, leading to conditions like microcephaly, cortical malformations, autism spectrum disorders, and fragile X syndrome. This review provides an overview of mRNA translation mechanisms that control prenatal brain development and identifies significant knowledge gaps. Specifically, we focus on mRNA translation regulation through signaling cascades such as the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), the integrated stress response, Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2/kinase (eEF2/eEF2K), all of which are critical for mRNA translational regulation and have been previously studied regarding brain development."

    "abstract": "Therapeutic protein replacement has demonstrated pre-clinical and clinical efficacy in neurological disorders but has not been used clinically for Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss of Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). FXS results from a triplet repeat expansion of over 200 CGG repeats in the 5'-UTR of the FMR1 gene leading to epigenetic silencing of FMRP. Currently, no clinically approved disease-modifying treatments for FXS exist. Recently, a tat-conjugated FMRP fragment encompassing residues 1-297 (FMRP N-tat) was shown to restore aspects of neuronal function in a mouse model of FXS. Promising in vivo data hinted to the therapeutic potential of FMRP N-tat. Herein, affinity purification mass spectrometry was used to identify the FMRP N-tat interactome in tsA-201 FMR1 knockout cells and FXS patient iPSC-derived neurons. The FMRP N-tat interactome included RNA binding proteins and constituents of the ribosome, which aligned closely with the known functions of FMRP. Further, the FMRP N-tat associated proteins included FXR2, STAU1, TRIM28, C1QBP, VDAC2, and several ribosomal proteins to regulate mRNA stability, cellular stress responses, mitochondrial function, and translation. The results highlight the potential of FMRP N-tat to orchestrate assembly of factors to correct lost function in FMRP deficient cells."

    "abstract": "Parents of children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) experience elevated levels of parenting stress due to the challenges associated with raising a child with significant disabilities. Biological mothers of children with FXS are at an increased genetic risk for experiencing mental health challenges. Parental mental health challenges and stress are often associated with reduced marital cohesion and satisfaction, which may spill over and negatively affect the parent-child relationship for both mothers and fathers. The current study examined relationships among characteristics of parents, characteristics of couples, and parent behavior (i.e., responsivity and behavior management) during mother-child and father-child dyadic interactions in 23 families of young boys with FXS. We found that mothers and fathers used similar rates of responsive behaviors, but that fathers used higher rates of behavior management strategies compared to mothers. Parenting stress predicted lower rates of parental responsivity and higher rates of behavior management, but these effects were only marginally significant. Couples satisfaction was not found to contribute to either parental responsivity or behavior management, despite the significant relationship between parenting stress and couples satisfaction. Overall, this study suggests that reducing parenting stress may lead to more responsive parent-child interactions, and equally so for both mothers and fathers."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common inherited cause of intellectual disability, and FXS testing is recommended as a first-line genetic investigation for global developmental delay or intellectual disability. This retrospective study evaluated the diagnostic yield of FXS testing and clinical features in Chinese patients in Hong Kong. From 1993 to 2022, 7291 patients referred to the Clinical Genetic Service for neurodevelopmental conditions (eg, developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability) underwent FXS testing. In total, 103 individuals from 61 families were confirmed to have an <i>FMR1</i> full mutation, including 59 index cases and 44 family members. Clinical features of 70 Chinese patients with FXS, including growth, neurobehavioural features, and other co-morbidities, were evaluated. The diagnostic yield of FXS testing was 0.8%. The median age at diagnosis for index cases was 4.1 years, with a trend towards earlier diagnosis in recent years. In 27 families (44.2%), multiple members carried a full mutation. Prenatal diagnosis was arranged in 11% of families. Developmental delay was observed in all males, compared with 45.0% of females. Intellectual disability affected 86.0% of males but only 30.0% of females. Common co-morbidities included obesity, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, gastrointestinal problems, and sleep disturbances. Features such as strabismus, scoliosis, and mitral valve prolapse were rarely reported. Fragile X syndrome is more than a pure neurodevelopmental disorder. Our findings highlight the importance of early diagnosis and subsequent management, with awareness of relevant surveillance and management guidelines."

    "title": "Atypical retinal ganglion cell function in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Altered function of peripheral sensory neurons is an emerging mechanism for symptoms of autism spectrum disorders. Visual sensitivities are common in autism, but whether differences in the retina might underlie these sensitivities is not well understood. This includes Fragile X syndrome, which is the most common syndromic cause of autism. We explored retinal function in the Fmr1 knockout mouse model of Fragile X syndrome. We focused on a specific type of retinal neuron homologous with primate ganglion cells, the \"sustained On alpha\" retinal ganglion cell, which plays roles in contrast sensing and binocular vision in mice. We found that these cells exhibit changes in dendritic structure and dampened responses to light in male Fmr1 knockout mice. We show that decreased light sensitivity is due to increased inhibitory input and reduced E-I balance. The change in E-I balance supports maintenance of circuit excitability similar to what has been observed in cortex. However, this maintenance also reshapes the tuning of this retinal ganglion cell type. These results show that loss of Fmr1 in the mouse retina affects sensory function of one retinal neuron type. As other retinal cell types also express Fmr1, Fragile X syndrome may affect the tuning of retinal cells more broadly. Our findings suggest that the retina may be relevant for understanding visual function in Fragile X syndrome.<b>Significance statement</b> Atypical sensory processing underlies some symptoms and experiences of people with autism spectrum disorders. These symptoms may include differences in vision, audition and sense of touch. In recent years, evidence has emerged that these differences start with atypical function of neurons in the periphery. However, not much is known about how ASD affects the function of the retina. Here, we explored retinal function in a mouse model of a disease strongly linked to ASD, Fragile X syndrome. Our experiments demonstrate that a cell type in the retina has dampened responses to light in the mouse model of Fragile X syndrome. Our work suggests that atypical processing in the retina may contribute to sensory symptoms in Fragile X syndrome."

    "title": "Behavioural difficulties in fragile X syndrome: current pharmacological options and potential future developments.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent inherited form of intellectual disability and a common cause of autism spectrum disorders and other neurodevelopmental conditions. It is commonly associated with hyperarousal, anxiety, and behavioral difficulties such as agitation, self-injurious behavior, and aggression. This narrative review covers the physical, cognitive, and behavioral phenotype associated with FXS and the evidence for pharmacological interventions for behavioral difficulties, including those prescribed on the basis of symptoms and those aimed at the pathophysiological mechanisms of FXS ('targeted' interventions). Consideration is then given to the evidence for novel targeted treatments currently in later stages of clinical development. The first-line management of behavioral difficulties are non-pharmacological interventions, and there are only a few studies in FXS to guide pharmacological approaches. Identification and management of anxiety and ADHD, which contribute to behavioral difficulties, are important steps before considering antipsychotic treatment for agitation, aggression, or self-injurious behavior. The evidence for repurposed targeted treatments remains based on small RCTs or open-label studies; therapeutic trials of these interventions therefore need close monitoring. Multiple novel medications are in clinical development; genetic therapies remain preclinical but are likely to be important in the coming years."

FXS patients exhibit autistic behaviors and abnormal brain structures, with notable sex differences. However, the mechanisms by which Fmr1 deficiency leads to these sex differences during brain development remain unclear. In this study, we performed bulk RNA sequencing on telencephalon samples of Fmr1-knockout mice of both sexes at embryonic day (E) 14.5, i.e., at the peak of neurogenesis. Clustering analysis revealed gene expression differences influenced by Fmr1 gene dosage and sex. We found that majority of the transcripts were shared between male and female sample groups, while a smaller number were unique to each sex. Our dataset underscores the importance of studying brain development during the embryonic period to detect sex-dependent genetic factors which contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> To date, it remains unclear which oral doses and preparation forms of melatonin should be recommended for children and adolescents with non-organic sleep disorders and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We reviewed the current state of knowledge on this topic based on randomised placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) and diagnosis-related blood melatonin concentrations available in this age group. <b>Method:</b> Two investigators independently searched PubMed, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Cochrane CENTRAL on 1 March 2025 for the keywords \"melatonin\", \"autism\", and \"randomised\" in titles and abstracts in all languages, including an evaluation of the references of the reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses published up to that date, some of which were based on searches in numerous databases. Based on this, additional in-depth searches were carried out in PubMed for pharmacokinetic, physiological, and pathophysiological data on melatonin in children and adolescents, with a special focus on ASD. <b>Results</b>: To date, five RCTs on non-organic sleep disorders in children and adolescents with the sole diagnosis of ASD or with subgroup analyses in the presence of several initial diagnoses such as ADHD, epilepsy, Smith-Magenis, or Fragile X syndrome are available. In these studies, rapid-release, non-delayed preparations were administered orally. In one of these studies, the clinical efficacy of a combination preparation with a sustained-release and a non-released active substance component was tested. Pharmacokinetic data with multiple determinations of melatonin concentrations in the blood are only available for children with ASD in the form of a case series (N = 9). <b>Discussion</b>: RCTs comparing the efficacy of delayed melatonin preparations with non-delayed rapid-release oral preparations are not yet available. Physiological data and clinical effects documented in five RCTs indicate that non-delayed melatonin preparations with an initial rapid onset of action are effective for non-organic sleep disorders in children and adolescents with ASD. <b>Conclusions</b>: From a clinical, pharmacokinetic, and physiological point of view, the RCTs available to date and the data on melatonin concentrations in the blood of children with ASD, measured several times over 24 h, suggest that a low oral melatonin dose and a non-delayed preparation with rapid onset should be started in children and adolescents with non-organic sleep disorders in ASD, if sleep hygiene advice and psychotherapeutic interventions have not demonstrated sufficient effects."

    "abstract": "Women with the FMR1 premutation (FXpm) are at heightened genetic vulnerability for depression, with risk compounded by the stressors of parenting a disabled child. Although risk factors persist as FXpm women age, depression in FXpm mothers during midlife and old age is poorly characterized. This study used an accelerated longitudinal design to capture the trajectory of depressive symptoms in 73 FXpm mothers across 20-75 years of age. The FXpm mothers had children with fragile X syndrome or FXpm and contributed 2-11 longitudinal assessments, for a total of 294 observations. Mothers with mid-range CGG expansions (91-110 CGG repeats) exhibited the highest overall symptoms, with a marked increase in depression during early midlife, followed by late midlife trajectories that varied by history of premature menopause. Symptoms of mothers with high CGGs (111-200) peaked during early and late adulthood rather than midlife. At low CGGs (55-90) symptoms were low and stable across age. Parenting stress was associated with increased symptoms during early adulthood, but this effect dwindled with age. Findings illuminate evolving patterns of depression vulnerability across adulthood that are shaped by specific environmental and genetic factors, offering insights for personalized medicine to enhance the health of aging FXpm mothers."

    "abstract": "Accurately determining the sample size (\"N\") of a dataset is a key consideration for experimental design. Misidentification of sample size can lead to pseudoreplication, a process of artificially inflating the number of experimental replicates which systematically underestimates variability, overestimates effect sizes and invalidates statistical tests performed on the data. While many journals have adopted stringent requirements with regard to statistical reporting over the last decade, it remains unknown whether such efforts have had a meaningful impact on statistical rigour. Here, we evaluated the prevalence of this type of statistical error among neuroscience studies involving animal models of Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS) and those using animal models of neurological disorders at large published between 2001 and 2024. We found that pseudoreplication was present in the majority of publication, increasing over time despite marked improvements in statistical reporting over the last decade. This trend generalised beyond the FXS literature to rodent studies of neurological disorders at large between 2012 and 2024, suggesting that pseudoreplication remains a widespread issue in the literature. The scope of this study was limited to rodent-model studies of neurological disorders which had the potential for being pseudoreplicated, by allowing repeat observations from individual animals. We did not consider reviews or articles whose experimental design could not allow for pseudoreplication, for example studies which reported only behavioural results, or studies which did not use inferential statistics. These observations identify an urgent need for better standards in experimental design and increased vigilance for this type of error during peer review. While reporting standards have significantly improved over the past two decades, this alone has not been enough to curb the prevalence of pseudoreplication. We offer suggestions for how this can be remedied as well as quantifying the severity of this particular type of statistical error. Although the examined literature concerns a specific neuroscience-related area of research, the implications of pseudoreplication apply to all fields of empirical research."

Forty-three school-aged and adolescent individuals completed the ADOS-2, CARS-2, and cognitive assessments. We found a strong to very strong positive association between the CARS-2 total scores and ADOS-2 total scores for individuals with FXS, and fair agreement between the ADOS-2 and CARS-2 autism classification ratings. Using a receiver-operator characteristic curve, an optimal CARS-2 cut-off score of 24.25 was found for identifying autism in individuals with FXS. Our findings should be considered preliminary, as they represent an examination of measurement agreement rather than validation against comprehensive DSM-5 clinical diagnoses. Studies using CARS-2 in FXS should carefully evaluate the scores or consider using the CARS-2 as a continuous measure of autism traits until the results of this paper are replicated in a larger and more diverse sample."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders (ASD)- associated behaviors, including sensory processing deficits. Sensory sensitivity and temporal processing deficits in the auditory domain will affect development of language and cognitive functions. The mouse model for FXS, Fmr1 KO, has shown remarkably similar auditory processing phenotypes to patients with FXS. In vitro cortical slice recordings show layer-specific differences in Fmr1 KO mouse local circuits, but it is unclear how these differences translate to changes in sensory processing. In this study, we used a depth multielectrode to record in vivo spikes and local field potentials across layers of the auditory cortex in Fmr1 KO and wildtype mice (WT), converting the latter to current source density (CSD) profiles for improved spatial resolution analysis. We observed reduced CSD sink amplitudes and inter-trial phase coherence, and an increase in trial-to-trial variability for temporally modulated stimuli in the KO mice. Results indicated a differential cortical layer pattern of activity in KO mice, with higher baseline gamma power in superficial and deep layers and higher resting delta and theta power in granular layers. Significantly elevated inter-trial variability was observed for CSD and spikes in KO mice. Auditory steady state responses to clicks or gaps at 40 Hz showed considerable trial-to-trial variability in a layer-specific manner in KO mice. Neural generators in the Fmr1 KO mouse auditory cortex failed to detect short gaps in noise, indicating severe temporal processing deficits. Altogether, this study indicates layer-specific cortical mechanisms of sensory hypersensitivity and temporal processing deficits in FXS."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an X-linked disorder that often leads to intellectual disability, anxiety, and sensory hypersensitivity. While sound sensitivity (hyperacusis) is a distressing symptom in FXS, its neural basis is not well understood. It is postulated that hyperacusis may stem from temporal lobe hyperexcitability or dysregulation in top-down modulation. Studying the neural mechanisms underlying sound sensitivity in FXS using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) is challenging because the temporal and frontal regions have overlapping neural projections that are difficult to differentiate. To overcome this challenge, we conducted EEG source analysis on a group of 36 individuals with FXS and 39 matched healthy controls. Our goal was to characterize the spatial and temporal properties of the response to an auditory chirp stimulus. Our results showed that males with FXS exhibit excessive activation in the frontal cortex in response to the stimulus onset, which may reflect changes in top-down modulation of auditory processing. Additionally, during the chirp stimulus, individuals with FXS demonstrated a reduction in typical gamma phase synchrony, along with an increase in asynchronous gamma power, across multiple regions, most strongly in the temporal cortex. Consistent with these findings, we observed a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio, estimated by the ratio of synchronous to asynchronous gamma activity, in individuals with FXS. Furthermore, this ratio was highly correlated with performance in an auditory attention task. Compared to controls, males with FXS demonstrated elevated bidirectional frontotemporal information flow at chirp onset. The evidence indicates that both temporal lobe hyperexcitability and disruptions in top-down regulation play a role in auditory sensitivity disturbances in FXS. These findings have the potential to guide the development of therapeutic targets and back-translation strategies."

    "abstract": "Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are extracellular matrix assemblies that preferentially cover parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons in the neocortex. PV+ cells and PNNs are impaired in a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders including Fragile X Syndrome and schizophrenia. In both of these disorders, electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings show similar phenotypes, including elevated resting gamma band power and reduced temporal fidelity in the 40 Hz auditory steady state response (ASSR). Whether there is a causal link between PNN integrity and EEG abnormalities remains unclear. We tested this link by recording EEG responses in the auditory cortex (AC) in wildtype mice in which PNNs were enzymatically degraded (Chondroitinase ABC or ChABC). EEGs were recorded at two different time points (4- or 14-days post injection, cross-sectional design). In comparison to saline control, ChABC injected mice showed a ∼50 % reduction in PNN density after 4-days. However, there was no difference in resting EEG power spectral density, auditory event-related potential amplitudes or ASSR temporal fidelity between saline and ChABC mice. At the 14-day time point, there was a recovery of PNN density in the AC. Interestingly, EEG responses were abnormal at this time point, with elevated gamma band activity and reduced ASSR temporal fidelity. Thus, the electrophysiological consequences of PNN loss are not seen acutely, but over a delayed time course, suggesting abnormal plasticity after a circuit perturbation. Taken together, these data indicate acute shaping of auditory cortical responses is less dependent on PNNs, but long-term stability of responses following a circuit perturbation depends on the integrity of PNNs."

One common pathomechanism of these conditions is the repeat-associated non-AUG-initiated (RAN) translation of CGG repeats of mutant <i>FMR1</i> mRNA, resulting in production of FMRpolyG, a toxic protein containing long polyglycine tract. To identify novel modifiers of RAN translation we used an RNA-tagging system and mass spectrometry-based screening. It revealed proteins enriched on CGGexp-containing <i>FMR1</i> RNA in cellulo, including a ribosomal protein RPS26, a component of the 40 S subunit. We demonstrated that depletion of RPS26 and its chaperone TSR2, modulates FMRpolyG production and its toxicity. We also found that the RPS26 insufficiency impacted translation of limited number of proteins, and 5'UTRs of mRNAs encoding these proteins were short and guanosine and cytosine-rich. Moreover, <i>the</i> silencing of another component of the 40 S subunit, the ribosomal protein RPS25, also induced repression of FMRpolyG biosynthesis. Results of this study suggest that the two 40 S ribosomal proteins and chaperone TSR2 play an important role in noncanonical CGGexp-related RAN translation."

Evidence seems to associate the clinical disfunction observed in FXTAS with MCP abnormalities. However, other tracts within the different CPs may also contribute to the symptoms observed in FXTAS. By integrating imaging and pathological data, this review looks to enhance the understanding of the functional anatomy of the CPs and their involvement in different pathological entities, with special interest in premutation carriers and FXTAS. This review, therefore, aims to provide accessible knowledge on the subject of the CPs and their functional anatomy through detailed diagrams, offering a clearer understanding of their role in <i>FMR1</i> premutation."

We stained MNTB brain slices from wild-type and FXS mice with two mitochondrial markers, TOMM20 and PMPCB, located on the outer mitochondrial membrane and in the matrix, respectively. Our imaging reveals significant sex-specific differences between genotypes. Colocalization analyses between TOMM20 and PMPCB show that the integrity of mitochondrial subcompartments is most disrupted in female FXS mice compared with female wild-type mice. We highlight a quantitative fluorescence microscopy pipeline to monitor mitochondrial functions in the MNTB from control or FXS mice and provide four complementary readouts, paving the way to understanding how cellular mechanisms important to sound encoding are altered in ASD."

    "title": "Awareness and knowledge of pediatricians regarding genetic testing for Fragile X syndrome in Japan: A National Survey of Pediatricians Managing Developmental Delay/Intellectual disability.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) commonly cause developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder. Although genetic testing has been available and included in Japan's national health insurance since 2016, the number of cases diagnosed with FXS remains low. This study aimed to explore the levels of awareness and understanding of FXS among pediatricians managing developmental delay/ intellectual disability in Japan, particularly between pediatrician with and without clinical genetics certification (or clinical experience with FXS). A survey involving 1217 certified pediatric neurologists from the Japanese Society of Pediatric Neurology and 367 members of the Japanese Society of Pediatric Genetics was conducted. Additional participants were recruited from an online mailing list of 1469 pediatric neurologists. The survey comprised questions on demographics, knowledge about FXS, and genetic testing practices. The responses were analyzed using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, and a p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Out of 386 respondents, 326 had experience ordering some kind of genetic testing, including 78 certified clinical geneticists. Knowledge gaps were significant between clinical geneticists and non-genetic specialists. While 20 % of non-genetic specialists were unaware of insurance-covered FXS genetic testing, this percentage was lower among those with clinical experience in FXS cases. Many respondents, irrespective of certification, struggled to determine the indications for requesting FXS genetic testing. Furthermore, non-genetic specialists reported more difficulty providing genetic counseling owing to the psychological burden on mothers. This study highlights the necessity for expanding education and training on FXS among pediatricians in Japan. Addressing these knowledge gaps may enhance FXS diagnostic rates and improve the management of affected individuals and families. Future efforts should focus on strengthening the collaboration between clinical geneticists and general pediatricians and establishing reliable genetic counseling support systems."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a common cause of autism spectrum symptoms. The genetic mutation results in multiple molecular alterations that are hypothesized to negatively impact neural circuit development although the nature of any functional neural dynamic consequences remain unclear. Therefore, the characteristics of hippocampal-prefrontal (H-PFC) network dysfunction were investigated in a rat model of FXS. FMR-KO and control rats underwent behavioral tests assessing sociability, memory, and anxiety to validate and replicate previously recognized deficits. Single-unit electrophysiology in the H-PFC circuit during exploration was used to measure patterns of action potential firing that were then compared between groups using generalized linear mixed models. FMR-KO rats demonstrated significant behavioral deficits in sociability, spatial learning, and anxiety. These rats also exhibited abnormal firing patterns outside of times when specific behavioral tasks were being performed. The network firing is less precise, more fragmented and with poor H-PFC communication in FXS. These findings suggest that disruptions in 'exploration' neural network dynamics impair the ability of networks to be appropriately engaged during specific behavioral tasks, leading to the observed deficits in social behavior, memory, and anxiety."

    "abstract": "This article synthesizes findings, from the Autism/Dementia Work Group of the 2nd International Summit on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia, on the nature of autism/autism spectrum disorder and later-age neuropathologies, particularly dementia. The convened group of experts explored genetic, neurobiological, and environmental risk factors that may affect the lifespan and lived experiences of older adults with autism. A review of current literature indicates a lack of comprehensive information on the demographics and factors associated with aging in autistic adults. However, our understanding of autism is evolving, challenging traditional views of it as a static, inherited neurodevelopmental disorder. The relationship between autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions-such as Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex-reflects the complex genetic landscape of neurodevelopmental disorders. These genetic and familial factors may contribute to progressive health challenges and cognitive decline in later life. Key findings reveal a complex link between autism and dementia, despite limited research on this relationship, particularly among older adults. The overall prevalence of dementia in this population appears to be influenced by co-occurring intellectual disabilities, particularly Down syndrome. While the association between autism and specific types of dementia is still not well understood, the reviewed evidence suggests a notable connection with frontotemporal dementia, although causality has not been established. Exploration of biomarkers may offer further insights. Currently, the relationship between autism, cognitive health, and cognitive decline in older adults remains a complex and underexplored area of research."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and a major genetic contributor to autism spectrum disorder. It is caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the <i>FMR1</i> gene, resulting in gene silencing and the loss of FMRP, an RNA-binding protein essential for synaptic plasticity. This review covers over 80 years of FXS research, highlighting key milestones, clinical features, genetic and molecular mechanisms, the FXS mouse model, disrupted molecular pathways, and current therapeutic strategies. Additionally, we discuss recent advances including AI-driven combination therapies, CRISPR-based gene editing, and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) therapies. Despite these scientific breakthroughs, translating preclinical findings into effective clinical treatments remains challenging. Clinical trials have faced several difficulties, including patient heterogeneity, inconsistent outcome measures, and variable therapeutic responses. Standardized preclinical testing protocols and refined clinical trial designs are required to overcome these challenges. The development of FXS-specific biomarkers could also improve the precision of treatment assessments. Ultimately, future therapies will need to combine pharmacological and behavioral interventions tailored to individual needs. While significant challenges remain, ongoing research continues to offer hope for transformative breakthroughs that could significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with FXS and their families."

    "title": "MSH2 is not required for either maintenance of DNA methylation or repeat contraction at the FMR1 locus in fragile X syndrome or the FXN locus in Friedreich's ataxia.",
    "abstract": "Repeat-induced epigenetic changes are observed in many repeat expansion disorders (REDs). These changes result in transcriptional deficits and/or silencing of the associated gene. MSH2, a mismatch repair protein that is required for repeat expansion in the REDs, has been implicated in the maintenance of DNA methylation seen in the region upstream of the expanded CTG repeats at the DMPK locus in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Here, we investigated the role of MSH2 in aberrant DNA methylation in two additional REDs, fragile X syndrome (FXS) that is caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene, and Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) that is caused by a GAA repeat expansion in intron 1 of the frataxin (FXN) gene. In contrast to what is seen at the DMPK locus in DM1, loss of MSH2 did not decrease DNA methylation at the FMR1 promoter in FXS embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or increase FMR1 transcription. This difference was not due to the differences in the CpG density of the two loci as a decrease in DNA methylation was also not observed in a less CpG dense region upstream of the expanded GAA repeats in the FXN gene in MSH2 null induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from FRDA patient fibroblasts. Surprisingly, given previous reports, we found that FMR1 reactivation was associated with a high frequency of MSH2-independent CGG-repeat contractions that resulted a permanent loss of DNA methylation. MSH2-independent GAA-repeat contractions were also seen in FRDA cells. Our results suggest that there are mechanistic differences in the way that DNA methylation is maintained in the region upstream of expanded repeats among different REDs even though they share a similar mechanism of repeat expansion. The high frequency of transcription-induced MSH2-dependent and MSH2-independent contractions we have observed may contribute to the mosaicism that is frequently seen in carriers of FMR1 alleles with expanded CGG-repeat tracts. These contractions may reflect the underlying problems associated with transcription through the repeat. Given the recent interest in the therapeutic use of transcription-driven repeat contractions, our data may have interesting mechanistic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications."

Here, we use Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification and RNA-seq (TRAP-seq) to identify mistranslating mRNAs in <i>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></i> CA1 pyramidal neurons that exhibit occluded long-term potentiation (LTP). We find the translation environment is significantly altered in a manner that is distinct from the <i>Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup></i> model of fragile X syndrome (FXS), another monogenic model of autism and intellectual disability. The <i>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></i> translatome is enriched for regulators of DNA repair and mimics changes induced with chemical LTP (cLTP) in WT. This includes a striking upregulation in the translation of mRNAs with a longer-length (>2 kb) coding sequence (CDS). In contrast, long CDS transcripts are downregulated with induction of Gp1 metabotropic glutamate receptor-induced long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) in WT, and in the <i>Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup></i> model that exhibits occluded mGluR-LTD. Together, our results show the <i>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></i> and <i>Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup></i> models mimic the translation environments of LTP and LTD, respectively, consistent with the saturation of plasticity states in each model. Moreover, we show that translation of >2 kb mRNAs is a defining feature of LTP that is oppositely regulated during LTD, revealing a novel mRNA signature of plasticity."

    "title": "Transcriptomic profiling of unmethylated full mutation carriers implicates TET3 in FMR1 CGG repeat expansion methylation dynamics in fragile X syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the expansion of a CGG repeat in the 5'UTR of the FMR1 (fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1) gene. Healthy individuals possess a repeat 30-55 CGG units in length. Once the CGG repeat exceeds 200 copies it triggers methylation at the locus. This methylation covers the FMR1 promoter region and silences expression of the gene and the production of FMRP (fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein). The loss of FMRP is responsible for a number of pathologies including neurodevelopmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. Methylation of the expanded repeat in the FMR1 locus is the causal factor for FXS, however it is not known why the expanded repeat triggers this epigenetic change or how exactly DNA methylation is established. Intriguingly, genetic engineering of expanded CGG repeats of over 300 copies in the FMR1 locus in mice remains unmethylated. Also in humans, in very rare cases, individuals can have an FMR1 CGG expansion > 200 copies but the locus remains unmethylated. These unmethylated full mutation (UFM) individuals give us a rare opportunity to investigate the mechanism of FMR1 promoter methylation. Fibroblasts were obtained from a healthy control, an FXS patient and two unmethylated full expansion carriers. RNA was extracted and comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed on all samples. Whole genome sequencing was carried out on DNA from the two UFM carriers and the results analysed to investigate DNA variants that could explain the observed differences in gene expression. Our analyses focused on genes involved in epigenetic modification. We show that Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 3 (TET3), a gene involved in DNA methylation, is significantly downregulated in UFM carriers compared to healthy controls or FXS patient derived cells. Genomic analyses reveal a number of rare variants present in the TET3 locus in UFM carriers when compared to the reference genome. However, no clear modifying TET3 variants were identified. Our results suggest that TET3 is a candidate factor responsible for the lack of methylation of the expanded FMR1 locus. Further analyses are needed to further elucidate this relationship, however given its potential to directly interact with CGG repeats and its ambiguous role in 5-hydroxy-methylation of CG containing sequences, TET3 is a strong candidate for further exploration."

    "title": "Compensatory Regulation of Excitation/Inhibition Balance in the Ventral Hippocampus: Insights from Fragile X Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "The excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance is a critical feature of neural circuits, which is crucial for maintaining optimal brain function by ensuring network stability and preventing neural hyperexcitability. The hippocampus exhibits the particularly interesting characteristics of having different functions and E/I profiles between its dorsal and ventral segments. Furthermore, the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to epilepsy and implicated in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), disorders associated with heightened E/I balance and possible deficits in GABA-mediated inhibition. In epilepsy, the ventral hippocampus shows heightened susceptibility to seizures, while in FXS, recent evidence suggests differential alterations in excitability and inhibition between dorsal and ventral regions. This article explores the mechanisms underlying E/I balance regulation, focusing on the hippocampus in epilepsy and FXS, and emphasizing the possible mechanisms that may confer homeostatic flexibility to the ventral hippocampus in maintaining E/I balance. Notably, the ventral hippocampus in adult FXS models shows enhanced GABAergic inhibition, resistance to epileptiform activity, and physiological network pattern (sharp wave-ripples, SWRs), potentially representing a homeostatic adaptation. In contrast, the dorsal hippocampus in these FXS models is more vulnerable to aberrant discharges and displays altered SWRs. These findings highlight the complex, region-specific nature of E/I balance disruptions in neurological disorders and suggest that the ventral hippocampus may possess unique compensatory mechanisms. Specifically, it is proposed that the ventral hippocampus, the brain region most prone to hyperexcitability, may have unique adaptive capabilities at the cellular and network levels that maintain the E/I balance within a normal range to prevent the transition to hyperexcitability and preserve normal function. Investigating the mechanisms underlying these compensatory responses in the ventral hippocampus and their developmental trajectories may offer novel insights into strategies for mitigating E/I imbalances in epilepsy, FXS, and potentially other neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading cause of monogenic autism spectrum disorder and inherited intellectual disabilities. Although the value of population-based FXS carrier screening has been acknowledged, appropriate screening methods are urgently required to establish and implement screening programs. We developed a nanopore sequencing-based assay that includes data analysis software to identify FXS carriers. Reference and clinical samples were used to evaluate the performance of the nanopore sequencing assay. Triplet-primed PCR and PacBio sequencing assays were used for comparisons. Nanopore sequencing identified reference carrier samples with a full range of premutation alleles in single-, 10-, and 100-plex assays, and identified AGG interruptions in an allele-specific manner. Moreover, nanopore sequencing revealed no size preference for amplicons containing different-length CGG repeat regions. Finally, nanopore sequencing successfully identified three carriers among 10 clinical samples for preliminary clinical validation. The observed variation in CGG repeat region size resulted from the base calling process of nanopore sequencing. In conclusion, the nanopore sequencing assay is rapid, high-capacity, inexpensive, and easy to perform, thus providing a promising tool and paving the way for population-based FXS carrier screening."

A key feature of FXS symptomatology is altered sensory processing greatly affecting FXS individual's life quality. Here, we use a combination of behavioral tests and slice physiology tools to study the neurophysiological alterations underlying aberrant sensory processing in the olfactory system of the FXS mouse model (Fmr1 KO). We focused on the piriform cortex (PC), since it is in this brain region where olfactory information is integrated and ultimately decoded. Using a go-no go behavioral task we have found that Fmr1 KO learn to discriminate between a rewarded and a not rewarded odorant but cannot distinguish complex odor mixtures, akin to what is found in the environment. Moreover, Fmr1 KO long-term memory is impaired compared to control mice suggesting possibly cortical processing alterations. In addition, electrophysiological data from PC layer II neurons of Fmr1 KO mice showed a hyperexcitable phenotype manifested by differences in active membrane properties and altered network connectivity. Taken together, our data suggest a possible causal link between the observed olfactory discrimination deficiencies in the Fmr1 KO mouse and the altered physiology of PC."

The diversity and complexity of RBPs are particularly significant in cancer biology, as they directly impact a multitude of RNA metabolic events closely associated with tumor initiation and progression. The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), as a member of the RBP family, is central to the neurodevelopmental disorder fragile X syndrome and increasingly recognized in the modulation of cancer biology through its influence on RNA metabolism. The protein's versatility, stemming from its diverse RNA-binding domains, enables it to govern a wide array of transcript processing events. Modifications in FMRP's expression or localization have been associated with the regulation of mRNAs linked to various processes pertinent to cancer, including tumor proliferation, metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cellular senescence, chemotherapy/radiotherapy resistance, and immunotherapy evasion. In this review, we emphasize recent findings and analyses that suggest contrasting functions of this protein family in tumorigenesis. Our knowledge of the proteins that are regulated by FMRP is rapidly growing, and this has led to the identification of multiple targets for therapeutic intervention of cancer, some of which have already moved into clinical trials or clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and the leading monogenetic cause of autism. Studies in mouse models of autism spectrum disorders, including the <i>Fmr1</i> knockout (FX) mouse, suggest that abnormal inhibition in hippocampal circuits contributes to behavioral phenotypes. In FX mice, changes in multiple voltage-gated ion channels occur in excitatory pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. Whether there are also changes in the intrinsic properties of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons, however, remains largely unknown. We made whole cell current clamp recordings from both fast-spiking (FS) and low threshold spiking (LTS) interneurons in the stratum oriens region of the hippocampus. We found that LTS, but not FS, interneurons in FX mice had lower input resistance and action potential firing compared with the wild type. When we subdivided LTS interneurons into low-threshold high hyperpolarization-activated current (<i>I</i><sub>h</sub>) (LTH) and putative oreins-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) cells (Hewitt et al. <i>Physiol Rep</i> 9: e14848, 2021), we found that it was the LTH subgroup that had significantly lower input resistance in FX mice. The difference in input resistance between wild-type and FX LTH interneurons was absent in the presence of the h-channel blocker ZD7288, suggesting a greater contribution of <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> in FX LTH interneurons. Voltage clamp recordings found that indeed, <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> was significantly higher in FX LTH interneurons compared with wild type. Our results suggest that altered inhibition in the hippocampus of FX mice may be due in part to changes in the intrinsic excitability of LTH inhibitory interneurons.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> In this paper, we use physiological and biochemical approaches to investigate the intrinsic excitability of inhibitory interneurons in hippocampal area CA1 of the fragile X mouse. We found that higher <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> lowers the intrinsic excitability of one specific type of interneuron.

    "abstract": "The Fragile X mental retardation type 1 gene (<i>FMR1</i>) contains a CGG triplet cluster of varied length (30 repeats on average) located in its 5' UTR. In its premutated state (54-200 repeats), <i>FMR1</i> contributes to the pathogenesis of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Its gray zone alleles (41-54 repeats) are supposed to impair the ovarian function as well. In the case of a CGG repeat length > 200, Fragile X syndrome occurs. Post-transcriptional expression of <i>FMR1</i> is regulated by microRNAs. Although miR-323a-3p overexpression suppresses <i>FMR1</i> in various tissues, this relationship has not been evaluated in the human ovary. Additionally, this microRNA targets <i>SMAD</i>s, which are suggested regulators of ovarian cell proliferation, growth, and function. This study investigated how <i>FMR1</i> allele lengths with CGG repeat numbers <i>n</i> < 55 (normal and gray zone genotypes) relate to miR-323a-3p expression and how they may impact associated <i>SMAD</i> expression in human granulosa cells. COV434 cells and patient-derived GCs were used to evaluate <i>FMR1</i>, miR-323a-3p, and BMP/SMAD-pathway member expression levels. Briefly, miR-323a-3p was significantly upregulated in GCs of the gray zone group compared to the normal allele group (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), while the <i>FMR1</i> level did not vary. Furthermore, the gray zone group showed a significant upregulation of <i>BMPR2</i>, <i>SMAD1</i>, <i>SMAD4</i>, and <i>SMAD9</i>. In contrast, the miR-323a-3p transfection of COV434 cells significantly downregulated <i>SMAD3</i>, <i>SMAD4</i>, <i>SMAD5</i>, and <i>SMAD9</i>, while the <i>FMR1</i> and <i>SMAD1</i> levels remained stable. Our findings highlight a CGG repeat number-dependent upregulation of miR-323a-3p and an alteration of the BMP/SMAD pathway, suggesting that these changes happen and contribute to impaired ovarian function independently."

The detection and assessment of STRs is important for diagnostics and prognosis. We tested the abilities of nanopore long-read sequencing (LRS) using a custom panel including the nine most common SCA-related genes and FraX and created raw data to report workflow. Using known STR lengths for 23 loci in 12 patients, a pipeline was validated to detect and report STR lengths. In addition, we assessed the capability to detect SNVs, indels, and the methylation status in the same test. For the 23 loci, 22 were concordant with known STR lengths, while for the last, one of three replicates differed, indicating an artefact. All positive control STRs were detected as likely pathogenic, with no additional findings after a visual assessment of repeat motifs. Out of 226 SNV and Indel variants, two were false positive and one false negative (accuracy 98.7%). In all <i>FMR1</i> controls, a methylation status could be determined. In conclusion, LRS is suitable as a diagnostic workflow for STR analysis in neurological disorders and can be generalized to other diseases. The addition of SNV/Indel and methylation detection promises to allow for a one-test-fits-all workflow."

The model simulated the effect of expanded RCS including the downstream interventions for at-risk couples on cost and outcomes. The comparators were (i) no population screening (ii) limited screening for cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and fragile X syndrome and (iii) a 300 conditions screening panel. Averted affected births and health service cost with expanded RCS were projected to year 2061. At a 50% uptake, our model predicts that expanded RCS is cost saving (i.e., higher quality-adjusted life-years and lower costs) compared with other screening strategies in the model from the health service and societal perspectives. The number of affected births averted in a single cohort would increase from 84 [95% confidence interval (CI) 60-116] with limited screening to 2067 (95%CI 1808-2376) with expanded RCS. Expanded RCS was cost-saving compared to the 300-conditions screening panel. Indirect cost accounted for about one-third of the total costs associated with recessive disorders. Our model predicts that the direct treatment cost associated with current limited 3 genes screening would increase by 20% each year to A$73.4 billion to the health system by 2061. Our findings contribute insights on the cost burden of genetic diseases and the economic benefits of expanded RCS to better informed resource allocation decisions."

    "abstract": "Synaptic proteins form intracellular condensates with their scaffolds, but it is unknown whether and how essential lipids transform dynamic cytosolic condensates into stable, functional macromolecular assemblies at the membrane. We show that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), independent of canonical fatty acid receptor 4 signaling, facilitates the re-localization of cytosolic \"full-droplet\" condensates composed of the key synaptic elements PSD95 and Kv1.2 to the plasma membrane as \"half-droplets.\" To exploit the therapeutic potential of DHA in vivo, we briefly place juvenile wild-type and Fmr1 KO mice, modeling human fragile X syndrome (FXS), under DHA-enriched or -depleted diets. DHA reverses the inhibitory overtone by promoting the re-localization of presynaptic PSD95-Kv1.2 condensates to interneuron terminal membranes and corrects morpho-functional synaptic defects and stereotypic behaviors. These findings reveal an unexpected role of essential lipids in translocating dynamic condensates into stable synaptic condensates, providing long-lasting benefits for rectifying excitation-inhibition imbalance in FXS and potentially other neurodevelopmental disorders."

FXS is characterized by intellectual disability, behavior challenges, and distinct physical features such as an elongated face, large ears, and hyperflexible joints; FXS remains the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability. Behavioral manifestations often include attention deficits, hyperactivity, anxiety, and features of autism spectrum disorder. The prevalence of FXS in the South Asian population is not well-documented, but existing studies suggest it may be comparable to global prevalence rates, which are approximately 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females. Accurate diagnosis of FXS in South Asians is crucial due to the implications for early intervention and treatment, which can significantly improve the quality of life and developmental outcomes for affected individuals. Early diagnosis also facilitates genetic counselling and family planning, helping to reduce the risk of recurrence in families. Increased awareness and screening in South Asian communities are essential to address the diagnostic gap and ensure timely support for individuals with FXS or disorders associated with the premutation of <i>FMR1.</i>"

    "title": "Dual Diagnosis of Fragile X Syndrome and DEPDC5-Related Disorder Emphasizes DEPDC5's Role Beyond Familial Epilepsy: A Case Report and Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Dep domain-containing Protein 5 (DEPDC5), encoded by the gene DEPDC5, regulates the cell cycle by inhibiting the mTORC1 pathway in response to amino acid deficiency. Loss of function DEPDC5 variants are recognized to present as focal familial epilepsy; however, associations with comorbid brain malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders have also been reported. mTOR inhibitors were found to benefit DEPDC5-knockout mice. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss of function of FMR1, and females are expected to have milder neurodevelopmental presentations than males. The reported individual is a 17-year-old female diagnosed with FXS at 1 year of age, but the severity of her neuropsychiatric symptoms prompted further genetic testing at age 14, revealing a likely pathogenic c.4307_4310del DEPDC5 variant. Following this diagnosis, she was started on the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus without significant clinical response. She has never been diagnosed with epilepsy; however, her DEPDC5 and FXS dual diagnosis was thought explanatory for her presentation. A review of 213 previously reported individuals with DEPDC5-related disorder demonstrated that 15.2% of individuals do not have epilepsy, 24.3% have intellectual disability, and 33.8% have brain malformations. Her lack of response to sirolimus may represent the presence of a critical treatment window for mTOR inhibitors in neurodevelopmental disorders."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder caused by the lack of FMRP, a crucial protein for brain development and function. FMR1 mutations are categorized into premutation and full mutation (FXSFull), with somatic mosaicism (FXSMos) modulating the FXS phenotype. Recent studies identified muscle activity alterations during gait in FXS children. This study aims to explore the relationship between these muscle activity changes and motor fibre recruitment strategies during gait in FXS children. Fifty-four FXS children and fourteen healthy controls participated in the study. Gait trials at self-selected speeds were recorded using four synchronized cameras and a surface electromyography system that captured bilateral activity of Gastrocnemius lateralis, Tibialis anterior, Rectus and Biceps femoris muscles. The continuous wavelet transform, using the 'bump' mother wavelet, provided the percentage distribution of signal energy across nine frequency bands (50-Hz increments within a 450- to 10-Hz spectrum) and the Instantaneous MeaN Frequency (IMNF) time-frequency distribution. Results indicated that both FXSFull and FXSMos children exhibit a distinct fibre recruitment strategy compared to controls, with a higher percentage of total energy and elevated IMNF (p < 0.05). This increased reliance on fast-twitch fibres may contribute to the observed fatigability and exercise intolerance in FXS children."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal problems including vomiting, reflux, flatulence, diarrhea, constipation and colic are common comorbidities in fragile X syndrome. There is accumulating evidence suggesting that leaky gut syndrome causes neurological phenotypes. Although fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein is ubiquitously expressed, there is a dearth of knowledge regarding its role outside of the brain including effects on gut dysfunction in fragile X. The aim of this study was to generate novel data on gastrointestinal barrier function and the gut microbiome in response to <i>Fmr1</i> genotype, sex and diet in mice. <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> male mice and littermate controls in an FVB background were maintained on two purified ingredient diets (AIN-93G with casein protein versus soy protein isolate) versus two standard chows (Teklad 2019 with wheat, corn and yeast protein versus Purina 5015 with wheat, soy, corn, yeast and whey protein sources). Gut permeability was quantified by FITC-dextran levels in blood plasma. The cecal microbiome was identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. In addition, gut permeability was tested in <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> mice in the C57BL/6 J background maintained on casein- and soy protein isolate-based AIN-93G versus Teklad 2019. Knockout of the <i>Fmr1</i> gene in FVB mice did not affect gut permeability. Soy protein isolate-based AIN-93G increased gut permeability. Beta-diversity of the cecal microbiome was significantly altered as a function of the four test diets. <i>Akkermansia_muciniphila</i> was increased in <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> mice fed AIN-93G while unnamed species within the genus <i>Anaerovorax</i> and family Ruminococcaceae were increased and the order Clostridales decreased in <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> mice fed AIN-93G/soy. <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> mice in the C57BL/6 J background exhibited increased gut permeability in response to soy protein. These findings regarding the effects of diet on gut permeability and the microbiome have important implications for experimental design. Single-source diets are ubiquitously used to maintain laboratory animals for medical research and feed details are frequently not reported in publications. Diet/phenotype interactions could have a large impact on inter-laboratory replicability in premedical research. For infants with fragile X, early-life diet could impact the severity of disease outcomes."

    "abstract": "In all domains of life, the ancient K homology (KH) domain superfamily is central to RNA processes including splicing, transcription, posttranscriptional gene regulation, signaling, and translation. Proteins with 1 to 15 KH domains bind single-strand (ss) RNA or DNA with base sequence specificity. Here, we examine over 40 KH domain experimental structures in complex with nucleic acid (NA) and define a novel Helix-clasp-Helix-Strand-Loop (HcH-SL) NA recognition motif binding 4 to 5 nucleotides using 10 to 18 residues. HcH-SL includes and extends the Gly-X-X-Gly (GXXG) signature sequence \"clasp\" that brings together two helices as an ∼90° helical corner. The first helix primarily provides side chain interactions to unstack and sculpt 2 to 3 bases on the 5' end for recognition of sequence and chemistry. The clasp and second helix amino dipole recognize a central phosphodiester. Following the helical corner, a beta strand and its loop extension recognize the two 3' nucleotides, primarily through main chain interactions. The HcH-SL structural motif forms a right-handed triangle and concave functional interface for NA interaction that unexpectedly splays four bound nucleotides into conformations matching RNA recognition motif (RRM) bound RNA structures. Evolutionary analyses and its ability to recognize base sequence and chemistry make HcH-SL a primordial NA binding motif distinguished by its binding mode from other NA structural recognition motifs: helix-turn-helix, helix-hairpin-helix, and beta strand RRM motifs. Combined results explain its vulnerability as a viral hijacking target and how mutations and expression defects lead to diverse diseases spanning cancer, cardiovascular, fragile X syndrome, neurodevelopmental disorders, and paraneoplastic disease."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and is caused by the transcriptional silencing of the Fmr1 gene and the lack of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the synthesis of synaptic proteins which are essential for proper brain function. Although circuit hyperexcitability is a hallmark of fragile X syndrome (FXS), the cell-autonomous effects of FMRP deficiency remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigated the functional consequences of the absence of FMRP on neuronal morphology and on ionotropic glutamate receptor surface distribution, using primary cultures of mice hippocampal neurons isolated from wild-type (WT) and Fmr1 knock-out (KO) pups. MAP2 staining of Fmr1 KO neurons showed a decrease in total dendritic length and complexity of the dendritic tree, accompanied by an increase in soma size compared to WT neurons. Moreover, immunolabelling of surface glutamate receptors performed under non-permeabilising conditions showed that Fmr1 KO neurons presented a higher content of synaptic surface GluN2A and a lower content of GluN2B subunits of NMDA receptors, while GluA1 and GluA2 distribution remained unchanged. Finally, multielectrode array data showed that Fmr1 KO neurons presented reduced spontaneous activity compared to control neurons. These data support the hypothesis that at the cellular level, Fmr1 KO hippocampal neurons are less excitable due to altered input processing, driven by structural defects and altered GluN2A expression in the synaptic plasma membrane."

Electrophysiological biomarkers analyzed consistently across species could bridge this divide. In humans, alpha oscillations in the resting state electroencephalogram (rsEEG) are altered in many disorders, but these disruptions have not yet been characterized in animal models. Here, we employ a uniform analytical method to show in males with fragile X syndrome (FXS) that the slowed alpha oscillations observed in adults are also present in children and in visual cortex of adult and juvenile <i>Fmr1 <sup>-/y</sup></i> mice. We find that alpha-like oscillations in mice reflect the differential activity of two classes of inhibitory interneurons, but the phenotype is caused by deletion of <i>Fmr1</i> specifically in cortical excitatory neurons. These results provide a framework for studying alpha oscillation disruptions across species, advance understanding of a critical rsEEG signature in the human brain and inform the cellular basis for a putative biomarker of FXS."

In fragile X syndrome (FXS), mutation-length expansion of a CGG short tandem repeat (STR) in <i>FMR1</i> causes reduced gene expression and FMRP loss. Nevertheless, <i>FMR1</i> and FMRP are limited predictors of adaptive functioning and cognition in FXS patients, suggesting that molecular correlates of clinical measures would add diagnostic value. We recently uncovered Megabase-scale domains of heterochromatin (BREACHes) in FXS patient-derived iPSCs. Here, we identify BREACHes in FXS brain tissue (N=4) and absent from sex/age-matched neurotypical controls (N=4). BREACHes span >250 genes and exhibit patient-specific H3K9me3 variation. Using N=4 FXS iPSC lines and N=7 single-cell isogenic FXS iPSC subclones, we observe a strong correlation between inter-sample H3K9me3 variation and heterogeneous BREACH gene repression. We demonstrate improved prediction of cognitive metrics in FXS patients with an additive model of blood FMRP and mRNA levels of H3K9me3-mosaic, but not H3K9me3-invariant, BREACH genes. Our results highlight the utility of H3K9me3 variation at BREACHes for identifying genes associated with FXS clinical metrics."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by mutations in the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene, characterized by low plasma cholesterol levels. Considering the essential role of brain cholesterol in signaling and synaptogenesis, it is important to screen for brain cholesterol abnormalities in FXS and explore their link with neuropsychological profiles. Brain cholesterol is synthesized in situ, and the excess is primarily converted to 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24(S)-OHC). 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) is the major cholesterol oxidation metabolite that crosses the blood-brain barrier from peripheral circulation into the brain. Plasma levels of 24(S)-OHC and 27-OHC were quantified in FXS and control individuals. The FXS group underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation to evaluate corticospinal excitability and inhibition. The clinical profile was assessed using questionnaires evaluating specific symptoms related to autism, aberrant behaviors, and anxiety. Study results show a significant decrease in plasma levels of 24(S)-OHC in FXS as compared to controls (78.48 nM ± 20.90 vs. 99.53 nM ± 32.30; P = 0.006). Moreover, a negative correlation was observed between plasma levels of 24(S)-OHC and motor evoked potential (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.57; P = 0.05) in FXS. Similarly, a negative correlation was also found between plasma levels of 24(S)-OHC and the total score of the Social Communication Questionnaire (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.72; P = 0.002) and the Anxiety Depression and Mood Scale (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.61; P = 0.02). The 24(S)-OHC is associated with specific neurophysiological and behavioral characteristics in individuals with FXS. Larger studies are warranted to confirm the potential of 24(S)-OHC as a reliable biomarker for FXS."

FMRP has a significant role in controlling the genesis and progression of various forms of human cancer. However, studies on the prognostic significance of FXR2 in cancer are scarce. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological significance of FXR2, a member of the FMRP family, in primary breast cancer (BC). <b>Methods</b>: A total of 100 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks from invasive BC cases were collected from King Abdulaziz Hospital in Saudi Arabia. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to assess FXR2 protein expression in the BC tissues, and the results were correlated with clinicopathological parameters, such as tumor grade, tumor size and hormone receptor status. Additionally, the association between clinicopathological features and <i>FXR2</i> mRNA expression was assessed using the BC Gene-Expression Miner v5.0 tool on all publicly available DNA microarray (<i>n</i> = 10,872) and RNA sequence (<i>n</i> = 4421) data to validate the results. <b>Results</b>: FXR2 protein expression was significantly associated with human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) negativity (<i>p</i> = 0.010) and low Ki67 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Both DNA microarray and RNA sequence data showed that HER2 negativity was strongly linked to high levels of <i>FXR2</i> mRNA. High <i>FXR2</i> mRNA levels were also correlated with hormone receptor negativity and mutated p53. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study suggests that FXR2 may have indirect clinical significance in BC. However, further studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the association between FXR2 and other clinicopathological parameters, which could lead to improved diagnostic, treatment, and prognostic strategies for BC patients."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a disease of pathologic epigenetic silencing induced by RNA. In FXS, an expanded CGG repeat tract in the <i>FMR1</i> gene induces epigenetic silencing during embryogenesis. <i>FMR1</i> silencing can be reversed with 5-aza-deoxyctidine (5-aza-dC), a nonspecific epigenetic reactivator; however, continuous administration of 5-aza-dC is problematic due to its toxicity. We describe an approach to restore <i>FMR1</i> expression in FXS neurons by transient treatment with 5-aza-dC, followed by treatment with 2HE-5NMe, which binds the CGG repeat expansion in the <i>FMR1</i> mRNA and could block the resilencing of the <i>FMR1</i> gene after withdrawal of 5-aza-dC. This study uses immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to measure whether <i>FMR1</i> expression is maintained in FXS post-mitotic neurons treated with 2HE-5NMe. Genome-wide profiling of histone marks was used to monitor epigenetic changes and drug selectivity in response to 5-aza-dC followed by 2HE-5NMe treatment. Changes to dendritic morphology were visualized using confocal microscopy. In this study, we find that 2HE-5Nme maintains <i>FMR1</i> in a reactivated state after reactivation using 5-aza-dC in post-mitotic neurons. <i>FMR1</i> reactivation in neurons results in the re-expression of FMRP and reversal of FXS-associated dendritic spine defects.

    "abstract": "Fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with the <i>FMR1</i> gene premutation, characterized by the presence of 55 to 200 CGG triplet repeat expansions. Although the initial symptoms of FXTAS typically manifest in males around the age of 60 with motor symptoms and cognitive deficits, the presentation and progression in females differ. Women, in fact, exhibit a higher prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms, with an earlier onset compared to the motor symptoms observed in men. The following article reports on ten cases of women with a diagnosis of <i>FMR1</i> gene premutation, originating from two medical centers. All the women in the study exhibited neuropsychiatric symptoms and subtle neurological signs as common features. Symptoms typically observed in the male population, such as tremors and cerebellar ataxia, were either absent or significantly reduced in the female cohort. Conversely, there was a higher prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms among the women. Neurocognitive impairment was only minimally evident, with mild executive dysfunction and memory complaints noted in a subset of cases. For this reason, we propose the terminology <i>preFXTAS</i> or prodromic <i>FXTAS</i> to define a clinical presentation in women characterized by early manifestations of FXTAS that do not entirely fulfill the established diagnostic criteria but exhibit MRI evidence of white matter alterations suggesting the initiation of the disease process. The study underscores the importance of establishing new diagnostic criteria for FXTAS and, at the same time, developing new biomarkers and interview checklists/assessment scales dedicated to females."

FANCJ, a DNA helicase involved in unwinding unusual DNA secondary structures, has been implicated in a number of DNA repair processes including MMR. To test the role of FANCJ in repeat expansion, we crossed <i>FancJ</i>-null mice to an FXD mouse model. We found that loss of FANCJ resulted in a trend towards more extensive expansion that was significant for the small intestine and male germline. This finding has interesting implications for the expansion mechanism and raises the possibility that other DNA helicases may be important modifiers of expansion risk in certain cell types."

Previous studies suggest a disruption of the brain 5-HT system in Fragile X Syndrome, with abnormal activity of the 5-HT transporter leading to altered 5-HT brain levels. We provide an update on therapeutic effects exerted by drugs modulating serotonergic transmission on Fragile X patients and animal models. The enhancement of serotonergic transmission using Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) corrected mood disorders and language deficits in Fragile X patients. In <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice, a model of Fragile X Syndrome, selective 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor agonists rescued synaptic plasticity, memory and stereotyped behavior. In addition, drugs specifically acting on 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2</sub> and 5-HT<sub>5</sub> receptor subtypes were able to correct, respectively, epilepsy, learning deficits and hyperactivity in different Fragile X animal models. In conclusion, the SSRI treatment of Fragile X patients improves mood and language; in parallel, studies on animal models suggest that compounds selectively acting on distinct 5-HT receptor subtypes might provide a targeted correction of other Fragile X phenotypes, and thus should be further tested in clinical trials for future therapy."

Such evidence may implicate <i>FMR1</i>, a high-confidence gene associated with AU, in components of the AU phenotype. Prosody (i.e., using intonation and rhythm in speech to express meaning) is a pragmatic feature widely impacted in AU. Prosodic differences have also been observed in unaffected relatives of autistic individuals and in those with fragile X syndrome, although prosody has not been extensively studied among <i>FMR1</i> premutation carriers. This study investigated how <i>FMR1</i> variability may specifically influence prosody by examining the prosodic characteristics and related neural processing of prosodic features in women carrying the <i>FMR1</i> premutation (PM). In Study 1, acoustic measures of prosody (i.e., in intonation and rhythm) were examined in speech samples elicited from a semi-structured narrative task. Study 2 examined the neural frequency following response (FFR) as an index of speech prosodic processing. Findings revealed differences in the production of intonation and rhythm in PM carriers relative to controls, with patterns that parallel differences identified in parents of autistic individuals. No differences in neural processing of prosodic cues were found. Post hoc analyses further revealed associations between speech rhythm and <i>FMR1</i> variation (number of CGG repeats) among PM carriers. Together, the results suggest that <i>FMR1</i> may play a role in speech prosodic phenotypes, at least in speech production, contributing to a deeper understanding of AU-related speech and language phenotypes among <i>FMR1</i> mutation carriers."

These RBPs often harbor arginine-glycine rich RGG motifs, which can drive phase separation, and can preferentially interact with RNA G-quadruplex (G4) structures, particularly in the neuron. Increasing evidence underscores the important role that RNA sequence and structure play in contributing to the form and function of protein condensates, however, less is known about the role of G4 RNAs and their interaction with RGG domains specifically. In this study we focused on the model protein, Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), to investigate how G4-containing RNA sequences impact the phase behavior and material properties of condensates. FMRP is implicated in the development of Fragile X Syndrome, and is enriched in neuronal granules where it is thought to aid in mRNA trafficking and translational control. Here, we examined RNA sequences with increasing G content and G4 propensity in complex with the RGG-containing low complexity region (LCR) of FMRP. We found, that while increasing G content triggers aggregation of poly-arginine, all RNA sequences supported phase separation into liquid droplets with FMRP-LCR. Combining microrheology, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we measured a moderate increase in viscosity and decrease in dynamics for increasing G-content, and detected no measurable increase in elasticity as a function of G4 structure. Additionally, we found that while methylation of FMRP decreased RNA binding affinity, this modification did not impact condensate material properties suggesting that RNA sequence/structure can play a greater role than binding affinity in determining the emergent properties of condensates. Together, this work lends much needed insight into the ways in which G-rich RNA sequences tune the assembly, dynamics and material properties of protein/RNA condensates and/or granules."

Next, we link dysregulated network activity in FXS to molecular studies showing neurometabolic imbalances, particularly in GABAergic and glutamatergic systems. Additionally, gene-brain-behavior correlations are explored with gene expression maps to illustrate regional FMR1 expression patterns tied to clinical symptoms. A graph analysis and meta-analytic mapping further link these dysfunctional networks to the specific symptoms of FXS. We conclude by highlighting gaps in the literature, including the need for greater global collaboration, inclusion of underrepresented populations, and consideration of transdiagnostic effects in future research to advance neuroimaging and therapeutic approaches for FXS."

However, some severe, high-prevalent and complex diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), α-/β-thalassemia, 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), and fragile-X syndrome (FXS), cannot be fully addressed by NGS, resulting in a high residual risk ratio. This study aims to evaluate the clinical utility of a long-read sequencing (LRS) panel for carrier screening of these five complex diseases. A total of 2926 participants were retrospectively enrolled from International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital from Jan 2019 to Dec 2022. All the participants were previously screened for 149 genes correlated to 147 diseases by NGS. The samples were collected and analyzed with the LRS panel targeting the five complex diseases. LRS identified 236 carrier variants, including 54 for SMA, 113 for α-thalassemia, 19 for β-thalassemia, 47 for 21-OHD, and three for FXS. NGS identified only 56.4% (133/236) of the variants detected by LRS. NGS failed to detect three SMA carriers with SMN1 intragenic variants, while reported 10 false-positive carriers for α-thalassemia (HKαα miscalled as -α3.7). Both 21-OHD and FXS were beyond its detection scope. NGS identified only three of the seven at-risk couples determined by LRS. The total estimated at-risk couple rate for 151 genes in NGS and LRS panels was 1.0996%. SMA, α-/β-thalassemia, 21-OHD, and FXS were among the top 30 high-prevalent diseases and had a combined at-risk couple rate of 0.2433%, accounting for 22.1% of the total ratio. NGS could only identify 22.7% of the at-risk couples for the five diseases in the LRS panel. Comprehensive carrier screening for high-prevalent diseases had higher clinical utility than expanding the list of low-prevalent diseases. Incorporating LRS into the NGS carrier screening strategy would facilitate more effective carrier screening."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder that typically presents with neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Patients with FXS can present with signs and symptoms of connective tissue disorder (CTD) and occasionally with vascular disease. However, cerebrovascular disease is not well documented in these patients, and it is unknown whether there is a direct link between abnormal levels of fragile X protein (FMRP) and its mRNA. Here, the authors present a rare case of an adult male with full mutation FXS of a high-functioning phenotype who presented with syncope, and on further evaluation, a fusiform dissecting aneurysm of the distal middle cerebral artery was identified. The patient was treated for the aneurysm and recovered successfully. Previous clinical evidence suggests that there might be an association between FMRP and increased mRNA levels on CTD and vascular pathologies in patients with FXS. This leads the authors to believe that their patient's previous FXS diagnosis might have played a role in the spontaneous aneurysm and presents a novel area of inquiry in the clinical and pathological manifestations of this disease. Therefore, screening for underlying FXS genetic abnormalities in patients with CNS aneurysms and screening for aneurysms in those with these mutations might need to be considered. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24889."

In addition to the typical mammalian astrocytes, in the primate cortex interlaminar astrocytes are located in the superficial layer and project long processes traversing multiple layers of the cerebral cortex. Previously, we described a human stem cell based chimeric mouse model where interlaminar astrocytes develop. Here, we utilized this model to study the calcium signaling properties of interlaminar astrocytes. To determine how interlaminar astrocytes could contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders, we generated a chimeric mouse model for Fragile X syndrome. We report that FXS interlaminar astrocytes exhibit hyperexcitable calcium signaling and are associated with dendritic spines with increased turnover rate."

    "abstract": "The Slack channels, encoded by KCNT1, are found in neurons across the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), generating a delayed outward current known as sodium-activated potassium current (IK<sub>Na</sub>). IK<sub>Na</sub> plays a crucial role in shaping neuronal excitability and facilitating adaptation in response to sustained stimulation. Slack channels are crucial for neural plasticity and cognitive function; however, mutations in these channels cause profound learning and developmental abnormalities in humans. The physiological significance of Slack conductance in both systems is still unclear. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the role of Slack channels in both CNS and PNS, along with their associated modulators. It offers a summary of diseases that can result from abnormal expression of the Slack channel in both systems. Furthermore, identifying potent blockers and activators of Slack channels could greatly improve our understanding of Slack functions."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome is caused by the loss of the Fmr1 gene expression. Deletion of Fmr1 in various neuronal and non-neuronal subpopulations in the brain of mice leads to cell-type-specific effects. Microglia, immune cells critical for the refinement of neuronal circuits during brain development, have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders, including fragile X syndrome. However, it is unknown whether reduced Fmr1 expression in microglia leads to molecular and behavioral phenotypes. We downregulated Fmr1 in microglia during early and late postnatal development and studied the effect on microglial morphology and distinct behaviours. Female, but not male, adult mice with downregulation of Fmr1 in microglia during early development exhibited reactive microglia and behavioral phenotypes, including enhanced self-grooming and alterations in social interaction. Downregulation of Fmr1 in microglia during late development induced a milder phenotype, characterized by impaired preference for social novelty without affecting microglia morphology. The downregulation of Fmr1 and its encoded protein FMRP in microglia contributes to behavioural phenotypes in a sex-specific manner."

    "abstract": "Despite being a monogenic condition, individual variability in the phenotypic profile of fragile X syndrome (FXS) is substantial, with behavioural outcomes differing in severity and frequency. Existing studies have revealed that common variation in 5-HTTLPR (serotonin) and COMT (dopamine) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is associated with behavioural variation in FXS when measured cross-sectionally. However, the associations between SNPs and longitudinal behavioural trajectories in FXS remain unknown. This study explored relationships between three SNPs, selected a priori (5-HTTLPR, COMT and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)), and trajectories of clinically relevant behaviours in 42 males with FXS. Autistic characteristics, property destruction, aggression, stereotyped behaviour, self-injury, repetitive behaviour, and mood/interest and pleasure were measured at two time points across three years via a series of standardised informant questionnaires. DNA was extracted from saliva samples and a combination of PCR and TaqMan genotyping was performed for genetic confirmation of FXS, and COMT, 5-HTTLPR and MAOA analyses. Results revealed that males with FXS with AA COMT genotype were less likely to display persistent stereotyped behaviour compared to AG or GG genotypes. Participants with the S/S 5-HTTLPR genotype displayed a steeper decline in repetitive and stereotyped behaviours compared to the L/S or L/L genotypes. Participants with the three-repeat MAOA genotype demonstrated a steeper decline in communication skills over three years compared to those with four repeats. This study documents the association between common genetic variation and behavioural trajectories in males with FXS. Results suggest specific SNPs play an important role in longitudinal behavioural patterns in FXS. This work may facilitate an understanding of individual trajectories for people with FXS, and, therefore, support future tailored interventions."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can cause impairments in spatial cognition and memory. The hippocampus is thought to support spatial cognition through the activity of place cells, neurons with spatial receptive fields. Coordinated firing of place cell populations is organized by different oscillatory patterns in the hippocampus during specific behavioral states. Theta rhythms organize place cell populations during awake exploration. Sharp wave-ripples organize place cell population reactivation during waking rest. Here, we examined the coordination of CA1 place cell populations during active behavior and subsequent rest in a rat model of FXS (<i>Fmr1</i> knock-out rats). While the organization of individual place cells by the theta rhythm was normal, the coordinated activation of sequences of place cells during individual theta cycles was impaired in <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out rats. Furthermore, the subsequent replay of place cell sequences was impaired during waking rest following active exploration. Together, these results expand our understanding of how genetic modifications that model those observed in FXS affect hippocampal physiology and suggest a potential mechanism underlying impaired spatial cognition in FXS."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common cause of intellectual disability and autism. FXS presents with abnormal facial features, which in pediatric patients are subtler than what is seen in adults. The three-dimensional (3D) facial images, which contain more stereoscopic and subtle information than two-dimensional (2D) photographs, are increasingly being used to classify genetic syndromes. Here, we used 3D facial images to describe facial features and construct a classification model, especially in male patients with FXS. We registered the 3D facial images of 40 Chinese boys with FXS and 40 healthy boys. We utilized seven machine learning models with different features extracted from dense point cloud and sparse landmarks. A linear regression model was performed between feature reduction of regional point cloud and genomic as well as methylation subtypes. The typical and subtle differences between 3D average faces of patients and controls could be quantitatively visualized. The projection of patients and controls in Fragile X-liked vectors are significantly different. The random forests model using coordinates of regional facial points (chin, eye, forehead, nose and upper lip) could perform better than expert clinicians in binary classification. Among the 63 hierarchical facial segmentation, significantly associations were found in 8 segments with genetic subtypes, and 2 segments with methylation subtypes. The 3D facial images could assist to distinguish male patients with FXS by machine learning, in which the selected regional features performed better than the global features and sparse landmarks. The genetic and methylation status might affect regional facial features differently."

    "abstract": "Atypical sensory processing, particularly in the auditory domain, is one of the most common and quality-of-life affecting symptoms seen in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading inherited cause of ASD and a majority of FXS individuals present with auditory processing alterations. While auditory hypersensitivity is a common phenotype observed in FXS and <i>Fmr1</i> KO rodent models, it is important to consider other auditory coding impairments that could contribute to sound processing difficulties and disrupted language comprehension in FXS. We have shown previously that a <i>Fmr1</i> knockout (KO) rat model of FXS exhibits heightened sound sensitivity that coincided with abnormal perceptual integration of sound bandwidth, indicative of altered spectral processing. Frequency discrimination is a fundamental aspect of sound encoding that is important for a range of auditory processes, such as source segregation and speech comprehension, and disrupted frequency coding could thus contribute to a range of auditory issues in FXS and ASD. Here we explicitly characterized spectral processing deficits in male <i>Fmr1</i> KO rats using an operant conditioning tone discrimination assay and <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiology recordings from the auditory cortex and inferior colliculus. We found that <i>Fmr1</i> KO rats exhibited poorer frequency resolution, which corresponded with neuronal hyperactivity and broader frequency tuning in auditory cortical but not collicular neurons. Using an experimentally informed population model, we show that these cortical physiological differences can recapitulate the observed behavior discrimination deficits, with decoder performance being tightly linked to differences in cortical tuning width and signal-to-noise ratios. These findings suggest that cortical hyperexcitability may account for a range of auditory behavioral phenotypes in FXS, providing a potential locus for development of novel biomarkers and treatment strategies that could extend to other forms of ASD."

We have identified cellular changes in thalamic neurons in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome (FX), the leading monogenic cause of ASD, that alter how the thalamus transmits sensory information to neocortical circuits. In awake animals, thalamic relay cells gate input by shifting between two firing modes: burst and tonic. Relay cells in FX mice, however, do not shift between these modes and instead operate primarily in the tonic mode. We demonstrate that the lack of burst mode firing is caused by a shift in the voltage sensitivity for the Ca <sup>2+</sup> -dependent low threshold spike, which underlies normal burst firing."

The physical correlate of a memory in the brain is termed an engram and since decades helps researchers to elucidate the intricate nature of our imprinted experiences and knowledge. Given the importance that memories have for our lives, their impairment can present a tremendous burden. In this review we aim to discuss engram malfunctioning across diseases, covering dementia-associated pathologies, epilepsy, chronic pain and psychiatric disorders. Current neuroscientific tools allow to witness the emergence and fate of engram cells and enable their manipulation. We further suggest that specific mechanisms of mnemonic malfunction can be derived from engram cell readouts. While depicting the way diseases act on the mnemonic component - specifically, on the cellular engram - we emphasize a differentiation between forms of amnesia and hypermnesia. Finally, we highlight commonalities and distinctions of engram impairments on the cellular level across diseases independent of their pathogenic origins and discuss prospective therapeutic measures."

    "abstract": "Fragile X, Huntington disease, and myotonic dystrophy type 1 are prototypical examples of human disorders caused by short tandem repeat variation, repetitive nucleotide stretches that are highly mutable both in the germline and somatic tissue. As short tandem repeats are unstable, they can expand, contract, and acquire and lose epigenetic marks in somatic tissue. This means within an individual, the genotype and epigenetic state at these loci can vary considerably from cell to cell. This somatic mosaicism may play a key role in clinical pathogenesis, and yet, our understanding of mosaicism in driving clinical phenotypes in short tandem repeat disorders is only just emerging. This review focuses on these three relatively well-studied examples where, given the advent of new technologies and bioinformatic approaches, a critical role for mosaicism is coming into focus both with respect to cellular physiology and clinical phenotypes."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the most common genetic causes of intellectual developmental disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), second only to Down's syndrome and associated with a broad range of neurodevelopmental, behavioral, and psychiatric challenges. FXS may be present in infants or young children with characteristic dysmorphic features, developmental delays, and behavioral challenges. The diagnosis of FXS is confirmed by the molecular genetic testing of the <i>FMR1</i> gene encoding fragile X messenger RNA-binding protein (FMRP), involved in regulating the translation of multiple mRNAs which play a key role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Understanding the genetic cause, pathophysiology, and natural history of FXS is crucial for identifying commonly associated comorbidities, instituting effective therapeutic interventions, and improving long-term outcomes. This systematic review employed a comprehensive literature search using multiple electronic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus with keywords related to fragile X syndrome, lifespan, genetics, neurodevelopmental, behavioral, and psychiatric disorders. FXS is associated with an increased risk for specific neurodevelopmental, or psychiatric disorders. Symptoms and challenges associated with FXS vary based on multiple factors, including genetic differences, age, sex, comorbid conditions, various environmental influences, the availability of support, and opportunities for therapeutic interventions. Knowledge of these associations helps guide caregivers and clinicians in identifying potentially treatable conditions that can help to improve the lives of affected patients and their families. The focus of this article is to explore and describe the genetic underpinnings of FXS, identify associated developmental, behavioral, and psychiatric conditions over the lifespan, and provide a review of clinical features, therapeutic interventions including investigational treatments, and current research updates."

    "abstract": "Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by moderately expanded CGG trinucleotide repeats in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the <i>FMR1</i> gene. Characterized by motor deficits such as action tremor and cerebellar gait ataxia, FXTAS is further distinguished by ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions in neurons and glia. However, its clinical spectrum often overlaps with other neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Sensorimotor gating deficits, commonly associated with disorders affecting the nigrostriatal pathway such as PD, have been reported in FXTAS, but the underlying connection between these two phenotypes remains undetermined. In this study, we used the P90CGG mouse model of FXTAS, which expresses 90 CGG repeats upon doxycycline induction, to investigate sensorimotor gating deficits and their relationship to nigrostriatal degeneration. After induction, the P90CGG model exhibited late-onset impairments in prepulse inhibition (PPI), a cross-species measure of sensorimotor gating. These deficits coincided with pronounced nigrostriatal degeneration but occurred without evidence of inclusion formation in the substantia nigra. Our findings highlight nigrostriatal degeneration, which has not previously been reported in animal models of FXTAS, and suggest a potential link to sensorimotor gating dysfunction within the context of the disorder."

Participants included 45 boys with full mutation FXS, ranging in age from 2.9 to 14.0 years, who were subdivided into those with FXS only (FXS-Only) and those with FXS and Autism (FXS-Autism). Speech, expressive vocabulary, and receptive vocabulary skills were assessed over three years for each participant. There was a significant relationship between each of the outcome measures and the child's nonverbal mental level, and between for both outcome measures of vocabulary and Autism status, but these relationships were moderated by the level of FMRP. Specifically, higher levels of FMRP seemed to increase the relationship between developmental level of speech, receptive, and expressive vocabulary for boys with FXS with and without Autism; however, at lower levels of FMRP, these relationships seemed to weaken significantly for both groups. These findings implicate increased complexity in the relationship between various contributors to the rates of growth of speech, expressive vocabulary, and receptive vocabulary in boys with FXS, with FMRP being a key variable potentially moderating the relationship between nonverbal abilities, Autism status, and speech and vocabulary development."

    "abstract": "N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced spine shrinkage proceeds independently of ion flux and requires the initiation of de novo protein synthesis. Using subtype-selective pharmacological and genetic tools, we find that structural plasticity is dependent on ligand binding to GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and signaling via the GluN2B carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). Disruption of non-ionotropic signaling by replacing the GluN2B CTD with the GluN2A CTD leads to an increase in spine density, dysregulated basal protein synthesis, exaggerated long-term depression mediated by G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR-LTD), and epileptiform activity reminiscent of phenotypes observed in the Fmr1 knockout (KO) model of fragile X syndrome. By crossing the Fmr1 KO mice with animals in which the GluN2A CTD has been replaced with the GluN2B CTD, we observe a correction of these core fragile X phenotypes. These findings suggest that non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling through GluN2B may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of fragile X and related causes of intellectual disability and autism."

FMRP modulates the expression and function of a wide variety of proteins, including voltage-gated ion channels such as Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide gated (HCN) channels, which are integral to rhythmic activity in thalamic structures. Thalamocortical pathology, particularly involving the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. MD connectivity with mPFC is integral to executive functions like working memory and social behaviors that are disrupted in FXS. We used a combination of retrograde labeling and <i>ex vivo</i> brain slice whole cell electrophysiology in 40 wild type and 42 <i>Fmr1</i> KO male mice to investigate how a lack of <i>Fmr1</i> affects intrinsic cellular properties in lateral (MD-L) and medial (MD-M) MD neurons that project to the medial prefrontal cortex (MD→mPFC neurons). In MD-L neurons, <i>Fmr1</i> knockout caused a decrease in HCN-mediated membrane properties such as voltage sag and membrane afterhyperpolarization. These changes in subthreshold properties were accompanied by changes in suprathreshold neuron properties such as the variability of action potential burst timing. In <i>Fmr1</i> knockout mice, reduced HCN channel activity in MD→mPFC neurons impairs both the timing and magnitude of HCN-mediated membrane potential regulation. Changes in response timing may adversely affect rhythm propagation in <i>Fmr1</i> KO thalamocortical circuitry. MD thalamic neurons are critical for maintaining rhythmic activity involved in cognitive and affective functions. Understanding specific mechanisms of thalamocortical circuit activity may lead to therapeutic interventions for individuals with FXS."

The present study aims to evaluate the 40 Hz auditory steady state response (ASSR) in FXS to evaluate stimulus representation maintenance in FXS. Adolescents and adults (N = 67; 34 FXS and 33 age, sex-matched typically developed controls (TDC)) completed a 40 Hz auditory steady state task during electroencephalography (EEG). Time-frequency analyses using Morlet wavelets were completed to evaluate intertrial phase coherence (ITC) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), including characterization of the transient and sustained components of the 40 Hz ASSR. Both ITC (<i>p</i> = .003) and ERSP (<i>p</i> = .004) at 40 Hz were reduced for FXS compared to TDC. Interestingly, TDC exhibited a significantly elevated early, transient component (100 - 400 ms) which reduced in both ITC and ERSP during transition to the sustained component (650 - 3000 ms) whereas FXS were consistently reduced across the ASSR suggesting a reduced ability for FXS to mount a transient response. Individuals with FXS exhibit robust reductions in magnitude and temporal precision of neural entrainment to the steady state stimulus. The reduced ability to mount a transient response may represent reduced GABAergic modulation where the overall reduction in ITC and ERSP may reflect reduced excitatory/inhibitory balance between NMDA and GABAergic input."

The Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse model displays many aspects of FXS-related phenotypes and is used to study FXS pathophysiology. Sensory manipulations, such as sound exposure, are considered as a non-invasive approach to alleviate FXS phenotypes. However, it is unclear what specific sound attributes may have beneficial effects. In this study, we examined the effects of sound repetition rate on auditory cortex development and FXS-associated behaviors in a mouse model of FXS. KO and wild-type (WT) male littermates were exposed to 14 kHz pure tone trains with 1 Hz or 5 Hz repetition rates during postnatal day (P)9-P21 developmental period. We analyzed the effects of developmental sound exposure on PV cell development, cortical activity and exploratory behaviors in sound-exposed WT and KO mice. We found that parvalbumin (PV) cell density was lower in the auditory cortex (AuC) of KO compared to WT mice raised in sound-attenuated environment, but was increased following the exposure to both 1 Hz and 5 Hz sound trains. However, PV protein levels were upregulated only in AuC of 5 Hz rate exposed KO mice. Interestingly, analysis of baseline cortical activity using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings showed that sound attenuation or exposure to sound trains with 5 Hz, but not 1 Hz, repetition rates corrected enhanced resting state gamma power in AuC of KO mice to WT levels. In addition, sound attenuation and exposure to 5 Hz showed some beneficial effects on the synchronization to frequency-modulated chirp in the frontal cortex (FC) of both WT and KO mice. Analysis of event-related potentials (ERP) in response to broadband sound showed increased ongoing responses and decreased habituation to noise stimuli in the AuC and FC of naive KO mice. While sound-attenuation and exposure to 5 Hz showed no significant effects on the power of onset and ongoing responses, exposure to 1 Hz further enhanced ongoing responses and decreased habituation to sound in both WT and KO mice. Finally, developmental exposure to sound trains with 5 Hz, but not 1 Hz, repetition rates normalized exploratory behaviors and improved social novelty preference but not hyperactivity in KO mice. Summarizing, our results show that developmental exposure of mice to sound trains with 5 Hz, but not 1 Hz, repetition rate had beneficial effects on PV cell development, overall cortical activity and behaviors in KO mice. While sound attenuation alone normalized some EEG phenotypes, it did not improve PV development or behaviors. These findings may have a significant impact on developing new approaches to alleviate FXS phenotypes and open possibilities for a combination of sound exposure with drug treatment which may offer highly novel therapeutic approaches."

Theme 2: Parents are guided by previous healthcare and research experiences. Wearables were considered low burden in the context of everything else their child experiences through health care. Theme 3: Early engagement with families in the design and research process of new technologies is important. Parents had strong views on how to introduce a wearable to their child. In this article, parents stressed that the child's behavioral phenotype needs to be considered early in the design and rollout phases. A shared decision-making approach between researchers and parents will improve the uptake and success of NDD-focused research adopting wearable technology approaches for clinical measurement."

    "title": "The Clinical and Molecular Spectrum of Patients With X-Linked Intellectual Disability and Novel Variations in Different Genes.",
    "abstract": "X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. In this study, we aimed to describe the clinical and molecular spectrum of patients with XLID. We also evaluated the clinical efficacy of a targeted gene panel in patients with suspected XLID. Eighty-four patients with suspected XLID were enrolled in the study. Array comparative genomic hybridization, fragile X fragman analysis, and targeted XLID gene panel were performed. Genetic diagnosis was established in a total of 24 patients (22 male and two female) with XLID. Different copy number variations of the X chromosome were detected in four patients, including two duplications and two deletions. Fifteen patients had fragile X syndrome. Point mutations were detected in five unrelated patients. Variants detected in RPS6KA3 gene were previously reported by our team. A novel two-nucleotide deletion was shown in the MID1 gene. Additionally, novel missense variations were revealed in IL1RAPL1 and ATRX genes. The IL1RAPL1 variant was detected in additional five affected male patients in the same family. The patient, who had ATRX variation, had pachygyria in the cerebral cortex and hypoplasia of cerebellar vermis. Our findings have broadened the spectrum of mutations and clinical manifestations of patients with XLID. Additionally, this represents the second reported missense variation in the IL1RAPL1 gene identified in patients with XLID. We also emphasized the importance of a stepwise diagnostic algorithm that incorporates chromosomal microarray analysis, FMR1 gene repeat analysis, and next-generation sequencing analysis for patients with XLID."

    "abstract": "Mouse models of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) have demonstrated impairments in sensory-evoked neuronal firing of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Homeostatic plasticity does not compensate for these changes in activity. Previous work has shown that impairments in homeostatic plasticity mechanisms are observed in FXS, including deficits in synaptic scaling and intrinsic excitability. Here, we aimed to examine how sensory integration changes in vivo following a homeostatic perturbation, unilateral whisker deprivation (WD), in an Fmr1 knock out (KO) mouse model. We used multi-electrode array recordings of neurons in the lightly anesthetized juvenile mouse somatosensory cortex, and found that whisker-evoked responses in layer 5/6 (L5/6) excitatory neurons were weaker in the KO compared to the wild-type (WT). We show that WD in the WT leads to a compensatory increase in the proportion of L5/6 somatosensory neurons that were recruited following whisker stimulation, but this did not occur in the KO. On the other hand, certain compensatory responses were observed in the KO following WD; the firing rate of the whisker-responsive neurons was increased following both a 2- and 7-day WD. Similar to excitatory neurons, we observed increased recruitment of fast spiking (presumed inhibitory) neurons following WD in the WT, but not KO. Our results suggest that certain homeostatic mechanisms are impaired in the KO, while others appear to remain intact. Compromised homeostatic plasticity in development could influence adult sensory processing and long-term cortical organization."

    "title": "Repeat expansion in a fragile X model is independent of double strand break repair mediated by Pol θ, RAD52, RAD54 or RAD54B.",
    "abstract": "Microsatellite instability is responsible for the human repeat expansion diseases (REDs). The mutagenic process differs from classical cancer-associated microsatellite instability (MSI) in that it requires the mismatch repair proteins that normally protect against MSI. LIG4, an enzyme essential for non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), the major pathway for double-strand break repair (DSBR) in mammalian cells, protects against expansion in mouse models. Thus, NHEJ may compete with the expansion pathway for access to a common intermediate. This raises the possibility that expansion involves an NHEJ-independent form of DSBR. Pol θ, a polymerase involved in the theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ) DSBR pathway, has been proposed to play a role in repeat expansion. Here we examine the effect of the loss of Pol θ on expansion in FXD mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), along with the effects of mutations in Rad52, Rad54l and Rad54b, genes important for multiple DSBR pathways. None of these mutations significantly affected repeat expansion. These observations put major constraints on what pathways are likely to drive expansion. Together with our previous demonstration of the protective effect of nucleases like EXO1 and FAN1, and the importance of Pol β, they suggest a plausible model for late steps in the expansion process."

    "abstract": "The Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) is an RNA binding protein that regulates the translation of multiple mRNAs and is expressed by neurons and glia in the mammalian brain. Loss of FMRP leads to fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common inherited form of intellectual disability and autism. While most research has been focusing on the neuronal contribution to FXS pathophysiology, the role of glia, particularly oligodendrocytes, is largely unknown. FXS individuals are characterized by white matter changes, which imply impairments in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. We hypothesized that FMRP regulates oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination during postnatal development. Using a combination of human pluripotent stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes and an Fmr1 knockout rat model, we studied the role of FMRP on mammalian oligodendrocyte development. We found that the loss of FMRP leads to shared defects in oligodendrocyte morphology in both rat and human systems in vitro, which persist in the presence of FMRP-expressing axons in chimeric engraftment models. Our findings point to species-conserved, cell-autonomous defects during oligodendrocyte maturation in FXS."

Traditional diagnostic approaches often lack biological markers, making precision in diagnosis challenging. This study explores the role of array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) in improving diagnostic accuracy for ASD. Five clinical vignettes of children diagnosed with ASD <i>via</i> DSM-5 or ADOS-2 were evaluated at a child and adolescent psychiatry clinic. Genome-wide oligonucleotide aCGH analysis was conducted using the Human Genome CGH Microarray kit (OGT), containing approximately 180,000 probes with 30-37 kb spacing based on the GRCh37 build. Fragile X syndrome was excluded using the Asuragen Amplidex PCR/CE FMR1 kit. The case series included boys aged 8-11 from diverse ethnic backgrounds (Asian, African, and Qatari), all presenting with varying degrees of ASD. Genetic analyses revealed significant chromosomal changes affecting eight genes, <i>SHOX</i>, <i>HNF1B</i>, <i>COH1</i>, <i>AHNAK</i>, <i>DOCK8</i>, <i>TIAM1</i>, <i>TBL1XR1</i>, and <i>ALKBH8</i>, highlighting diverse genetic contributions to ASD. These findings encompassed both chromosomal gains and losses, as well as variants of uncertain significance (VUS). The aCGH analyses provided valuable genetic insights, refining the diagnostic process and informing personalized management strategies for ASD. This suggests that aCGH is a useful tool in identifying clinically relevant genetic variations, particularly in settings with limited resources, where other diagnostic modalities may be less accessible."

    "abstract": "<b><i>Objective:</i></b> The current intense period of drug development for fragile X syndrome (FXS) and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) indications has highlighted the importance of behavioral outcome measures with strong psychometric properties and specifically content validity. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-C), which has successfully been applied to autism spectrum disorder drug trials, has been revised for FXS (ABC<sub>FX</sub>) and is widely used for both clinical and research purposes. Despite its strong psychometric validation, the ABC<sub>FX</sub> and its parent measure have not been subjected to qualitative content validity evaluations. The present study intended to fill this gap. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Using two surveys administered sequentially and developed with guidance and review from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we asked 10 clinicians experienced in FXS and related NDDs to determine the adequacy of the ABC<sub>FX</sub> for assessing its behavioral constructs, its relevance to FXS, and its potential for detecting response to interventions. Various descriptive statistic parameters and <i>ad hoc</i> metrics were used to analyze categorical and Likert-like scale responses. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Experts considered that most items and all six ABC<sub>FX</sub> subscales indeed evaluated their explicit or implicit behavioral constructs. However, item and subscale specificity were relatively low (∼25%-30%). Relevance of items of the Hyperactivity subscale was relatively high while low for many items of the Socially Unresponsive/Lethargic subscale. These items were also considered of low responsiveness potential. Irritability, Hyperactivity, Stereotypy, and Social Avoidance were the subscales with the strongest profiles, although the experts estimated that Stereotypy items may not be that responsive to treatment. A novel Anxiety construct, representing mainly recently reported observable behaviors, contributed mainly by Irritability items, emerged as a potential measure. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The present study demonstrated the overall adequacy of the ABC<sub>FX</sub> for its behavioral constructs, its relevance to FXS, and its potential for detecting response to treatment. It also showed that anxiety, a distinctive feature of FXS and other genetic NDDs, can also be measured by the ABC<sub>FX</sub>. These findings can help with the implementation and interpretation of the ABC<sub>FX</sub>, as well as with potential improvements to the measure in FXS and other NDDs."

    "abstract": "The Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein and a key regulator of translation in neurons, hence crucial for neural development and plasticity. FMRP loss, resulting from mutations in the Fmr1 gene, leads to Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the most common inherited intellectual disabilities. Ribosome profiling in neurons consistently reveals that FMRP-knockout (FK) significantly down-regulates the translation of numerous lengthy genes, many of which are FMRP-binding targets and associated with ASD. Despite these findings, the functional explanation for FMRP's translation regulation of large neuronal proteins remains elusive. Our present study compiles data from published ribosome profiling studies, to identify genes with significantly decreased translation in FK neurons. Using bioinformatic analysis and machine-learning sequence-based tools, PSPredictor and FuzDrop, we found that the proteins encoded by these genes are predicted to be enriched in intrinsically disordered regions and are prone to liquid-liquid phase separation. These findings suggest that FMRP modulates the translation of proteins involved in the formation of biomolecular condensates. Our results can have significant implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms of FXS and ASD, adding complexity to FMRP's regulatory functions, thus offering avenues for further exploration and targeted therapeutic interventions in intellectual disability disorders."

However, many of the genes contributing to ASD-DM have yet to be delineated. In this study, we identified additional ASD-DM candidate genes with the aim to better define the genetic etiology of this subphenotype of autism. We expanded the previously studied sample size of ASD-DM individuals ten fold by including probands from the Autism Phenome Project and Simons Simplex Collection, totaling 766 autistic individuals meeting the criteria for megalencephaly or macrocephaly and revealing 154 candidate ASD-DM genes harboring de novo protein-impacting variants. Our findings include 14 high confidence autism genes and seven genes previously associated with DM. Five impacted genes have previously been associated with both autism and DM, including CHD8 and PTEN. By performing functional network analysis, we expanded to additional candidate genes, including one previously implicated in ASD-DM (PIK3CA) as well as 184 additional genes connected with ASD or DM alone. Using zebrafish, we modeled a de novo tandem duplication impacting YTHDF2, encoding an N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A)-mRNA reader, in an ASD-DM proband. Testing zebrafish CRISPR knockdown led to reduced head/brain size, while overexpressing YTHDF2 resulted in increased head/brain size matching that of the proband. Single-cell transcriptomes of YTHDF2 gain-of-function larvae point to reduced expression of Fragile-X-syndrome-associated FMRP-target genes globally and in the developing brain, providing insight into the mechanism underlying autistic phenotypes. We additionally discovered a variant impacting a different gene encoding an m<sup>6</sup>A reader, YTHDC1, in our ASD-DM cohort.

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that causes a range of developmental problems including cognitive and behavioral impairment and learning disabilities. FXS is caused by full mutations (FM) of the <i>FMR1</i> gene expansions to over 200 repeats, with hypermethylation of the cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) tandem repeated region in its promoter, resulting in transcriptional silencing and loss of gene function. Female carriers of FM are typically less impaired than males. The Activation Ratio (AR), the fraction of the normal allele carried on the active X chromosome, is thought to play a crucial modifying role in defining phenotype severity. Here, we compare the cognitive, neuropsychological, adaptive, and behavioral profile of two FXS girls (10 and 11 years old) with seemingly identical <i>FMR1</i> genotypic profile of FM but distinctive AR levels (70% vs. 30%). A multi-method protocol, combining molecular pathophysiology and phenotypical measures, parent reports, lab-based tasks, gait analyses, and eye-tracking was employed. Results showed that lower AR corresponds to worse performances in most (cognitive, neuropsychological, adaptive, behavioral, social, mathematical skills), but not all the considered areas (i.e., time perception and gait analysis). These observations underscore the importance of AR as a phenotypic modifying parameter in females affected with FXS."

Here, we found that Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice, a mouse model of FXS, showed increased sniffing duration for non-social odors during their first exposure. Additionally, while wild-type (WT) males demonstrated differences in behavioral patterns between non-social odors while Fmr1 KO males did not show such distinction. We also showed that Fmr1 KO males spent significantly less time sniffing female urine odor compared to WT males. Moreover, we found an increased volume of the olfactory bulb in Fmr1 KO males. Overall, our findings suggest that the Fmr1 KO mice demonstrate atypical olfactory behaviors as well as structural changes in the olfactory bulb."

The predominant mechanism is due to CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion of more than 200 repeats in the 5'UTR (untranslated region) of <i>FMR1</i> (Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1) causing promoter methylation and transcriptional silencing. However, not all patients presenting with the characteristic phenotype and point/frameshift mutations with deletions in <i>FMR1</i> have been described in the literature. It is believed that < 1% of cases are caused by point mutations. Genetic and functional testing of point mutations in FXS has yielded insights on KH domain RNA-binding properties of FMRP (Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein Protein) and nuclear export of the protein.

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is among the most common neurodevelopmental conditions in humans. While public awareness of the challenges faced by individuals with autism is steadily increasing, the underlying causes of abnormalities observed in ASD remains incompletely understood. The autism spectrum is notably broad, with symptoms that can manifest in various forms and degrees of severity. Core features of ASD, such as communication difficulties, impaired social interactions, and restricted patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, are often accompanied by other co‑occurring conditions, such as anxiety. ASD affects individuals regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity. Although we are currently unable to pinpoint a single definitive cause of autism, it is clear that genetics play a crucial role in its development. The first genes associated with an increased risk for ASD were discovered in rare monogenic disorders, such as fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by mutations in the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene, and macrocephaly, linked to mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge of ASD in patients with mutations in the FMR1 and PTEN genes."

    "abstract": "Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in individuals with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and the mouse model of FXS ( <i>Fmr1</i> KO) display cortical hyperexcitability at rest, as well as deficits in sensory-driven cortical network synchrony. A form of circuit hyperexcitability is observed in <i>ex vivo</i> cortical slices of <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice as prolonged persistent activity, or Up, states. It is unknown if the circuit mechanisms that cause prolonged Up states contribute to FXS-relevant EEG phenotypes. Here we examined the role of endocannabinoids (eCB) in prolonged Up states in slices and resting and sensory-driven EEG phenotypes in awake <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. Bidirectional changes in eCB function are reported in the <i>Fmr1</i> KO that depend on synapse type (excitatory or inhibitory). We demonstrate that pharmacological or genetic reduction of Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CB1R) in GABAergic neurons rescues prolonged cortical Up states and deficits in sensory-driven cortical synchrony in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. In support of these findings, recordings from <i>Fmr1</i> KO cortical Layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons revealed enhanced CB1R-mediated suppression of inhibitory synaptic currents. In contrast, genetic reduction of <i>Cnr1</i> in glutamatergic neurons did not affect Up state duration, but deletion of <i>Fmr1</i> in the same neurons was sufficient to cause long Up states. These findings support a model where loss of <i>Fmr1</i> in glutamatergic neurons leads to enhanced CB1R-mediated suppression of GABAergic synaptic transmission, prolonged cortical circuit activation and reduced sensory-driven circuit synchronization. Results suggest that antagonism of CB1Rs as a therapeutic strategy to correct sensory processing deficits in FXS."

These full mutation (FM) alleles are associated with DNA methylation and gene silencing, which result in intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, and social and behavioral issues. Mosaicism for both the size of the CGG repeat tract and the extent of its methylation is commonly observed in individuals with the FM. Mosaicism has also been reported in carriers of premutation (PM) alleles, which have 55-200 CGG repeats. PM alleles confer risk for the fragile X premutation-associated conditions (FXPAC), including FXTAS, FXPOI, and FXAND, conditions thought to be due to the toxic consequences of transcripts containing large CGG-tracts. Unmethylated FM (UFM) alleles are transcriptionally and translationally active. Thus, they produce transcripts with toxic effects. These transcripts do produce some FMRP, the encoded product of the <i>FMR1</i> gene, albeit with reduced translational efficiency. As a result, mosaicism can result in a complex clinical presentation. Here, we review the concept of mosaicism in both FXS and in PM carriers, including its potential clinical significance."

    "abstract": "It is well known that activation of NMDA receptors can trigger long-term synaptic depression (LTD) and that a morphological correlate of this functional plasticity is spine retraction and elimination. Recent studies have led to the surprising conclusion that NMDA-induced spine shrinkage proceeds independently of ion flux and requires the initiation of <i>de novo</i> protein synthesis, highlighting an unappreciated contribution of mRNA translation to non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling. Here we used NMDA-induced spine shrinkage in slices of mouse hippocampus as a readout to investigate this novel modality of synaptic transmission. By using selective pharmacological and genetic tools, we find that structural plasticity is dependent on the ligand binding domain (LBD) of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors and that metabotropic signaling occurs via the GluN2B carboxyterminal domain (CTD). Disruption of signaling by replacing the GluN2B CTD with the GluN2A CTD leads to increased spine density, dysregulated basal protein synthesis, and epileptiform activity in area CA3 reminiscent of phenotypes observed in the <i>Fmr1 <sup>-/y</sup></i> model of fragile X syndrome. By crossing the <i>Fmr1 <sup>-/y</sup></i> mice with animals in which the GluN2A CTD has been replaced with the GluN2B CTD, we observe a correction of these core fragile X phenotypes. These findings suggest that non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling through GluN2B may represent a novel therapeutic target for treatment of fragile X and related causes of intellectual disability and autism."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading known genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders (ASD)-associated behaviors. A consistent and debilitating phenotype of FXS is auditory hypersensitivity that may lead to delayed language and high anxiety. Consistent with findings in FXS human studies, the mouse model of FXS, the Fmr1 knock out (KO) mouse, shows auditory hypersensitivity and temporal processing deficits. In electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings from humans and mice, these deficits manifest as increased N1 amplitudes in event-related potentials (ERP), increased gamma band single trial power (STP) and reduced phase locking to rapid temporal modulations of sound. In our previous study, we found that administration of the selective serotonin-1 A (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>)receptor biased agonist, NLX-101, protected Fmr1 KO mice from auditory hypersensitivity-associated seizures. Here we tested the hypothesis that NLX-101 will normalize EEG phenotypes in developing Fmr1 KO mice. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of NLX-101 on EEG phenotypes in male and female wildtype (WT) and Fmr1 KO mice. Using epidural electrodes, we recorded auditory event related potentials (ERP) and auditory temporal processing with a gap-in-noise auditory steady state response (ASSR) paradigm at two ages, postnatal (P) 21 and 30 days, from both auditory and frontal cortices of awake, freely moving mice, following NLX-101 (at 1.8 mg/kg i.p.) or saline administration. Saline-injected Fmr1 KO mice showed increased N1 amplitudes, increased STP and reduced phase locking to auditory gap-in-noise stimuli versus wild-type mice, reproducing previously published EEG phenotypes. An acute injection of NLX-101 did not alter ERP amplitudes at either P21 or P30, but significantly reduces STP at P30. Inter-trial phase clustering was significantly increased in both age groups with NLX-101, indicating improved temporal processing. The differential effects of serotonin modulation on ERP, background power and temporal processing suggest different developmental mechanisms leading to these phenotypes. These results suggest that NLX-101 could constitute a promising treatment option for targeting post-synaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors to improve auditory temporal processing, which in turn may improve speech and language function in FXS."

In the past decade or so, research has focused on the role of FMRP as an RNA-binding protein involved in translation inhibition in the brain in FXS model mice, particularly by slowing or stalling ribosome translocation on mRNA. More recent advances have shown that FMRP has a profound role in RNA splicing, at least in some cases by modulating the translation of splicing factor mRNAs. In a surprise, the human <i>FMR1</i> gene is transcribed in most cases even with a full CGG expansion. However, much of the <i>FMR1</i> that is produced is misspliced, which can be corrected by splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) administration. Other recent findings suggest that inhibition of multiple kinases can demethylate the <i>FMR1</i> gene and induce the formation of an R-loop in the CGG repeat region, leading to contraction of the repeat and FMRP restoration. These insights are paving the way for possible future therapeutic approaches for this disorder. We highlight the importance of FMRP restoration by ASO-mediated splice switching or CGG repeat modulation as key advances that may lead to successful treatments for FXS."

    "abstract": "β-Caryophyllene (BCP) is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene found in numerous plant species, including Cannabis sativa. BCP has shown a high safety profile and a wide range of biological functions, including beneficial effects in neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases. Here, we used behavioral, pharmacological, and in-silico docking analyses to investigate the effects and mechanism of action of BCP in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited cause of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability. To this aim, we used the recently validated Fmr1-<sup>Δ</sup>exon 8 rat model of FXS, that is also a genetic rat model of ASD. Acute and repeated oral administration of BCP rescued the cognitive deficits displayed by Fmr1-<sup>Δ</sup>exon 8 rats, without inducing tolerance after repeated administration. These beneficial effects were mediated by activation of hippocampal peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) α and γ, and were mimicked by the PPARα agonist Fenofibrate and the PPARγ agonist Pioglitazone. Conversely, CB2 cannabinoid receptors were not involved. Docking analyses further confirmed the ability of BCP to bind rat PPARs. Together, our findings demonstrate that hippocampal PPARs α and γ play a role in the cognitive deficits observed in a rat model of FXS, and provide first preclinical evidence about the efficacy and mechanism of action of BCP in neurodevelopmental disorders."

    "abstract": "LIMKs are serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases responsible for controlling cytoskeletal dynamics as key regulators of actin stability, ensuring synaptic health through normal synaptic bouton structure and function. However, LIMK1 overactivation results in abnormal dendritic synaptic development that characterizes the pathogenesis of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). As a result, the development of LIMK inhibitors represents an emerging disease-modifying therapeutic approach for FXS. We report the discovery of MDI-114215 (<b>85</b>), a novel, potent allosteric dual-LIMK1/2 inhibitor that demonstrates exquisite kinome selectivity. <b>85</b> reduces phospho-cofilin in mouse brain slices and rescues impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation in brain slices from FXS mice. We also show that LIMK inhibitors are effective in reducing phospho-cofilin levels in iPSC neurons derived from FXS patients, demonstrating <b>85</b> to be a potential therapeutic candidate for FXS that could have broad application to neurological disorders or cancers caused by LIMK1/2 overactivation and actin instability."

Drawing on African epistemologies such as ubuntu and ujamaa and on our collective experiences in genomics and big data research for sickle cell disease, hearing impairment, and fragile X syndrome and the project Public Understanding of Big Data in Genomics Medicine in Africa, we envision a transformative shift in health research data governance in Africa that could help create a sense of shared responsibility between all stakeholders in genomics and data-driven health research in Africa. This shift includes proposing a social contract for genomics and data science in health research that is grounded in African communitarianism such as solidarity, shared decision-making, and reciprocity. We make several recommendations for a social contract for genomics and data science in health, including the coproduction of genomics knowledge with study communities, power sharing between stakeholders, public education on the ethical and social implications of genetics and data science, benefit sharing, giving voice to data subjects through dynamic consent, and democratizing data access to allow wide access by all research stakeholders. Achieving this would require adopting participatory approaches to genomics and data governance."

    "abstract": "Many individuals with autism experience challenges using language in social contexts (i.e., pragmatic language). Characterizing and understanding pragmatic variability is important to inform intervention strategies and the etiology of communication challenges in autism; however, current manual coding-based methods are often time and labor intensive, and not readily applied in ample sample sizes. This proof-of-concept methodological study employed an artificial intelligence pre-trained language model, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, as a tool to address such challenges. We applied Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers to computationally index pragmatic-related variability in autism and in genetically related phenotypes displaying pragmatic differences, namely, in parents of autistic individuals, fragile X syndrome, and <i>FMR1</i> premutation. Findings suggest that without model fine-tuning, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers's Next Sentence Prediction module was able to derive estimates that differentiate autistic from non-autistic groups. Moreover, such computational estimates correlated with manually coded characterization of pragmatic abilities that contribute to conversational coherence, not only in autism but also in the other genetically related phenotypes. This study represents a step forward in evaluating the efficacy of artificial intelligence language models for capturing clinically important pragmatic differences and variability related to autism, showcasing the potential of artificial intelligence to provide automatized, efficient, and objective tools for pragmatic characterization to help advance the field.Lay abstractAutism is clinically defined by challenges with social language, including difficulties offering on-topic language in a conversation. Similar differences are also seen in genetically related conditions such as fragile X syndrome (FXS), and even among those carrying autism-related genes who do not have clinical diagnoses (e.g., the first-degree relatives of autistic individuals and carriers of the <i>FMR1</i> premutation), which suggests there are genetic influences on social language related to the genes involved in autism. Characterization of social language is therefore important for informing potential intervention strategies and understanding the causes of communication challenges in autism. However, current tools for characterizing social language in both clinical and research settings are very time and labor intensive. In this study, we test an automized computational method that may address this problem. We used a type of artificial intelligence known as pre-trained language model to measure aspects of social language in autistic individuals and their parents, non-autistic comparison groups, and individuals with FXS and the <i>FMR1</i> premutation. Findings suggest that these artificial intelligence approaches were able to identify differences in social language in autism, and to provide insight into the individuals' ability to keep a conversation on-topic. These findings also were associated with broader measures of participants' social communication ability. This study is one of the first to use artificial intelligence models to capture important differences in social language in autism and genetically related groups, demonstrating how artificial intelligence might be used to provide automatized, efficient, and objective tools for language characterization."

    "abstract": "Specialization of the brain for language is early emerging and essential for language learning in young children. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurogenetic disorder marked by high rates of delays in both expressive and receptive language, but neural activation patterns during speech and language processing are unknown. We report results of a functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) study of responses to speech and nonspeech sounds in the auditory cortex in a sample of 2- to 10-year-old children with FXS and typically developing controls (FXS n = 23, TDC n = 15, mean age = 6.44 and 7.07 years, respectively). Specifically, we measured changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the auditory cortex during blocks of speech and nonspeech matched noise in children with FXS and sex-and-age-matched controls. Similar to controls, children with FXS showed hemodynamic change consistent with neural activation of the primary auditory regions for speech as well as leftward lateralization for speech sound processing, strength of which was associated with higher verbal abilities in FXS. However, while controls showed neural differentiation of speech and nonspeech in the left auditory cortex, children with FXS did not demonstrate differentiation of the two conditions in this study. In addition, the children with FXS showed a greater neural activation to the nonspeech condition overall. Overall, these results suggest that basic patterns of neural activation for speech are present in FXS in childhood, but neural response to nonspeech sounds may differ in FXS when compared to controls."

The first links between RBPs and RNPs to diseases emerged serendipitously for fragile X syndrome, as its gene (<i>FMR1</i>) encoded RBP (FMRP), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), caused by deficits in survival motor neurons (SMN). Discoveries of the SMN complex and its unanticipated function in RNP assembly, essential for spliceosomal snRNP biogenesis, advanced understanding of RNA biology and pathogenesis. I reflect on how these and other contributions (e.g., nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, telescripting) originated from curiosity-driven exploration and highly collaborative lab culture. The vast RNA and RBP assortments are beneficial, but increase complexity and chances of disorders, making the RNP sphere a rich source for future discoveries."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein 1 (FMR1) is a translational repressor crucial for regulating genes in the central nervous system. While a lack of FMR1 expression causes Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), its overexpression is implicated in various cancers, necessitating tight regulation of FMR1 protein levels for normal cell physiology. In this study, we report that FMR1 is upregulated in gastric cancer patients. Reducing FMR1 expression decreased cell growth in gastric cancer cell lines. The Smac Mimetic LCL161 reduced both FMR1 and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (cIAP2) levels. Suppressing cIAP2, but not cIAP1, led to decreased FMR1, while cIAP2 overexpression increased FMR1 in gastric cancer cells. We observed that cIAP2 is also upregulated in gastric cancer patients, with FMR1 and cIAP2 levels positively correlated in both gastric and colorectal cancers. Notably, cIAP2 binds FMR1 via its CARD domain, unlike most cIAP2 targets that bind the BIR domain. Furthermore, cIAP2 ubiquitinates FMR1 through its CARD-RING domains, stabilizing the protein without proteasomal degradation. FMR1, modulated by cIAP2, promotes gastric cancer cell growth. Collectively, our findings highlight FMR1's growth-promoting role in gastric cancer and reveal a novel function of cIAP2 in stabilizing FMR1 as an E3 ligase. These results suggest targeting cIAP2 could be an effective strategy for treating gastric cancer by downregulating both cIAP2 and FMR1."

    "abstract": "The Royal Australian College of General Practice recommends that all women contemplating pregnancy or in early pregnancy should be offered reproductive genetic carrier screening (RGCS). In November 2023, a new Medicare item number was introduced for RGCS to detect cystic fibrosis (CF), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and fragile X syndrome (FXS) carrier status. The role of general practice in offering RGCS is recognised as being of crucial importance, but only a minority of general practitioners (GPs) are offering such screening. This study investigates the facilitators and barriers to offering RGCS in general practice. Fifteen Victorian GPs who had offered RGCS for CF, SMA and FXS participated in semi-structured telephone interviews. A behavioural change framework was used for this study. Barriers to offering screening (eg out-of-pocket costs, low frequency of preconception care and lack of GP education) mapped predominantly onto the 'opportunity' domain of the behaviour change framework. Reducing out-of-pocket costs and increasing the provision of preconception care and GP education will provide more people with the opportunity to make informed choices about participation in RGCS."

Besides medical and legal considerations, genetic testing, including carrier screening for multiple autosomal and X-linked recessive disorders plays an essential role in evaluating hereditary risk among donors and therefore exclude them from the donation process. A retrospective study was conducted on oocyte donors from a private clinic of assisted reproduction who underwent genetic testing between June 2014 and September 2023. Pre and post-test procedures were performed at the private clinic while karyotyping and carrier screening for Cystic Fibrosis, Fragile X syndrome and Spinal Muscular Atrophy were performed at the Genetic Unit of Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto. Among 581 donors, 81 women were excluded from the donation process since 5/563 had an alteration in karyotype, 57/581 were carriers of a Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator pathogenic variant or had a 5T allele, 11/394 had Survival of Motor Neuron 1 deletion and 8/426 had an intermediate or premutation allele in Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein gene. While recommendations from fertility societies advocate for comprehensive screening, opinions differ on the mandatory implementation of expanded carrier screening. In conclusion, the genetic tests and the pre and post-test counseling is imperative to optimize reproductive outcomes in the oocyte donation process."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FX) is the most common form of inherited cognitive impairment and falls under the broader category of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). FX is caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the non-coding region of the X-linked <i>Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1</i> (<i>FMR1</i>) gene, leading to its hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing. Animal models of FX rely on the deletion of the <i>Fmr1</i> gene, which fails to replicate the epigenetic silencing mechanism of the <i>FMR1</i> gene observed in human patients. Human stem cells carrying FX repeat expansions have provided a better understanding of the basis of epigenetic silencing of <i>FMR1</i>. Previous studies have found that 5-Azacytidine (5Azac) can reverse this methylation; however, 5Azac can be toxic, which may limit its therapeutic potential. Here, we show that the dietary factor Ascorbic Acid (AsA) can reduce DNA methylation in the <i>FMR1</i> locus and lead to an increase in <i>FMR1</i> gene expression in FX iPSCs and cerebral organoids. In addition, AsA treatment rescued neuronal gene expression and morphological defects observed in FX iPSC-derived cerebral organoids. Hence, we demonstrate that the dietary co-factor AsA can partially revert the molecular and morphological defects seen in human FX models in vitro. Our findings have implications for the development of novel therapies for FX in the future."

Specifically, we ask whether syntactic skills plateau or continue to change during adolescence for these groups and whether the profile of syntactic change differs between boys with FXS and those with DS. Participants were 38 boys with FXS (with and without autism) and 20 boys with DS between the ages of 10 and 16 years, as well as 33 boys who were neurotypical between the ages of 3 and 8 years at study entry. Trained examiners evaluated the participants annually for four consecutive years. The evaluation included standardized language assessments and a conversational language sample, which was analyzed using mean length of utterance-morphemes and the Index of Productive Syntax. For each measure, we fit a series of candidate models, including the intercept-only model and models with nonverbal cognition and maternal IQ as moderators. We then used Akaike's information criteria-corrected to determine which model in a candidate set had the most empirical evidence. Our between-groups results indicated that FXS and DS have distinct syntactic profiles. However, our growth analyses and moderator analyses yielded mixed results. For most measures, the most likely models suggest that there is no plateau in the growth of syntactic skills for boys with FXS or DS and that nonverbal cognition is associated with the rate of change. These results suggest that syntactic change continues to occur throughout adolescence for boys with FXS or DS. The results also indicate that the growth profiles are distinct between the two groups. Future research with more participants from more diverse backgrounds would add more clarity to these findings. https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.27984548."

    "abstract": "Discovered more than four decades ago, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) plays a fundamental role in the regulation of gene expression and is a major contributor to numerous diseases. With advanced technologies, several novel approaches aim to directly circumvent the effects of disease-causing frameshift and nonsense mutations. Additional therapeutics aim to globally dampen the NMD pathway in diseases associated with pathway hyperactivation, one example being Fragile X syndrome. In other cases, therapeutics have been designed to hijack or inhibit the cellular NMD machinery to either activate or obviate transcript-specific NMD by modulating pre-mRNA splicing. Here, we discuss promising approaches employed to regulate NMD for therapeutic purposes and highlight potential challenges in future clinical development. We are optimistic that the future of developing target-specific and global modulators of NMD (inhibitors as well as activators) is bright and will revolutionize the treatment of many genetic disorders, especially those with high unmet medical need."

Findings from blinded studies are mixed, and there is a limited understanding of electrophysiological target engagement that would facilitate cross-species translational studies. Smaller-scale, acute (e.g., single-dose) drug studies may speed treatment identification by detecting subtle electrophysiological and behavioral changes. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Twenty-nine participants with FXS (31% female) ages 15-45 years completed a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in which they received a single oral dose of 40 mg of lovastatin, 270 mg of minocycline, or placebo, with a 2-week washout period between dosing visits. Participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and three EEG paradigms (resting state; auditory chirp; auditory habituation) before and 4 hours after dosing. <b><i>Results:</i></b> No serious adverse events were reported, and both drugs were well-tolerated. Compared with placebo, there were no overall treatment effects for any outcomes, including EEG, but several modest drug responses varied as a function of sex and age. Lovastatin treatment was associated with improved spatial awareness in older participants and females compared with minocycline and placebo. <b><i>Discussion:</i></b> We show that single-dose drug studies are highly feasible in FXS and that patients with FXS can complete a range of EEG and behavioral tasks, many of which have been shown to be reliable and may therefore be sensitive to subtle drug target engagement. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Acute single doses of lovastatin or minocycline did not lead to changes in electrophysiological or performance-based measures. This may be due to the limited effects of these drugs in human patients or limited acute effects relative to chronic dosing. However, the study design was further validated for use in neurodevelopmental populations."

This approach has several advantages: (i) UDCs collection and culture are non-invasive, straightforward, and do not require medical personnel; (ii) reprogramming UDCs using commercially available Sendai viruses is highly efficient and reliable; and (iii) iPSCs generated from UDCs demonstrate strong differentiation potential. To showcase the effectiveness of this method, we generated iPSC lines from UDCs of three control individuals and three patients with Fragile X syndrome."

    "abstract": "Preclinical and clinical evidence support the notion that neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are synaptic disorders, characterized by excitatory-inhibitory imbalance. Despite this, NDD drug development programs targeting glutamate or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors have been largely unsuccessful. Nonetheless, recent drug trials in Rett syndrome (RTT), fragile X syndrome (FXS), and other NDDs targeting other mechanisms have met their endpoints. The purpose of this review is to identify the basis of these successful studies. Despite increasing evidence of disruption in synaptic homeostasis, most genetic variants associated with NDDs implicate proteins involved in cell regulation and not in neurotransmission. Metabolic processes, in particular mitochondrial function, appear to play a role in NDD pathophysiology. NDDs are also characterized by distinctive cell signaling abnormalities, which link cellular and synaptic homeostasis. Recent successful trials in NDDs, including those of trofinetide, the first drug specifically approved for one of these disorders (i.e., RTT), implicate the targeting of downstream processes (i.e., signaling pathways) rather than neurotransmitter receptors. Recent positive drug studies in NDDs and their underlying mechanisms, in conjunction with new knowledge on the pathophysiology of these disorders, support the concept that targeting signaling and cellular and synaptic homeostasis may be a preferred approach for ameliorating synaptic abnormalities in many NDDs."

A survey assessed familiarity with primary ovarian insufficiency and FXPOI knowledge among 107 women's healthcare providers and 14 medical students in the USA. Knowledge Scores, ranging from 0 to 16, were assigned, and demographic data, including healthcare provider type, specialty, and genetics exposure in education or training, were collected. Participants scored an average of 6.92 (± 2.19) out of 16 (42%) despite 88% of participants reporting genetics exposure in training.

Participants with a genetic counselor in their clinic scored 8% higher (p = 0.0083) than those without. Additionally, medical school graduation year was a significant predictor for knowledge score (p = 0.0397). This study underscores limited FXPOI knowledge among women's healthcare providers, aligning with patient reports. Notably, medical specialty and the presence of a genetic counselor impacted knowledge, emphasizing the urgency for broader education in women's healthcare, particularly among OBGYNs, the initial point of contact for patients with POI symptoms."

Given shared molecular and clinical features, understanding convergent and divergent implications of these syndromes on brain development may offer unique insights into disease mechanisms. While an increasing number of studies have examined brain volumes in these syndromes, the effects of each syndrome on global and subcortical brain volumes are unclear. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize existing literature on volumetric brain changes across TSC, FXS, NF1, and NS. Study outcomes were the effect sizes of the genetic syndromes on whole brain, gray and white matter, and subcortical volumes compared to typically developing controls. We performed a series of meta-analyses synthesizing data from 23 studies in NF1, TSC, FXS, and NS (pooled N = 1556) reporting whole brain volume, gray and white matter volumes, and volumes of subcortical structures compared to controls. Meta-analyses revealed significantly larger whole brain volume, gray and white matter volumes, and subcortical volumes in NF1 compared to controls. FXS was associated with increased whole brain, and gray and white matter volumes relative to controls, but effect sizes were smaller than those seen in NF1. In contrast, studies in NS indicated smaller whole brain and gray matter volumes, and reduced subcortical volumes compared to controls. For individuals with TSC, there were no significant differences in whole brain, gray matter, and white volumes compared to controls. Volumetric effect sizes were not moderated by age, sex, or full-scale IQ. This meta-analysis revealed that dysregulation of mTOR signaling across pre- and post-natal periods of development can result in convergent and divergent consequences for brain volume among genetic syndromes. Further research employing advanced disease modeling techniques with human pluripotent stem cell-derived in vitro models is needed to further refine our understanding of between and within syndrome variability on early brain development and identify shared molecular mechanisms for the development of pharmaceutical interventions."

Mutations in the human FMR1 gene, encoding the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP), cause the most common monogenic form of ASD, the Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). This study explored the interaction between the FMR1 gene and a viral-like infection as an environmental insult, focusing on the impact on core autistic-like behaviors and the mGluR1/5-mTOR pathway. Pregnant heterozygous Fmr1 mouse females were exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA), by injecting the immunostimulant Poly (I:C) at the embryonic stage 12.5, simulating viral infections. Subsequently, ASD-like behaviors were analyzed in the adult offspring, at 8-10 weeks of age. MIA exposure in wild-type mice led to ASD-like behaviors in the adult offspring. These effects were specifically confined to the intrauterine infection, as immune activation at later stages, namely puberty (Pubertal Immune Activation, PIA) at post-natal day 35 or adulthood (Adult Immune Activation, AIA) at post-natal day 56, did not alter adult behavior. Importantly, combining the Fmr1 mutation with MIA exposure did not intensify core autistic-like behaviors, suggesting an occlusion effect. Mechanistically, MIA provided a strong activation of the mGluR1/5-mTOR pathway, leading to increased LTP and downregulation of FMRP specifically in the hippocampus. Finally, FMRP modulates mTOR activity via TSC2. These findings further strengthen the key role of the mGluR1/5-mTOR pathway in causing ASD-like core symptoms."

    "title": "Parkinson's Disease Polygenic Risk Score and Neurological Involvement in Carriers of the FMR1 Premutation Allele: A Case for Genetic Modifier.",
    "abstract": "Premutation alleles of the FMR1 X-linked gene containing CGG repeat expansions ranging from 55 to 200 are associated with diverse late-onset neurological involvements, including most severe disorder termed Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). It is intriguing that at least one-third of male, and a much lower than predicted from the X-linkage proportion of female carriers are free of this syndrome. This suggests the existence of secondary genetic factors modifying the risk of neurological involvements in these carriers. Considering the occasional presence of parkinsonian features in FXTAS, we explored the possibility that the Parkinson's Disease Polygenic Risk Score (PD PRS) is related to the occurrence of FXTAS or less severe neurological involvements, in premutation carriers. The Genome-wide SNP genotyping and clinical data on neurological status were obtained from 250 unrelated affected and non-affected male and female adult carriers of the premutation. The medians for the Parkinson's Disease Polygenic Risk Score (PD PRS) were compared between the groups of asymptomatic and neurologically affected carriers, and the association of PD PRS with neurological involvement in context with the other known risk factors was explored by fitting univariate and multiple logistic regression models. There was a significant difference between the medians from the asymptomatic versus neurologically affected (FXTAS+) groups (p = 0.009). The FXTAS+ status was significantly associated with age at testing (p < 0.001), gender (p = 0.026), and with PD PRS (p = 0.021). The contribution of PD PRS remained significant after adjusting for age and gender (p = 0.044). We have obtained the first evidence for the relationship between PD PRS and the risk of FXTAS or lesser neurological involvements in the FMR1 premutation carriers. This suggests the role of Parkinson's disease polygenic variants as genetic modifiers of the risk of late onset neurological changes in these carriers."

    "abstract": "This study examined the early breastfeeding experiences of mothers with an FMR1 premutation (FXPM) and their infants with and without fragile X syndrome (FXS) to identify early feeding needs and potential opportunities for intervention. Data collection occurred through a retrospective national survey that captured data on breastfeeding experiences and co-occurring conditions of mother and child. Participants were 246 mothers with an FXPM. Of their 384 infants, 287 had FXS and 97 were unaffected (i.e., they did not have FXS or an FXPM). Unaffected infants had a longer breastfeeding duration relative to infants with FXS, and infants of mothers who had postpartum depression (PPD). Additionally, infants who were reported to display aggressiveness towards others later in childhood had a shorter breastfeeding duration than those who did not go on to display aggression. Approximately 42% percent of mothers reported difficulties with breastfeeding infants with FXS compared to only 17% of unaffected infants. The most common reason for breastfeeding cessation for mothers of children with FXS was perceived difficulties in breastfeeding for the child (37%), whereas the most common reason for mothers of unaffected infants was a personal choice to stop (37%). This study provides preliminary evidence that infants with FXS show early phenotypes that make breastfeeding more difficult. Future research should investigate whether interventions for infants with FXS could improve breastfeeding outcomes."

    "abstract": "Estimating meaningful change thresholds (MCT) on clinical outcome assessments is an important consideration when evaluating treatments. In fragile X syndrome (FXS) research, there has been no consensus on how to define MCT's on several commonly used outcome measures. The purpose of the current study was to determine clinically relevant MCT's of caregiver-rated assessments using data from a phase 3 clinical trials of arbaclofen (Berry-Kravis et al., 2017). Data were collected as a part of previous phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of arbaclofen in individuals with FXS (Berry-Kravis et al., 2017). The two studies enrolled age groups of 5-11-years (n = 159) and 12-50-years (n = 119). The current study examines meaningful within-patient change thresholds from baseline to treatment week 8 across several measures: ABC-C<sub>FXS</sub>; PSI; Vineland-II; and a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of Anxiety and Disruptive Behaviors. MCT's were established by using anchor-based methods, using the CGI-S and CGI-I as anchors. Examining the results of the anchor-based analyses and visual CDF plots, MCT's were observed for the pediatric study for the ABC-C<sub>FXS</sub> subscales (with a range depending on use of CGI-S or CGI-I as anchor): Irritability: 11.1-14.8 points; Hyperactivity: 6.7-8.9 points; and Socially Unresponsive/Lethargic: 6.6-8.1 points; as well both VAS subscales: Anxiety: 28.3-36.2 mm; and Disruptive Behavior: 22.4-27.4 mm. Such thresholds were not observed for the Vineland-II and PSI subscales. Our analysis of MCT's helps set the stage for interpreting clinical trial results in FXS. This may include use of relevant subscales of the ABC-C<sub>FXS</sub> and VAS as primary outcomes using the MCT's for response definition. This work may help define future study inclusion criteria and enable future interpretation of treatment outcome results in the field."

    "abstract": "The concept that dimeric protein complexes in synapses can sequentially replace their subunits has been a cornerstone of Francis Crick's 1984 hypothesis, explaining how long-term memories could be maintained in the face of short protein lifetimes. However, it is unknown whether the subunits of protein complexes that mediate memory are sequentially replaced in the brain and if this process is linked to protein lifetime. We address these issues by focusing on supercomplexes assembled by the abundant postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD95, which plays a crucial role in memory. We used single-molecule detection, super-resolution microscopy and MINFLUX to probe the molecular composition of PSD95 supercomplexes in mice carrying genetically encoded HaloTags, eGFP, and mEoS2. We found a population of PSD95-containing supercomplexes comprised of two copies of PSD95, with a dominant 12.7 nm separation. Time-stamping of PSD95 subunits in vivo revealed that each PSD95 subunit was sequentially replaced over days and weeks. Comparison of brain regions showed subunit replacement was slowest in the cortex, where PSD95 protein lifetime is longest. Our findings reveal that protein supercomplexes within the postsynaptic density can be maintained by gradual replacement of individual subunits providing a mechanism for stable maintenance of their organization. Moreover, we extend Crick's model by suggesting that synapses with slow subunit replacement of protein supercomplexes and long-protein lifetimes are specialized for long-term memory storage and that these synapses are highly enriched in superficial layers of the cortex where long-term memories are stored."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and often accompanied with debilitating pathologies including seizures and hyperactivity. FXS arises from a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of the <i>FMR1</i> gene that silences expression of the RNA-binding protein FMRP. Despite progress in understanding FMRP functions, the identification of effective therapeutic targets has lagged and at present there are no viable treatment options. Here we identify the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) as candidate target for intervention in FXS. In the early postnatal hippocampus of <i>Fmr1</i> knockout (KO) mice, an established pre-clinical model of FXS, the α7 nAChR accessory protein Ly6H is abnormally enriched at the neuronal surface and mislocalized in dendrites. Ly6H, a GPI-anchored protein, binds α7 nAChRs with high affinity and can limit α7 nAChR surface expression and signaling. We find that α7 nAChR-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses are dampened in immature glutamatergic and GABAergic <i>Fmr1</i> <sup>KO</sup> neurons compared to wild type. Knockdown of endogenous Ly6H in <i>Fmr1</i> <sup>KO</sup> neurons is sufficient to rescue dampened α7 nAChR Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in vitro, providing evidence of a cell-autonomous role for Ly6H aberrant expression in α7 nAChR hypofunction. In line with intrinsic deficits in α7 nAChR activity in <i>Fmr1</i> <sup>KO</sup> neurons, in vivo administration of the α7 nAChR-selective positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596 reduced hyperactivity and seizure severity in adolescent <i>Fmr1</i> <sup>KO</sup> mice. Our mechanistic studies together with evidence of the in vivo efficacy of α7 nAChR augmentation implicate α7 nAChR hypofunction in FXS pathology."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can cause impairments in spatial cognition and memory. The hippocampus is thought to support spatial cognition through the activity of place cells, neurons with spatial receptive fields. Coordinated firing of place cell populations is organized by different oscillatory patterns in the hippocampus during specific behavioral states. Theta rhythms organize place cell populations during awake exploration. Sharp wave-ripples organize place cell population reactivation during waking rest. Here, we examined the coordination of CA1 place cell populations during active behavior and subsequent rest in a rat model of FXS (<i>Fmr1</i> knockout rats). While the organization of individual place cells by the theta rhythm was normal, the coordinated activation of sequences of place cells during individual theta cycles was impaired in <i>Fmr1</i> knockout rats. Further, the subsequent replay of place cell sequences was impaired during waking rest following active exploration. Together, these results expand our understanding of how genetic modifications that model those observed in FXS affect hippocampal physiology and suggest a potential mechanism underlying impaired spatial cognition in FXS."

Emerging evidence suggests that the repeats trigger an error-prone form of DNA repair that causes the expansion mutation by exploiting a limitation in normal mismatch repair. Furthermore, while much remains to be understood about how the mutation causes pathology in different diseases in this group, there is evidence to suggest that some of the downstream consequences of repeat expansion trigger the DNA damage response in ways that contribute to disease pathology. This review will discuss these subjects in the context of the Fragile X-related disorders (aka the FMR1 disorders) that provide a particularly interesting example of the intersection between the repeats and the DNA damage response that may also be relevant for many other diseases in this group."

    "abstract": "Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) is a critical regulator of translation, whose dysfunction causes fragile X syndrome. FMRP dysfunction disrupts mitochondrial health in neurons, but it is unclear how FMRP supports mitochondrial homoeostasis. Here we demonstrate that FMRP granules are recruited to the mitochondrial midzone, where they mark mitochondrial fission sites in axons and dendrites. Endolysosomal vesicles contribute to FMRP granule positioning around mitochondria and facilitate FMRP-associated fission via Rab7 GTP hydrolysis. Cryo-electron tomography and real-time translation imaging reveal that mitochondria-associated FMRP granules are ribosome-rich structures that serve as sites of local protein synthesis. Specifically, FMRP promotes local translation of mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), selectively enabling replicative fission at the mitochondrial midzone. Disrupting FMRP function dysregulates mitochondria-associated MFF translation and perturbs fission dynamics, resulting in increased peripheral fission and an irregular distribution of mitochondrial nucleoids. Thus, FMRP regulates local translation of MFF in neurons, enabling precise control of mitochondrial fission."

    "abstract": "Repetitive stereotyped behaviors are core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and fragile X syndrome (FXS), the prevalent genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism. The nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) circuit rules movement and creation of habits and sequential behaviors; therefore, its dysregulation could promote autistic repetitive behaviors. Nevertheless, inspection of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) DA neurons in ASD models has been overlooked and specific evidence of their altered activity in ASD and FXS is absent. Here, we show that hyperactivity of SNpc DA neurons is an early feature of FXS. The underlying mechanism relies on an interplay between metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) and ErbB tyrosine kinases, receptors for the neurotrophic and differentiation factors known as neuregulins. Up-regulation of ErbB4 and ErbB2 in nigral DA neurons drives neuronal hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors of the FXS mouse, concurrently rescued by ErbB inhibition. In conclusion, beyond providing the first evidence that nigral DA neuron hyperactivity is a signature of FXS and nigral mGluR1 and ErbB4/2 play a relevant role in FXS etiology, we demonstrate that inhibiting ErbB is a valuable pharmacological approach to attenuate stereotyped repetitive behaviors, thus opening an avenue toward innovative therapies for ASD and FXS treatment."

Nanopore long-read sequencing, triplet-repeat primed PCR (TP-PCR), methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) and trinucleotide polymorphism genotyping of androgen receptor (AR) gene were used to analyze the FMR1 CGG repeat number, methylation, and X chromosome inactivation of the pedigree members. This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (No. KS-2018-KY-36). Full mutation and CpG island hypermethylation were detected in the proband. The elder sister of the proband had full mutation of the FMR1 gene on one X chromosome and hypermethylation of CpG island, while the FMR1 gene on the other X chromosome was normal. FMR1 premutation was detected in the proband's mother. Nanopore long-read sequencing can simultaneously detect the dynamic mutation and methylation status of the FMR1 gene on the two X chromosomes of females, which has important value for the diagnosis of FXS in different genders."

    "abstract": "Repeat expansion disorders (REDs) encompass over 50 inherited neurological disorders and are characterized by the expansion of short tandem nucleotide repeats beyond a specific repeat length. Particularly intriguing among these are multiple fragile X-associated disorders (FXds), which arise from an expansion of CGG repeats in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. Despite arising from repeat expansions in the same gene, the clinical manifestations of FXds vary widely, encompassing developmental delays, parkinsonism, dementia, and an increased risk of infertility. FXds also exhibit molecular mechanisms observed in other REDs, that is, gene- and protein-loss-of-function and RNA- and protein-gain-of-function. The heterogeneity of phenotypes and pathomechanisms in FXds results from the different lengths of the CGG tract. As the number of repeats increases, the structures formed by RNA and DNA fragments containing CGG repeats change significantly, contributing to the diversity of FXd phenotypes and mechanisms. In this review, we discuss the role of RNA and DNA structures formed by expanded CGG repeats in driving FXd pathogenesis and how the genetic instability of CGG repeats is mediated by the complex interplay between transcription, DNA replication, and repair. We also discuss therapeutic strategies, including small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides, and CRISPR-Cas systems, that target toxic RNA and DNA involved in the development of FXds."

We also sought to test delay discounting in the model and assess potential relations between timing and choice behavior. Consistent with previous human and nonhuman work, we found reduced timing precision in the FMR1 KO rats. We also discovered significantly increased smaller, sooner reward choice in the FMR1 KO rats. Performance on the timing task appeared to be unrelated to performance on the choice task for both model and control rats. These results add to what has become increasingly clear: timing is disrupted in humans diagnosed with developmental disabilities and in nonhuman models designed to model developmental disabilities. Our findings are consistent with those of previous work and the first to our knowledge to show such effects in the FMR1 KO rat. We discuss the potential clinical implications and future directions surrounding potential \"timing interventions\" for individuals diagnosed with developmental disabilities."

Several studies have reported the dysregulation of GSK3β in FXS, and its role in mitochondrial function is also well established. However, the link between disrupted GSK3β activity and mitochondrial dysfunction in FXS remains unexplored. Utilizing Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice and human cell lines from individuals with FXS, we uncovered a developmental window where dysregulated GSK3β activity disrupts mitochondrial function.

This neurophysiological phenotype was optimized and validated into a high throughput assay based on the amount of FMRP re-expression and the number of healthy neurons in a mosaic network necessary for functional rescue.

As transdiagnostic features of intellectual disability, elevated rates of RRBs in FXS could represent various underlying known co-occurring conditions in FXS such as anxiety or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet this distinction has not been investigated. Further, delineating whether RRBs are more indicative of anxiety or ASD in FXS may clarify phenotypic profiles within FXS and improve differential assessment. We longitudinally examined the potentially independent or multiplicative effect of ASD and anxiety symptom severity on RRBs in 60 children with FXS. Anxiety was measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), ASD severity was measured using the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), and RRBs were measured using the Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS-R). We estimated a series of moderated regression models with anxiety and ASD symptoms at the initial assessment (Time 1) as predictors of RRBs at the outcome assessment two years later (Time 2), along with an anxiety-by-ASD interaction term to determine the potential multiplicative effect of these co-occurring conditions on RRBs. Results identified a significant interaction between ASD and anxiety symptom severity at the initial assessment that predicted elevated sensory-motor RRBs two years later. Increased sensory-motor RRBs were predicted by elevated ASD symptoms only when anxiety symptom severity was low. Likewise, increased sensory-motor RRBs were predicted by elevated anxiety symptoms only when ASD symptom severity was low. Interestingly, this relationship was isolated to Sensory-Motor RRBs, with evidence that it could also apply to total RRBs. Findings suggest that ASD and anxiety exert independent and differential effects on Sensory-Motor RRBs when at high severity levels and a multiplicative effect when at moderate levels, which has important implications for early and targeted interventions."

The full mutation of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein-1 gene, characterized by an expansion of CGG trinucleotide repeats (>200 CGG repeats), leads to fragile X syndrome. Currently, there are no targeted treatments available for fragile X syndrome. In a recent large multi-site trial, FXLEARN, the effects of the mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator, AFQ056 (mavoglurant), were investigated, but did not show a significant impact of AFQ056 on language development in children with fragile X syndrome aged 3-6 years. The current analyses from biospecimens collected in the FXLEARN study aimed to determine whether AFQ056 affects the level of potential biomarkers associated with Akt/mTOR and matrix metalloproteinase 9 signaling in young individuals with fragile X syndrome. Previous research has indicated that these biomarkers play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome. A double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group flexible-dose forced titration design. Blood samples for biomarkers were collected during the FXLEARN at baseline and subsequent visits (1- and 8-month visits). Biomarker analyses included fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein-1 genotyping by Southern blot and PCR approaches, fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein-1 mRNA levels determined by PCR, matrix metalloproteinase 9 levels' detection using a magnetic bead panel, and targets of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway with their phosphorylation levels detected. This research revealed that administering AFQ056 does not affect the expression levels of the investigated blood biomarkers in young children with fragile X syndrome. Our findings of the lack of association between clinical improvement and biomarkers' levels in the treatment group are in line with the lack of benefit observed in the FXLEARN study.

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms that are associated with cognitive, learning, and behavioral challenges. We investigated how known molecular disruptions in the Fmr1 knockout (FMR-KO) rat model of FXS negatively impact hippocampal-prefrontal cortex (H-PFC) neural network activity and consequent behavior. FMR-KO and control rats underwent a battery of behavioral tests assessing sociability, memory, and anxiety. Single-unit electrophysiology recordings were then conducted to measure patterns of neural activity in H-PFC circuit. Advanced mathematical models were used to characterize the patterns that were then compared between groups using generalized linear mixed models. FMR-KO rats demonstrated significant behavioral deficits in sociability, spatial learning, and anxiety, aligning with symptoms of ASD. At the neural level, these rats exhibited abnormal firing patterns in the H-PFC circuit that is critical for learning, memory, and social behavior. The neural networks in FMR-KO rats were also less densely connected and more fragmented, particularly in hippocampal-PFC correlated firing. These findings suggest that disruptions in neural network dynamics underlie the observed behavioral impairments in FMR-KO rats. FMR-KO significantly disrupts several characteristics of action potential firing in the H-PFC network, leading to deficits in social behavior, memory, and anxiety, as seen in FXS. This disruption is characterized by less organized and less resilient hippocampal-PFC networks. These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at normalizing neural dynamics, such as with brain stimulation, could potentially improve behavior and cognitive functions in autistic individuals. Fragile X Syndrome is associated with autism, cognitive challenges and anxietyThe loss of Fmr1 protein disrupts processes involved in building neural networksThe consequence is abnormal neural dynamics in hippocampal-prefrontal cortex networksNormalization of dynamics could improve outcomes in FXS and ASD."

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as crucial elements in the regulation of gene expression, playing a significant role in the underlying neurobiology of a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders. This review examines the intricate involvement of miRNAs in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Fragile X syndrome (FXS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome (TS), schizophrenia (SCZ), and mood disorders. This review highlights how miRNA dysregulation can illuminate the molecular pathways of these diseases and potentially serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis. Specifically, miRNAs' ability to target genes critical to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, their role in the development of trinucleotide repeat and neurodevelopmental disorders, and their distinctive patterns in SCZ and mood disorders are discussed. The review also stresses the value of miRNAs in precision neuropsychiatry, where they could predict treatment outcomes and aid in disease management. Furthermore, the study of conserved miRNAs in model organisms like Drosophila underscores their broad utility and provides deeper mechanistic insights into their biological functions. This comprehensive examination of miRNAs across various conditions advocates for their integration into clinical practice, promising advancements in personalized healthcare for neurological and psychiatric conditions."

    "abstract": "Genomic repeat sequences are patterns of nucleic acids that exist in multiple copies throughout the genome. More than 60 Mendelian disorders are caused by the expansion or contraction of these repeats. Various specific methods for determining tandem repeat variations have been developed. However, these methods are highly specific to the genomic region being studied and sometimes require specialized tools. In this study, we have investigated the use of Optical Genome Mapping (OGM) as a diagnostic tool for detecting repeat disorders. We evaluated 19 patients with a prediagnosis of repeat disorders and explained the molecular etiology of 9 of them with OGM (5 patients with Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD), 2 patients with Friedreich's Ataxia (FA), 1 patient with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), and 1 patient with Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsy 1A (EPM1A)). We confirmed OGM results with more widely used fragment analysis techniques. This study highlights the utility of OGM as a diagnostic tool for repeat expansion and contraction diseases such as FA, FXS, EPM1A, and FSHD."

    "abstract": "Conversations about prognosis for genetic neurodevelopmental conditions are becoming more frequent; however, there is a lack of evidence and guidance on how to approach these conversations and frame the information being provided. (1) To understand how parents perceive prognostic conversations with healthcare professionals and their preferences for these conversations, (2) To investigate the framing of prognostic information found online. This was a mixed-methods study, comprising of (1) a thematic analysis of interviews with parents and (2) a quantification of prognostic information available on the internet that portrayed a negative message. The strategy to classify the framing of prognostic information was defined iteratively, informed by the information found online. We interviewed 32 parents from across Australia. Parents had a child with a genetic neurodevelopmental condition, such as Fragile X syndrome (28 %), 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (16 %) or Angelman syndrome (16 %). Parents reported their preference to discuss their child's potential strengths as well as challenges regarding prognosis. They reported that conversations about prognosis often focused on the child's possible deficits and that online information they encountered was similarly framed negatively. Our analysis of online information confirmed parents accounts: 95.3 % was coded as negative, while only 4.7 % was positive/neutral. Our data provide evidence of an over-emphasis of deficit-framed prognostic information about genetic neurodevelopmental conditions. The initial exposure to negative information may adversely affect parents' psychological well-being and expectations, which future research could address. Health professionals could consider strengths-based framing of prognostic information gained from current and emerging technologies when returning results to families. Findings from this study can help to inform health communication practices as well as online content development."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) deficiency. Electroencephalogram (EEG) changes in FXS include alterations of oscillatory activity and responses to sensory stimuli, some of which have been back-translated into rodent models by knocking-out the Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 gene (Fmr1-KO). However, the validity of these EEG phenotypes as objective biomarkers requires further investigation. Potential pharmacotherapies such as mGluR5 inhibitors (e.g. CTEP; 2-chloro-4-((2,5-dimethyl-1-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)-1H-imidazole-4-yl)ethynyl)pyridine), GABA<sub>B</sub>R agonists (e.g. arbaclofen) and δ-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>R agonists (e.g. gaboxadol) have not translated into clinical success despite rescuing many phenotypes in the Fmr1-KO model. Yet none of these treatments have been assessed on EEG phenotypes in the Fmr1-KO model. Therefore, we set out to discover new EEG phenotypes in Fmr1-KO mice, using \"task-free\" and auditory-evoked (AEPs) and visually-evoked potential (VEP) paradigms, and probe their modulation by CTEP, arbaclofen and gaboxadol, using within-subjects designs. First, we report Fmr1-KO-associated EEG abnormalities that closely resemble those observed in FXS, including elevated gamma-band power, reduced alpha/beta-band coherence, increased AEPs and delayed VEPs. Secondly, we found that pharmacological treatment, at best, only partially normalized EEG phenotypes. CTEP restored alpha/beta-band coherence and AEP amplitudes but failed to normalize gamma power and VEP latencies. Conversely, arbaclofen reduced gamma power but did not restore coherence or AEP amplitudes and further delayed VEPs. Gaboxadol did not normalize any EEG phenotypes. We conclude that these compounds have limited ability to normalize these EEG phenotypes."

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Angelman syndrome (AS), Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), and Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are monogenic disorders with high a prevalence of ASD symptomatology. This study aimed to identify ASD symptom profiles in a large group of children and adolescents (0;9-28 years) with FXS, AS, TSC, and NF1. Data on ASD symptomatology (Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS-2) & Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2)) were collected from children and adolescents with FXS (n = 54), AS (n = 93), TSC (n = 112), and NF1 (n = 278). To identify groups of individuals with similar ASD profiles, we performed two latent profile analyses. We identified a four-profile model based on the ADOS-2, with a (1) 'Non-spectrum symptom profile', (2) 'Social Affect symptom profile', (3)'Restricted/Repetitive Behaviors symptom profile', and (4)'ASD symptom profile'. We also identified a four-profile model based on the SRS, with a (1)'Non-clinical symptom profile', (2)'Mild symptom profile', (3)'Moderate symptom profile', and (4)'Severe symptom profile'. Although each syndrome group exhibited varying degrees of severity, they also displayed heterogeneity in the profiles in which they were classified. We found distinct ASD symptom profiles in a population consisting of children and adolescents with FXS, AS, TSC, and NF1. Our study highlights the importance of a personalized approach to the identification and management of ASD symptoms in rare genetic syndromes. Future studies should aim to include more domains of functioning and investigate the stability of latent profiles over time."

    "abstract": "Mouse models of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) have demonstrated impairments in excitatory and inhibitory sensory-evoked neuronal firing. Homeostatic plasticity, which encompasses a set of mechanisms to stabilize baseline activity levels, does not compensate for these changes in activity. Previous work has shown that impairments in homeostatic plasticity are observed in FXS, including deficits in synaptic scaling and intrinsic excitability. Here, we aimed to examine how homeostatic plasticity is altered <i>in vivo</i> in an <i>Fmr1</i> KO mouse model following unilateral whisker deprivation (WD). We show that WD in the wild type leads to an increase in the proportion of L5/6 somatosensory neurons that are recruited, but this does not occur in the KO. In addition, we observed a change in the threshold of excitatory neurons at a later developmental stage in the KO. Compromised homeostatic plasticity in development could influence sensory processing and long-term cortical organization."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is an X-linked disorder leading to the loss of expression of FMR1-protein product, FMRP. The absence or deficiency of FMRP is thought to result in the characteristic FXS phenotypes, including intellectual disability. Identifying the relationship between FMRP levels and IQ may be critical to better understand underlying mechanisms and advance treatment development and planning. A sample of 143 individuals with FXS (69% male), aged 8-50 years, completed IQ testing and blood draw via venipuncture to determine the relationship between Deviation IQ scores and FMRP levels as well as the distribution of Deviation IQ scores. In both males and females with FXS, higher FMRP levels were associated with higher Deviation IQ. However, this relationship was no longer significant when only examining full mutation, fully-methylated males. Yet, both the full and restricted male samples showed a downward shifted but otherwise normal distribution of Deviation IQ scores. Our findings support and extend previous studies establishing molecular markers of disease severity in FXS as well as provide novel evidence of a \"FXS IQ standard curve\". This latter finding suggests inter-individual variation in Deviation IQ in FXS, especially among males, may be driven by similar factors known to impact cognitive outcomes in typically-developing individuals. Thus, future work aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which FMRP loss leads to intellectual disability should revisit the biological/genetic, socio-environmental, and epigenetic factors contributing to inter-individual variation in IQ in FXS."

This study utilized guided machine learning to test promising translational EEG measures (resting power and auditory chirp oscillatory variables) in a large heterogeneous sample of individuals with FXS to identify best performing EEG variables for reliably separating individuals with FXS, and genetically-mediated subgroups within FXS, from typically developing controls. Best performing variables included resting relative frontal theta power, all combined posterior-head resting power bands, posterior peak alpha frequency (PAF), combined PAF across all measured regions, combined theta, alpha, and gamma power during the chirp, and all combined chirp oscillatory variables. Sub-group analyses for resting EEG best discriminated non-mosaic FXS males via frontal theta resting relative power (AUC = 0.8759), even with data reduced to a 20-channel clinical montage (AUC = 0.9062). In the chirp task, FXS females and non-mosaic males were nearly perfectly discriminated by combined theta, alpha, and gamma power (AUC = 0.9444) and a combination of all variables (AUC = 0.9610), respectively. Results support use of resting and auditory oscillatory tasks to reliably identify neural deficit in FXS, and to identify specific translational targets for genetically-mediated sub-groups, supporting potential points for stratification."

Methods This was a retrospective case-control study including children aged 2-14 years diagnosed with ASD by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5 criteria and the assessment card in the ASD center at King Salman Armed Forces Hospital. Data were obtained using a self-developed questionnaire that included demographic features, nutritional and behavioral characteristics, and GI symptoms in the previous six months. The control group consisted of typically developing (TD) children matched to the ASD group for age and gender. Syndromic autism with defined somatic abnormalities and recognized genetic causes (e.g., fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis) were excluded Results A total of 146 ASD children and 114 normal children were included. No significant demographic differences were found between the groups. The ASD group had a higher frequency of low income and a significantly lower rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months. GI symptoms, specifically constipation, abdominal gases and distension, diarrhea, undigested food particles in stool, and mouth ulcers, were significantly more frequent in the ASD group. Weight abnormalities (both increase and decrease) were also more common. Family history of ASD was significantly more in ASD children with GI symptoms while low maternal education was more in those without. Conclusion This study reveals a high prevalence of GI symptoms in ASD children. Family history of ASD and maternal education may influence the GI symptoms reported in ASD children."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the abnormal expansion of CGG repeats in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Many FXS patients experience sleep disruptions, and we sought to explore these symptoms along with the possible benefits of a scheduled feeding intervention using the <i>Fmr1</i> knockout (KO) mouse model. These mutants displayed clear evidence for sleep and circadian disturbances including delay in the onset of sleep and fragmented activity rhythms with increases in cycle-to-cycle variability. Importantly, the <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice exhibited deficits in their circadian behavioral response to light with reduced masking, longer time to resetting to shifts in the Light-Dark cycle, altered synchronization to a skeleton photoperiod and lower magnitude light-induced phase shifts of activity rhythms. Investigation of the retinal input to the surprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) with the neurotracer cholera toxin (β subunit) and quantification of the light-evoked cFos expression in the SCN revealed an abnormal retinal innervation of the SCN in the <i>Fmr1</i> KO, providing a possible mechanistic explanation for the observed behavioral deficits. Interestingly, disruptions in social and repetitive behaviors correlated with sleep duration and fragmentation. Understanding the nature of the deficits, we decided to apply a scheduled feeding regimen (6-hr/18-hr feed/fast cycle) as a circadian-based strategy to boast circadian rhythms independently of light. This intervention significantly improved the activity rhythms and sleep in the mutants. Strikingly, the scheduled feeding ameliorated social interactions and reduced repetitive behaviors as well as the levels of Interferon-gamma and Interleukin-12 in the <i>Fmr1</i> KO mutants, suggesting that timed eating may be an effective way to lessen inflammation. Collectively, this work adds support to efforts to develop circadian based interventions to help with symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders."

We examined the impact of repeated seizures on the behavioral and molecular changes in male Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice. Seizures were induced by administering three flurothyl seizures per day across postnatal days (PD) 7-11, for a total of 15 seizures. In adulthood, mice were tested in a battery of behavioral tasks to assess long-term behavioral deficits. The two-hit impact of a Fmr1 knockout and seizures resulted in decreased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze test and a longer latency to their first nose poke (repetitive behavior). Seizures resulted in decreased activity, decreased repetitive behavior (grooming and rearings), and decreased social behavior, while they also increased habituation to auditory stimuli and increased freezing in delayed fear conditioning in both KO and control mice. KO mice displayed increased repetitive behavior in the open field task (clockwise revolutions) and repeated nose pokes, and decreased anxiety in the open field test. No differences in mTOR signaling were found. These findings further illuminate the long-term effects of synergistic impact of two hits on the developing brain."

Ten young adults diagnosed with FXS took part in the second stage intervention of \"Corp-osa-Mente\" (CoM II), a group nCBT program previously outlined by Montanaro and colleagues in an earlier study, with the participants being the same as in the previous research. This report details the outcomes of an additional twelve-month group sections aimed at enhancing the ability to manage emotions and the socio-communicative skills of these young adults. Caregivers completed measures of adaptive functioning, emotional and behavior problems, executive function, communication skills and family quality of life at pre-treatment (T0) and post-treatment (T1).

The present study characterized psychological well-being, social support, and caregiving responsibilities during the pandemic across mothers of children with autism, fragile X syndrome (FXS), and neurotypical children. Participants were 54 mothers of children with FXS, 46 mothers of autistic children, and a control group of 80 mothers of neurotypical children. Mothers completed questionnaires on depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived decline in psychological well-being due to the pandemic, pandemic-related changes in caregiving responsibilities, and levels of social support. Over half of the mothers of children with autism and over one-third of the mothers of children with FXS reported clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety, with rates significantly higher than the control mothers. Though all mothers reported a surge in caregiving responsibilities, mothers of children with FXS experienced greater increases in caregiving responsibilities and social support was lower in both disability groups. Caregiving responsibilities and social support were associated with psychological well-being due to the pandemic across all groups. Findings highlight the harsh impact of the pandemic on the mental health of mothers of children with FXS and autism. The staggering rate of clinical depressive and anxiety symptoms reported by these groups underscores the urgent need for improved access to psychological services and family-centered supports, with increased caregiving responsibilities and inadequate social support representing important risk factors for mental health problems."

Female carriers of a premutation (PM; 55-200 CGG) can transmit the PM allele, which, depending on the CGG allele size, can expand to an allele in the FM range in the offspring. Carrier screening for FMR1 PM is not available in Thailand. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of PM carriers among Thai reproductive women at the tertiary hospital. A total of 1250 females participated in this study; ages ranged from 20 to 45 years, mean of 30 years (S.D. = 6.27). Two carriers of a premutation allele, with 32,62 and 32,69 CGG repeats respectively, were identified. This corresponds to 1 in 600 women or 0.17% of the population. Further, three women carrying a gray zone allele (45-54 CGG repeats) were identified (29,51; 29,49; and 30,47 CGG repeats) which equals to 1:400 women or 0.25% of the population. No FM case was detected. This study heightens the importance of PM carrier screening of women of reproductive age, particularly for the higher risk of developing fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). Early identification of PM carrier status enhances family planning and fecundity alternatives and improves reproductive health outcomes leading to a better life."

    "abstract": "Early-generated circuits are critical for the maturation of cortical network activity and the formation of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance. This process involves the maturation of specific populations of inhibitory neurons. While parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons have been associated with E/I impairments observed in neurodevelopmental disorders, somatostatin-expressing (SST) neurons have recently been shown to regulate PV neuron maturation by controlling neural dynamics in the developing cortex. SST neurons receive transient connections from the sensory thalamus, yet the implications of transient connectivity in neurodevelopmental disorders remain unknown. Here, we show that thalamocortical connectivity to SST neurons is persistent rather than transient in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome. We were able to restore the transient dynamics using chemogenetics, which led to the recovery of fragile X-associated dysfunctions in circuit maturation and sensory-dependent behavior. Overall, our findings unveil the role of early transient dynamics in controlling downstream maturation of sensory functions."

Of these, a GCC expansion in the promoter of AFF3 was associated with a 2.4-fold reduced probability of completing secondary education, an effect size comparable to several recurrent pathogenic microdeletions. In a cohort of 6,371 probands with neurodevelopmental problems of suspected genetic etiology, we observed a significant enrichment of AFF3 expansions compared with controls.

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) encompasses a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders with common behavioral symptoms including deficits in social interaction and ability for communication, enhanced restricted or repetitive behaviors, and also, in some cases, learning disability and motor deficit. Drosophila has served as an unparalleled model organism for modeling a great number of human diseases. As many genes have been implicated in ASD, fruit flies have emerged as a powerful and efficient way to test the genes putatively involved with the disorder. As hundreds of genes, with varied functional roles, are implicated in ASD, a single genetic fly model of ASD is unfeasible; instead, individual genetic mutants, gene knockdowns, or overexpression-based studies of the fly homologs of ASD-associated genes are the common means for gaining insight regarding molecular pathways underlying these gene products. A host of behavioral techniques are available in Drosophila which provide easy readout of deficits in specific behavioral components. Social space assay and aggression and courtship assays in flies have been shown to be useful in assessing defects in social interaction or communication. Grooming behavior in flies is an excellent readout of repetitive behavior. Habituation assay is used in flies to estimate the ability for habituation learning, which is found to be affected in some ASD patients. A combination of these behavioral paradigms can be utilized to make a thorough assessment of the human ASD-like disease state in flies. Using Fmr1 mutant flies, recapitulating Fragile-X syndrome in humans, and POGZ-homolog row knockdown in fly neurons, we have shown quantifiable deficits in social spacing, aggression, courtship behavior, grooming behavior, and habituation. These behavioral paradigms are demonstrated here in their simplest and straightforward forms with an assumption that it would facilitate their widespread use for research on ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders in fly models."

Analysis of brain neurotransmitter content revealed deficits in striatal GABA, glutamate, and serotonin content. RNA sequencing of the ventral striatum unveiled expression changes associated with neurotransmission as well as motivation and substance use pathways. Sex differences were identified in nest building behavior, striatal neurotransmitter content, and ventral striatal gene expression. In summary, our study identified sex differences in specific behavioral, neurotransmitter, and gene expression phenotypes and gene set enrichment analysis identified significant enrichment of pathways associated with motivation and drug reward."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a significant cause of intellectual disability and autism, while Fragile X Premutation -Associated Conditions (FXPAC) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality globally. This study assessed the level of knowledge and perceptions about FXS and FXPAC among doctors in Nigeria. It was a web-based, cross-sectional study conducted among a cohort of doctors in Nigeria. Socio-demographic profile, knowledge of FXS, perceptions about FXS, knowledge of FXPAC, experience of doctors, and suggested ways of improving knowledge and management of FXS were obtained. Data were analyzed using STATA 16.0. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests of association were used to determine the association between variables, with the significance level set at p < 0.05. A total of 274 doctors participated in the study. A significant proportion of respondents had limited knowledge about the clinical features of FXS. Nine of ten (90.0%) participants with good knowledge of FXS had good perceptions of FXS management. This was statistically significant (p < 0.001). There was a high nonresponse rate to what FXPAC is (164/274, 59.9%) among the respondents because of insufficient knowledge. Suboptimal knowledge of FXS which influenced perception was noted among doctors. More strategies should be considered to improve doctors' knowledge and management of FXS and FXPAC in Nigeria."

    "title": "Crosstalk between ubiquitination and translation in neurodevelopmental disorders.",
    "abstract": "Ubiquitination is one of the most conserved post-translational modifications and together with mRNA translation contributes to cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis). Temporal and spatial regulation of proteostasis is particularly important during synaptic plasticity, when translation of specific mRNAs requires tight regulation. Mutations in genes encoding regulators of mRNA translation and in ubiquitin ligases have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. RNA metabolism and translation are regulated by RNA-binding proteins, critical for the spatial and temporal control of translation in neurons. Several ubiquitin ligases also regulate RNA-dependent mechanisms in neurons, with numerous ubiquitination events described in splicing factors and ribosomal proteins. Here we will explore how ubiquitination regulates translation in neurons, from RNA biogenesis to alternative splicing and how dysregulation of ubiquitin signaling can be the underlying cause of pathology in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome. Finally we propose that targeting ubiquitin signaling is an attractive novel therapeutic strategy for neurodevelopmental disorders where mRNA translation and ubiquitin signaling are disrupted."

Surface-based modeling techniques were applied to the magnetic resonance imaging of 45 females with FXS (mean age = 10 years 9 months, range 6 years-16 years 4 months, SD = 2 years 9 months) and 33 age-matched and developmentally matched females without FXS to elucidate differences in cortical gray matter volume, surface area, and thickness. Gray matter volumes in subcortical regions were examined to ascertain differences in subcortical volume. In females with FXS, cortical volume was greater bilaterally in the occipital pole and smaller in the right postcentral gyrus. Seven regions demonstrated lower surface area in participants with FXS, while cortical thickness was significantly greater over the posterior and medial surfaces in the group with FXS. Subcortical region of interest analyses demonstrated greater volume in the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, and nucleus accumbens in the group with FXS. Global gray matter volume, pial thickness, and surface area were associated with behavioral outcomes in the group with FXS but not in the comparison group. Females with FXS demonstrated unique cortical and subcortical gray matter anatomy relative to a matched comparison group. These findings may be relevant to the pathogenesis of the FXS behavioral phenotype and provide insights into behavioral interventions targeted to this population."

    "abstract": "Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenetic cause of intellectual disability among children but remains without a cure. Using the Fmr1 KO mouse model of FXS, much work has been done to understand FXS hippocampus dysfunction. Purinergic signaling, where ATP and its metabolites are used as signaling molecules, participates in hippocampus development, but it is unknown if purinergic signaling is affected in the developing Fmr1 KO hippocampus. In our study, we characterized the purinergic receptor P2X7. We first found that P2X7 was reduced in Fmr1 KO whole hippocampus tissue at P14 and P21, corresponding to the periods of neurite outgrowth and synaptic refinement in the hippocampus. We then evaluated the cell-specific expression of P2X7 with immunofluorescence and found differences between WT and Fmr1 KO mice in P2X7 colocalization with hippocampal microglia and neurons. P2X7 colocalized more with microglia at P14 and P21, but there was a sex-specific reduction in P2X7 colocalization with neurons. In contrast, male mice at P14 and P21 showed reduced neuronal P2X7 colocalization compared to females, but only females showed reduced absolute neuronal P2X7 expression across the dorsal hippocampal formation. Together, our results suggest that P2X7 expression is altered during Fmr1-KO hippocampal development, potentially influencing several developmental processes in the Fmr1-KO hippocampus formation."

    "title": "Dysregulated Purinergic Signalling in Fragile X Syndrome Cortical Astrocytes.",
    "abstract": "The symptoms of fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by a single gene mutation to Fmr1, have been increasingly linked to disordered astrocyte signalling within the cerebral cortex. We have recently demonstrated that the purinergic signalling pathway, which utilizes nucleoside triphosphates and their metabolites to facilitate bidirectional glial and glial-neuronal interactions, is upregulated in cortical astrocytes derived from the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse model of FXS. Heightened Fmr1 KO P2Y purinergic receptor levels were correlated with prolonged intracellular calcium release, elevated synaptogenic protein secretion, and hyperactivity of developing circuits. However, due to the relative lack of sensitive and reproducible quantification methods available for measuring purines and pyrimidines, determining the abundance of these factors in Fmr1 KO astrocytes was limited. We therefore developed a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography protocol coupled with mass spectrometry to compare the abundance of intracellular and extracellular purinergic molecules between wildtype and Fmr1 KO mouse astrocytes. Significant differences in the concentrations of UDP, ATP, AMP, and adenosine intracellular stores were found within Fmr1 KO astrocytes relative to WT. The extracellular level of adenosine was also significantly elevated in Fmr1 KO astrocyte-conditioned media in comparison to media collected from WT astrocytes. Glycosylation of the astrocyte membrane-bound CD39 ectonucleotidase, which facilitates ligand breakdown following synaptic release, was also elevated in Fmr1 KO astrocyte cultures. Together, these differences demonstrated further dysregulation of the purinergic signalling system within Fmr1 KO cortical astrocytes, potentially leading to significant alterations in FXS purinergic receptor activation and cellular pathology."

FXS is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and the most common monogenetic cause of ASD. Previous literature has shown that electrophysiological activity measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) during resting state is perturbated in FXS and ASD. However, whether electrophysiological profiles of participants with FXS and ASD are similar remains unclear. The aim of this study was to compare EEG alterations found in these two clinical populations presenting varying degrees of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Resting state EEG signal complexity, alpha peak frequency (APF) and power spectral density (PSD) were compared between 47 participants with FXS (aged between 5-20), 49 participants with ASD (aged between 6-17), and 52 neurotypical (NT) controls with a similar age distribution using MANCOVAs with age as covariate when appropriate. MANCOVAs controlling for age, when appropriate, and nonverbal intelligence quotient (NVIQ) score were subsequently performed to determine the impact of cognitive functioning on EEG alterations. Our results showed that FXS participants manifested decreased signal complexity and APF compared to ASD participants and NT controls, as well as altered power in the theta, alpha and low gamma frequency bands. ASD participants showed exaggerated beta power compared to FXS participants and NT controls, as well as enhanced low and high gamma power compared to NT controls. However, ASD participants did not manifest altered signal complexity or APF. Furthermore, when controlling for NVIQ, results of decreased complexity in higher scales and lower APF in FXS participants compared to NT controls and ASD participants were not replicated. These findings suggest that signal complexity and APF might reflect cognitive functioning, while altered power in the low gamma frequency band might be associated with neurodevelopmental conditions, particularly FXS and ASD."

Understanding how best to assess the features of autism in individuals with these conditions is crucial. In this study, we consider the short-term and long-term psychometric consistency of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) calibrated comparison scores (CCSs) and ASD classifications in individuals with FXS or DS. 76 individuals with DS (39 males; M<sub>age</sub> = 15.27) and 90 individuals with FXS (71 males; M<sub>age</sub> = 14.52 years) completed an assessment battery (ADOS-2, abbreviated IQ assessment and semi-structured language sample) at three timepoints (initial visit, short-term stability visit, long-term stability visit). All CCSs were found to have short-and long-term consistency for both groups, with lowest reliability scores for the repetitive behaviors (RRB) CCSs. Decreased reliability of RRB CCSs was found in the DS group than the FXS group. Variable short- and long-term ASD classifications were observed in both groups, with significantly higher variability in the DS group. Across groups, participants with variable classifications had lower ADOS-2 CCSs and higher language scores than those with stable ASD classifications. In the FXS group, those with variable classifications earned higher cognitive scores than did participants with stable ASD classifications. These findings highlight the high incidence of autism symptomatology in individuals with DS or FXS and co-occurring intellectual disability, while elucidating the short- and long-term variability of symptom expression in the context of structured observational tasks such as the ADOS-2."

It is characterized by exacerbated neuronal excitability, and its correction is considered an objective measure of treatment response in animal models, a marker albeit rarely used in clinical trials. Here, we used an extensive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) battery to assess the neurophysiological effects of a therapy combining two disease-modifying drugs, lovastatin (40 mg) and minocycline (100 mg), administered alone for 8 weeks and in combination for 12 weeks, in 19 patients (mean age of 23.58 ± 1.51) with FXS taking part in the LOVAmix trial. The TMS battery, which included the resting motor threshold, short-interval intracortical inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition, corticospinal silent period, and intracortical facilitation, was completed at baseline after 8 weeks of monotherapy (visit 2 of the clinical trial) and after 12 weeks of dual therapy (visit 4 of the clinical trial). Repeated measure ANOVAs were performed between baseline and visit 2 (monotherapy) and visit 3 (dual therapy) with interactions for which monotherapy the participants received when they began the clinical trial. Results showed that dual therapy was associated with reduced cortical excitability after 20 weeks. This was reflected by a significant increase in the resting-motor threshold after dual therapy compared to baseline. There was a tendency for enhanced short-intracortical inhibition, a marker of GABAa-mediated inhibition after 8 weeks of monotherapy compared to baseline. Together, these results suggest that a combined therapy of minocycline and lovastatin might act on the core neurophysiopathology of FXS. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02680379)."

Despite the pervasive physical and cognitive effects of FXTAS, no studies have examined language in symptomatic males and females, limiting utility as an outcome measure in clinical trials of FXTAS. The goal of this work is to determine (a) the extent to which male and female FMR1 premutation carriers with FXTAS symptoms differ in their language use and (b) whether language production predicts FXTAS symptoms. Thirty-one individuals with the FMR1 premutation (21M, 10F), ages 58-85 years with some symptoms of FXTAS, were recruited from a larger cross-sectional study. Participants completed a five-minute monologic language sample. Language transcripts were assessed for rate of dysfluencies, lexical-semantics, syntax, and speech rate. Multivariable linear and ordinal regressions were used to predict FXTAS-associated symptoms, cognitive functioning, and executive functioning. Males and females did not differ in their language use. Language production predicted FXTAS symptom severity, cognitive functioning, and executive functioning. Language production difficulties may co-occur with FXTAS-associated symptoms and may be a viable outcome measure in future clinical trials, with future research needed."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by several behavioral abnormalities, including hyperactivity, anxiety, sensory hyper-responsiveness, and autistic-like symptoms such as social deficits. Despite considerable efforts, effective pharmacological treatments are still lacking, prompting the need for exploring the therapeutic value of existing drugs beyond their original approved use. One such repurposed drug is chlorzoxazone which is classified as a large-conductance calcium-dependent potassium (BKCa) channel opener. Reduced BKCa channel functionality has been reported in FXS patients, suggesting that molecules activating these channels could serve as promising treatments for this syndrome. Here, we sought to characterize the therapeutic potential of chlorzoxazone using the Fmr1-KO mouse model of FXS which recapitulates the main phenotypes of FXS, including BKCa channel alterations. Chlorzoxazone, administered either acutely or chronically, rescued hyperactivity and acoustic hyper-responsiveness as well as impaired social interactions exhibited by Fmr1-KO mice. Chlorzoxazone was more efficacious in alleviating these phenotypes than gaboxadol and metformin, two repurposed treatments for FXS that do not target BKCa channels. Systemic administration of chlorzoxazone modulated the neuronal activity-dependent gene c-fos in selected brain areas of Fmr1-KO mice, corrected aberrant hippocampal dendritic spines, and was able to rescue impaired BKCa currents recorded from hippocampal and cortical neurons of these mutants. Collectively, these findings provide further preclinical support for BKCa channels as a valuable therapeutic target for treating FXS and encourage the repurposing of chlorzoxazone for clinical applications in FXS and other related neurodevelopmental diseases."

    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) encompass a range of conditions marked by abnormal brain development in conjunction with impaired cognitive, emotional and behavioural functions. Transgenic animal models, mainly rodents, traditionally served as key tools for deciphering the molecular mechanisms driving NDD physiopathology and significantly contributed to the development of pharmacological interventions aimed at treating these disorders. However, the efficacy of these treatments in humans has proven to be limited, due in part to the intrinsic constraint of animal models to recapitulate the complex development and structure of the human brain but also to the phenotypic heterogeneity found between affected individuals. Significant advancements in the field of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a promising avenue for overcoming these challenges. Indeed, the development of advanced differentiation protocols for generating iPSC-derived brain organoids gives an unprecedented opportunity to explore human neurodevelopment. This review provides an overview of how 3D brain organoids have been used to investigate various NDD (i.e. Fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, Angelman syndrome, microlissencephaly, Prader-Willi syndrome, Timothy syndrome, tuberous sclerosis syndrome) and elucidate their pathophysiology. We also discuss the benefits and limitations of employing such innovative 3D models compared to animal models and 2D cell culture systems in the realm of personalized medicine."

    "title": "Epigenetic insights into Fragile X Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder closely associated with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. The core of the disease lies in the abnormal expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat sequence at the 5'end of the FMR1 gene. When the repetition exceeds 200 times, it causes the silencing of the FMR1 gene, leading to the absence of the encoded Fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMRP). Although the detailed mechanism by which the CGG repeat expansion triggers gene silencing is yet to be fully elucidated, it is known that this process does not alter the promoter region or the coding sequence of the FMR1 gene. This discovery provides a scientific basis for the potential reversal of FMR1 gene silencing through interventional approaches, thereby improving the symptoms of FXS. Epigenetics, a mechanism of genetic regulation that does not depend on changes in the DNA sequence, has become a new focus in FXS research by modulating gene expression in a reversible manner. The latest progress in molecular genetics has revealed that epigenetics plays a key role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiological processes of FXS. This article compiles the existing research findings on the role of epigenetics in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) with the aim of deepening the understanding of the pathogenesis of FXS to identify potential targets for new therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FX) is the most prevalent inheritable form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), characterized by hypersensitivity, difficulty in habituating to new sensory stimuli, and intellectual disability. Individuals with FX often experience visual perception and learning deficits. Visual experience leads to the emergence of the familiarity-evoked theta band oscillations in the primary visual cortex (V1) and the lateromedial area (LM) of mice. These theta oscillations in V1 and LM are synchronized with each other, providing a mechanism of sensory multi-areal binding. However, how this multi-areal binding and the corresponding theta oscillations are altered in FX is not known. Using iDISCO whole brain clearing with light-sheet microscopy, we quantified immediate early gene Fos expression in V1 and LM, identifying deficits in experience-dependent neural activity in FX mice. We performed simultaneous in vivo recordings with silicon probes in V1 and LM of awake mice and channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM) in acute brain slices to examine the neural activity and strength of long-range synaptic connections between V1 and LM in both wildtype (WT) and Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, the model of FX, before and after visual experience. Our findings reveal synchronized familiarity-evoked theta oscillations in V1 and LM, the increased strength of V1→LM functional and synaptic connections, which correlated with the corresponding changes of presynaptic short-term plasticity in WT mice. The LM oscillations were attenuated in FX mice and correlated with impaired functional and synaptic connectivity and short-term plasticity in the feedforward (FF) V1→LM and feedback (FB) LM→V1 pathways. Finally, using 4Pi single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) in thick brain tissue, we identified experience-dependent changes in the density and shape of dendritic spines in layer 5 pyramidal cells of WT mice, which correlated with the functional synaptic measurements. Interestingly, there was an increased dendritic spine density and length in naïve FX mice that failed to respond to experience. Our study provides the first comprehensive characterization of the role of visual experience in triggering inter-areal neural synchrony and shaping synaptic connectivity in WT and FX mice."

Our study investigates the potential therapeutic role of serotonin receptor 1A (5-HT1A) in FXS. Using the <i>Drosophila</i> model of FXS, we demonstrated that treatment with eltoprazine, a 5-HT1A agonist, can ameliorate synaptic transmission, correct mitochondrial deficits, and ultimately improve motor behavior. While these findings suggest that the 5-HT1A-mitochondrial axis may be a promising therapeutic target, further investigation is needed in the context of FXS."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). FMRP is an evolutionarily conserved and neuronally enriched RNA-binding protein (RBP) with functions in RNA editing, RNA transport, and protein translation. Specific target RNAs play critical roles in neurodevelopment, including the regulation of neurite morphogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function. The different biological functions of FMRP are modulated by its cooperative interaction with distinct sets of neuronal RNA and protein-binding partners. Here, we focus on interactions between FMRP and components of the microRNA (miRNA) pathway. Using the <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cell model system, we show that the <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog of FMRP (dFMRP) can repress translation when directly tethered to a reporter mRNA. This repression requires the activity of AGO1, GW182, and MOV10/Armitage, conserved proteins associated with the miRNA-containing RNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). Additionally, we find that untagged dFMRP can interact with a short stem-loop sequence in the translational reporter, a prerequisite for repression by exogenous miR-958. Finally, we demonstrate that dFmr1 interacts genetically with GW182 to control neurite morphogenesis. These data suggest that dFMRP may recruit the miRISC to nearby miRNA binding sites and repress translation via its cooperative interactions with evolutionarily conserved components of the miRNA pathway."

Electrophysiologic studies of synaptic plasticity, models for learning and memory, are disrupted in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). FXS is characterized by the loss of FMRP, an RNA-binding protein (RBP) known to suppress translation of specific neuronal RNAs. Synaptic plasticity in CA1 excitatory hippocampal neurons is protein-synthesis dependent, suggesting a role for FMRP in FXS-related synaptic deficits. To explore this model, we developed Opto-CLIP, integrating optogenetics with cell-type specific FMRP-CLIP and RiboTag in CA1 neurons, allowing investigation of activity-induced FMRP regulation. We tracked changes in FMRP binding and ribosome-associated RNA profiles 30 minutes after neuronal activation. Our findings reveal distinct temporal dynamics for FMRP transcript regulation in the cell body versus the synapse. In the cell body, FMRP binding to transcripts encoding nuclear functions is relieved, potentially allowing rapid transcriptional responses to neuronal activation. At the synapse, FMRP binding to transcripts encoding synaptic targets was relatively stable, with variability in translational control across target categories. These results offer fresh insights into the dynamic regulation of RNA by FMRP in response to neuronal activation and provide a foundation for future research into the mechanisms of RBP-mediated synaptic plasticity."

    "abstract": "STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase (STEP) is a brain-specific tyrosine phosphatase that is associated with numerous neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. STEP dephosphorylates and inactivates various kinases and phosphatases critical for neuronal function and health including Fyn, Pyk2, ERK1/2, p38, and PTPα. Importantly, STEP dephosphorylates NMDA and AMPA receptors, two major glutamate receptors that mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission. This STEP-mediated dephosphorylation leads to their internalization and inhibits both Hebbian synaptic potentiation and homeostatic synaptic scaling. Hence, STEP has been widely accepted to weaken excitatory synaptic strength. However, emerging evidence implicates a novel role of STEP in neuronal hyperexcitability and seizure disorders. Genetic deletion and pharmacological blockade of STEP reduces seizure susceptibility in acute seizure mouse models and audiogenic seizures in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome. Pharmacologic inhibition of STEP also decreases hippocampal activity and neuronal intrinsic excitability. Here, we will highlight the divergent roles of STEP in excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal intrinsic excitability, present the potential underlying mechanisms, and discuss their impact on STEP-associated neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders."

    "abstract": "Self-determination refers to setting goals and making decisions regarding one's own life with support from others as needed. Research on people with intellectual and developmental disabilities has established the importance of self-determination for quality of life outcomes, such as increased independence and life satisfaction. However, self-determination has not been characterised specifically in fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading inherited cause of intellectual disability. Relative to youth with other forms of intellectual and developmental disabilities, youth with FXS may face exceptional barriers to the development of self-determined behaviour. In addition to intellectual disability, the FXS behavioural profile is characterised by high rates of autism and anxiety that may further limit opportunities for youth with FXS. The heritable nature of the condition can also yield a distinctive family environment, with siblings and parents also living with fragile X or its associated conditions. Considering these unique challenges, the present study examined self-determination in young adult males and females with FXS and explored whether factors such as language skills, adaptive behaviour and autism traits were associated with self-determination capacity and opportunities. The present study included 9 females and 36 males with FXS between the ages of 17 and 25 years. Caregivers (mothers or fathers) completed the American Institute for Research Self-Determination Assessment, which is a questionnaire that yields three scores: self-determination capacity, opportunities for self-determination at home and opportunities for self-determination at school. Caregivers endorsed a wide range of self-determination capacity and opportunities, with ratings for opportunities at home and school exceeding ratings of capacity. Better adaptive behaviour skills were associated with more self-determination capacity, and the presence of more autism traits was associated with fewer opportunities at school. Results from this study contribute to our understanding of avenues to best support young adults with FXS as they transition to adulthood. Our findings also have implications for practice, such that interventions targeting adaptive behaviours and self-determination may be an effective approach for promoting autonomy and independence for young adults with FXS.

    "abstract": "In this study, the potential role and interaction of the <i>APOε</i> and <i>KLOTHO</i> genes on the penetrance of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and on the IQ trajectory were investigated. FXTAS was diagnosed based on molecular, clinical and radiological criteria. Males with the premutation (PM) over 50 years, 165 with and 34 without an FXTAS diagnosis, were included in this study and were compared based on their <i>APO</i> (<i>ε2-ε3-ε4</i>) and <i>KLOTHO</i> variant (<i>KL-VS</i>) genotypes. The effect of <i>APOε4</i> on FXTAS stage and on diagnosis did not differ significantly by KL-VS genotype with interaction effect <i>p</i> = 0.662 and <i>p</i> = 0.91, respectively. In the FXTAS individuals with an <i>APOε2</i> allele, a marginal significance was observed towards a larger decline in verbal IQ (VIQ) in individuals with an <i>APOε4</i> allele compared to those without an <i>APOε4</i> allele (<i>p</i> = 0.071). In conclusion, our findings suggest that the <i>APOε4</i> and <i>KL-VS</i> genotypes alone or through their interaction effect do not appear to predispose to either FXTAS diagnosis or stage in male carriers of the PM allele. A further study is needed to establish the trend of IQ decline in the FXTAS individuals who carry <i>APOε4</i> with <i>APOε2</i> compared to those without <i>APOε4</i>."

Cross-sectional data from 100 participants (62 men, 38 women; mean±SD age=67.11±7.90 years) with FXTAS stage 1, 2, or 3 were analyzed, including demographic information, cognitive measures, psychiatric assessments (Symptom Checklist-90-Revised and Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale-II [BDS-II]), and CGG repeat number. Participants with FXTAS stage 3 exhibited significantly worse psychiatric outcomes compared with participants with either stage 1 or 2, with distinct gender-related differences. Men showed differences in anxiety and hostility between stage 3 and combined stages 1 and 2, whereas women exhibited differences in anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and somatization, as well as in the Global Severity Index, the Positive Symptom Distress Index, and the Positive Symptom Total. Among male participants, negative correlations were observed between BDS-II total scores and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, as well as between anxiety and CGG repeat number. These findings suggest that even at early FXTAS stages, patients have significant cognitive and other psychiatric symptoms, with notable gender-specific differences. This study underscores the clinical and prognostic relevance of comorbid psychiatric conditions in FXTAS, highlighting the need for early intervention and targeted support for individuals with relatively mild motor deficits."

    "abstract": "Brain development may be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, with potential consequences that may last through the lifespan. Alterations during neurogenesis are linked to neurodevelopmental cognitive disorders. Many neurotransmitters and their systems play a vital role in brain development, as most are present prior to synaptogenesis, and they are involved in the aetiology of many neurodevelopmental disorders. For instance, dopamine (DA) receptor expression begins at the early stages of development and matures at adolescence. The long maturation period suggests how important it is for the stabilisation and integration of neural circuits. DA and dopaminergic (DAergic) system perturbations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. The DAergic system controls key cognitive and behavioural skills including emotional and motivated behaviour through DA as a neurotransmitter and through the DA neuron projections to major parts of the brain. In this review, we summarise the current understanding of the DAergic system's influence on neurodevelopment and its involvement in the aetiology and progression of major disorders of the developing brain including autism, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, down syndrome, and fragile X syndrome."

    "abstract": "It is currently not known whether mRNAs fulfill structural roles in the cytoplasm. Here, we report the fragile X-related protein 1 (FXR1) network, an mRNA-protein (mRNP) network present throughout the cytoplasm, formed by FXR1-mediated packaging of exceptionally long mRNAs. These mRNAs serve as an underlying condensate scaffold and concentrate FXR1 molecules. The FXR1 network contains multiple protein binding sites and functions as a signaling scaffold for interacting proteins. We show that it is necessary for RhoA signaling-induced actomyosin reorganization to provide spatial proximity between kinases and their substrates. Point mutations in FXR1, found in its homolog FMR1, where they cause fragile X syndrome, disrupt the network. FXR1 network disruption prevents actomyosin remodeling-an essential and ubiquitous process for the regulation of cell shape, migration, and synaptic function. Our findings uncover a structural role for cytoplasmic mRNA and show how the FXR1 RNA-binding protein as part of the FXR1 network acts as an organizer of signaling reactions."

Videotaped interactions of 47 dyads interacting with an iPad game, completing a puzzle, and making a snack and were coded for challenging behaviors by adolescents with FXS, and maternal behaviors that preceded these behaviors. We described the frequencies of adolescent challenging behaviors, then used sequential and survival analyses to identify maternal and adolescent behaviors that preceded self-injurious behavior (SIB) and aggression. Across all the dyads, 109 instances of SIB and 79 instances of aggression were identified during the 30 min of recorded interaction. Most of these challenging behaviors occurred during the iPad activity. The sequential analysis indicated that maternal requests for behavioral compliance frequently preceded both SIB and aggression. Survival analyses revealed that the likelihood of SIB or aggression was increased if the mothers requested behavioral compliance after the child engaged in another challenging behavior. Challenging behaviors including SIB and aggression were frequently observed in many participants. The sequential and survival analyses were useful for identifying precursors to these behaviors. Further research is needed to investigate preventative strategies based on the results of sequential and survival analyses."

In humans, males have been shown to have larger brain volumes than females with development of the hippocampus and amygdala showing prominent sex differences. Mechanistically, sex steroids and sex chromosomes drive these differences in brain development, which seem to peak during prenatal and pubertal stages. Animal models have played a crucial role in understanding sex differences, but the study of human sex differences requires an experimental model that can recapitulate complex genetic traits. To fill this gap, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids are now being used to study how complex genetic traits influence prenatal brain development. For example, brain organoids from individuals with autism and individuals with X chromosome-linked Rett syndrome and fragile X syndrome have revealed prenatal differences in cell proliferation, a measure of brain volume differences, and excitatory-inhibitory imbalances. Brain organoids have also revealed increased neurogenesis of excitatory neurons due to androgens. However, despite growing interest in using brain organoids, several key challenges remain that affect its validity as a model system. In this review, we discuss how sex steroids and the sex chromosomes each contribute to sex differences in brain development. Then, we examine the role of X chromosome inactivation as a factor that drives sex differences. Finally, we discuss the combined challenges of modeling X chromosome inactivation and limitations of brain organoids that need to be taken into consideration when studying sex differences."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of human intellectual disability, is a monogenic neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a loss-of-function mutation of the FMR1 gene. FMR1 is encoding the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleo Protein (FMRP) an RNA-binding protein that regulates the translation of synaptic proteins. The absence of FMRP expression has many important consequences on synaptic plasticity and function, leading to the FXS clinical phenotype. Over the last decade, a visual neurosensorial phenotype had been described in the FXS patients as well as in the murine model (Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup>mice), characterized by retinal deficits associated to retinal perception alterations. However, although the transcriptomic profile in the absence of FMRP has been studied in the cerebral part of the central nervous system (CNS), there are no actual data for the retina which is an extension of the CNS. Herein, we investigate the transcriptomic profile of mRNA from whole retinas of Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup>mice. Interestingly, we found a specific signature of Fmrp absence on retinal mRNA expression with few common genes compared to other brain studies. Gene Ontology on these retinal specific genes demonstrated an enrichment in retinal development genes as well as in synaptic genes. These alterations could be linked to the reported retinal phenotype of the FXS condition. In conclusion, we describe for the first time, retinal-specific transcriptomic changes in the absence of FMRP."

FXS is characterized by substantial alterations in social behavior, encompassing social withdrawal, avoidance of eye contact, heightened social anxiety, increased arousal levels, language deficits, and challenges in regulating emotions. Conventional behavioral assessments primarily focus on short-term interactions within controlled settings. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive examination of the adaptive group behavior of Fmr1 KO male mice over a three-day period, without introducing experimental interventions or task-based evaluations. The data unveiled intricate behavioral anomalies, with the most significant changes manifesting during the initial adaptation to unfamiliar environments. Notably, certain behaviors exhibited a gradual return to typical patterns over time. This dynamic Fmr1 KO phenotype exhibited heightened activity, featuring increased exploration, amplified social interest, and an unconventional approach to social interactions characterized by a higher frequency of shorter engagements. These findings contribute to the growing understanding of social behavior in individuals with FXS and underscore the significance of comprehending their adaptive responses in various environmental contexts."

This methodology provides more sensitive results, which could be crucial for all further research in this model of fruit flies. The study revealed that <i>dFMR1<sup>B55</sup></i> male mutants sleep more and can be considered weak rhythmic flies rather than totally arrhythmic and present a good alternative animal model of genetic disorder, which includes impairment of CR and sleep behavior.

In this study, we look for DNA methylation patterns in blood samples and its association with the brain methylation pattern in neurodegenerative disorders. Using data from methylation databases, we selected 18,293 CpGs presenting correlated methylation levels between blood and brain (bb-CpGs) and compare their methylation level between blood samples from patients with neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and X Fragile Syndrome) and healthy controls. Sixty-four bb-CpGs presented significant distinct methylation levels in patients, being: nine for Alzheimer's disease, nine for Parkinson's disease, 28 for Multiple Sclerosis, and 18 for Fragile X Syndrome. Similar differences in methylation pattern for the nine Alzheimer's bb-CpGs was also observed when comparing brain tissue from patients vs. controls. The genomic regions of some of these 64 bb-CpGs are placed close to or inside genes previously associated with the respective condition. Our findings support the rationale of using blood DNA as a surrogate of brain tissue to analyze changes in CpG methylation level in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, opening the possibility for characterizing new biomarkers."

Animal models of intellectual disability, in particular of monogenic intellectual disability syndromes (MIDS), recapitulate many disease phenotypes and have been invaluable for linking some of these phenotypes to specific molecular pathways. An emerging feature of MIDS, in both animal models and humans, is the prevalence of metabolic abnormalities, which could be relevant for behavior. Focusing on specific MIDS that have been molecularly characterized, we review sleep, circadian, and metabolic phenotypes in animal models and humans and propose that altered metabolic state contributes to the abnormal sleep/circadian phenotypes in MIDS."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome is the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. Female premutation carriers exhibit no obvious symptoms during reproductive age, but the premutation allele can expand to full mutation when transmitted to the fetus. Given the relatively low prevalence but large population, the distinct health care system, the middle-income economic status, and low awareness among public and medical professionals, the optimal genetic screening strategy remains unknown. We conducted a pilot study of Fragile X carrier screening in China, involving 22,245 pregnant women and women with childbearing intentions, divided into control and pilot groups. The prevalence of Fragile X carriers in the control group was 1 of 850, similar to East Asian populations. Strikingly, the prevalence of Fragile X carriers in the pilot group was 1 of 356, which can be attributed to extensive medical training, participant education, and rigorous genetic counseling and testing protocols. Cost-effectiveness analyses of four strategies-no screening, population-based screening, targeted screening, and our pilot screening-indicated that our pilot screening was the most cost-effective option. A follow-up survey revealed that 55% of respondents reported undergoing screening because of their family history. We have successfully established a standardized system, addressing the challenges of low prevalence, limited awareness, and genetic testing complexities. Our study provides practical recommendations for implementing Fragile X carrier screening in China."

Deficiencies in the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein, encoded by the <i>FMR1</i> gene, lead to various anatomical and pathophysiological abnormalities and behavioral deficits, such as spine dysmorphogenesis and learning and memory impairments. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play crucial roles in synapse formation and neural signal transmission by promoting the formation of new synaptic contacts, accurately organizing presynaptic and postsynaptic protein complexes, and ensuring the accuracy of signal transmission. Recent studies have implicated synaptic CAMs such as the immunoglobulin superfamily, N-cadherin, leucine-rich repeat proteins, and neuroligin-1 in the pathogenesis of FXS and found that they contribute to defects in dendritic spines and synaptic plasticity in FXS animal models. This review systematically summarizes the biological associations between nine representative synaptic CAMs and FMRP, as well as the functional consequences of the interaction, to provide new insights into the mechanisms of abnormal synaptic development in FXS."

How and why sounds are perceived as overwhelming by affected people is unknown. To process sound information properly, the brain requires high activity and fast processing, as seen in areas like the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) of the auditory brainstem. Recent work has shown dysfunction in mitochondria, which are the primary source of energy in cells, in a genetic model of ASD, Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Whether mitochondrial functions are also altered in sound-processing neurons, has not been characterized yet. To address this question, we imaged the MNTB in a mouse model of FXS. We stained MNTB brain slices from wild-type and FXS mice with two mitochondrial markers, TOMM20 and PMPCB, located on the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane and in the matrix, respectively. These markers allow exploration of mitochondrial subcompartments. Our integrated imaging pipeline reveals significant sex-specific differences between genotypes. Colocalization analyses between TOMM20 and PMPCB reveal that the integrity of mitochondrial subcompartments is most disrupted in female FXS mice compared to female wildtype mice. We highlight a quantitative fluorescence microscopy pipeline to monitor mitochondrial functions in the MNTB from control or FXS mice and provide four complementary readouts. Our approach paves the way to understanding how cellular mechanisms important to sound encoding are altered in ASDs."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an intellectual developmental disorder characterized, inter alia, by deficits in the short-term processing of neural information, such as sensory processing and working memory. The primary cause of FXS is the loss of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), which is profoundly involved in synaptic function and plasticity. Short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) may play important roles in functions that are affected by FXS. Recent evidence points to the crucial involvement of the presynaptic calcium sensor synaptotagmin-7 (Syt-7) in STSP. However, how the loss of FMRP affects STSP and Syt-7 have been insufficiently studied. Furthermore, males and females are affected differently by FXS, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate possible changes in STSP and the expression of Syt-7 in the dorsal (DH) and ventral (VH) hippocampus of adult males and females in a <i>Fmr1</i>-knockout (KO) rat model of FXS. We found that the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) and frequency facilitation/depression (FF/D), two forms of STSP, as well as the expression of Syt-7, are normal in adult KO males, but the PPR is increased in the ventral hippocampus of KO females (6.4 ± 3.7 vs. 18.3 ± 4.2 at 25 ms in wild type (WT) and KO, respectively). Furthermore, we found no gender-related differences, but did find robust region-dependent difference in the STSP (e.g., the PPR at 50 ms: 50.0 ± 5.5 vs. 17.6 ± 2.9 in DH and VH of WT male rats; 53.1 ± 3.6 vs. 19.3 ± 4.6 in DH and VH of WT female rats; 48.1 ± 2.3 vs. 19.1 ± 3.3 in DH and VH of KO male rats; and 51.2 ± 3.3 vs. 24.7 ± 4.3 in DH and VH of KO female rats). AMPA receptors are similarly expressed in the two hippocampal segments of the two genotypes and in both genders. Also, basal excitatory synaptic transmission is higher in males compared to females. Interestingly, we found more than a twofold higher level of Syt-7, not synaptotagmin-1, in the dorsal compared to the ventral hippocampus in the males of both genotypes (0.43 ± 0.1 vs. 0.16 ± 0.02 in DH and VH of WT male rats, and 0.6 ± 0.13 vs. 0.23 ± 0.04 in DH and VH of KO male rats) and in the WT females (0.97 ± 0.23 vs. 0.31 ± 0.09 in DH and VH). These results point to the susceptibility of the female ventral hippocampus to FMRP loss. Importantly, the different levels of Syt-7, which parallel the higher score of the dorsal vs. ventral hippocampus on synaptic facilitation, suggest that Syt-7 may play a pivotal role in defining the striking differences in STSP along the long axis of the hippocampus."

Espansion between 55 and 200 triplets fall within the premutation range (PM) and can lead to different clinical conditions, including fragile X- primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (FXAND) and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Although there is not a current cure for FXS and for the Fragile X-PM associated conditions (FXPAC), timely diagnosis as well as the implementation of treatment strategies, psychoeducation and behavioral intervention may improve the quality of life (QoL) of people with FXS or FXPAC. With the aim to investigate the main areas of concerns and the priorities of treatment in these populations, the Italian National Fragile X Association in collaboration with Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, conducted a survey among Italian participants. Here, we present a survey based on the previous study that Weber and colleagues conducted in 2019 and that aimed to investigate the main symptoms and challenges in American individuals with FXS. The survey has been translated into Italian language to explore FXS needs of treatment also among Italian individuals affected by FXS, family members, caretakers, and professionals. Furthermore, we added a section designated only to people with PM, to investigate the main symptoms, daily living challenges and treatment priorities. Anxiety, challenging behaviors, language difficulties and learning disabilities were considered the major areas of concern in FXS, while PM was reported as strongly associated to cognitive problems, social anxiety, and overthinking. Anxiety was reported as a treatment priority in both FXS and PM. FXS and PM can be associated with a range of cognitive, affective, and physical health complications. Taking a patient-first perspective may help clinicians to better characterize the cognitive-behavioral phenotype associated to these conditions, and eventually to implement tailored therapeutic approaches."

In particular, PDE4D has been associated with Alzheimer's disease and the intellectual disability seen in fragile X syndrome. Furthermore, single point mutations in critical PDE4D regions cause acrodysostosis type 2(ACRDYS2, also referred to as inactivating PTH/PTHrP signalling disorder 5 or iPPSD5), where intellectual disability is seen in ∼90% of patients alongside the skeletal dysmorphologies that are characteristic of acrodysostosis type 1 (ACRDYS1/iPPSD4) and ACRDYS2. Two contrasting mechanisms have been proposed to explain how mutations in PDE4D cause iPPSD5. The first mechanism, the 'over-activation hypothesis', suggests that cAMP/PKA (cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A) signalling is reduced by the overactivity of mutant PDE4D, whilst the second, the 'over-compensation hypothesis' suggests that mutations reduce PDE4D activity. That reduction in activity is proposed to cause an increase in cellular cAMP, triggering the overexpression of other PDE isoforms. The resulting over-compensation then reduces cellular cAMP and the levels of cAMP/PKA signalling. However, neither of these proposed mechanisms accounts for the fine control of PDE activation and localization, which are likely to play a role in the development of iPPSD5. This review will draw together our understanding of the role of PDE4D in iPPSD5 and present a novel perspective on possible mechanisms of disease."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a monogenic neurodevelopmental disorder with manifestations spanning molecular, neuroanatomical, and behavioral changes. Astrocytes contribute to FXS pathogenesis and show hundreds of dysregulated genes and proteins; targeting upstream pathways mediating astrocyte changes in FXS could therefore be a point of intervention. To address this, we focused on the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway, which is upregulated in FXS astrocytes. We generated a conditional KO (cKO) of Smad4 in astrocytes to suppress BMP signaling, and found this lessens audiogenic seizure severity in FXS mice. To ask how this occurs on a molecular level, we performed <i>in vivo</i> transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of cortical astrocytes, finding upregulation of metabolic pathways, and downregulation of secretory machinery and secreted proteins in FXS astrocytes, with these alterations no longer present when BMP signaling is suppressed. Functionally, astrocyte Smad4 cKO restores deficits in inhibitory synapses present in FXS auditory cortex. Thus, astrocytes contribute to FXS molecular and functional phenotypes, and targeting astrocytes can mitigate FXS symptoms."

However, the sequence of events through which a presynapse acquires functionality is relatively poorly understood, which is surprising, since mutations in genes essential for its operation are heavily implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. We addressed this gap in knowledge by determining the developmental trajectory of synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling pathways in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. Exploiting a series of optical and morphological assays, we revealed that the majority of nerve terminals displayed activity-dependent calcium influx from 3 days in vitro (DIV), immediately followed by functional evoked exocytosis and endocytosis, although the number of responsive nerve terminals continued to increase until the second week in vitro. However, the most intriguing discovery was that activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) was only observed from DIV 14 onwards. Importantly, optimal ADBE recruitment was delayed until DIV 21 in Fmr1 knockout neurons, which model Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). This implicates the delayed recruitment of ADBE as a potential contributing factor in the development of circuit dysfunction in FXS, and potentially other neurodevelopmental disorders."

    "abstract": "To investigate the epidemiological characteristics and mutation spectrum of monogenic diseases in Chinese population through a large-scale, multicenter carrier screening. This study was conducted among a total of 33 104 participants (16 610 females) from 12 clinical centers across China.Carrier status for 223 genes was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing and different PCR methods. The overall combined carrier frequency was 55.58% for 197 autosomal genes and 1.84% for 26 X-linked genes in these participants.Among the 16 669 families, 874 at-risk couples (5.24%) were identified.Specifically, 584 couples (3.50%) were at risk for autosomal genes, 306(1.84%) for X-linked genes, and 16 for both autosomal and X-linked genes.The most frequently detected autosomal at-risk genes included GJB2(autosomal recessive deafness type 1A, 393 couples), HBA1/HBA2(α-thalassemia, 36 couples), PAH (phenylketonuria, 14 couples), and SMN1(spinal muscular atrophy, 14 couples).The most frequently detected X-linked at-risk genes were G6PD (G6PD deficiency, 236 couples), DMD (Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 23 couples), and FMR1(fragile X syndrome, 17 couples).After excluding GJB2 c.109G>A, the detection rate of at-risk couples was 3.91%(651/16 669), which was lowered to 1.72%(287/16 669) after further excluding G6PD.The theoretical incidence rate of severe monogenic birth defects was approximately 4.35‰(72.5/16 669).Screening for a battery of the top 22 most frequent genes in the at-risk couples could detect over 95% of at-risk couples, while screening for the top 54 genes further increased the detection rate to over 99%. This study reveals the carrier frequencies of 223 monogenic genetic disorders in the Chinese population and provides evidence for carrier screening strategy development and panel design tailored to the Chinese population.In carrier testing, genetic counseling for specific genes or gene variants can be challenging, and the couples need to be informed of these difficulties before testing and provided with options for not screening these genes or gene variants."

    "title": "Kv7/M channel dysfunction produces hyperexcitability in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells of Fmr1 knockout mice.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most frequent monogenic form of intellectual disability, is caused by transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene that could render neuronal hyperexcitability. Here we show that pyramidal cells (PCs) in the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus elicited a larger action potential (AP) number in response to suprathreshold stimulation in juvenile Fmr1 knockout (KO) than wild-type (WT) mice. Because Kv7/M channels modulate CA1 PC excitability in rats, we investigated if their dysfunction produces neuronal hyperexcitability in Fmr1 KO mice. Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses showed no differences in the expression of Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 channel subunits between genotypes; however, the current mediated by Kv7/M channels was reduced in Fmr1 KO mice. In both genotypes, bath application of XE991 (10 μM), a blocker of Kv7/M channels: produced an increased AP number, produced an increased input resistance, produced a decreased AP voltage threshold and shaped AP medium afterhyperpolarization by increasing mean velocities. Retigabine (10 μM), an opener of Kv7/M channels, produced opposite effects to XE991. Both XE991 and retigabine abolished differences in all these parameters found in control conditions between genotypes. Furthermore, a low concentration of retigabine (2.5 μM) normalized CA1 PC excitability of Fmr1 KO mice. Finally, ex vivo seizure-like events evoked by 4-aminopyiridine (200 μM) in the dorsal CA1 region were more frequent in Fmr1 KO mice, and were abolished by retigabine (5-10 μM). We conclude that CA1 PCs of Fmr1 KO mice exhibit hyperexcitability, caused by Kv7/M channel dysfunction, and increased epileptiform activity, which were abolished by retigabine. KEY POINTS: Dorsal pyramidal cells of the hippocampal CA1 region of Fmr1 knockout mice exhibit hyperexcitability. Kv7/M channel activity, but not expression, is reduced in pyramidal cells of the hippocampal CA1 region of Fmr1 knockout mice. Kv7/M channel dysfunction causes hyperexcitability in pyramidal cells of the hippocampal CA1 region of Fmr1 knockout mice by increasing input resistance, decreasing AP voltage threshold and shaping medium afterhyperpolarization. A Kv7/M channel opener normalizes neuronal excitability in pyramidal cells of the hippocampal CA1 region of Fmr1 knockout mice. Ex vivo seizure-like events evoked in the dorsal CA1 region were more frequent in Fmr1 KO mice, and such an epileptiform activity was abolished by a Kv7/M channel opener depending on drug concentration. Kv7/M channels may represent a therapeutic target for treating symptoms associated with hippocampal alterations in fragile X syndrome."

    "abstract": "Loss of functional fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) causes fragile X syndrome and is the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability. FMRP is most notably a translational repressor and is thought to inhibit translation elongation by stalling ribosomes as FMRP-bound polyribosomes from brain tissue are resistant to puromycin and nuclease treatment. Here, we present data showing that the C-terminal noncanonical RNA-binding domain of FMRP is essential and sufficient to induce puromycin-resistant mRNA•ribosome complexes. Given that stalled ribosomes can stimulate ribosome collisions and no-go mRNA decay (NGD), we tested the ability of FMRP to drive NGD of its target transcripts in neuroblastoma cells. Indeed, FMRP and ribosomal proteins, but not poly(A)-binding protein, were enriched in isolated nuclease-resistant disomes compared to controls. Using siRNA knockdown and RNA-seq, we identified 16 putative FMRP-mediated NGD substrates, many of which encode proteins involved in neuronal development and function. Increased mRNA stability of four putative substrates was also observed when either FMRP was depleted or NGD was prevented via RNAi. Taken together, these data support that FMRP stalls ribosomes but only stimulates NGD of a small select set of transcripts, revealing a minor role of FMRP that would be misregulated in fragile X syndrome."

    "abstract": "Although hyperactivity is associated with a wide variety of neurodevelopmental disorders, the early embryonic origins of locomotion have hindered investigation of pathogenesis of these debilitating behaviors. The earliest motor output in vertebrate animals is generated by clusters of early-born motor neurons (MNs) that occupy distinct regions of the spinal cord, innervating stereotyped muscle groups. Gap junction electrical synapses drive early spontaneous behavior in zebrafish, prior to the emergence of chemical neurotransmitter networks. We use a genetic model of hyperactivity to gain critical insight into the consequences of errors in motor circuit formation and function, finding that Fragile X syndrome model mutant zebrafish are hyperexcitable from the earliest phases of spontaneous behavior, show altered sensitivity to blockade of electrical gap junctions, and have increased expression of the gap junction protein Connexin 34/35. We further show that this hyperexcitable behavior can be rescued by pharmacological inhibition of electrical synapses. We also use functional imaging to examine MN and interneuron (IN) activity in early embryogenesis, finding genetic disruption of electrical gap junctions uncouples activity between <i>mnx1</i> <sup>+</sup> MNs and INs. Taken together, our work highlights the importance of electrical synapses in motor development and suggests that the origins of hyperactivity in neurodevelopmental disorders may be established during the initial formation of locomotive circuits."

    "title": "Systemic pharmacological suppression of neural activity reverses learning impairment in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome.",
    "abstract": "The enhancement of associative synaptic plasticity often results in impaired rather than enhanced learning. Previously, we proposed that such learning impairments can result from saturation of the plasticity mechanism (Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017), or, more generally, from a history-dependent change in the threshold for plasticity. This hypothesis was based on experimental results from mice lacking two class I major histocompatibility molecules, MHCI H2-K<sup>b</sup> and H2-D<sup>b</sup> (MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b-/-</sup>), which have enhanced associative long-term depression at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses in the cerebellum (PF-Purkinje cell LTD). Here, we extend this work by testing predictions of the threshold metaplasticity hypothesis in a second mouse line with enhanced PF-Purkinje cell LTD, the <i>Fmr1</i> knockout mouse model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Mice lacking <i>Fmr1</i> gene expression in cerebellar Purkinje cells (L7-<i>Fmr1</i> KO) were selectively impaired on two oculomotor learning tasks in which PF-Purkinje cell LTD has been implicated, with no impairment on LTD-independent oculomotor learning tasks. Consistent with the threshold metaplasticity hypothesis, behavioral pre-training designed to reverse LTD at the PF-Purkinje cell synapses eliminated the oculomotor learning deficit in the L7-<i>Fmr1</i> KO mice, as previously reported in MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b-/-</sup>mice. In addition, diazepam treatment to suppress neural activity and thereby limit the induction of associative LTD during the pre-training period also eliminated the learning deficits in L7-<i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. These results support the hypothesis that cerebellar LTD-dependent learning is governed by an experience-dependent sliding threshold for plasticity. An increased threshold for LTD in response to elevated neural activity would tend to oppose firing rate stability, but could serve to stabilize synaptic weights and recently acquired memories. The metaplasticity perspective could inform the development of new clinical approaches for addressing learning impairments in autism and other disorders of the nervous system."

    "abstract": "Exaggerated responses to sensory stimuli, a hallmark of fragile X syndrome, contribute to anxiety and learning challenges. Sensory hypersensitivity is recapitulated in the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse model of fragile X syndrome. Recent studies in Fmr1 KO mice have demonstrated differences in the activity of cortical interneurons and a delayed switch in the polarity of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) signaling during development. Previously, we reported that blocking the chloride transporter NKCC1 with the diuretic bumetanide could rescue synaptic circuit phenotypes in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of Fmr1 KO mice. However, it remains unknown whether bumetanide can rescue earlier circuit phenotypes or sensory hypersensitivity in Fmr1 KO mice. We used acute and chronic systemic administration of bumetanide in Fmr1 KO mice and performed in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging to record neuronal activity, while tracking mouse behavior with high-resolution videos. We demonstrated that layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the S1 of Fmr1 KO mice showed a higher frequency of synchronous events on postnatal day 6 than wild-type controls. This was reversed by acute administration of bumetanide. Furthermore, chronic bumetanide treatment (postnatal days 5-14) restored S1 circuit differences in Fmr1 KO mice, including reduced neuronal adaptation to repetitive whisker stimulation, and ameliorated tactile defensiveness. Bumetanide treatment also rectified the reduced feedforward inhibition of layer 2/3 neurons in the S1 and boosted the circuit participation of parvalbumin interneurons. This further supports the notion that synaptic, circuit, and sensory behavioral phenotypes in Fmr1 KO can be mitigated by inhibitors of NKCC1, such as the Food and Drug Administration-approved diuretic bumetanide."

A recent phase 2a clinical trial testing BPN14770, a phosphodiesterase 4D inhibitor, showed improved cognition in 30 adult males with FXS on drug relative to placebo. The initial study found significant improvements in clinical measures assessing cognition, language, and daily functioning in addition to marginal improvements in electroencephalography (EEG) results for the amplitude of the N1 event-related potential (ERP) component. EEG results suggest BPN14770 improved neural hyperexcitability in FXS. The current study investigated the relationship between BPN14770 pharmacokinetics (PK) and the amplitude of the N1 ERP component from the initial data. Consistent with the original group-level finding in period 1 of the study, participants who received BPN14770 in the period 1 showed a significant correlation between N1 amplitude and serum concentration of BPN14770. These findings strengthen the validity of the original result, indicating that BPN14770 improves cognitive performance by modulating neural hyperexcitability.

Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we previously demonstrated aberrant neural activity responding to faces in young girls with FXS cross-sectionally. Here, we tested the hypothesis that abnormalities in neural activation and sensitization would increase with age in 65 girls with FXS (ages 6-16 years) relative to an age-matched control group of 52 girls who had comparable cognitive function and clinical symptoms. fNIRS data were collected at 2 time points (mean [SD] = 2.8 [0.6] years apart) during a face processing task. Linear mixed-effect models examined longitudinal neural profiles in girls with FXS and control participants. Correlational analysis was performed to examine associations between neural sensitization (increasing neural response to repeated stimuli) and clinical ratings. In the FXS group, 24 participants had 1 fNIRS scan, and 32 had 2 scans. In the control group, 28 participants had 1 fNIRS scan, and 22 had 2 scans. Brain activations in the superior frontal gyrus were higher in girls with FXS than control participants at both time points. Neural sensitization also increased in girls with FXS at a higher rate than control participants in the superior frontal gyrus when responding to upright faces. For the FXS group, sensitization in the superior frontal gyrus positively correlated with longitudinal increases in anxiety and social avoidance scores. Girls with FXS show increasingly abnormal neural activation and sensitization responding to faces over time. Aberrant neural sensitization in girls with FXS is associated with longitudinal changes in anxiety and social skills."

Individuals with FXS ages 6 to 25 years (mean 13.15 ± 5.50) and nonverbal IQ mean 57.69 (±15.46) were treated for 1-3 years (1.88 ± 0.63).

There were no significant changes in non-verbal IQ or in the adaptive behavior measurements at FDR < 0.05. The findings thus far indicate that both IQ and adaptive behavior are stable over time, and we did not see a significant decline in either measure.

    "abstract": "Sleep problems are a significant phenotype in children with fragile X syndrome. Our prior work assessed sleep-wake cycles in <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> male mice and wild type (WT) littermate controls in response to ketogenic diet therapy where mice were treated from weaning (postnatal day 18) through study completion (5-6 months of age). A potentially confounding issue with commencing treatment during an active period of growth is the significant reduction in weight gain in response to the ketogenic diet. The aim here was to employ sleep electroencephalography (EEG) to assess sleep-wake cycles in mice in response to the <i>Fmr1</i> genotype and a ketogenic diet, with treatment starting at postnatal day 95. EEG results were compared with prior sleep outcomes to determine if the later intervention was efficacious, as well as with published rest-activity patterns to determine if actigraphy is a viable surrogate for sleep EEG. The data replicated findings that <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> mice exhibit sleep-wake patterns similar to wild type littermates during the dark cycle when maintained on a control purified-ingredient diet but revealed a genotype-specific difference during hours 4-6 of the light cycle of the increased wake (decreased sleep and NREM) state in <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> mice. Treatment with a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet increased the percentage of NREM sleep in both wild type and <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> mice during the dark cycle. Differences in sleep microstructure (length of wake bouts) supported the altered sleep states in response to ketogenic diet. Commencing ketogenic diet treatment in adulthood resulted in a 15% (WT) and 8.6% (<i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i>) decrease in body weight after 28 days of treatment, but not the severe reduction in body weight associated with starting treatment at weaning. We conclude that the lack of evidence for improved sleep during the light cycle (mouse sleep time) in <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> mice in response to ketogenic diet therapy in two studies suggests that ketogenic diet may not be beneficial in treating sleep problems associated with fragile X and that actigraphy is not a reliable surrogate for sleep EEG in mice."

The issues addressed include epidemiology, clinical features, discrimination against affected persons, limited awareness and research, and poor access to resources, including genetic services and treatment programs. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the existing worldwide data for the diagnosis and treatment of fragile X disorders. This review will improve the understanding of FXS and FXPAC in Africa by incorporating existing knowledge, identifying research gaps, and potential topics for future research to enhance the well-being of individuals and families affected by FXS and FXPAC."

In comparison with wild-type flies (<i>w<sup>1118</sup></i>), SNA analysis in <i>dFMR1<sup>B55</sup></i> mutants revealed hypoactivity, fewer connections in their networks, longer interaction duration, a lower ability to transmit information efficiently, fewer alternative pathways for information transmission, a higher variability in the number of interactions they achieved, and flies tended to stay near the boundaries of the testing chamber.

In this study, we have used both Fmr1-KO and wild-type male rats (F2 generation) at postnatal days (PND) 7 and 40 obtained after F1 pregnant females were randomly exposed to 1 mg/kg/mL/day of CPF or vehicle. A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics approach together with gene expression profiles of these F2 generation rats were employed to analyze different brain regions (such as prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum), whole large intestine (at PND7) and gut content (PND40). The statistical comparison of each matrix spectral profile unveiled tissue-specific metabolic fingerprints. Significant variations in some biomarker levels were detected among brain tissues of different genotypes, including taurine, myo-inositol, and 3-hydroxybutyric acid, and exposure to CPF induced distinct metabolic alterations, particularly in serine and myo-inositol. Additionally, this study provides a set of metabolites associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction in ASD, encompassing several amino acids, choline-derived compounds, bile acids, and sterol molecules.

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an X-linked disorder that often leads to intellectual disability, anxiety, and sensory hypersensitivity. While sound sensitivity (hyperacusis) is a distressing symptom in FXS, its neural basis is not well understood. It is postulated that hyperacusis may stem from temporal lobe hyperexcitability or dysregulation in top-down modulation. Studying the neural mechanisms underlying sound sensitivity in FXS using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) is challenging because the temporal and frontal regions have overlapping neural projections that are difficult to differentiate. To overcome this challenge, we conducted EEG source analysis on a group of 36 individuals with FXS and 39 matched healthy controls. Our goal was to characterize the spatial and temporal properties of the response to an auditory chirp stimulus. Our results showed that males with FXS exhibit excessive activation in the frontal cortex in response to the stimulus onset, which may reflect changes in top-down modulation of auditory processing. Additionally, during the chirp stimulus, individuals with FXS demonstrated a reduction in typical gamma phase synchrony, along with an increase in asynchronous gamma power, across multiple regions, most strongly in temporal cortex. Consistent with these findings, we observed a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio, estimated by the ratio of synchronous to asynchronous gamma activity, in individuals with FXS. Furthermore, this ratio was highly correlated with performance in an auditory attention task. Compared to controls, males with FXS demonstrated elevated bidirectional frontotemporal information flow at chirp onset. The evidence indicates that both temporal lobe hyperexcitability and disruptions in top-down regulation play a role in auditory sensitivity disturbances in FXS. These findings have the potential to guide the development of therapeutic targets and back-translation strategies."

Only 20% of female premutation carriers develop early ovulatory dysfunction, the reason for this incomplete penetrance is unknown. This study validated the mathematical model in premutation alleles, after assigning each allele a score representing allelic complexity. Subsequently, allelic scores were used to investigate the impact of allele complexity on age at amenorrhea for 58 premutation cases (116 alleles) previously published. The allelic score was determined using a formula previously described by our group. The impact of each allelic score on age at amenorrhea was analyzed using Pearson's test and a contour plot generated to visualize the effect. Correlation of allelic score revealed two distinct complexity behaviors in premutation alleles. No significant correlation was observed between the allelic score of premutation alleles and age at amenorrhea. The same lack of significant correlation was observed regarding normal-sized alleles, despite a nearly significant trend. Our results suggest that the use of allelic scores combination have the potential to explain female infertility, namely the development of FXPOI, or ovarian dysfunction, despite the lack of correlation with age at amenorrhea. Such a finding is of great clinical significance for early identification of females at risk of ovulatory dysfunction, enhancement of fertility preservation techniques, and increasing the probability for a successful pregnancy in females with premutations. Additional investigation is necessary to validate this hypothesis."

Computational modeling suggested that these dynamics could be attributed to a spatial gradient of hyperpolarization-activated currents (I<sub>h</sub>), which we confirmed in ex vivo slice experiments and corroborated in other cortical structures. These findings open up the possibility that varying amounts of I<sub>h</sub> across cortical neurons could result in sequential neuronal patterns and that traveling activity upstream of the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit organizes large-scale neuronal activity supporting learning and memory during sleep."

The present study assessed whether intrasubject variability during a sustained attention task better predicted functional outcomes in women with a PM than the previously published standard reaction time and accuracy variables. We analyzed continuous performance test, a computerized measure of sustained attention, and the Conners' Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale Report (CAARS) data from 273 women with a PM and 175 women without a PM aged 18-50 years. Separate analyses using Pearson correlations and independent t tests were performed on the full range of coefficient of variation (CV) of reaction time scores and the subset of scores that showed higher variability. Performance variability of sustained attention measured by the continuous performance test was associated with functional outcomes measured by the CAARS in women with a PM but not women without a PM. Specifically, the CV in those with higher variability was correlated with two CAARS subscale scores (<i>p</i> = .006). Independent t tests showed significant differences in CV between CAARS scores dichotomized for the presence of subclinical symptoms for two subscales (<i>p</i> ≤ .001-.007). Correlation between the full range of CV scores and the CAARS Inattention/Memory Problems subscale approached significance (<i>p</i> = .012).

    "title": "Social Communication Delay in an Unbiased Sample of Preschoolers With the <i>FMR1</i> Premutation.",
    "abstract": "The <i>Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein-1</i> (<i>FMR1</i>) premutation (FXpm) is a genetic variant that is common in the general population and is associated with health symptoms and disease in adulthood. However, poor understanding of the clinical phenotype during childhood has hindered the development of clinical practice guidelines for screening and intervention. Given that social communication difficulties have been widely documented in adults with the FXpm and are linked with reduced psychosocial functioning, the present study aimed to characterize the communication profile of the FXpm during early childhood. Eighteen children with the FXpm who were identified through cascade testing (89%) or screening at birth (11%) were compared to 21 matched typically developing children, aged 2-4 years. Participants completed standardized assessments of language (Mullen Scales of Early Learning) and adaptive communication (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II). Social communication was rated from seminaturalistic interaction samples using the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change. Children with the FXpm showed delayed social communication development, with the magnitude of group differences highlighting social communication as a feature that distinguishes children with the FXpm from their peers (<i>p =</i> .046, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .12). The groups did not differ on the standardized language and adaptive communication measures (<i>p</i>s > .297, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>s < .03). Early screening and treatment of social communication delays may be key to optimizing outcomes for children with the FXpm. Further research is needed to replicate findings in a larger sample, delineate the trajectory and consequences of social communication difficulties across the life span in the FXpm, and determine the potential epidemiological significance of <i>FMR1</i> as a mediator of developmental communication differences within the general population."

    "abstract": "The common fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> provides a powerful platform to investigate the genetic, molecular, cellular, and neural circuit mechanisms of behavior. Research in this model system has shed light on multiple aspects of brain physiology and behavior, from fundamental neuronal function to complex behaviors. A major anatomical region that modulates complex behaviors is the mushroom body (MB). The MB integrates multimodal sensory information and is involved in behaviors ranging from sensory processing/responses to learning and memory. Many genes that underlie brain disorders are conserved, from flies to humans, and studies in <i>Drosophila</i> have contributed significantly to our understanding of the mechanisms of brain disorders. Genetic mutations that mimic human diseases-such as Fragile X syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease-affect MB structure and function, altering behavior. Studies dissecting the effects of disease-causing mutations in the MB have identified key pathological mechanisms, and the development of a complete connectome promises to add a comprehensive anatomical framework for disease modeling. Here, we review <i>Drosophila</i> models of human neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders via the effects of their underlying mutations on MB structure, function, and the resulting behavioral alterations."

    "title": "Developmental associations between cognition and adaptive behavior in intellectual and developmental disability.",
    "abstract": "Intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) are associated with both cognitive challenges and difficulties in conceptual, social, and practical areas of living, commonly referred to as adaptive behavior (DSM-5). Although cross-sectional associations between intelligence or cognition and adaptive behavior have been reported in IDD populations, no study to date has examined whether developmental changes in cognition contribute to or track with changes in adaptive behavior. The present study sought to examine associations of longitudinal developmental change in domains of cognition (NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery, NIHTB-CB) and adaptive behavior domains (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-3; VABS-3) including Socialization, Communication, and Daily Living Skills (DLS) over a two year period in a large sample of children, adolescents and young adults with IDD. Three groups were recruited, including those with fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome, and other/idiopathic intellectual disability. Eligible participants (n = 263) included those who were between 6 and 26 years (m<sub>age</sub> = 15.52, sd = 5.17) at Visit 1, and who had a diagnosis of, or suspected intellectual disability (ID), including borderline ID, with a mental age of at least 3.0 years. Participants were given cognitive and adaptive behavior assessments at two time points over a two year period (m = 2.45 years, range = 1.27 to 5.56 years). In order to examine the association of developmental change between cognitive and adaptive behavior domains, bivariate latent change score (BLCS) models were fit to compare change in the three cognitive domains measured by the NIHTB-CB (Fluid Cognition, Crystallized Cognition, Total Cognition) and the three adaptive behavior domains measured by the VABS-3 (Communication, DLS, and Socialization). Over a two year period, change in cognition (both Crystallized and Total Composites) was significantly and positively associated with change in daily living skills. Also, baseline cognition level predicted growth in adaptive behavior, however baseline adaptive behavior did not predict growth in cognition in any model. The present study demonstrated that developmental changes in cognition and adaptive behavior are associated in children and young adults with IDD, indicating the potential for cross-domain effects of intervention. Notably, improvements in DLS emerged as a primary area of adaptive behavior that positively related to improvements in cognition. This work provides evidence for the clinical, \"real life\" meaningfulness of changes in cognition detected by the NIHTB-CB in IDD, and provides empirical support for the NIHTB-CB as a fit-for-purpose performance-based outcome measure for this population."

The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene contains polymorphic CGG repeats, the length of which has differing effects on FMR1 expression and human health, including the neurodevelopmental disorder fragile X syndrome. We deleted the CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene (0CGG) in human stem cells and examined the effects on differentiated neurons. 0CGG neurons have altered subcellular localization of FMR1 mRNA and protein, and differential expression of cellular stress proteins compared with neurons with normal repeats (31CGG). In addition, 0CGG neurons have altered responses to glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation, including FMR1 mRNA localization, GR chaperone HSP90α expression, GR localization, and cellular stress protein levels. Therefore, the CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene are important for the homeostatic responses of neurons to stress signals."

    "abstract": "Phosphodiesterases (PDE) are involved in the regulation of cellular physiological processes and neurological functions, including neuronal plasticity, synapto-genesis, synaptic transmission, memory formation and cognitive functions by catalyzing the hydrolysis of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Many basic and clinical studies have shown that PDE4 inhibitors block or ameliorate the occurrence and development of central nervous system (CNS) diseases by inhibiting cAMP hydrolysis, increasing cAMP content and enhancing its downstream effects. PDE4 inhibitors have long-term potentiation effect, which can enhance phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and upregulate expression of memory related Arc genes in hippocampal neurons, thereby improving cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease-like symptoms. They can also delay the occurrence and development of Parkinson's disease by reducing the cytotoxicity induced by α-syn and increasing the effect of miR-124-3p on cell functions. Alteration of PDE4 activity is the molecular basis for psychosis and some cognitive disorders, therefore it is considered as a therapeutic target for schizophrenia. PDE4 inhibitors play a role in depression by inhibiting the advanced glycation end product receptor (RAGE), TLR4 and NLRP3 pathways in the hippocampus, reducing the activation of microglia and the production of IL-1β, down-regulating HMGB1/RAGE signaling pathway and inhibiting inflammatory factors. PDE4 inhibitor plays a role in the treatment of autism spectrum disorder by reducing the damage of cerebellar glial cells, increasing nociceptive threshold, and improving mutual learning and memory deficits. PDE4 inhibitors might be used in the treatment of fragile X syndrome by regulating the level of cAMP and affecting the expression of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). PDE4 inhibitors can also promote the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and enhance myelination, which has potential in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. PDE4 is also related to bipolar disorder, which may be one of the therapeutic targets. At present, several PDE4 inhibitors are in clinical trials for the treatment of CNS diseases. This article reviews and discusses the progress on basic research and clinical trials of PDE4 inhibitors in CNS diseases, providing a reference for the prevention and treatment of CNS diseases and the development of new drugs."

    "abstract": "Epigenetic control systems are based on chromatin modifications (DNA methylation, histone modifications and nucleosome positioning), which affect the local kinetics of gene expression. They play an important role in maintaining cell fate decisions, X inactivation and genomic imprinting. Aberrant chromatin states that are associated with a deleterious change in gene expression are called epimutations. An epimutation can be a primary epimutation that has occurred in the absence of any genetic change or a secondary epimutation that results from a mutation of a <i>cis</i>-acting regulatory element or <i>trans</i>-acting factor. Epimutations may play a causative role in disease, for example in imprinting disorders, or may be part of the pathogenetic mechanism as in the fragile X syndrome and in syndromes caused by a mutation affecting a chromatin modifier. For several diseases, DNA methylation testing is an important tool in the diagnostic work-up of patients."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and is the leading known single-gene cause of autism spectrum disorder. Patients with FXS display varied behavioural deficits that include mild to severe cognitive impairments in addition to mood disorders. Currently, there is no cure for this condition; however, there is an emerging focus on therapies that inhibit mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent protein synthesis owing to the clinical effectiveness of metformin for alleviating some behavioural symptoms in FXS. Adiponectin (APN) is a neurohormone that is released by adipocytes and provides an alternative means to inhibit mTOR activation in the brain. In these studies, we show that <i>Fmr1</i> knockout mice, like patients with FXS, show reduced levels of circulating APN and that both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in the dentate gyrus (DG) are impaired. Brief (20 min) incubation of hippocampal slices in APN (50 nM) was able to rescue both LTP and LTD in the DG and increased both the surface expression and phosphorylation of GluA1 receptors. These results provide evidence for reduced APN levels in FXS playing a role in decreasing bidirectional synaptic plasticity and show that therapies which enhance APN levels may have therapeutic potential for this and related conditions.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Long-term potentiation: 50 years on'."

Long-term potentiation (LTP), thought to underlie the formation of memories, has been studied in the <i>Fmr1</i> mouse model of FXS. However, there have been many discrepancies in the literature with inconsistent use of littermate and non-littermate <i>Fmr1</i> knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) control mice. Here, the influence of the breeding strategy (cage effect) on short-term potentiation (STP), LTP, contextual fear conditioning (CFC), expression of <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits and the modulation of NMDARs, were examined. The largest deficits in STP, LTP and CFC were found in KO mice compared with non-littermate WT. However, the expression of NMDAR subunits was unchanged in this comparison. Rather, NMDAR subunit (GluN1, 2A, 2B) expression was sensitive to the cage effect, with decreased expression in both WT and KO littermates compared with non-littermates. Interestingly, an NMDAR-positive allosteric modulator, UBP714, was only effective in potentiating the induction of LTP in non-littermate KO mice and not the littermate KO mice. These results suggest that commonly studied phenotypes in <i>Fmr1</i> KOs are sensitive to the cage effect and therefore the breeding strategy may contribute to discrepancies in the literature.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Long-term potentiation: 50 years on'."

    "abstract": "Chromosomal abnormalities are associated with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, one of the more commonly observed of which is epilepsy. The frequency, severity, and type of epileptic seizures vary according to the macro- and microrearrangements present. Even within a single chromosomal anomaly, we most often deal with a phenotypic spectrum. The aim of the study was to look for chromosomal rearrangements with a characteristic electroencephalographic pattern. Only a few disorders have peculiar electroclinical abnormalities: 1p36, 4p16, 6q terminal or trisomy 12p, Angelman syndrome, inv dup 15, 15q13.3 deletions, ring 20, Down syndrome, or Xp11.22-11.23 duplication. We also reviewed studies on epileptic seizures and typical electroencephalographic patterns described in certain chromosomal rearrangements, focusing on the quest for potential electroclinical biomarkers. The comprehensive review concludes with clinical presentations of the most common micro and macro chromosomal rearrangements, such as 17q21.31 microdeletion, 6q terminal deletion, 15q inv dup syndrome, 2q24.4 deletion, Xp11.22-11.23 duplication, 15q13.3 microdeletion, 1p36 terminal deletion, 5q14.3 microdeletion, and Xq28 duplication. The papers reviewed did not identify any specific interictal electroencephalographic patterns that were unique and significant biomarkers for a given chromosomal microrearrangement. The types of seizures described varied, with both generalized and focal seizures of various morphologies being reported. Patients with chromosomal anomalies may also meet the criteria for specific epileptic syndromes such as Infantile Epilepsy Spasms Syndrome (IESS, West syndrome): 16p13.11, 15q13.3 and 17q21.31 microdeletions, 5q inv dup. syndrome; Dravet syndrome (2q24.4 deletion), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (15q11 duplication. 1q13.3, 5q inv dup.); or Self-Limited Epilepsy with Autonomic Features (SeLEAS, Panayiotopoulos syndrome: terminal deletion of 6q.n), Self-Limited Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (SeLECT): fragile X syndrome. It is essential to better characterize groups of patients to more accurately define patterns of epilepsy and EEG abnormalities. This could lead to new treatment strategies. Future research is required to better understand epileptic syndromes and chromosomal rearrangements. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: This paper presents EEG recording abnormalities in patients with various gene abnormalities that can cause epilepsy. The authors summarize these EEG variations based on a literature review to see if they occur frequently enough in other chromosomal abnormalities (in addition to those already known) to be a clue for further diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. The mesocorticolimbic system, which includes the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and nucleus accumbens core (NAcC), is essential for regulating socioemotional behaviors. We employed optogenetics to compare the functional properties of the BLA→NAcC, PFC→NAcC, and reciprocal PFC↔BLA pathways in <i>Fmr1-/y::Drd1a-tdTomato</i> male mice. In FXS mice, the PFC↔BLA reciprocal pathway was unaffected, while significant synaptic modifications occurred in the BLA/PFC→NAcC pathways. We observed distinct changes in D1 striatal projection neurons (SPNs) and separate modifications in D2 SPNs. In FXS mice, the BLA/PFC→NAcC-D2 SPN pathways demonstrated heightened synaptic strength. Focusing on the BLA→NAcC pathway, linked to autistic symptoms, we found increased AMPAR and NMDAR currents and elevated spine density in D2 SPNs. Conversely, the amplified firing probability of BLA→NAcC-D1 SPNs was not accompanied by increased synaptic strength, AMPAR and NMDAR currents, or spine density. These pathway-specific alterations resulted in an overall enhancement of excitatory-to-spike coupling, a physiologically relevant index of how efficiently excitatory inputs drive neuronal firing, in both BLA→NAcC-D1 and BLA→NAcC-D2 pathways. Finally, the absence of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP) led to impaired long-term depression specifically in BLA→D1 SPNs. These distinct alterations in synaptic transmission and plasticity within circuits targeting the NAcC highlight the potential role of postsynaptic mechanisms in selected SPNs in the observed circuit-level changes. This research underscores the heightened vulnerability of the NAcC in the context of FMRP deficiency, emphasizing its pivotal role in the pathophysiology of FXS."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by epigenetic silencing of the Fmr1 gene, leading to the deletion of the coding protein FMRP. FXS induces abnormal hippocampal autophagy and mTOR overactivation. However, it remains unclear whether FMRP regulates hippocampal autophagy through the AKT/mTOR pathway, which influences the neural behavior of FXS. Our study revealed that FMRP deficiency increased the protein levels of p-ULK-1 and p62 and decreased LC3II/LC3I level in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice. The mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22 with knockdown of Fmr1 by lentivirus showed that the protein levels of p-ULK-1 and p62 were increased, whereas LC3II/LC3I was unchanged. Further observations revealed that FMRP deficiency obstructed autophagic flow in HT22 cells. Therefore, FMRP deficiency inhibited autophagy in the mouse hippocampus and HT22 cells. Moreover, FMRP deficiency increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, decreased the co-localization between the mitochondrial outer membrane proteins TOM20 and LC3 in HT22 cells, and caused a decrease in the mitochondrial autophagy protein PINK1 in HT22 cells and Fmr1 KO mice, indicating that FMRP deficiency caused mitochondrial autophagy disorder in HT22 cells and Fmr1 KO mice. To explore the mechanism by which FMRP deficiency inhibits autophagy, we examined the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in the hippocampus of Fmr1 KO mice, found that FMRP deficiency caused overactivation of the AKT/mTOR pathway. Rapamycin-mediated mTOR inhibition activated and enhanced mitochondrial autophagy. Finally, we examined whether rapamycin affected the neurobehavior of Fmr1 KO mice. The Fmr1 KO mice exhibited stereotypical behavior, impaired social ability, and learning and memory impairment, while rapamycin treatment improved behavioral disorders in Fmr1 KO mice. Thus, our study revealed the molecular mechanism by which FMRP regulates autophagy function, clarifying the role of hippocampal neuron mitochondrial autophagy in the pathogenesis of FXS, and providing novel insights into potential therapeutic targets of FXS."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Currently, there are no established biomarkers for predicting and monitoring drug effects in FXS, and no approved therapies are available. Previous studies have shown electrophysiological changes in the brain using electroencephalography (EEG) in individuals with FXS and animal models. These changes may be influenced by drug therapies. In this study, we aimed to assess the reliability of resting-state EEG measures in individuals with FXS, which could potentially serve as a biomarker for drug discovery. We collected resting-state EEG data from 35 individuals with FXS participating in placebo-controlled clinical trials (23 males, 12 females; visit age mean+/-std 25.6 +/-8.3). The data were analyzed for various spectral features using intraclass correlation analysis to evaluate test-retest reliability. The intervals between EEG recordings ranged from same-day measurements to up to six weeks apart. Our results showed high reliability for most spectral features, with same-day reliability exceeding 0.8. Features of interest demonstrated ICC values of 0.60 or above at longer intervals. Among the features, alpha band relative power exhibited the highest reliability. These findings indicate that resting-state EEG can provide consistent and reproducible measures of brain activity in individuals with FXS. This supports the potential use of EEG as an objective biomarker for evaluating the effects of new drugs in FXS. The reliable measurements obtained from power spectrum-based resting-state EEG make it a promising tool for assessing the impact of small molecule drugs in FXS."

    "abstract": "Deficiency in fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) leads to loss of its encoded protein FMRP and causes fragile X syndrome (FXS) by dysregulating its target gene expression in an age-related fashion. Using comparative proteomic analysis, this study identified 105 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the hippocampus of postnatal day 7 (P7) Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> mice and 306 DEPs of P90 Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> mice. We found that most DEPs in P90 hippocampus were not changed in P7 hippocampus upon FMRP absence, and some P90 DEPs exhibited diverse proteophenotypes with abnormal expression of protein isoform or allele variants. Bioinformatic analyses showed that the P7 DEPs were mainly enriched in fatty acid metabolism and oxidoreductase activity and nutrient responses; whereas the P90 PEPs (especially down-regulated DEPs) were primarily enriched in postsynaptic density (PSD), neuronal projection development and synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, 25 of 30 down-regulated PSD proteins present in the most enriched protein to protein interaction network, and 6 of them (ANK3, ATP2B2, DST, GRIN1, SHANK2 and SYNGAP1) are both FMRP targets and autism candidates. Therefore, this study suggests age-dependent alterations in hippocampal proteomes upon loss of FMRP that may be associated with the pathogenesis of FXS and its related disorders. SIGNIFICANCE: It is well known that loss of FMRP resulted from Fmr1 deficiency leads to fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common neurodevelopmental disorder accompanied by intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). FMRP exhibits distinctly spatiotemporal patterns in the hippocampus between early development and adulthood, which lead to distinct dysregulations of gene expression upon loss of FMRP at the two age stages potentially linked to age-related phenotypes. Therefore, comparison of hippocampal proteomes between infancy and adulthood is valuable to provide insights into the early causations and adult-dependent consequences for FXS and ASD. Using a comparative proteomic analysis, this study identified 105 and 306 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the hippocampi of postnatal day 7 (P7) and P90 Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> mice, respectively. Few overlapping DEPs were identified between P7 and P90 stages, and the P7 DEPs were mainly enriched in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism and oxidoreduction, whereas the P90 DEPs were preferentially enriched in the regulation of synaptic formation and plasticity. Particularly, the up-regulated P90 proteins are primarily involved in immune responses and neurodegeneration, and the down-regulated P90 proteins are associated with postsynaptic density, neuron projection and synaptic plasticity. Our findings suggest that distinctly changed proteins in FMRP-absence hippocampus between infancy and adulthood may contribute to age-dependent pathogenesis of FXS and ASD."

Bilateral hyperintensities of the middle cerebellar peduncles (MCP sign) are the major radiological hallmarks of FXTAS. In the general population, enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are biomarkers of small vessel disease and glymphatic dysfunction and are associated with cognitive decline. Our aim was to determine if premutation carriers show higher ratings of PVS than controls and whether enlarged PVS are associated with motor and cognitive impairment, MRI features of neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular risk factors and CGG repeat length. We evaluated 655 MRIs (1-10 visits/participant) from 229 carriers (164 with FXTAS and 65 without FXTAS) and 133 controls. PVS in the basal ganglia (BG-EPVS), centrum semiovale, and midbrain were evaluated with a semiquantitative scale. Mixed-effects models were used for statistical analysis adjusting for age. In carriers with FXTAS, we revealed that (1) BG-PVS ratings were higher than those of controls and carriers without FXTAS; (2) BG-PVS severity was associated with brain atrophy, white matter hyperintensities, enlarged ventricles, FXTAS stage and abnormal gait; (3) age-related increase in BG-PVS was associated with cognitive dysfunction; and (4) PVS ratings of all three regions showed robust associations with CGG repeat length and were higher in carriers with the MCP sign than carriers without the sign. This study demonstrates clinical relevance of PVS in FXTAS especially in the basal ganglia region and suggests microangiopathy and dysfunctional cerebrospinal fluid circulation in FXTAS physiopathology."

It is well established that Fragile X individuals are subjected to a wide array of comorbidities, ranging from cognitive, behavioural, and medical origin. Furthermore, recent studies have also described metabolic impairments in FXS individuals. However, the molecular mechanisms linking FMRP deficiency to improper metabolism are still misunderstood. The endocannabinoidome (eCBome) is a lipid-based signalling system that regulates several functions across the body, ranging from cognition, behaviour and metabolism. Alterations in the eCBome have been described in FXS animal models and linked to neuronal hyperexcitability, a core deficit of the disease. However, the potential link between dysregulation of the eCBome and altered metabolism observed in FXS remains unexplored. As such, this review aims to overcome this issue by describing the most recent finding related to eCBome and metabolic dysfunctions in the context of FXS. A better comprehension of this association will help deepen our understanding of FXS pathophysiology and pave the way for future therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), characterized by amenorrhea before age 40 years, occurs in 20% of female FMR1 premutation carriers. Presently, there are no molecular or biomarkers that can help predicting which FMR1 premutation women will develop FXPOI. We previously demonstrated that high FMR4 levels can discriminate between FMR1 premutation carriers with and without FXPOI. In the present study the relationship between the expression levels of FMR4 and the ovarian reserve markers was assessed in female FMR1 premutation carriers under age of 35 years. We examined the association between FMR4 transcript levels and the measures of total antral follicle count (AFC) and serum anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) levels as markers of ovarian follicle reserve. Results revealed a negative association between FMR4 levels and AMH (r = 0.45) and AFC (r = 0.64). Statistically significant higher FMR4 transcript levels were found among those FMR1 premutation women with both, low AFCs and AMH levels. These findings reinforce previous studies supporting the association between high levels of FMR4 and the risk of developing FXPOI in FMR1 premutation carriers."

    "title": "FMRP regulates postnatal neuronal migration via MAP1B.",
    "abstract": "The fragile X syndrome (FXS) represents the most prevalent form of inherited intellectual disability and is the first monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder. FXS results from the absence of the RNA-binding protein FMRP (fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein). Neuronal migration is an essential step of brain development allowing displacement of neurons from their germinal niches to their final integration site. The precise role of FMRP in neuronal migration remains largely unexplored. Using live imaging of postnatal rostral migratory stream (RMS) neurons in <i>Fmr1</i>-null mice, we observed that the absence of FMRP leads to delayed neuronal migration and altered trajectory, associated with defects of centrosomal movement. RNA-interference-induced knockdown of <i>Fmr1</i> shows that these migratory defects are cell-autonomous. Notably, the primary <i>Fmrp</i> mRNA target implicated in these migratory defects is microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B). Knocking down MAP1B expression effectively rescued most of the observed migratory defects. Finally, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms at play by demonstrating that the absence of FMRP induces defects in the cage of microtubules surrounding the nucleus of migrating neurons, which is rescued by MAP1B knockdown. Our findings reveal a novel neurodevelopmental role for FMRP in collaboration with MAP1B, jointly orchestrating neuronal migration by influencing the microtubular cytoskeleton."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most prevalent monogenetic form of intellectual disability and autism. Recently, dysregulation of insulin signaling (IS) and aberrations in mitochondrial function have emerged as robust, evolutionarily conserved components of FXS pathophysiology. However, the mechanisms by which altered IS and mitochondrial dysfunction impact behavior in the context of FXS remain elusive. Here, we show that normalization of IS improves mitochondrial volume and function in flies that lack expression of <i>dfmr1</i>, the <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of the causal gene of FXS in humans. Further, we demonstrate that dysregulation of IS underlies diminished expression of the mitochondrial master regulator PGC-1α/Spargel in <i>dfmr1</i> mutant flies. These results are behaviorally relevant, as we show that pan-neuronal augmentation of PGC-1α/Spargel improves circadian behavior in <i>dfmr1</i> mutants. Notably, we also show that modulation of PGC-1α/Spargel expression in wild-type flies phenocopies the <i>dfmr1</i> mutant circadian defect. Taken together, the results presented herein provide a mechanistic link between mitochondrial function and circadian behavior both in FXS pathogenesis as well as more broadly at the interface between metabolism and behavioral output."

    "title": "Sex differences during development in cortical temporal processing and event related potentials in wild-type and fragile X syndrome model mice.",
    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is currently diagnosed in approximately 1 in 44 children in the United States, based on a wide array of symptoms, including sensory dysfunction and abnormal language development. Boys are diagnosed ~ 3.8 times more frequently than girls. Auditory temporal processing is crucial for speech recognition and language development. Abnormal development of temporal processing may account for ASD language impairments. Sex differences in the development of temporal processing may underlie the differences in language outcomes in male and female children with ASD. To understand mechanisms of potential sex differences in temporal processing requires a preclinical model. However, there are no studies that have addressed sex differences in temporal processing across development in any animal model of ASD. To fill this major gap, we compared the development of auditory temporal processing in male and female wildtype (WT) and Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice, a model of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), a leading genetic cause of ASD-associated behaviors. Using epidural screw electrodes, we recorded auditory event related potentials (ERP) and auditory temporal processing with a gap-in-noise auditory steady state response (ASSR) paradigm at young (postnatal (p)21 and p30) and adult (p60) ages from both auditory and frontal cortices of awake, freely moving mice. The results show that ERP amplitudes were enhanced in both sexes of Fmr1 KO mice across development compared to WT counterparts, with greater enhancement in adult female than adult male KO mice. Gap-ASSR deficits were seen in the frontal, but not auditory, cortex in early development (p21) in female KO mice. Unlike male KO mice, female KO mice show WT-like temporal processing at p30. There were no temporal processing deficits in the adult mice of both sexes. These results show a sex difference in the developmental trajectories of temporal processing and hypersensitive responses in Fmr1 KO mice. Male KO mice show slower maturation of temporal processing than females. Female KO mice show stronger hypersensitive responses than males later in development. The differences in maturation rates of temporal processing and hypersensitive responses during various critical periods of development may lead to sex differences in language function, arousal and anxiety in FXS."

We sought to assess whether mitochondrial abnormalities present in postmortem brain tissues of patients with FXTAS are also present in plasma neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) from living carriers of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein1 (FMR1) gene premutations at an early asymptomatic stage of the disease continuum. We utilized postmortem frozen cerebellar and frontal cortex samples from a cohort of eight patients with FXTAS and nine controls and measured the quantity and activity of the mitochondrial proteins complex IV and complex V. In addition, we evaluated the same measures in isolated plasma NDEVs by selective immunoaffinity capture targeting L1CAM from a separate cohort of eight FMR1 premutation carriers and four age-matched controls. Lower complex IV and V quantity and activity were observed in the cerebellum of FXTAS patients compared to controls, without any differences in total mitochondrial content. No patient-control differences were observed in the frontal cortex. In NDEVs, FMR1 premutation carriers compared to controls had lower activity of Complex IV and Complex V, but higher Complex V quantity. Quantitative and functional abnormalities in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes IV and V seen in the cerebellum of patients with FXTAS are also manifest in plasma NDEVs of FMR1 premutation carriers. Plasma NDEVs may provide further insights into mitochondrial pathologies in this syndrome and could potentially lead to the development of biomarkers for predicting symptomatic FXTAS among premutation carriers and disease monitoring."

Behavioural features such as autism, hyperactivity and anxiety disorder may be present. Biofilm development and pathogenicity of Streptococcus mutans may be altered because FXS renders the dental approach and oral hygiene more complex. The purpose of this study was to compare the levels of transcripts for VicRK and CovR of S. mutans isolated from FXS patients with the levels of transcripts for VicRK and CovR of standard strain ATCC, using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The caries experience index was assessed by the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS), Periodontal Condition Index (PCI) and Invasive Dental Treatment Need Index (INI). The clinical index findings revealed a high rate of caries cavities and bleeding on probing of FXS patients. When VicRK and CovR transcript levels were compared with the reference strain, Fragile X patients were found to have significantly higher values. The present study demonstrated that FXS patients have more adverse clinical conditions, with increased biofilm accumulation and virulence. When combined with behavioural abnormalities, these patients become even more vulnerable to dental caries."

Both FXTAS and neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) belong to polyglycine diseases and present similar clinical, radiological, and pathological features, making it difficult to distinguish these diseases. Reversible encephalitis-like attacks are often observed in NIID. It is unclear whether they are presented in FXTAS and can be used for differential diagnosis of NIID and FXTAS. A 63-year-old Chinese male with late-onset gait disturbance, cognitive decline, and reversible attacks of fever, consciousness impairment, dizziness, vomiting, and urinary incontinence underwent neurological assessment and examinations, including laboratory tests, electroencephalogram test, imaging, skin biopsy, and genetic test. Brain MRI showed T2 hyperintensities in middle cerebellar peduncle and cerebrum, in addition to cerebellar atrophy and DWI hyperintensities along the corticomedullary junction. Lesions in the brainstem were observed. Skin biopsy showed p62-positive intranuclear inclusions. The possibilities of hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, epileptic seizures, and cerebrovascular attacks were excluded. Genetic analysis revealed CGG repeat expansion in FMR1 gene, and the number of repeats was 111. The patient was finally diagnosed as FXTAS. He received supportive treatment as well as symptomatic treatment during hospitalization. His encephalitic symptoms were completely relieved within one week. This is a detailed report of a case of FXTAS with reversible encephalitis-like episodes. This report provides new information for the possible and rare features of FXTAS, highlighting that encephalitis-like episodes are common in polyglycine diseases and unable to be used for differential diagnosis."

    "title": "Loss of FMRP affects ovarian development and behaviour through multiple pathways in a zebrafish model of fragile X syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited neurodevelopmental disorder and the leading genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. FXS is caused by loss of function mutations in Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein that is known to regulate translation of its target mRNAs, predominantly in the brain and gonads. The molecular mechanisms connecting FMRP function to neurodevelopmental phenotypes are well understood. However, neither the full extent of reproductive phenotypes, nor the underlying molecular mechanisms have been as yet determined. Here, we developed new fmr1 knockout zebrafish lines and show that they mimic key aspects of FXS neuronal phenotypes across both larval and adult stages. Results from the fmr1 knockout females also showed that altered gene expression in the brain, via the neuroendocrine pathway contribute to distinct abnormal phenotypes during ovarian development and oocyte maturation. We identified at least three mechanisms underpinning these defects, including altered neuroendocrine signaling in sexually mature females resulting in accelerated ovarian development, altered expression of germ cell and meiosis promoting genes at various stages during oocyte maturation, and finally a strong mitochondrial impairment in late stage oocytes from knockout females. Our findings have implications beyond FXS in the study of reproductive function and female infertility. Dissection of the translation control pathways during ovarian development using models like the knockout lines reported here may reveal novel approaches and targets for fertility treatments."

We studied hormonal and ultrasound ovarian reserve, fertility and fertility preservation outcomes in these patients. Retrospective cohort study of 63 female FMR1 premutation carriers. Sixty-three female patients bearing an FMR1 premutation were included. Median age was 30 years [26.5-35]. Median number of CGG triplets was 83 [77.2-92]. Before diagnosis of PM, 19 women (30%) had had in all 35 pregnancies, resulting in 20 births, including 7 affected children. After diagnosis of PM, 17 women (26.1%) had in all 23 pregnancies, at a median age of 34.5 years [32.2-36.0]: 2 after pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, 3 after oocyte donation, 18 spontaneously, and 5 ending in medical termination for fragile X syndrome. Thirty-three patients (52.4%) had POI diagnosis (median age, 30 years [27-34]) with median FSH level 84 IU/L [50.5-110] and median AMH level 0.08ng/mL [0.01-0.19]. After POI diagnosis, 8 women had in all 9 pregnancies: 3 following oocyte donation, and 6 spontaneous in 5 women (15.1%). Eight of the 9 pregnancies resulted in a live birth (including 2 affected children) and 1 in medical termination for trisomy 13. The median age of the 30 patients without POI was 31 years [25.2-35.0]. Thirteen women (20.6%) underwent fertility preservation, at a median age of 29 years [24-33]: FSH 7.7 IU/L [6.8-9.9], AMH 1.1ng/mL [0.95-2.1], antral follicle count 9.5 [7.7-14.7]. A median 15 oocytes [10-26] were cryopreserved in a median 2 cycles [1-3]. At the time of writing, no oocytes had yet been thawed for in-vitro fertilization. This study shows the importance of early fertility preservation after diagnosis of FMR1 premutation in women, due to early deterioration of ovarian reserve. Genetic counseling is essential in these patients, as spontaneous pregnancies are not uncommon, even in cases of impaired ovarian reserve, and can lead to birth of affected children."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in genetic and epigenetic research have underscored the significance of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID), revealing its potential as both a biomarker for early detection and a target for novel therapeutic strategies. This review article provides a comprehensive analysis of the role of 5hmC in NDDs by examining both animal models and human studies. By examining mouse models, studies have demonstrated that prenatal environmental challenges, such as maternal infection and food allergies, lead to significant epigenetic alterations in 5hmC levels, which were associated with NDDs in offspring, impacting social behavior, cognitive abilities and increasing ASD-like symptoms. In human studies, researchers have linked alterations in 5hmC levels NDDs through studies in individuals with ASD, fragile X syndrome, TET3 deficiency and ID, specifically identifying significant epigenetic modifications in genes such as <i>GAD1</i>, <i>RELN</i>, <i>FMR1</i> and <i>EN-2</i>, suggesting that dysregulation of 5hmC played a critical role in the pathogenesis of these disorders and highlighted the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions. Moreover, we explore the implications of these findings for the development of epigenetic therapies aimed at modulating 5hmC levels. The review concludes with a discussion on future directions for research in this field, such as machine learning, emphasizing the need for further studies to elucidate the complex mechanisms underlying NDDs and to translate these findings into clinical practice. This paper not only advances our understanding of the epigenetic landscape of NDDs but also opens up new avenues for diagnosis and treatment, offering hope for individuals affected by these conditions."

    "abstract": "Autism (or autism spectrum disorder) was initially defined as a psychiatric disorder, with the likely cause maternal behavior (the very destructive \"refrigerator mother\" theory). It took several decades for research into brain mechanisms to become established. Both neuropathological and imaging studies found differences in the cerebellum in autism spectrum disorder, the most widely documented being a decreased density of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex. The popular interpretation of these results is that cerebellar neuropathology is a critical cause of autism spectrum disorder. We challenge that view by arguing that if fewer Purkinje cells are critical for autism spectrum disorder, then any condition that causes the loss of Purkinje cells should also cause autism spectrum disorder. We will review data on damage to the cerebellum from cerebellar lesions, tumors, and several syndromes (Joubert syndrome, Fragile X, and tuberous sclerosis). Collectively, these studies raise the question of whether the cerebellum really has a role in autism spectrum disorder. Autism spectrum disorder is now recognized as a genetically caused developmental disorder. A better understanding of the genes that underlie the differences in brain development that result in autism spectrum disorder is likely to show that these genes affect the development of the cerebellum in parallel with the development of the structures that do underlie autism spectrum disorder."

These are promising for the potential to, in future, become part of the mainstay treatment in addressing the core symptoms of ASD. Although it is likely that the development of future targeted treatments will be influenced by the underlying heterogeneity in etiology, associated genetic mechanisms influencing ASD are likely to be the first targets of treatments and even gene therapy in the future for ASD. In this article, we provide a review of current psychopharmacological treatment in ASD including those used to address common comorbidities of the condition and upcoming new targeted approaches in autism management. Medications including metformin, arbaclofen, cannabidiol, oxytocin, bumetanide, lovastatin, trofinetide, and dietary supplements including sulforophane and N-acetylcysteine are discussed. Commonly used medications to address the comorbidities associated with ASD including atypical antipsychotics, serotoninergic agents, alpha-2 agonists, and stimulant medications are also reviewed. Targeted treatments in Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common genetic disorder leading to ASD, provide a model for new treatments that may be helpful for other forms of ASD.

Further, we reveal that Kir4.1 mRNA is a binding target of FMRP. Finally, we show that the deficit in astroglial Kir4.1 underlies neuronal hyperexcitability and several behavioral defects in Fmr1 knockout mice. Viral delivery of Kir4.1 channels specifically to hippocampal astrocytes from Fmr1 knockout mice indeed rescues normal astrocyte potassium uptake, neuronal excitability, and cognitive and social performance.

Dual-tasking (DT) cognitive-motor paradigms and challenging balance conditions may have the capacity to reveal markers of FXTAS onset. Our objectives were to determine the impact of dual-tasking and sensory and stance manipulation on balance in FXTAS and potentially detect subtle postural sway deficits in <i>FMR1</i> PMCs who are asymptomatic for signs of FXTAS on clinical exam. Participants with FXTAS, PMCs without FXTAS, and controls underwent balance testing using an inertial sensor system. Stance, vision, surface stability, and cognitive demand were manipulated in 30 s trials. FXTAS participants had significantly greater total sway area, jerk, and RMS sway than controls under almost all balance conditions but were most impaired in those requiring vestibular control. PMCs without FXTAS had significantly greater RMS sway compared with controls in the feet apart, firm, single task conditions both with eyes open and closed (EC) and the feet together, firm, EC, DT condition. Postural sway deficits in the RMS postural sway variability domain in asymptomatic PMCs might represent prodromal signs of FXTAS.

This is achieved through its trafficking signals, nuclear localization signal (NLS), nuclear export signal (NES), and nucleolar localization signal (NoLS), as well as its RNA and protein binding domains, and it is modulated by various post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and methylation.

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) arises from the loss of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) needed for normal neuronal excitability and circuit functions. Recent work revealed that FMRP contributes to mossy fiber long-term potentiation by adjusting the Kv4 A-type current availability through interactions with a Cav3-Kv4 ion channel complex, yet the mechanism has not yet been defined. In this study using wild-type and <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out (KO) tsA-201 cells and cerebellar sections from male <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice, we show that FMRP associates with all subunits of the Cav3.1-Kv4.3-KChIP3 complex and is critical to enabling calcium-dependent shifts in Kv4.3 inactivation to modulate the A-type current. Specifically, upon depolarization Cav3 calcium influx activates dual-specific phosphatase 1/6 (DUSP1/6) to deactivate ERK1/2 (ERK) and lower phosphorylation of Kv4.3, a signaling pathway that does not function in <i>Fmr1</i> KO cells. In <i>Fmr1</i> KO mouse tissue slices, cerebellar granule cells exhibit a hyperexcitable response to membrane depolarizations. Either incubating <i>Fmr1</i> KO cells or in vivo administration of a tat-conjugated FMRP N-terminus fragment (FMRP-N-tat) rescued Cav3-Kv4 function and granule cell excitability, with a decrease in the level of DUSP6. Together these data reveal a Cav3-activated DUSP signaling pathway critical to the function of a FMRP-Cav3-Kv4 complex that is misregulated in <i>Fmr1</i> KO conditions. Moreover, FMRP-N-tat restores function of this complex to rescue calcium-dependent control of neuronal excitability as a potential therapeutic approach to alleviating the symptoms of FXS."

Research indicates that up to 80% of the variation in IQ scores among individuals with syndromic IDDs is attributable to nongenetic effects, including social-environmental factors. In this narrative review, we summarize evidence of the influence that factors related to economic stability (focused on due to its prevalence in existing literature) have on IQ in individuals with syndromic IDDs. We also highlight the pathways through which economic stability is hypothesized to impact cognitive development and drive individual differences in IQ among individuals with syndromic IDDs. We also identify broader social-environmental factors (e.g., social determinants of health) that warrant consideration in future research, but that have not yet been explored in syndromic IDDs. We conclude by making recommendations to address the urgent need for further research into other salient factors associated with heterogeneity in IQ. These recommendations ultimately may shape individual- and community-level interventions and may inform systems-level public policy efforts to promote the cognitive development of and improve the lived experiences of individuals with syndromic IDDs."

This study focused on the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQoL), the Anxiety, Depression and Mood Scale (ADAMS), the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), but did include other cognitive tests (Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales, Nonverbal IQ, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule). We identified significant associations between decreases in emotional, social and school domains of PedsQoL and the ADAMS subtests of Generalized Anxiety, Manic/Hyperactivity and Obsessive/Compulsivity, with the subtest of Depressed Mood having associations with lower physical and emotional domains. We also identified a significant impact between CSHQ subtests of Sleep Anxiety, Night Wakings, Daytime Sleepiness, and Parasomnia with the emotional and school domains of PedsQoL. There were associations connecting school functioning with Bedtime Resistance, and additional associations connecting emotional functioning with Sleep Duration and Sleep Onset Delay. Physical functioning was also associated with Sleep Anxiety. Our study shows how mental health and sleep defects impact improper sleep patterns and mental health which leads to decreases in the quality of life for individuals with FXS, and how it is important to screen for these symptoms in order to alleviate issues."

    "abstract": "Neuronal hyperexcitability within developing cortical circuits is a common characteristic of several heritable neurodevelopmental disorders, including Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). While this aberrant circuitry is typically studied from a neuron-centric perspective, glial cells secrete soluble factors that regulate both neurite extension and synaptogenesis during development. The nucleotide-mediated purinergic signalling system is particularly instrumental in facilitating these effects. We recently reported that within a FXS animal model, the Fmr1 KO mouse, the purinergic signalling system is upregulated in cortical astrocytes leading to altered secretion of synaptogenic and plasticity-related proteins. In this study, we examined whether elevated astrocyte purinergic signalling also impacts neuronal morphology and connectivity of Fmr1 KO cortical neurons. Here, we found that conditioned media from primary Fmr1 KO astrocytes was sufficient to enhance neurite extension and complexity of both wildtype and Fmr1 KO neurons to a similar degree as UTP-mediated outgrowth. Significantly enhanced firing was also observed in Fmr1 KO neuron-astrocyte co-cultures grown on microelectrode arrays but was associated with large deficits in firing synchrony. The selective P2Y<sub>2</sub> purinergic receptor antagonist AR-C 118925XX effectively normalized much of the aberrant Fmr1 KO activity, designating P2Y<sub>2</sub> as a potential therapeutic target in FXS. These results not only demonstrate the importance of astrocyte soluble factors in the development of neural circuitry, but also show that P2Y purinergic receptors play a distinct role in pathological FXS neuronal activity."

The three KH domains (KH0, KH1 and KH2) within FMRP are recognized for their roles in mRNA binding. In the context of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), over-and-above CGG triplet repeats expansion, three specific point mutations have been identified, each affecting one of the three KH domains (<sup>R138Q</sup>KH0, <sup>G266E</sup>KH1, and <sup>I304N</sup>KH2) resulting in the expression of non-functional FMRP. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the loss of function associated with the <sup>G266E</sup>KH1 pathological variant. We investigate the conformational and dynamic properties of the isolated KH1 domain and the two KH1 site-directed mutants <sup>G266E</sup>KH1 and <sup>G266A</sup>KH1. Employing a combined in vitro and in silico approach, we reveal that the <sup>G266E</sup>KH1 variant lacks the characteristic features of a folded domain. This observation provides an explanation for functional impairment observed in FMRP carrying the G266E mutation within the KH1 domain, as it renders the domain unable to fold properly. Molecular Dynamics simulations suggest a pivotal role for residue 266 in regulating the structural stability of the KH domains, primarily through stabilizing the α-helices of the domain. Overall, these findings enhance our comprehension of the molecular basis for the dysfunction associated with the <sup>G266E</sup>KH1 variant in FMRP."

    "abstract": "High-penetrance mutations affecting mental health can involve genes ubiquitously expressed in the brain. Whether the specific patterns of dysfunctions result from ubiquitous circuit deficits or might reflect selective vulnerabilities of targetable subnetworks has remained unclear. Here, we determine how loss of ubiquitously expressed fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the cause of fragile X syndrome, affects brain networks in Fmr1y/- mice. We find that in wild-type mice, area-specific knockout of FMRP in the adult mimics behavioral consequences of area-specific silencing. By contrast, the functional axis linking the ventral hippocampus (vH) to the prelimbic cortex (PreL) is selectively affected in constitutive Fmr1y/- mice. A chronic alteration in late-born parvalbumin interneuron networks across the vH-PreL axis rescued by VIP signaling specifically accounts for deficits in vH-PreL theta-band network coherence, ensemble assembly, and learning functions of Fmr1y/- mice. Therefore, vH-PreL axis function exhibits a selective vulnerability to loss of FMRP in the vH or PreL, leading to learning and memory dysfunctions in fragile X mice."

To investigate underlying neuronal processing defects located in the auditory cortex (AC), we performed two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in <i>FMR1</i> (<i>fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein</i> <i>1</i>) knock-out (KO) mice, a model for fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of hereditary ASD in humans. For primary AC (A1) and the anterior auditory field (AAF), topographic frequency representation was less ordered compared with control animals. We additionally analyzed ensemble AC activity in response to various sounds and found subfield-specific differences. In A1, ensemble correlations were lower in general, while in secondary AC (A2), correlations were higher in response to complex sounds, but not to pure tones. Furthermore, sound specificity of ensemble activity was decreased in AAF. Repeating these experiments 1 week later revealed no major differences regarding representational drift. Nevertheless, we found subfield- and genotype-specific changes in ensemble correlation values between the two times points, hinting at alterations in network stability in <i>FMR1</i> KO mice. These detailed insights into AC network activity and topography in <i>FMR1</i> KO mice add to the understanding of auditory processing defects in FXS."

    "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotomimetic constituent of Cannabis sativa, has been recently approved for epileptic syndromes often associated with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the putative efficacy and mechanism of action of CBD in patients suffering from ASD and related comorbidities remain debated, especially because of the complex pharmacology of CBD. We used pharmacological, immunohistochemical and biochemical approaches to investigate the effects and mechanisms of action of CBD in the recently validated Fmr1-<sup>Δ</sup>exon 8 rat model of ASD, that is also a model of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the leading monogenic cause of autism. CBD rescued the cognitive deficits displayed by juvenile Fmr1-<sup>Δ</sup>exon 8 animals, without inducing tolerance after repeated administration. Blockade of CA1 hippocampal GPR55 receptors prevented the beneficial effect of both CBD and the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor URB597 in the short-term recognition memory deficits displayed by Fmr1-<sup>Δ</sup>exon 8 rats. Thus, CBD may exert its beneficial effects through CA1 hippocampal GPR55 receptors. Docking analysis further confirmed that the mechanism of action of CBD might involve competition for brain fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) that deliver anandamide and related bioactive lipids to their catabolic enzyme FAAH. These findings demonstrate that CBD reduced cognitive deficits in a rat model of FXS and provide initial mechanistic insights into its therapeutic potential in neurodevelopmental disorders."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading known genetic cause of intellectual disability with symptoms that include increased anxiety and social and sensory processing deficits. Recent electroencephalographic (EEG) studies in humans with FXS have identified neural oscillation deficits that include increased resting state gamma power, increased amplitude of auditory evoked potentials, and reduced phase locking of sound-evoked gamma oscillations. Similar EEG phenotypes are present in mouse models of FXS, but very little is known about the development of such abnormal responses. In the current study, we employed a 30-channel mouse multielectrode array (MEA) system to record and analyze resting and stimulus-evoked EEG signals in male P21 and P91 WT and Fmr1 KO mice. This led to several novel findings. First, P91, but not P21, Fmr1 KO mice have significantly increased resting EEG power in the low- and high-gamma frequency bands. Second, both P21 and P91 Fmr1 KO mice have markedly attenuated inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) to spectrotemporally dynamic auditory stimuli as well as to 40 Hz and 80 Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR) stimuli. This suggests abnormal temporal processing from early development that may lead to abnormal speech and language function in FXS. Third, we found hemispheric asymmetry of fast temporal processing in the mouse auditory cortex in WT but not Fmr1 KO mice. Together, these findings define a set of EEG phenotypes in young and adult mice that can serve as translational targets for genetic and pharmacological manipulation in phenotypic rescue studies."

FXTAS is associated with elevated levels of FMR1 mRNA, leading to neurodegenerative manifestations such as tremors and ataxia.Mounting evidence suggests a link between both syndromes and mitochondrial dysfunction (MDF). In this minireview, we critically examine the intricate relationship between FXS, FXTAS, and MDF, focusing on potential therapeutic avenues to counteract or mitigate their adverse effects. Specifically, we explore the role of mitochondrial cofactors and antioxidants, with a particular emphasis on alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), carnitine (CARN) and Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10).

The carrier rate of single gene disease, the detection rate of high-risk parents, and the clinical outcome of high-risk parents were statistically analyzed. A total of 1372 Chinese Han ethnicity patients underwent PECS, among which 458 patients underwent the extended 108-gene test, their overall carrier rate was 31.7%, and the detection rate of high-risk parents was 0.3%. The highest carrier rates were SLC22A (2.4%), ATP7B (2.4%), MMACHC (2.2%), PAH (1.8%), GALC (1.8%), MLC1 (1.3%), UNC13D (1.1%), CAPN3 (1.1%), and PKHD1 (1.1%).

    "abstract": "Altered function of peripheral sensory neurons is an emerging mechanism for symptoms of autism spectrum disorders. Visual sensitivities are common in autism, but whether differences in the retina might underlie these sensitivities is not well-understood. We explored retinal function in the Fmr1 knockout model of Fragile X syndrome, focusing on a specific type of retinal neuron, the \"sustained On alpha\" retinal ganglion cell. We found that these cells exhibit changes in dendritic structure and dampened responses to light in the Fmr1 knockout. We show that decreased light sensitivity is due to increased inhibitory input and reduced E-I balance. The change in E-I balance supports maintenance of circuit excitability similar to what has been observed in cortex. These results show that loss of Fmr1 in the mouse retina affects sensory function of one retinal neuron type. Our findings suggest that the retina may be relevant for understanding visual function in Fragile X syndrome."

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are involved in multiple aspects of neurodevelopmental processes and play a major role in the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to neuro-degenerative diseases. Fragile-X-related disorders (FXDs) are genetic conditions that occur due to the dynamic expansion of CGG repeats of the <i>FMR1</i> gene encoding for the RNA-binding protein FMRP, particularly expressed in the brain. This gene expansion can lead to premutation (PM, 56-200 CGGs), full mutation (FM, >200 CGGs), or unmethylated FM (UFM), resulting in neurodegeneration, neurodevelopmental disorders, or no apparent intellectual disability, respectively. To investigate the mitochondrial mechanisms that are involved in the FXD patients, we analyzed mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics in fibroblasts derived from patients. Donut-shaped mitochondrial morphology and excessive synthesis of critical mitochondrial proteins were detected in FM, PM, and UFM cells. Analysis of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in situ reveals lower respiration in PM fibroblasts. Importantly, mitochondrial permeability transition-dependent apoptosis is sensitized to reactive oxygen species in FM, PM, and UFM models. This study elucidated the mitochondrial mechanisms that are involved in the FXD phenotypes, and indicated altered mitochondrial function and morphology. Importantly, a sensitization to permeability transition and apoptosis was revealed in FXD cells. Overall, our data suggest that mitochondria are novel drug targets to relieve the FXD symptoms."

The syndrome is often caused by greatly reduced or absent protein expression from the <i>fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1</i> (<i>FMR1</i>) gene due to expansion of a 5'-non-coding trinucleotide (CGG) element beyond 200 repeats (full mutation). To better understand the complex relationships among <i>FMR1</i> allelotype, methylation status, mRNA expression, and <i>FMR1</i> protein (FMRP) levels, FMRP was quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells for a large cohort of FXS (<i>n</i> = 154) and control (<i>n</i> = 139) individuals using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Considerable size and methylation mosaicism were observed among individuals with FXS, with FMRP detected only in the presence of such mosaicism. No sample with a minimum allele size greater than 273 CGG repeats had significant levels of FMRP. Additionally, an association was observed between <i>FMR1</i> mRNA and FMRP levels in FXS samples, predominantly driven by those with the lowest FMRP values. This study underscores the complexity of <i>FMR1</i> allelotypes and FMRP expression and prompts a reevaluation of FXS therapies aimed at reactivating large full mutation alleles that are likely not capable of producing sufficient FMRP to improve cognitive function."

Those with a complete lack of methylation are rare, with little literature about the cognitive and behavioral phenotypes of these individuals. A review of past literature was conducted regarding individuals with unmethylated and mosaic <i>FMR1</i> FM. We report three patients with an unmethylated FM <i>FMR1</i> alleles without any behavioral or cognitive deficits. This is an unusual presentation for men with FM as most patients with an unmethylated FM and no behavioral phenotypes do not receive fragile X DNA testing or a diagnosis of FXS. Our cases showed that mosaic males with unmethylated <i>FMR1</i> FM alleles may lack behavioral phenotypes due to the presence of smaller alleles producing the <i>FMR1</i> protein (FMRP). However, these individuals could be at a higher risk of developing fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) due to the increased expression of mRNA, similar to those who only have a premutation."

We evaluated the clinical characteristics and trajectory of patients with CTD and the impact of the disease on caregivers to identify relevant endpoints for future therapeutic trials. As part of a French National Research Program, patients with CTD were included based on (1) a pathogenic <i>SLC6A8</i> variant and (2) ID and/or autism spectrum disorder. Families and patients were referred by the physician who ordered the genetic analysis through Reference Centers of ID from rare causes and inherited metabolic diseases. After we informed the patients and their parents/guardians about the study, all of them gave written consent and were included. A control group of age-matched and sex-matched patients with Fragile X syndrome was also included. Physical examination, neuropsychological assessments, and caregiver impact were assessed. All data were analyzed using R software. Thirty-one patients (27 male, 4 female) were included (25/31 aged 18 years or younger). Most of the patients (71%) had symptoms at <24 months of age. The mean age at diagnosis was 6.5 years. Epilepsy occurred in 45% (mean age at onset: 8 years). Early-onset behavioral disorder occurred in 82%. Developmental trajectory was consistently delayed (fine and gross motor skills, language, and communication/sociability). Half of the patients with CTD had axial hypotonia during the first year of life. All patients were able to walk without help, but 7/31 had ataxia and only 14/31 could walk tandem gait. Most of them had abnormal fine motor skills (27/31), and most of them had language impairment (30/31), but 12/23 male patients (52.2%) completed the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Approximately half (14/31) had slender build. Most of them needed nursing care (20/31), generally 1-4 h/d. Adaptive assessment (Vineland) confirmed that male patients with CTD had moderate-to-severe ID. Most caregivers (79%) were at risk of burnout, as shown by Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) > 36 (significantly higher than for patients with Fragile X syndrome) with a high burden of time dependence. In addition to clinical endpoints, such as the assessment of epilepsy and the developmental trajectory of the patient, the Vineland scale, PPVT5, and CBI are of particular interest as outcome measures for future trials.

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable form of intellectual disability and is caused by CGG repeat expansions exceeding 200 (full mutation). Such expansions lead to hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene. As a consequence, little or no FMR1 protein (FMRP) is produced; absence of the protein, which normally is responsible for neuronal development and maintenance, causes the syndrome. Previous studies have demonstrated the causal relationship between FMRP levels and cognitive abilities in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and dermal fibroblast cell lines of patients with FXS. However, it is arguable whether PBMCs or fibroblasts would be the preferred surrogate for measuring molecular markers, particularly FMRP, to represent the cognitive impairment, a core symptom of FXS. To address this concern, CGG repeats, methylation status, FMR1 mRNA, and FMRP levels were measured in both PBMCs and fibroblasts derived from 66 individuals. The findings indicated a strong association between FMR1 mRNA expression levels and CGG repeat numbers in PBMCs of premutation males after correcting for methylation status. Moreover, FMRP expression levels from both PBMCs and fibroblasts of male participants with a hypermethylated full mutation and with mosaicism demonstrated significant association between the intelligence quotient levels and FMRP levels, suggesting that PBMCs may be preferable for FXS clinical studies, because of their greater accessibility."

Many fragile X syndrome cases present with autism spectrum disorder and fragile X syndrome cases account for up to 5% of all autism spectrum disorder cases. The cellular composition of the fragile X syndrome cortex is not well known. We evaluated alterations in the number of Calbindin, Calretinin, and Parvalbumin expressing interneurons across 5 different cortical areas, medial prefrontal cortex (BA46), primary somatosensory cortex (BA3), primary motor cortex (BA4), superior temporal cortex (BA22), and anterior cingulate cortex (BA24) of fragile X syndrome and neurotypical brains. Compared with neurotypical cases, fragile X syndrome brains displayed a significant reduction in the number of PV+ interneurons in all areas and of CR+ interneurons in BA22 and BA3. The number of CB+ interneurons did not differ. These findings are the first to demonstrate that fragile X syndrome brains are characterized by cortical wide PV+ interneuron deficits across multiple cortical areas. These add to the idea that deficits in PV+ interneurons could disrupt the cortical balance and promote clinical deficits in fragile X syndrome patients and help to develop novel therapies for neurodevelopmental disorders like fragile X syndrome and autism spectrum disorder."

Dysregulated protein synthesis is a central effect of FMRP loss, however, direct translational modulation has not been leveraged in the treatment of FXS. Thus, we examined the effect of the translational modulator integrated stress response inhibitor (ISRIB) in treating synaptic and behavioral symptoms of FXS. We show that FMRP loss dysregulates synaptic protein abundance, stabilizing dendritic spines through increased PSD-95 levels while preventing spine maturation through reduced glutamate receptor accumulation, thus leading to the formation of dense, immature dendritic spines, characteristic of FXS patients and <i>Fmr1</i> knockout (KO) mice. ISRIB rescues these deficits and improves social recognition in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice.

Recent studies have uncovered important differences between infants with fragile X syndrome (FXS) and infants with familial history of autism spectrum disorder who go on to develop autism themselves (FH-ASD), including differences in brain development and behavior. Thus far, there have been no studies longitudinally investigating differential developmental skill profiles in FXS and FH-ASD infants. The current study contrasted longitudinal trajectories of verbal (expressive and receptive language) and nonverbal (gross and fine motor, visual reception) skills in FXS and FH-ASD infants, compared to FH infants who did not develop ASD (FH-nonASD) and typically developing controls. Infants with FXS showed delays on a nonverbal composite compared to FH-ASD (as well as FH-nonASD and control) infants as early as 6 months of age. By 12 months an ordinal pattern of scores was established between groups on all domains tested, such that controls > FH-nonASD > FH-ASD > FXS. This pattern persisted through 24 months. Cognitive level differentially influenced developmental trajectories for FXS and FH-ASD. Our results demonstrate detectable group differences by 6 months between FXS and FH-ASD as well as differential trajectories on each domain throughout infancy. This work further highlights an earlier onset of global cognitive delays in FXS and, conversely, a protracted period of more slowly emerging delays in FH-ASD. Divergent neural and cognitive development in infancy between FXS and FH-ASD contributes to our understanding of important distinctions in the development and behavioral phenotype of these two groups."

Subtle differences in gaze following abilities may contribute to the diverse range social and communicative autistic characteristics observed across people with genetic syndromes, such as Cornelia de Lange (CdLS) and fragile X (FXS) syndromes. To compare profiles of 1) visual attention to the eye region at critical points of the attention direction process, 2) whether children follow the gaze cue to the object, and 3) participant looking time to the target object following the gaze cue between groups and conditions. Children with CdLS (N = 11) and FXS (N = 8) and autistic (N = 22) and neurotypical (N = 15) children took part in a passive viewing paradigm adapted from Senju and Csibra (2008), in which videos of a central cue (ball/cartoon face/human face) directed attention towards one of two objects. Visual attention patterns were recorded via eye tracking technology. Neurotypical children were used as a reference group against which the autistic, CdLS and FXS groups were compared. Although autistic children looked at the eye region for significantly less time, they looked at the target object as frequently and for a similar duration as neurotypical children. Children with FXS looked at the target as frequently as neurotypical children but looked at it for comparatively less time. Both neurotypical children and children with CdLS frequently looked at the eye region, but children with CdLS were less likely to look at the target than neurotypical children. Findings provide preliminary evidence of unique patterns of visual attention and gaze following strategies in children with CdLS, children with FXS and autistic children. These unique gaze following patterns may underpin the distinct profiles of social and communication autistic traits observed between these groups."

Given the continued postnatal neurogenesis that occurs in the mammalian olfactory system, it provides an ideal model for understanding how disruptions in distinct stages of neurogenesis contribute to the pathophysiology of various NDDs. This review summarizes and discusses what is currently known about the disruption of neurogenesis within the olfactory system as it pertains to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and Rett syndrome.

However, these associations remain unexamined in FXS, or FXS + ASD. In this study, we aimed to determine the associations between early motor skills and their rate of development on communication outcomes in FXS. Furthermore, we investigated whether these associations varied in the context of co-occurring FXS + ASD. Results revealed within-FXS variation in the context of co-occurring ASD between some aspects of motor development and communication outcomes, yet within-FXS consistency between others.

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder with a prevalence of around 1% children worldwide and characterized by patient behaviour (communication, social interaction, and personal development). Data on the efficacy of diagnostic tests using copy number variations (CNVs) in candidate genes in ASD is currently around 10% but it is overrepresented by patients of Caucasian background. We report here that the diagnostic success of de novo candidate CNVs in Vietnamese ASD patients is around 6%. We recruited one hundred trios (both parents and a child) where the child was clinically diagnosed with ASD while the parents were not affected. We performed genetic screening to exclude RETT syndrome and Fragile X syndrome and performed genome-wide DNA microarray (aCGH) on all probands and their parents to analyse for de novo CNVs. We detected 1708 non-redundant CNVs in 100 patients and 118 (7%) of them were de novo. Using the filter for known CNVs from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) database, we identified six CNVs (one gain and five loss CNVs) in six patients (3 males and 3 females). Notably, 3 of our patients had a deletion involving the SHANK3 gene-which is the highest compared to previous reports. This is the first report of candidate CNVs in ASD patients from Vietnam and provides the framework for building a CNV based test as the first tier screening for clinical management."

    "abstract": "Kinesin 1 (KIF5) is one major type of motor protein in neurons, but its members' function in the intact brain remains less studied. Using in vivo two-photon imaging, we find that conditional knockout of Kif5b (KIF5B cKO) in CaMKIIα-Cre-expressing neurons shows heightened turnover and lower stability of dendritic spines in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons with reduced spine postsynaptic density protein 95 acquisition in the mouse cortex. Furthermore, the RNA-binding protein fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is translocated to the proximity of newly formed spines several hours before the spine formation events in vivo in control mice, but this preceding transport of FMRP is abolished in KIF5B cKO mice. We further find that FMRP is localized closer to newly formed spines after fear extinction, but this learning-dependent localization is disrupted in KIF5B cKO mice. Our findings provide the crucial in vivo evidence that KIF5B is involved in the dendritic targeting of synaptic proteins that underlies dendritic spine plasticity."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurological disorder caused by epigenetic silencing of the <i>FMR1</i> gene. Reactivation of <i>FMR1</i> is a potential therapeutic approach for FXS that would correct the root cause of the disease. Here, using a candidate-based shRNA screen, we identify nine epigenetic repressors that promote silencing of <i>FMR1</i> in FXS cells (called <i>FMR1</i> Silencing Factors, or <i>FMR1</i>- SFs). Inhibition of <i>FMR1</i>-SFs with shRNAs or small molecules reactivates <i>FMR1</i> in cultured undifferentiated induced pluripotent stem cells, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and post-mitotic neurons derived from FXS patients. One of the <i>FMR1</i>-SFs is the histone methyltransferase EZH2, for which an FDA-approved small molecule inhibitor, EPZ6438 (also known as tazemetostat), is available. We show that EPZ6438 substantially corrects the characteristic molecular and electrophysiological abnormalities of cultured FXS neurons. Unfortunately, EZH2 inhibitors do not efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier, limiting their therapeutic use for FXS. Recently, antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-based approaches have been developed as effective treatment options for certain central nervous system disorders. We therefore derived efficacious ASOs targeting EZH2 and demonstrate that they reactivate <i>FMR1</i> expression and correct molecular and electrophysiological abnormalities in cultured FXS neurons, and reactivate <i>FMR1</i> expression in human FXS NPCs engrafted within the brains of mice. Collectively, our results establish EZH2 inhibition in general, and EZH2 ASOs in particular, as a therapeutic approach for FXS."

Extensive preclinical work in several FXS animal models supported the therapeutic potential of decreasing metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) signaling to correct translation of proteins related to synaptic plasticity; however, multiple clinical trials failed to show conclusive evidence of efficacy. In this issue of the JCI, Berry-Kravis and colleagues conducted the FXLEARN clinical trial to address experimental design concerns from previous trials. Unfortunately, despite treatment of young children with combined pharmacological and learning interventions for a prolonged period, no efficacy of blocking mGluR activity was observed. Future systematic evaluation of potential therapeutic approaches should evaluate consistency between human and animal pathophysiological mechanisms, utilize innovative clinical trial design from FXLEARN, and incorporate translatable biomarkers."

These GC-rich repeats form RNA secondary structures that support repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation of toxic proteins that contribute to disease pathogenesis. Here we assessed whether these same repeats might trigger stalling and interfere with translational elongation. We find that depletion of ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) factors NEMF, LTN1 and ANKZF1 markedly boost RAN translation product accumulation from both G4C2 and CGG repeats while overexpression of these factors reduces RAN production in both reporter assays and C9ALS/FTD patient iPSC-derived neurons. We also detected partially made products from both G4C2 and CGG repeats whose abundance increased with RQC factor depletion. Repeat RNA sequence, rather than amino acid content, is central to the impact of RQC factor depletion on RAN translation-suggesting a role for RNA secondary structure in these processes. Together, these findings suggest that ribosomal stalling and RQC pathway activation during RAN translation inhibits the generation of toxic RAN products. We propose augmenting RQC activity as a therapeutic strategy in GC-rich repeat expansion disorders."

The current study examined relationships between parent behavior (i.e., responsivity and behavior management) and child language performance in both mother-child and father-child interactions, as well as relationships between child characteristics and both parent behavior and child language. Participants were 23 families of young boys with FXS between 3 and 7 years of age. Mothers and fathers independently completed questionnaires assessing child characteristics and separately engaged in 12-min play-based interactions with their child via telehealth. One parent also completed a comprehensive interview assessing child adaptive behavior. Video recordings of the parent-child interactions were transcribed and coded for parent and child behavior, and measures of parent and child language were obtained from the transcripts. Mothers and fathers used similar rates of responsive behaviors during parent-child interactions, and parental responsivity was positively associated with some aspects of child language performance (i.e., talkativeness and lexical diversity). Parental behavior, however, was not associated with syntactic complexity. Older children and children with higher levels of adaptive behavior had parents who used higher rates of responsive behaviors. Fathers used higher rates of behavior management strategies compared to mothers, and this type of parent behavior was not associated with child language. Overall, this study provides evidence that interventions focused on increasing parental responsiveness would be beneficial for families of children with FXS and that these interventions should be delivered early given the association between responsivity and child age. https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25229939."

Gene editing systems can potentially alter disease trajectory by correcting dysfunctional mutations or therapeutically altering gene expression. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches are attractive gene therapy platforms to personalize treatments because of their specificity, ease of design, versatility, and cost. However, many such approaches remain in the early stages of development, with ongoing efforts to optimize editing efficiency, minimize unintended off-target effects, and mitigate pathologic immune responses. Given the rapid evolution of CRISPR-based therapies, it is prudent for the clinically based child neurologist to have a conceptual understanding of what such therapies may entail, including both benefits and risks and how such therapies may be clinically applied. In this review, we describe the fundamentals of CRISPR-based therapies, discuss the opportunities and challenges that have arisen, and highlight preclinical work in several pediatric neurological diseases."

Based on this review to date there is limited data to support any specific pharmacological treatments, although the data for cannabinoids are encouraging in those with FXS and in future developments in gene therapy may provide the answer to the search for precision medicine.

    "abstract": "<i>MECP2, CDKL5,</i> and <i>FMR1</i> are three X-linked neurodevelopmental genes associated with Rett, CDKL5-, and fragile-X syndrome, respectively. These syndromes are characterized by distinct constellations of severe cognitive and neurobehavioral anomalies, reflecting the broad but unique expression patterns of each of the genes in the brain. As these disorders are not thought to be neurodegenerative and may be reversible, a major goal has been to restore expression of the functional proteins in the patient's brain. Strategies have included gene therapy, gene editing, and selective Xi-reactivation methodologies. However, tissue penetration and overall delivery to various regions of the brain remain challenging for each strategy. Thus, gaining insights into how much restoration would be required and what regions/cell types in the brain must be targeted for meaningful physiological improvement would be valuable. As a step toward addressing these questions, here we perform a meta-analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data from the human brain across multiple developmental stages, in various brain regions, and in multiple donors. We observe a substantial degree of expression variability for <i>MECP2</i>, <i>CDKL5</i>, and <i>FMR1</i> not only across cell types but also between donors. The wide range of expression may help define a therapeutic window, with the low end delineating a minimum level required to restore physiological function and the high end informing toxicology margin. Finally, the inter-cellular and inter-individual variability enable identification of co-varying genes and will facilitate future identification of biomarkers."

FXS is the leading cause of inherited intellectual disabilities and the most commonly known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder. Children with FXS experience behavioral and sleep problems, anxiety, inattention, learning difficulties, and speech and language delays. There are no approved medications for FXS; however, there are several interventions and treatments aimed at managing the symptoms and improving the quality of life of individuals with FXS. A combination of non-pharmacological therapies and pharmacotherapy is currently the most effective treatment for FXS.

In autism and Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), disruptions in pup-dam USV communication hint at a possible connection between abnormal early developmental USV communication and the later emergence of communication and social deficits. Here, we gathered USVs from PND 10 FXS pups during a short period of separation from their mothers, encompassing animals of all possible genotypes and both sexes (i.e., Fmr1-/y vs. Fmr1+/y males and Fmr1+/+, +/-, and -/- females). This allowed comparing the influence of sex and gene dosage on pups' communication capabilities. Leveraging DeepSqueak and analyzing vocal patterns, intricate vocal behaviors such as call structure, duration, frequency modulation, and temporal patterns were examined. Furthermore, homing behavior was assessed as a sensitive indicator of early cognitive development and social discrimination. This behavior relies on the use of olfactory and thermal cues to navigate and search for the maternal or nest odor in the surrounding space. The results show that FMRP-deficient pups of both sexes display an increased inclination to vocalize when separated from their mothers, and this behavior is accompanied by significant sex-specific changes in the main features of their USVs as well as in body weight. Analysis of the vocal repertoire and syntactic usage revealed that Fmr1 gene silencing primarily alters the USVs' qualitative composition in males. Moreover, sex-specific effects of Fmr1 silencing on locomotor activity and homing behavior were observed. FMRP deficiency in females increased activity, reduced nest-reaching time, and extended nest time. In males, it prolonged nest-reaching time and reduced nest time without affecting locomotion. These findings highlight the interplay between Fmr1 gene dosage and sex in influencing communicative and cognitive skills during infancy."

    "abstract": "NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) play a crucial role in synaptogenesis, circuit development, and synaptic plasticity, serving as fundamental components in cellular models of learning and memory. Their dysregulation has been implicated in several neurological disorders and synaptopathies. NMDARs are heterotetrameric complexes composed of two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits. The composition of GluN2 subunits determines the main biophysical properties of the channel, such as calcium permeability and gating kinetics, and influences the ability of the receptor to interact with postsynaptic proteins involved in normal synaptic physiology and plasticity, including scaffolding proteins and signaling molecules. During early development, NMDARs in the forebrain contain solely the GluN2B subunit, a necessary subunit for proper synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. As the animal matures, the expression of the GluN2A subunit increases, leading to a partial replacement of GluN2B-containing synaptic NMDARs with GluN2A-containing receptors. The switch in the synaptic GluN2A-to-GluN2B ratio has a significant impact on the kinetics of excitatory postsynaptic currents and diminishes the synaptic plasticity capacity. In this study, we present findings indicating that GluN2A expression occurs earlier in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS). This altered timing of GluN2A expression affects various important parameters of NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents, including maximal current amplitude, decay time, and response to consecutive stimuli delivered in close temporal proximity. These observations suggest that the early expression of GluN2A during a critical period when synapses and circuits are developing could be an underlying factor contributing to the formation of pathological circuits in the FXS mouse model.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> NMDA receptors (NMDARs) play important roles in synaptic transmission and are involved in multiple neurological disorders. During development, GluN2A in the forebrain becomes incorporated into previously GluN2B-dominated NMDARs, leading to the \"GluN2A/GluN2B ratio switch.\" This is a crucial step for normal brain development. Here we present findings indicating that GluN2A expression occurs earlier in the fragile X mouse and this could be an underlying factor contributing to the pathology found in the fragile X model."

The use of Fmr1 KO rats offers additional translational validity in this regard.

We found that these rats exhibit hyperactivity and cognitive deficits, along with characteristic bidirectional glutamatergic and GABAergic alterations in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. These results are coupled to affected excitability and local inhibitory processes in the hippocampus, along with a specific transcriptional profile, highlighting dysregulated hippocampal network activity in KO rats.

Although the mPTP is known to be a voltage-gated channel, the identity of its voltage sensor remains unknown. Here we found decreased gating potential of the mPTP and increased expression and activity of sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) in newborn Fragile X syndrome (FXS) mouse heart mitochondria, a model system of coenzyme Q excess and relatively decreased mPTP open probability. We further found that pharmacological inhibition and genetic silencing of SQOR increased mPTP open probability in vitro in adult murine cardiac mitochondria and in the isolated-perfused heart, likely by interfering with voltage sensing. Thus, SQOR is proposed to contribute to voltage sensing by the mPTP and may be a component of the voltage sensing apparatus that modulates the gating potential of the mPTP."

The clinical utility of a long-read sequencing-based assay termed comprehensive analysis of FXS (CAFXS) was evaluated in 238 high-risk samples by comparing to conventional PCR assays. PCR assays identified five premuation and three full mutation categories alleles in all the samples, and CAFXS successfully called all the FMR1 CGG expansion. CAFXS identified 24-bp microdeletions upstream to the trinucleotide region with 30 CGG repeats, which was miscalled by the length-based PCR methods. CAFXS also identified a 187-bp deletion in about 1/7 of the sequencing reads in a male patient with mosaic full mutation alleles.

Experimental and computational works established gamma rhythms as a global emergent property of neuronal networks generated by the balanced and coordinated interaction of excitation and inhibition. Coherently, gamma activity is strongly influenced by the alterations of synaptic dynamics which are often associated with pathological neural dysfunctions. We argue therefore that these oscillations are an optimal biomarker for probing the mechanism of cortical dysfunctions. Gamma oscillations are also highly sensitive to external stimuli in sensory cortices, especially the primary visual cortex (V1), where the stimulus dependence of gamma oscillations has been thoroughly investigated. Gamma manipulation by visual stimuli tuning is particularly easy in rodents, which have become a standard animal model for investigating the effects of network alterations on gamma oscillations. Overall, gamma in the rodents' visual cortex offers an accessible probe on dysfunctional information processing in pathological conditions. Beyond vision-related dysfunctions, alterations of gamma oscillations in rodents were indeed also reported in neural deficits such as migraine, epilepsy and neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders.

The loss of FMRP produces the fragile X syndrome (FXS), a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting synaptic and neuronal function and producing cognitive impairments. However, the effects of FXS on short-term processing of synaptic inputs and neuronal outputs in the hippocampus have not yet been sufficiently clarified. Furthermore, it is not known whether dorsal and ventral hippocampi are affected similarly or not in FXS. We used an Fmr1 knockout (KO) rat model of FXS and recordings of evoked field potentials from the CA1 field of transverse slices from both the dorsal and the ventral hippocampi of adult rats. Following application of a frequency stimulation protocol consisting of a ten-pulse train and recordings of fEPSP, we found that the dorsal but not ventral KO hippocampus shows altered short-term synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, applying the frequency stimulation protocol and recordings of population spikes, both segments of the KO hippocampus display altered short-term neuronal dynamics. These data suggest that short-term processing of synaptic inputs is affected in the dorsal, not ventral, FXS hippocampus, while short-term processing of neuronal output is affected in both segments of the FXS hippocampus in a similar way.

FMRP is most notably a translational repressor and is thought to inhibit translation elongation by stalling ribosomes as FMRP-bound polyribosomes from brain tissue are resistant to puromycin and nuclease treatment. Here, we present data showing that the C-terminal non-canonical RNA-binding domain of FMRP is essential and sufficient to induce puromycin-resistant mRNA•ribosome complexes. Given that stalled ribosomes can stimulate ribosome collisions and no-go mRNA decay (NGD), we tested the ability of FMRP to drive NGD of its target transcripts in neuroblastoma cells. Indeed, FMRP and ribosomal proteins, but not PABPC1, were enriched in isolated nuclease-resistant disomes compared to controls. Using siRNA knockdown and RNA-seq, we identified 16 putative FMRP-mediated NGD substrates, many of which encode proteins involved in neuronal development and function. Increased mRNA stability of the putative substrates was also observed when either FMRP was depleted or NGD was prevented via RNAi. Taken together, these data support that FMRP stalls ribosomes and can stimulate NGD of a select set of transcripts in cells, revealing an unappreciated role of FMRP that would be misregulated in FXS."

Understanding dentate circuit dysfunction in FXS has been complicated by the presence of two types of excitatory neurons, the granule cells and mossy cells. Here we report that loss of FMRP markedly decreased excitability of dentate mossy cells, a change opposite to all other known excitability defects in excitatory neurons in FXS. This mossy cell hypo-excitability is caused by increased Kv7 function in <i>Fmr1</i> knockout (KO) mice. By reducing the excitatory drive onto local hilar interneurons, hypo-excitability of mossy cells results in increased excitation/inhibition ratio in granule cells and thus paradoxically leads to excessive dentate output. Circuit-wide inhibition of Kv7 channels in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice increases inhibitory drive onto granule cells and normalizes the dentate output in response to physiologically relevant theta-gamma coupling stimulation. Our study suggests that circuit-based interventions may provide a promising strategy in this disorder to bypass irreconcilable excitability defects in different cell types and restore their pathophysiological consequences at the circuit level."

    "abstract": "Recent failures translating preclinical behavioral treatment effects to positive clinical trial results in humans with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) support refocusing attention on biological pathways and associated measures, such as electroencephalography (EEG), with strong translational potential and small molecule target engagement. This study utilized guided machine learning to test promising translational EEG measures (resting power and auditory chirp oscillatory variables) in a large heterogeneous sample of individuals with FXS to identify best performing EEG variables for reliably separating individuals with FXS, and genetically-mediated subgroups within FXS, from typically developing controls. Best performing variables included resting relative frontal theta power, all combined whole-head resting power bands, posterior peak alpha frequency (PAF), combined PAF across all measured regions, combined theta, alpha, and gamma power during the chirp, and all combined chirp oscillatory variables. Sub-group analyses best discriminated non-mosaic FXS males via whole-head resting relative power (AUC = .9250), even with data reduced to a 20-channel clinical montage. FXS females were nearly perfectly discriminated by combined theta, alpha, and gamma power during the chirp (AUC = .9522). Results support use of resting and auditory oscillatory tasks to reliably identify neural deficit in FXS, and to identify specific translational targets for genetically-mediated sub-groups, supporting potential points for stratification."

Increased duplications were also seen in FXS cells treated with SCR7, an inhibitor of Lig4, a ligase essential for NHEJ. Our study suggests that the fragile X (FX) locus is prone to spontaneous DNA damage that is normally repaired by NHEJ. We suggest that heterochromatinization of the FX allele may be triggered, at least in part, in response to this DNA damage."

We investigated the neurodevelopmental impacts of BPF exposure using Drosophila melanogaster as a model. Our transcriptomic analysis indicated that developmental exposure to BPF caused the downregulation of neurodevelopmentally relevant genes, including those associated with synapse formation and neuronal projection. To investigate the functional outcome of BPF exposure, we evaluated neurodevelopmental impacts across two genetic strains of Drosophila- w1118 (control) and the Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) model-by examining both behavioral and neuronal phenotypes. We found that BPF exposure in w1118 Drosophila caused hypoactive larval locomotor activity, decreased time spent grooming by adults, reduced courtship activity, and increased the severity but not frequency of β-lobe midline crossing defects by axons in the mushroom body. In contrast, although BPF reduced peristaltic contractions in FXS larvae, it had no impact on other larval locomotor phenotypes, grooming activity, or courtship activity. Strikingly, BPF exposure reduced both the severity and frequency of β-lobe midline crossing defects in the mushroom body of FXS flies, a phenotype previously observed in FXS flies exposed to BPA. This data indicates that BPF can affect neurodevelopment and its impacts vary depending on genetic background. Further, BPF may elicit a gene-environment interaction with Drosophila fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (dFmr1)-the ortholog of human FMR1, which causes fragile X syndrome and is the most common monogenetic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder."

    "abstract": "Glutamatergic synapses encode information from extracellular inputs using dynamic protein interaction networks (PINs) that undergo widespread reorganization following synaptic activity, allowing cells to distinguish between signaling inputs and generate coordinated cellular responses. Here, we investigate how Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) deficiency disrupts signal transduction through a glutamatergic synapse PIN downstream of NMDA receptor or metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) stimulation. In cultured cortical neurons or acute cortical slices from P7, P17 and P60 FMR1<sup>-/y</sup> mice, the unstimulated protein interaction network state resembled that of wildtype littermates stimulated with mGluR agonists, demonstrating resting state pre-activation of mGluR signaling networks. In contrast, interactions downstream of NMDAR stimulation were similar to WT. We identified the Src family kinase (SFK) Fyn as a network hub, because many interactions involving Fyn were pre-activated in FMR1<sup>-/y</sup> animals. We tested whether targeting SFKs in FMR1<sup>-/y</sup> mice could modify disease phenotypes, and found that Saracatinib (SCB), an SFK inhibitor, normalized elevated basal protein synthesis, novel object recognition memory and social behavior in FMR1<sup>-/y</sup> mice. However, SCB treatment did not normalize the PIN to a wild-type-like state in vitro or in vivo, but rather induced extensive changes to protein complexes containing Shank3, NMDARs and Fyn. We conclude that targeting abnormal nodes of a PIN can identify potential disease-modifying drugs, but behavioral rescue does not correlate with PIN normalization."

    "abstract": "In nucleotide expansion disorders, RNA foci are reportedly associated with neurodegenerative disease pathogeneses. Characteristically, these RNAs exhibit long poly-RNA repeats, such as 47 × CAG, 47 × CUG, or 29 × GGGGCC, usually becoming abnormal pathological aggregations above a critical number of nucleotide repeats. However, it remains unclear whether short, predominantly cellular RNA molecules can cause phase transitions to induce RNA foci. Herein, we demonstrated that short RNAs even with only two repeats can aggregate into a solid-like state via special RNA G-quadruplex structures. In human cells, these solid RNA foci could not dissolve even when using agents that disrupt RNA gelation. The aggregation of shorter RNAs can be clearly observed in vivo. Furthermore, we found that RNA foci induce colocalization of the RNA-binding protein Sam68, a protein commonly found in patients with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, suppressing cell clonogenicity and eventually causing cell death. Our results suggest that short RNA gelation promoted by specific RNA structures contribute to the neurological diseases, which disturb functional cellular processes."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability. Considering China's low prevalence, distinct healthcare system, middle-income economic status, and unique culture, China cannot simply replicate the screening systems in European and American countries. In this study, we investigated the attitudes of 450 Chinese medical professionals who received fragile X training on fragile X carrier screening and genetic counseling. Before the training, 57.6% of the respondents were unfamiliar with FXS. After the training, 7.3% of participants are unable to fully master the knowledge. Furthermore, 71.8% believe that the absence of phenotypes during the reproductive age and the availability of simple and feasible testing methods are prerequisites for screening. The presence of the phenotype would still require screening. Regarding the target population, over 90% of the participants support fragile X carrier screening in high-risk pregnant women. As for influencing factors, they consider cost as the most influential factor in pregnant women's decision to undergo screening. The acceptable price range for screening is determined to be ￥200-1000 ($30-150). In terms of the issues and challenges of screening, most medical professionals support the need for genetic counseling for intermediate alleles and 55-60 repeat premutation results. Additionally, some respondents believe that informing patients' family members of positive screening results is necessary. It is also recognized that positive results may lead to anxiety for patients. The findings of this study will provide valuable information for the establishment of fragile X carrier screening system, particularly for low-prevalence or middle-income countries."

    "abstract": "Primary ovarian failure (POF) is caused by follicle exhaustion and is associated with menstrual irregularities and elevated gonadotropin levels, which lead to infertility before the age of 40 years. The etiology of POI is mostly unknown, but a heterogeneous genetic and familial background can be identified in a subset of cases. Abnormalities in the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (<i>FMR1</i>) are among the most prevalent monogenic causes of POI. These abnormalities are caused by the expansion of an unstable CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of <i>FMR1</i>. Expansions over 200 repeats cause fragile X syndrome (FXS), whereas expansions between 55 and 200 CGG repeats, which are defined as a fragile X premutation, have been associated with premature ovarian failure type 1 (POF1) in heterozygous females. Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic diseases (PGT-M) can be proposed when the female carries a premutation or a full mutation. In this narrative review, we aim to recapitulate the clinical and molecular features of POF1 and their implications in the context of PGT-M."

    "abstract": "Intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) are associated with both cognitive challenges and difficulties in conceptual, social, and practical areas of living (DSM-5). Individuals with IDD often present with an intellectual disability in addition to a developmental disability such as autism or Down syndrome. Those with IDD may present with deficits in intellectual functioning as well as adaptive functioning that interfere with independence and living skills. The present study sought to examine associations of longitudinal developmental change in domains of cognition (NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery, NIHTB-CB) and adaptive behavior domains (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-3; VABS-3) including Socialization, Communication, and Daily Living Skills (DLS) over a two-year period. Eligible participants for this multisite longitudinal study included those who were between 6 and 26 years at Visit 1, and who had a diagnosis of, or suspected intellectual disability (ID), including borderline ID. Three groups were recruited, including those with fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome, and other/idiopathic intellectual disability. In order to examine the association of developmental change between cognitive and adaptive behavior domains, bivariate latent change score (BLCS) models were fit to compare change in the three cognitive domains measured by the NIHTB-CB (Fluid, Crystallized, Composite) and the three adaptive behavior domains measured by the VABS-3 (Communication, DLS, and Socialization). Over a two-year period, change in cognition (both Crystalized and Composite) was significantly and positively associated with change in daily living skills. Also, baseline cognition level predicted growth in adaptive behavior, however baseline adaptive behavior did not predict growth in cognition in any model. The present study demonstrated that developmental improvements in cognition and adaptive behavior are associated in children and young adults with IDD, indicating the potential for cross-domain effects of intervention. Notably, improvements in Daily Living Skills on the VABS-3 emerged as a primary area of adaptive behavior that positively related to improvements in cognition. This work provides evidence for the clinical, \"real life\" meaningfulness of the NIHTB-CB in IDD, and important empirical support for the NIHTB-CB as a fit-for-purpose performance-based outcome measure for this population."

Recently, FXS-specific changes were found more widely in astrocyte functioning, such as regulation of inflammatory pathways and maintenance of lipid homeostasis. Changes of FXS astrocytes impact the brain homeostasis and function both during development and in the adult brain and offer opportunities for novel types of approaches for intervention."

Autism in FXS is significantly underdiagnosed in the community, which may be partly due to insufficient clinical description of the social interaction profile of autism within the FXS phenotype. In this study, we applied a classic framework for characterising social interaction styles in autism to a sample of young adult males with FXS and co-occurring autism to enhance understanding of how the social challenges associated with autism manifest within FXS. Participants were 41 males (M age = 18 years) with FXS and co-occurring autism. Interaction samples were coded for expression of predominately 'active' (characterised by a desire to make social approaches) or 'passive' (characterised by lack of initiation of social approach towards others) interaction profiles. Differences in the expression of phenotypic features of FXS, including anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, cognitive, adaptive and language impairments and autism symptom severity, were examined across those with passive and active interaction styles. Approximately half of the sample was classified as active and half as passive, demonstrating diversity in the social phenotype of autism associated with FXS. The two subtypes did not differ in autism severity, anxiety or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms or in cognitive, adaptive or language abilities. This study enhances understanding of FXS-associated autism by documenting phenotypic variability in the social interaction profile in this group, with active and passive social interaction styles represented. The two social interaction styles were not associated with differential expression of common phenotypic features of FXS, suggesting similar support needs."

Our objective herein was to test matched casein- and soy protein-based purified ingredient diets in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome, <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> mice. The experimental methods included assessment of growth; 24-7 activity levels; motor coordination; learning and memory; blood-based amino acid, phytoestrogen and glucose levels; and organ weights. The primary outcome measure was body weight. We find increased body weight in male <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> from postnatal day 6 (P6) to P224, male wild type (WT) from P32-P39, female <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> from P6-P18 and P168-P224, and female <i>Fmr1<sup>HET</sup></i> from P9-P18 as a function of soy. Activity at the beginning of the light and dark cycles increased in female <i>Fmr1<sup>HET</sup></i> and <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> mice fed soy. We did not find significant differences in rotarod or passive avoidance behavior as a function of genotype or diet. Several blood-based amino acids and phytoestrogens were significantly altered in response to soy. Liver weight was increased in WT and adipose tissue in <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> mice fed soy. Activity levels at the beginning of the light cycle and testes weight were greater in <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> versus WT males irrespective of diet. DEXA analysis at 8-months-old indicated increased fat mass and total body area in <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> females and lean mass and bone mineral density in <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> males fed soy. Overall, dietary consumption of soy protein isolate by C57BL/6J mice caused increased growth, which could be attributed to increased lean mass in males and fat mass in females.

While research has identified a high prevalence of migraine headaches and vestibular deficits among fragile X premutation carriers, there has been no discussion about VM within this population. This case series and review seeks to describe the clinical characteristics and pathophysiology of VM among individuals with the fragile X premutation. We also seek to discuss treatment and future steps in addressing VM in this population. A review of the literature regarding vestibular migraine and presentation of migraine headaches and vestibular deficits among premutation carriers was performed. A detailed clinical history of migraine headaches and vertigo was obtained from three patients with the fragile X premutation seen by the senior author (RJH). All three cases first developed symptoms of migraine headaches earlier in life, with the development of VM near menopause. Two of the three cases developed progressive balance issues following the development of VM. All three cases found that their VM episodes were improved or resolved with pharmacological and/or lifestyle interventions. It is important to recognize VM among premutation carriers because beneficial treatments are available. Future studies are needed regarding the prevalence of VM and the relationship to subsequent FXTAS. The pathophysiology of VM remains uncertain but possibilities include mitochondrial abnormalities, cranial nerve VIII toxicity secondary to neurotoxic protein accumulation, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) signaling dysfunction due to altered levels of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP)."

Atypical visual attention is a feature of FXS, ASD, and ADHD. Thus, studying early attentional patterns in young children with FXS can offer insight into early emerging neurocognitive processes underlying challenges and contribute to our understanding of common and unique features of ASD and ADHD in FXS. The present study examined visual attention indexed by the gap-overlap paradigm in children with FXS (n = 39) compared to children with ASD matched on intellectual ability and age (n = 40) and age-matched neurotypical controls (n = 34). The relationship between gap-overlap performance and intellectual ability, ASD, and ADHD across groups was characterized. Saccadic reaction times (RT) were collected across baseline, gap, and overlap conditions. Results indicate no group differences in RT for any conditions. However, RT of the ASD and NT groups became slower throughout the experiment whereas RT of the FXS group did not change, suggesting difficulties in habituation for the FXS group. There was no relationship between RT and intellectual ability, ADHD, or ASD symptoms in the FXS and ASD groups. In the NT group, slower RT was related to elevated ADHD symptoms only. Taken together, findings suggest that the social attention differences documented in FXS and ASD may be due to other cognitive factors, such as reward or motivation, rather than oculomotor control of visual attention."

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting approximately 3% of school-age children. The core symptoms are deficits in social communication and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. Associated problems in cognition, language, behavior, sleep and mood are prevalent. Currently, no established pharmacological treatment exists for core ASD symptoms. Risperidone and aripiprazole are used to manage associated irritability, but their effectiveness is limited and adverse events are common. This mini-review summarizes existing scientific literature and ongoing clinical trials concerning cannabinoid treatment for ASD. Uncontrolled case series have documented improvements in both core ASD symptoms and related behavioral challenges in children treated with cannabis extracts rich in cannabidiol (CBD). Placebo-controlled studies involving CBD-rich cannabis extracts and/or pure CBD in children with ASD have demonstrated mixed efficacy results. A similar outcome was observed in a placebo-controlled study of pure CBD addressing social avoidance in Fragile X syndrome. Importantly, these studies have shown relatively high safety and tolerability. While current clinical data suggest the potential of CBD and CBD-rich cannabis extract in managing core and behavioral deficits in ASD, it is prudent to await the results of ongoing placebo-controlled trials before considering CBD treatment for ASD."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by silencing of the fragile X messenger ribonucleotide gene. Patients display a wide spectrum of symptoms ranging from intellectual and learning disabilities to behavioural challenges including autism spectrum disorder. In addition to this, patients also display a diversity of symptoms due to mosaicism. These factors make fragile X syndrome a difficult syndrome to manage and suggest that a single targeted therapeutic approach cannot address all the symptoms. To this end, we utilized Healx's data-driven drug discovery platform to identify a treatment strategy to address the wide range of diverse symptoms among patients. Computational methods identified the combination of ibudilast and gaboxadol as a treatment for several pathophysiological targets that could potentially reverse multiple symptoms associated with fragile X syndrome. Ibudilast is an approved broad-spectrum phosphodiesterase inhibitor, selective against both phosphodiesterase 4 and phosphodiesterase 10, and has demonstrated to have several beneficial effects in the brain. Gaboxadol is a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist, selective against the delta subunit, which has previously displayed encouraging results in a fragile X syndrome clinical trial. Alterations in GABA and cyclic adenosine monophosphate metabolism have long since been associated with the pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome; however, targeting both pathways simultaneously has never been investigated. Both drugs have a good safety and tolerability profile in the clinic making them attractive candidates for repurposing. We set out to explore whether the combination of ibudilast and gaboxadol could demonstrate therapeutic efficacy in a fragile X syndrome mouse model. We found that daily treatment with ibudilast significantly enhanced the ability of fragile X syndrome mice to perform a number of different cognitive assays while gaboxadol treatment improved behaviours such as hyperactivity, aggression, stereotypy and anxiety. Importantly, when ibudilast and gaboxadol were co-administered, the cognitive deficits as well as the aforementioned behaviours were rescued. Moreover, this combination treatment showed no evidence of tolerance, and no adverse effects were reported following chronic dosing. This work demonstrates for the first time that by targeting multiple pathways, with a combination treatment, we were able to rescue more phenotypes in a fragile X syndrome mouse model than either ibudilast or gaboxadol could achieve as monotherapies. This combination treatment approach holds promise for addressing the wide spectrum of diverse symptoms in this heterogeneous patient population and may have therapeutic potential for idiopathic autism."

    "abstract": "Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are mesh-like structures on the surfaces of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory and other neurons, and consist of proteoglycans such as aggrecan, brevican, and neurocan. PNNs regulate the Excitatory/Inhibitory (E/I) balance in the brain and are formed at the closure of critical periods of plasticity during development. PNN formation is disrupted in Fragile X Syndrome, which is caused by silencing of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (Fmr1) gene and loss of its protein product FMRP. FXS is characterized by impaired synaptic plasticity resulting in neuronal hyperexcitability and E/I imbalance. Here, we investigate how PNN formation is altered in FXS. PNNs are reduced in Fmr1 KO mouse brain when examined by staining for the lectin Wisteria floribunda agglutin (WFA) and aggrecan. Examination of PNNs by WFA staining at P14 and P42 in the hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, and retrosplenial cortex shows that they were reduced in these brain regions at P14 but mostly less so at P42 in Fmr1 KO mice. However, some differential FMRP regulation of PNN development in these brain regions persists, perhaps caused by asynchrony in PNN development between brain regions in wild-type animals. During development, aggrecan PNN levels in the brain were reduced in all brain regions in Fmr1 KO mice. Aggrecan mRNA levels were unchanged at these times, suggesting that FMRP is normally an activator of aggrecan mRNA translation. This hypothesis is buttressed by the observations that FMRP binds aggrecan mRNA and that ribosome profiling data show that aggrecan mRNA is associated with reduced numbers of ribosomes in Fmr1 KO mouse brain, indicating reduced translational efficiency. Moreover, aggrecan mRNA poly(A) tail length is also reduced in Fmr1 KO mouse brain, suggesting a relationship between polyadenylation and translational control. We propose a model where FMRP modulates PNN formation through translational up-regulation of aggrecan mRNA polyadenylation and translation."

We report here that Elongation Factor 1α (EF1α) forms a complex with two other proteins: Tripartite motif-containing protein 3 (TRIM3) and Murine double minute (Mdm2). Both EF1α-Mdm2 and EF1α-TRIM3 protein complexes are increased in the brain of Fmr1 knockout mice as a result of FMRP deficiency, which releases the normal translational suppression of EF1α mRNA and increases EF1α protein levels. Increased EF1α-Mdm2 complex decreases PSD-95 ubiquitination (Ub-PSD-95) and Ub-PSD-95-C1q interaction. The elevated level of TRIM3-EF1α complex is associated with decreased TRIM3-Complement Component 3 (C3) complex that inhibits the activation of C3. Both protein complexes thereby contribute to a reduction in microglia-mediated phagocytosis and dendritic spine pruning. Finally, we created a peptide that disrupts both protein complexes and restores dendritic spine plasticity and behavioural deficits in Fmr1 knockout mice. The EF1α-Mdm2 and EF1α-TRIM3 complexes could thus be new therapeutic targets for FXS."

RTT is caused by mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (<i>MECP2</i>). It is characterized by an early period of typical development with subsequent regression of previously acquired motor and speech skills in girls. The syndromic phenotypes are individualistic and dynamic over time. Thus far, it has been difficult to capture these dynamics and syndromic heterogeneity in the preclinical <i>Mecp2</i>-heterozygous female mouse model (Het). The emergence of computational neuroethology tools allows for robust analysis of complex and dynamic behaviors to model endophenotypes in preclinical models. Toward this first step, we utilized DeepLabCut, a marker-less pose estimation software to quantify trajectory kinematics and multidimensional analysis to characterize behavioral heterogeneity in Het in the previously benchmarked, ethologically relevant social cognition task of pup retrieval. We report the identification of two distinct phenotypes of adult Het: Het that display a delay in efficiency in early days and then improve over days like wild-type mice and Het that regress and perform worse in later days. Furthermore, regression is dependent on age and behavioral context and can be detected in the initial days of retrieval. Together, the novel identification of two populations of Het suggests differential effects on neural circuitry, opens new avenues to investigate the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of heterogeneity, and designs better studies for stratifying therapeutics."

Quality of life is often impaired due to irritability, aggression and self-injurious behavior, generally refractory to standard therapies. There are indications from previous (case) studies and patient reporting that cannabidiol (CBD) may be an effective treatment for severe behavioral manifestations in RGNDs. However, clear evidence is lacking and interventional research is challenging due to the rarity as well as the heterogeneity within and between disease groups and interindividual differences in treatment response. Our objective is to examine the effectiveness of CBD on severe behavioral manifestations in three RGNDs, including Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), and Fragile X syndrome (FXS), using an innovative trial design. We aim to conduct placebo-controlled, double-blind, block-randomized, multiple crossover N-of-1 studies with oral CBD (twice daily) in 30 patients (aged ≥ 6 years) with confirmed TSC, MPS III or FXS and severe behavioral manifestations. The treatment is oral CBD up to a maximum of 25 mg/kg/day, twice daily. The primary outcome measure is the subscale irritability of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist. Secondary outcome measures include (personalized) patient-reported outcome measures with regard to behavioral and psychiatric outcomes, disease-specific outcome measures, parental stress, seizure frequency, and adverse effects of CBD. Questionnaires will be completed and study medication will be taken at the participants' natural setting. Individual treatment effects will be determined based on summary statistics. A mixed model analysis will be applied for analyzing the effectiveness of the intervention per disorder and across disorders combining data from the individual N-of-1 trials. These N-of-1 trials address an unmet medical need and will provide information on the effectiveness of CBD for severe behavioral manifestations in RGNDs, potentially generating generalizable knowledge at an individual-, disorder- and RGND population level.

    "abstract": "Viruses interact with numerous host factors to facilitate viral replication and to dampen antiviral defense mechanisms. We currently have a limited mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 binds host factors and the functional role of these interactions. Here, we uncover a novel interaction between the viral NSP3 protein and the fragile X mental retardation proteins (FMRPs: FMR1, FXR1-2). SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 mutant viruses preventing FMRP binding have attenuated replication in vitro and reduced levels of viral antigen in lungs during the early stages of infection. We show that a unique peptide motif in NSP3 binds directly to the two central KH domains of FMRPs and that this interaction is disrupted by the I304N mutation found in a patient with fragile X syndrome. NSP3 binding to FMRPs disrupts their interaction with the stress granule component UBAP2L through direct competition with a peptide motif in UBAP2L to prevent FMRP incorporation into stress granules. Collectively, our results provide novel insight into how SARS-CoV-2 hijacks host cell proteins and provides molecular insight into the possible underlying molecular defects in fragile X syndrome."

    "abstract": "Expansion of trinucleotide repeats causes Huntington's disease, Fragile X syndrome and over twenty other monogenic disorders<sup>1</sup>. How mismatch repair protein MutSβ and large repeats of CNG (N=A, T, C or G) cooperate to drive the expansion is poorly understood. Contrary to expectations, we find that MutSβ prefers to bind the stem of an extruded (CNG) hairpin rather than the hairpin end or hairpin-duplex junction. Structural analyses reveal that in the presence of MutSβ, CNG repeats with N:N mismatches adopt a B form-like pseudo-duplex, with one or two CNG repeats slipped out forming uneven bubbles that partly mimic insertion-deletion loops of mismatched DNA<sup>2</sup>. When the extruded hairpin exceeds 40-45 repeats, it can be bound by three or more MutSβ molecules, which are resistant to ATP-dependent dissociation. We envision that such MutSβ-CNG complexes recruit MutLγ endonuclease to nick DNA and initiate the repeat expansion process<sup>3,4</sup>. To develop drugs against the expansion diseases, we have identified lead compounds that prevent MutSβ binding to CNG repeats but not to mismatched DNA."

    "abstract": "Lipid metabolism plays an essential role in nervous system development. Cholesterol deficiency leads to a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and fragile X syndrome. There have been a lot of efforts to search for biological markers associated with and causal to ADHD, among which lipid is one possible etiological factor that is quite widely studied. We aimed to evaluate the causal relationship between lipids traits, lipid-lowering drugs, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) outcomes using Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. We used summary data from genome-wide association studies to explore the causal relationships between circulating lipid-related traits and ADHD. Then, quantitative trait loci for the expression of lipid-lowering drug target genes and genetic variants associated with lipid traits were extracted. Summary-data-based MR and inverse-variance-weighted MR (IVW-MR) were used to investigate the correlation between the expression of these drug-target genes and ADHD. After rigorous screening, 939 instrumental variables were finally included for univariable mendelian randomization analysis. However, there is no correlation between lipid profile and ADHD risk. Drug target analysis by IVW-MR method observed that <i>APOB</i>-mediated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was associated with lower ADHD risk (odds ratio [<i>OR</i>] = 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.84, 0.97]; <i>p</i> = .007), whereas <i>LPL</i>-mediated triglycerides levels were associated with a higher risk of ADHD (<i>OR</i> = 1.13, 95% CI [1.06, 1.21]; <i>p</i> < .001). Our results suggest that <i>APOB</i> gene and <i>LPL</i> gene may be candidate drug target genes for the treatment of ADHD."

Ricaurte is a small village in southwestern Colombia, with an FXS prevalence of 1 in 38 men and 1 in 100 women (~100 times higher than the worldwide reported prevalence), defining Ricaurte as the largest FXS cluster in the world. In the present study, using next-generation sequencing of whole exome capture, we genotype 55 individuals from Ricaurte (49 with either full mutation or with premutation), four individuals from neighboring villages (with either the full mutation or with the premutation), and one unaffected woman, native of Ricaurte, who did not belong to any of the affected families. With advanced clustering and haplotype reconstruction, we modeled a common haplotype of 33 SNPs spanning 83,567,899 bp and harboring the FMR1 gene. This reconstructed haplotype was found in all the men from Ricaurte who carried the expansion, demonstrating that the genetic conglomerate of FXS in this population is due to a founder effect. The definition of this founder effect and its population outlining will allow a better prediction, follow-up, precise and personalized characterization of epidemiological parameters, better knowledge of the disease's natural history, and confident improvement of the clinical attention, life quality, and health interventions for this community."

    "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase 2 A (PDE2A) is an enzyme involved in the homeostasis of cAMP and cGMP and is the most highly expressed PDE in human brain regions critical for socio-cognitive behavior. In cerebral cortex and hippocampus, PDE2A expression level is upregulated in Fmr1-KO mice, a model of the Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Indeed, PDE2A translation is negatively modulated by FMRP, whose functional absence causes FXS. While the pharmacological inhibition of PDE2A has been associated to its pro-cognitive role in normal animals and in models of ID and ASD, homozygous PDE2A mutations have been identified in patients affected by ID, ASD and epilepsy. To clarify this apparent paradox about the role of PDE2A in brain development, we characterized here Pde2a<sup>+/-</sup> mice (homozygote animals being not viable) at the behavioral, cellular, molecular and electrophysiological levels. Pde2a<sup>+/-</sup> females display a milder form of the disorder with reduced cognitive performance in adulthood, conversely males show severe socio-cognitive deficits throughout their life. In males, these phenotypes are associated with microglia activation, elevated glutathione levels and increased externalization of Glutamate receptor (GluR1) in CA1, producing reduced mGluR-dependent Long-term Depression. Overall, our results reveal molecular targets of the PDE2A-dependent pathway underlying socio-cognitive performance. These results clarify the mechanism of action of pro-cognitive drugs based on PDE2A inactivation, which have been shown to be promising therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, FXS as well as other forms of ASD."

Semistructured interviews of 47 mothers of adolescents with FXS (mean child age = 15.89 years) were analyzed to identify mothers' changing expectations during the adolescent period and parent goals related to work and postsecondary education. Mothers' work and education goals were explored in relation to child factors such as language skills and autism characteristics. Lower language skills were associated with lower likelihood of reporting vocational goals. Results suggest that adolescents with FXS with lower language ability are less likely to have vocational plans for adulthood during this critical period and may need greater transition planning assistance."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is mainly caused by FMR1 CGG repeat expansions. Other types of mutations, particularly deletions, are also responsible for FXS phenotypes, however these mutations are often missed by routine clinical testing. Molecular diagnosis in cases of suspected FXS was a combination of PCR and Southern blot. Measurement of the FMRP protein level was useful for detecting potentially deleterious impact. PCR analysis and Southern blot revealed a case with premutation and suspected deletion alleles. Sanger sequencing showed that the deletion involved 313 bp upstream of repeats and some parts of CGG repeat tract, leaving transcription start site. FMRP was detected in 5.5 % of blood lymphocytes. According to our review of case reports, most patients carrying microdeletion and full mutation had typical features of FXS. To our knowledge, our case is the first to describe mosaicism of a premutation and microdeletion in the FMR1 gene. The patient was probably protected from the effects of the deletion by mosaicism with premutation allele, leading to milder phenotype. It is thus important to consider appropriate techniques for detecting FMR1 variants other than repeat expansions which cannot be detected by routine FXS diagnosis."

Despite the high prevalence of the FXTAS disorder, neuropathology studies of individuals affected by FXTAS are limited. We performed hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining in the hippocampus of 26 FXTAS cases and analyzed the tissue microscopically. The major neuropathological characteristics were white matter disease, intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astrocytes, and neuron loss. Astrocytes contained more and larger inclusions than neurons. There was a negative correlation between age of death and CGG repeat length in cases over the age of 60. The number of astroglial inclusions (CA3 and dentate gyrus) and the number of CA3 neuronal inclusions increased with elevated CGG repeat length. In the two cases with a CGG repeat size less than 65, FXTAS intranuclear inclusions were not present in the hippocampus, while in the two cases with less than 70 (65-70) CGG repeat expansion, neurons and astrocytes with inclusions were occasionally identified in the CA1 sub-region. These findings add hippocampus neuropathology to the previously reported changes in other areas of the brain in FXTAS patients, with implications for understanding FXTAS pathogenesis."

In some cases, these can cause specific autosomal dominant syndromes, with high-to-complete penetrance and de novo occurrence of the variant. In other cases, they result in non-syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders, often acting as moderate-penetrance risk factors, possibly inherited from unaffected parents. We describe a three-generation family with non-syndromic neuropsychiatric features segregating with a novel 19q13.32q13.33 microduplication. The propositus was a 28-month-old male ascertained for psychomotor delay, with no dysmorphic features or malformations. His mother had Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and a learning disability. The maternal uncle had an intellectual disability. Chromosomal microarray analysis identified a 969 kb 19q13.32q13.33 microduplication in the proband. The variant segregated in the mother, the uncle, and the maternal grandmother of the proband, who also presented neuropsychiatric disorders. Fragile-X Syndrome testing was negative. Exome Sequencing did not identify Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic variants. Imbalances involving 19q13.32 and 19q13.33 are associated with neurodevelopmental delay. A review of the reported microduplications allowed to propose <i>BICRA</i> (MIM *605690) and <i>KPTN</i> (MIM *615620) as candidates for the neurodevelopmental delay susceptibility in 19q13.32q13.33 copy number gains.

In fragile X syndrome (FXS), mutation-length expansion of a CGG STR represses FMR1 via local DNA methylation. Here, we find megabase-scale H3K9me3 domains on autosomes and encompassing FMR1 on the X chromosome in FXS patient-derived iPSCs, iPSC-derived neural progenitors, EBV-transformed lymphoblasts, and brain tissue with mutation-length CGG expansion. H3K9me3 domains connect via inter-chromosomal interactions and demarcate severe misfolding of TADs and loops. They harbor long synaptic genes replicating at the end of S phase, replication-stress-induced double-strand breaks, and STRs prone to stepwise somatic instability. CRISPR engineering of the mutation-length CGG to premutation length reverses H3K9me3 on the X chromosome and multiple autosomes, refolds TADs, and restores gene expression. H3K9me3 domains can also arise in normal-length iPSCs created with perturbations linked to genome instability, suggesting their relevance beyond FXS. Our results reveal Mb-scale heterochromatinization and trans interactions among loci susceptible to instability."

AGG interruptions in CGG repeat tracts were found in most healthy individuals, suggesting a crucial role in preventing disease-prone repeat expansion. Previous biophysics studies emphasize a difference in the secondary structure affected by AGG interruptions. However, the mechanism of how AGG interruptions impede repeat expansion remains elusive. We utilized single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer spectroscopy to investigate the structural dynamics of CGG repeats and their AGG-interrupted variants. Tandem CGG repeats fold into a stem-loop hairpin structure with the capability to undergo a conformational rearrangement to modulate the length of the overhang. However, this conformational rearrangement is much more retarded when two AGG interruptions are present. Considering the significance of hairpin slippage in repeat expansion, we present a molecular basis suggesting that the internal loop created by two AGG interruptions acts as a barrier, obstructing the hairpin slippage reconfiguration. This impediment potentially plays a crucial role in curbing abnormal expansion, thereby contributing to the genomic stability."

    "abstract": "A deficiency of FMRP, a canonical RNA-binding protein, causes the development of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), which is characterised by multiple phenotypes, including neurodevelopmental disorders, intellectual disability, and autism. Due to the alternative splicing of the encoding <i>FMR1</i> gene, multiple FMRP isoforms are produced consisting of full-length predominantly cytoplasmic (i.e., iso1) isoforms involved in translation and truncated nuclear (i.e., iso6) isoforms with orphan functions. However, we recently implicated nuclear FMRP isoforms in DNA damage response, showing that they negatively regulate the accumulation of anaphase DNA genomic instability bridges. This finding provided evidence that the cytoplasmic and nuclear functions of FMRP are uncoupled played by respective cytoplasmic and nuclear isoforms, potentially involving specific interactions. While interaction partners of cytoplasmic FMRP have been reported, the identity of nuclear FMRP isoform partners remains to be established. Using affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry, we mapped the nuclear interactome of the FMRP isoform iso6 in U2OS. In doing so, we found FMRP nuclear interaction partners to be involved in RNA processing, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, DNA replication and damage response, chromatin remodeling and chromosome segregation. By comparing interactions between nuclear iso6 and cytoplasmic iso1, we report a set of partners that bind specifically to the nuclear isoforms, mainly proteins involved in DNA-associated processes and proteasomal proteins, which is consistent with our finding that proteasome targets the nuclear FMRP iso6. The specific interactions with the nuclear isoform 6 are regulated by replication stress, while those with the cytoplasmic isoform 1 are largely insensitive to such stress, further supporting a specific role of nuclear isoforms in DNA damage response induced by replicative stress, potentially regulated by the proteasome."

In a 24-week open-label trial involving 15 adults aged 60-88 with FXTAS, 11 participants successfully completed the study, demonstrating the safety and tolerability of sulforaphane. Clinical outcomes and biomarkers were measured to elucidate the effects of sulforaphane. While there were nominal improvements in multiple clinical measures, they were not significantly different after correction for multiple comparisons. PBMC energetic measures showed that the level of citrate synthase was higher after sulforaphane treatment, resulting in lower ATP production. The ratio of complex I to complex II showed positive correlations with the MoCA and BDS scores.

Although cross-sectional studies have suggested that earlier executive function changes may precede FXTAS, the lack of longitudinal studies has made it difficult to address this hypothesis. To determine whether executive function deterioration experienced by premutation carriers (PC) in daily life precedes and predicts FXTAS. This study included 66 FMR1 PC ranging from 40 to 78 years (mean, 59.5) and 31 well-matched healthy controls (HC) ages 40 to 75 (mean, 57.7) at baseline. Eighty-four participants returned for 2 to 5 follow up visits over a duration of 1 to 9 years (mean, 4.6); 28 of the PC developed FXTAS. The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A) was completed by participants and their spouses/partners at each visit. Longitudinal mixed model regression analyses showed a greater decline with age in PC compared to HC on the Metacognition Index (MI; self-initiation, working memory, organization, task monitoring). Conversion to FXTAS was associated with worsening MI and Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI; inhibition, flexibility, emotion modulation). For spouse/partner report, FXTAS conversion was associated with worsening MI. Finally, increased self-report executive function problems at baseline significantly predicted later development of FXTAS. Executive function changes experienced by male PC represent a prodrome of the later movement disorder. © 2023 The Authors.

In this study, we evaluated for the first time, the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of anodal prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with standard speech therapy to enhance language function in FXS patients. In total, 16 adult FXS patients were enrolled. Participants underwent 45 min of anodic tDCS combined with speech therapy for 5 weeks (3 times per week). Language function was evaluated using the Test for Reception of Grammar-Version 2 (TROG-2) and subtests of the Italian Language Examination (Esame del Linguaggio - II, EDL-II). Right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex transcranial magnetic stimulation and concurrent electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) recordings were collected at baseline and after the treatment to evaluate cortical reactivity and connectivity changes. After 5 weeks of combined therapy, we observed a significant improvement in the writing (7.5%), reading (20.3%), repetition (13.3%), and TROG-2 (10.2%) tests. Parallelly with clinical change, TMS-EEG results showed a significant difference in TMS-evoked potential amplitude over the left frontal cortex after treatment (-0.73 ± 0.87 μV) compared to baseline (0.18 ± 0.84 μV). Our study provides novel evidence that left anodal prefrontal tDCS combined with standard speech therapy could be effective in enhancing language function in FXS patients, mainly by inducing a rebalance of the dysfunctional prefrontal cortical excitability."

FMRP is a nucleocytoplasmic protein, primarily characterized as a translation repressor with poorly understood nuclear function(s). We recently reported that FXS patient cells lacking FMRP sustain higher level of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) than normal cells, specifically at sequences prone to forming R-loops, a phenotype further exacerbated by DNA replication stress. Moreover, expression of FMRP, and not an FMRPI304N mutant known to cause FXS, reduced R-loop-associated DSBs. We subsequently reported that recombinant FMRP directly binds R-loops, primarily through the carboxyl terminal intrinsically disordered region. Here, we show that FMRP directly interacts with an RNA helicase, DHX9. This interaction, which is mediated by the amino terminal structured domain of FMRP, is reduced with FMRPI304N. We also show that FMRP inhibits DHX9 helicase activity on RNA:DNA hybrids and the inhibition is also dependent on the amino terminus. Furthermore, the FMRPI304N mutation causes both FMRP and DHX9 to persist on the chromatin in replication stress. These results suggest an antagonistic relationship between FMRP and DHX9 at the chromatin, where their proper interaction leads to dissociation of both proteins from the fully resolved R-loop. We propose that the absence or the loss of function of FMRP leads to persistent presence of DHX9 or both proteins, respectively, on the unresolved R-loop, ultimately leading to DSBs. Our study sheds new light on our understanding of the genome functions of FMRP."

FXS is caused by mutations of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 gene (<i>Fmr1</i>) and is associated with alterations in neuronal network excitability in several brain areas including hippocampus. The loss of fragile X protein affects brain oscillations, however, the effects of FXS on hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs), an endogenous hippocampal pattern contributing to memory consolidation have not been sufficiently clarified. In addition, it is still not known whether dorsal and ventral hippocampus are similarly affected by FXS. We used a <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out (KO) rat model of FXS and electrophysiological recordings from the CA1 area of adult rat hippocampal slices to assess spontaneous and evoked neural activity. We find that SWRs and associated multiunit activity are affected in the dorsal but not the ventral KO hippocampus, while complex spike bursts remain normal in both segments of the KO hippocampus. Local network excitability increases in the dorsal KO hippocampus. Furthermore, specifically in the ventral hippocampus of KO rats we found an increased effectiveness of inhibition in suppressing excitation and an upregulation of α1GABA<sub><i>A</i></sub> receptor subtype. These changes in the ventral KO hippocampus are accompanied by a striking reduction in its susceptibility to induced epileptiform activity. We propose that the neuronal network specifically in the ventral segment of the hippocampus is reorganized in adult <i>Fmr1</i>-KO rats by means of balanced changes between excitability and inhibition to ensure normal generation of SWRs and preventing at the same time derailment of the neural activity toward hyperexcitability."

    "abstract": "Approximately half of the human genome includes repetitive sequences, and these DNA sequences (as well as their transcribed repetitive RNA and translated amino-acid repeat sequences) are known as the repeatome. Within this repeatome there are a couple of million tandem repeats, dispersed throughout the genome. These tandem repeats have been estimated to constitute ∼8% of the entire human genome. These tandem repeats can be located throughout exons, introns and intergenic regions, thus potentially affecting the structure and function of tandemly repetitive DNA, RNA and protein sequences. Over more than three decades, more than 60 monogenic human disorders have been found to be caused by tandem-repeat mutations. These monogenic tandem-repeat disorders include Huntington's disease, a variety of ataxias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, as well as many other neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, tandem-repeat disorders can include fragile X syndrome, related fragile X disorders, as well as other neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, these monogenic tandem-repeat disorders, which were discovered via their dominant or recessive modes of inheritance, may represent the 'tip of the iceberg' with respect to tandem-repeat contributions to human disorders. A previous proposal that tandem repeats may contribute to the 'missing heritability' of various common polygenic human disorders has recently been supported by a variety of new evidence. This includes genome-wide studies that associate tandem-repeat mutations with autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and various types of cancers. In this article, I will discuss how tandem-repeat mutations and polymorphisms could contribute to a wide range of common disorders, along with some of the many major challenges of tandem-repeat biology and medicine. Finally, I will discuss the potential of tandem repeats to be therapeutically targeted, so as to prevent and treat an expanding range of human disorders."

    "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) β, a subtype of class I PI3Ks, has an essential role in PTEN-deficient tumors and links to thrombosis, male fertility, and Fragile X syndrome. PI3Kβ-specific targeting therapy could be an efficacious treatment for diseases highly dependent on PI3Kβ, while mitigating the severe toxicity of pan-PI3K inhibitors. Achieving selectivity can be accomplished through three primary strategies, namely, binding to the induced lipophilic pocket, targeting the unique amino acid residue of PI3Kβ, or using atropisomerism to lock conformation. In this review, we focus on advances in the development of these β-isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors, providing potential guidance for the further development of novel clinical candidates."

    "title": "FXTAS Neuropathology Includes Widespread Reactive Astrogliosis and White Matter Specific Astrocyte Degeneration.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset progressive genetic neurodegenerative disorder that occurs in FMR1 premutation carriers. The temporal, spatial, and cell-type specific patterns of neurodegeneration in the FXTAS brain remain incompletely characterized. Intranuclear inclusion bodies are the neuropathological hallmark of FXTAS, which are largest and occur most frequently in astrocytes, glial cells that maintain brain homeostasis. Here, we characterized neuropathological alterations in astrocytes in multiple regions of the FXTAS brain. Striatal and cerebellar sections from FXTAS cases (n = 12) and controls (n = 12) were stained for the astrocyte markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1L1 (ALDH1L1) using immunohistochemistry. Reactive astrogliosis severity, the prevalence of GFAP+ fragments, and astrocyte density were scored. Double label immunofluorescence was utilized to detect co-localization of GFAP and cleaved caspase-3. FXTAS cases showed widespread reactive gliosis in both grey and white matter. GFAP staining also revealed remarkably severe astrocyte pathology in FXTAS white matter - characterized by a significant and visible reduction in astrocyte density (-38.7% in striatum and - 32.2% in cerebellum) and the widespread presence of GFAP+ fragments reminiscent of apoptotic bodies. White matter specific reductions in astrocyte density were confirmed with ALDH1L1 staining. GFAP+ astrocytes and fragments in white matter were positive for cleaved caspase-3, suggesting that apoptosis-mediated degeneration is responsible for reduced astrocyte counts. We have established that FXTAS neuropathology includes robust degeneration of astrocytes, which is specific to white matter. Because astrocytes are essential for maintaining homeostasis within the central nervous system, a loss of astrocytes likely further exacerbates neuropathological progression of other cell types in the FXTAS brain.

    "title": "Structural peculiarities of tandem repeats and their clinical significance.",
    "abstract": "While it is well established that a mere 2% of human DNA nucleotides are involved in protein coding, the remainder of the DNA plays a vital role in the preservation of normal cellular genetic function. A significant proportion of tandem repeats (TRs) are present in non-coding DNA. TRs - specific sequences of nucleotides that entail numerous repetitions of a given fragment. In this study, we employed our novel algorithm grounded in finite automata theory, which we refer to as Dafna, to investigate for the first time the likelihood of these nucleotide sequences forming non-canonical DNA structures (NS). Such structures include G-quadruplexes, i-motifs, hairpins, and triplexes. The tandem repeats under consideration in our research encompassed sequences containing 1 to 6 nucleotides per repeated fragment. For comparison, we employed a set of randomly generated sequences of the same length (60 nucleotides) as a benchmark. The outcomes of our research exposed a disparity between the potential for NS formation in random sequences and tandem repeats. Our findings affirm that the propensity of DNA and RNA to form NS is closely tied to various genetic disorders, including Huntington's disease, Fragile X syndrome, and Friedreich's ataxia. In the concluding discussion, we present a proposal for a new therapeutic mechanism to address these diseases. This novel approach revolves around the ability of specific nucleic acid fragments to form multiple types of NS."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is often modeled in Fmr1 knockout mice where the RNA-binding protein FMRP is absent. Here, we show that in Fmr1-deficient mice, RNA mis-splicing occurs in several brain regions and peripheral tissues. To assess molecular mechanisms of splicing mis-regulation, we employed N2A cells depleted of Fmr1. In the absence of FMRP, RNA-specific exon skipping events are linked to the splicing factors hnRNPF, PTBP1, and MBNL1. FMRP regulates the translation of Mbnl1 mRNA as well as Mbnl1 RNA auto-splicing. Elevated Mbnl1 auto-splicing in FMRP-deficient cells results in the loss of a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing exon. This in turn alters the nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio of MBNL1. This redistribution of MBNL1 isoforms in Fmr1-deficient cells could result in downstream splicing changes in other RNAs. Indeed, further investigation revealed that splicing disruptions resulting from Fmr1 depletion could be rescued by overexpression of nuclear MBNL1. Altered Mbnl1 auto-splicing also occurs in human FXS postmortem brain. These data suggest that FMRP-controlled translation and RNA processing may cascade into a general dys-regulation of splicing in Fmr1-deficient cells."

Although cerebellar pathology has been observed in individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) and in mouse models of the disorder, a cerebellar functional contribution to ASD-relevant behaviors in FXS has yet to be fully characterized. In this study, we demonstrate a critical cerebellar role for Fmr1 (fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1) in ASD-relevant behaviors. First, we identify reduced social behaviors, sensory hypersensitivity, and cerebellar dysfunction, with loss of cerebellar Fmr1. We then demonstrate that cerebellar-specific expression of Fmr1 is sufficient to impact social, sensory, cerebellar dysfunction, and cerebro-cortical hyperexcitability phenotypes observed in global Fmr1 mutants. Moreover, we demonstrate that targeting the ASD-implicated cerebellar region Crus1 ameliorates behaviors in both cerebellar-specific and global Fmr1 mutants. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for the cerebellar contribution to FXS-related behaviors, with implications for future therapeutic strategies."

Here, by recording neocortical single neuron activity in a well-established mouse model of Fragile X syndrome and autism, we characterized atypical sensory processing and probed the role of endogenous noise sources in exaggerated response variability in males. The analysis of sensory stimulus evoked activity and spontaneous dynamics, as well as neuronal features, reveals a complex cellular and network phenotype. Neocortical sensory information processing is more variable and temporally imprecise. Increased trial-by-trial and inter-neuronal response variability is strongly related to key endogenous noise features, and may give rise to behavioural sensory responsiveness variability in autism. We provide a novel preclinical framework for understanding the sources of endogenous noise and its contribution to core autism symptoms, and for testing the functional consequences for mechanism-based manipulation of noise."

One of the well-characterized molecular phenotypes of <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice, a model of FXS, is increased translation of synaptic proteins. Although this upregulation stabilizes in adulthood, abnormalities during the critical period of plasticity have long-term effects on circuit formation and synaptic properties. Using high-resolution quantitative proteomics of synaptoneurosomes isolated from the adult, developed brains of <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice, we show a differential abundance of proteins regulating the postsynaptic receptor activity of glutamatergic synapses. We investigated the AMPA receptor composition and shuttling in adult <i>Fmr</i>1 KO and WT mice using a variety of complementary experimental strategies such as surface protein crosslinking, immunostaining of surface receptors, and electrophysiology. We discovered that the activity-dependent synaptic delivery of AMPARs is impaired in adult <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice.

    "title": "Oral language interventions can improve language outcomes in children with neurodevelopmental disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Young people who fail to develop language as expected face significant challenges in all aspects of life. Unfortunately, language disorders are common, either as a distinct condition (e.g., Developmental Language Disorder) or as a part of another neurodevelopmental condition (e.g., autism). Finding ways to attenuate language problems through intervention has the potential to yield great benefits not only for the individual but also for society as a whole. This meta-analytic review examined the effect of oral language interventions for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The last electronic search was conducted in April 2022. Intervention studies had to target language skills for children from 2 to 18 years of age with Developmental Language Disorder, autism, intellectual disability, Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and Williams syndrome in randomised controlled trials or quasi-experimental designs. Control groups had to include business-as-usual, waiting list, passive or active conditions. However, we excluded studies in which the active control group received a different type, delivery, or dosage of another language intervention. Eligible interventions implemented explicit and structured activities (i.e., explicit instruction of vocabulary, narrative structure or grammatical rules) and/or implicit and broad activities (i.e., shared book reading, general language stimulation). The intervention studies had to assess language skills in receptive and/or expressive modalities. The search provided 8195 records after deduplication. Records were screened by title and abstract, leading to full-text examinations of 448 records. We performed Correlated and Hierarchical Effects models and ran a retrospective power analysis via simulation. Publication bias was assessed via <i>p</i>-curve and precision-effect estimate. We examined 38 studies, with 46 group comparisons and 108 effects comparing pre-/post-tests and eight studies, with 12 group comparisons and 21 effects at follow-up. The results showed a mean effect size of <i>d</i> = 0.27 at the post-test and <i>d</i> = 0.18 at follow-up. However, there was evidence of publication bias and overestimation of the mean effects. Effects from the meta-analysis were significantly related to these elements: (1) receptive vocabulary and omnibus receptive measures showed smaller effect sizes relative to expressive vocabulary, grammar, expressive and receptive discourse, and omnibus expressive tests; and (2) the length of the intervention, where longer sessions conducted over a longer period of time were more beneficial than brief sessions and short-term interventions. Neither moderators concerning participants' characteristics (children's diagnosis, diagnostic status, age, sex, and non-verbal cognitive ability and severity of language impairment), nor those regarding of the treatment components and implementation of the language interventions (intervention content, setting, delivery agent, session structure of the intervention or total number of sessions) reached significance. The same occurred to indicators of study quality. The risk of bias assessment showed that reporting quality for the studies examined in the review was poor. In sum, the current evidence base is promising but inconclusive. Pre-registration and replication of more robust and adequately powered trials, which include a wider range of diagnostic conditions, together with more long-term follow-up comparisons, are needed to drive evidence-based practice and policy."

Here, we found that the developmental elimination of synapses formed between the principal nucleus of V (PrV) and the ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPm) of the somatosensory system was delayed in fragile X mental retardation 1 gene knockout (Fmr1 KO) mice, while the developmental strengthening of these synapses was disrupted. Immunohistochemistry showed excessive VGluT2 puncta in mutants at P12-13, but not at P7-8 or P15-16, confirming a delay in somatic pruning of PrV-VPm synapses. Impaired synaptic function was associated with a reduction in the frequency of quantal AMPA events, as well as developmental deficits in presynaptic vesicle size and density. Our results uncovered the developmental impairment of thalamic relay synapses in Fmr1 KO mice and suggest that a thalamic contribution to the somatosensory over-reactivity in FXS should be considered."

The inactivation of the <i>FMR1</i> gene results in fragile X syndrome (FXS), a serious neurodevelopmental disorder. FMRP deficiency causes abnormal neurite outgrowth, which is likely to lead to abnormal learning and memory capabilities. However, the mechanism of FMRP in modulating neuronal development remains unknown. We found that FMRP enhances the translation of 4EBP2, a neuron-specific form of 4EBPs that inactivates eIF4E by inhibiting the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G. Depletion of 4EBP2 results in abnormal neurite outgrowth. Moreover, the impairment of neurite outgrowth upon FMRP depletion was overcome by the ectopic expression of 4EBP2. These results suggest that FMRP controls neuronal development by enhancing 4EBP2 expression at the translational level. In addition, treatment with 4EGI-1, a chemical that blocks eIF4E activity, restored neurite length in FMRP-depleted and 4EBP2-depleted cells. In conclusion, we discovered that 4EBP2 functions as a key downstream regulator of FMRP activity in neuronal development and that FMRP represses eIF4E activity by enhancing 4EBP2 translation."

    "abstract": "A common neurobiological mechanism in several neurodevelopmental disorders, including fragile X syndrome (FXS), is alterations in the balance between excitation and inhibition in the brain. It is thought that in the hippocampus, as in other brain regions, FXS is associated with increased excitability and reduced inhibition. However, it is still not known whether these changes apply to both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, which appear to be differently involved in neurodegenerative disorders. Using a Fmr1 knock-out (KO) rat model of FXS, we found increased neuronal excitability in both the dorsal and ventral KO hippocampus and increased excitatory synaptic transmission in the dorsal hippocampus. Interestingly, synaptic inhibition is significantly increased in the ventral but not the dorsal KO hippocampus. Furthermore, the ventral KO hippocampus displays increased expression of the α1GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtype and a remarkably reduced rate of epileptiform discharges induced by magnesium-free medium. In contrast, the dorsal KO hippocampus displays an increased rate of epileptiform discharges and similar expression of α1GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors compared with the dorsal WT hippocampus. Blockade of α5GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors by L-655,708 did not affect epileptiform discharges in any genotype or hippocampal segment, and the expression of α5GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors did not differ between WT and KO hippocampus. These results suggest that the increased excitability of the dorsal KO hippocampus contributes to its heightened tendency to epileptiform discharges, while the increased phasic inhibition in the Fmr1-KO ventral hippocampus may represent a homeostatic mechanism that compensates for the increased excitability reducing its vulnerability to epileptic activity."

Assessment of the expression of the complement genes C1q, C3, and C4 identified the upregulation of C3 in both wild-type (WT) and knockout mice. Levels of C3 also increased in both genotypes. Analysis of the correlation between the expression of C3 and the cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α identified a different relationship between the expression of the genes in <i>Fmr1</i> KO when compared to WT mice. Our findings did not support our initial hypotheses that the lack of the <i>FMR1</i> gene would alter complement system signaling, and that the induction of the complement system in response to LPS in Fmr1 KO mice differed from wild-type conspecifics."

Moreover, research on NDDs is problematic due to its reliance on a neurocentric approach.

This review aims to summarize studies from the past few decades on potential new contributions to the etiology of NDDs, with a special focus on metabolic signatures of various brain cells.

Thus, early-life exposure to chemicals in the diet could cause or exacerbate disease outcomes. Herein, we review the effects of potential dietary toxins, i.e., soy phytoestrogens, glyphosate, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in FXS and other autism models. The rationale is that potentially toxic chemicals in the diet, particularly infant formula, could contribute to the development and/or severity of ASD and that further study in this area has potential to improve ASD outcomes through dietary modification."

These mRNAs serve as underlying condensate scaffold and concentrate FXR1 molecules. The FXR1 network contains multiple protein binding sites and functions as a signaling scaffold for interacting proteins. We show that it is necessary for RhoA signaling-induced actomyosin reorganization to provide spatial proximity between kinases and their substrates. Point mutations in FXR1, found in its homolog FMR1, where they cause Fragile X syndrome, disrupt the network. FXR1 network disruption prevents actomyosin remodeling-an essential and ubiquitous process for the regulation of cell shape, migration, and synaptic function.

    "abstract": "Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) are highly prevalent and reduce function in individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS). As transdiagnostic features of intellectual disability, elevated rates of RRBs in FXS could represent various underlying known co-occurring conditions in FXS such as anxiety or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet this distinction has not been investigated. Further, delineating whether RRBs are more indicative of anxiety or ASD in FXS may clarify phenotypic profiles within FXS and improve differential assessment. We longitudinally examined the potentially independent or multiplicative effect of ASD and anxiety symptom severity on RRBs in 60 children with FXS. Anxiety was measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), ASD severity was measured using the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), and RRBs were measured using The Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS-R). We estimated a series of moderated regression models with anxiety and ASD symptoms at the initial assessment (Time 1) as predictors of RRBs at the outcome assessment two years later (Time 2), along with an anxiety-by-ASD interaction term to determine the potential multiplicative effect of these co-occurring conditions on RRBs. Results identified a significant interaction between ASD and anxiety symptom severity at the initial assessment that predicted elevated sensory-motor RRBs two years later. Increased sensory-motor RRBs were predicted by elevated ASD symptoms only when anxiety symptom severity was low. Likewise, increased sensory-motor RRBs were predicted by elevated anxiety symptoms only when ASD symptom severity was low. Interestingly, this relationship was isolated to Sensory-Motor RRBs, with evidence that it could also apply to total RRBs. Findings suggest that ASD and anxiety exert independent and differential effects on Sensory-Motor RRBs when at high severity levels and a multiplicative effect when at moderate levels."

    "title": "Discovery of novel indole derivatives as potent and selective inhibitors of proMMP-9 activation.",
    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is a secreted zinc-dependent endopeptidase that degrades the extracellular matrix and basement membrane of neurons, and then contributes to synaptic plasticity by remodeling the extracellular matrix. Inhibition of MMP-9 activity has therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases such as fragile X syndrome. This paper reports the molecular design, synthesis, and in vitro studies of novel indole derivatives as inhibitors of proMMP-9 activation. High-throughput screening (HTS) of our internal compound library and subsequent merging of hit compounds 1 and 2 provided compound 4 as a bona-fide lead. X-ray structure-based design and subsequent lead optimization led to the discovery of compound 33, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of proMMP-9 activation."

    "title": "FMRP phosphorylation modulates neuronal translation through YTHDF1.",
    "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) control messenger RNA fate in neurons. Here, we report a mechanism that the stimuli-induced neuronal translation is mediated by phosphorylation of a YTHDF1-binding protein FMRP. Mechanistically, YTHDF1 can condense with ribosomal proteins to promote the translation of its mRNA targets. FMRP regulates this process by sequestering YTHDF1 away from the ribosome; upon neuronal stimulation, FMRP becomes phosphorylated and releases YTHDF1 for translation upregulation. We show that a new small molecule inhibitor of YTHDF1 can reverse fragile X syndrome (FXS) developmental defects associated with FMRP deficiency in an organoid model. Our study thus reveals that FMRP and its phosphorylation are important regulators of activity-dependent translation during neuronal development and stimulation and identifies YTHDF1 as a potential therapeutic target for FXS in which developmental defects caused by FMRP depletion could be reversed through YTHDF1 inhibition."

Females with FXS typically display a milder cognitive phenotype than males, despite experiencing significant developmental, behavioral, and social-emotional issues. To measure and distinguish the cognitive-behavioral profile of girls with FXS relative to verbal IQ-matched peers. Ninety-seven participants (N<sub>FXS</sub>=55, N<sub>comparison</sub>=42) six to 16 years of age completed assessments evaluating cognition, academic achievement, and adaptive behavior. The comparison group consisted of age-, sex-, and verbal IQ-matched peers. Consistent with previous studies, the FXS group demonstrated mean cognitive skills, academic achievement, and adaptive behavior in the borderline to low average range. On average, the FXS group showed poorer nonverbal reasoning, visual pattern recognition, verbal abstraction, math abilities, attention, inhibitory control, and working memory than the comparison group. There were no significant group differences in adaptive behavior. Different patterns of associations between cognition and selected outcomes emerged in each group. Results highlight the importance of identifying specific cognitive-behavioral profiles in girls with FXS to inform more targeted interventions for optimizing outcomes and quality of life in this population."

    "title": "Tau reduction attenuates autism-like features in Fmr1 knockout mice.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and resulted from a loss of the FMR1-encoded fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP) protein due to large CGG repeat expansions in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene. The microtubule-associated protein Tau is a promising target for Tauopathic diseases and our preliminary study found that Tau protein levels were increased in the brain of Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, a model of FXS. However, whether Tau reduction can prevent autism-like features in Fmr1 KO mice and become a novel strategy for FXS treatment remain unknown. Tau was genetically reduced in Fmr1 KO mice through crossing Fmr1<sup>±</sup> female mice with Mapt<sup>±</sup> male mice. The male offspring with different genotypes were subjected to various autism-related behavioral tests, RNA sequencing, and biochemical analysis. Fmr1 KO male mice were treated with Tau-targeting antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) and then subjected to behavioral tests and biochemical analysis. Tau expression was increased in the cortex of Fmr1 KO mice. Genetically reducing Tau prevented social defects, stereotyped and repetitive behavior, and spine abnormality in Fmr1 KO mice. Tau reduction also reversed increased periodic activity and partially rescued Per1 expression reduction in Fmr1 KO mice. Moreover, Tau reduction reversed compromised P38/MAPK signaling in Fmr1 KO mice. Finally, Tau-targeting ASO also effectively alleviated autism-like phenotypes and promoted P38/MAPK signaling in Fmr1 KO mice. Our study is limited to male mice, in agreement with the higher incidence of FXS in males than females. Whether Tau reduction also exerts protection in females deserves further scrutiny. Moreover, although Tau reduction rescues impaired P38/MAPK signaling in Fmr1 KO mice, whether this is the responsible molecular mechanism requires further determination. Our data indicate that Tau reduction prevents autism-like phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice. Tau may become a new target for FXS treatment."

    "abstract": "There is a critical need for effective treatment of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The purinergic antagonist suramin may improve core symptoms through restoration of normal mitochondrial function and reduction of neuro-inflammation via its known antagonism of P2X and P2Y receptors. Nonclinical studies in fragile X knockout mice and the maternal immune activation model support these hypotheses. We conducted a 14 week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof -of-concept study (N = 52) to test the efficacy and safety of suramin intravenous infusions in boys aged 4-15 years with moderate to severe ASD. The study had 3 treatment arms: 10 mg/kg suramin, 20 mg/kg suramin, and placebo given at baseline, week 4, and week 8. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist of Core Symptoms (ABC-Core) (subscales 2, 3, and 5) was the primary endpoint and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) was a secondary endpoint. Forty-four subjects completed the study. The 10 mg/kg suramin group showed a greater, but statistically non-significant, numeric improvement (- 12.5 ± 3.18 [mean ± SE]) vs. placebo (- 8.9 ± 2.86) in ABC-Core at Week 14. The 20 mg/kg suramin group did not show improvement over placebo. In exploratory analyses, the 10 mg/kg arm showed greater ABC Core differences from placebo in younger subjects and among those with less severe symptoms. In CGI-I, the 10 mg/kg arm showed a statistically significant improvement from baseline (2.8 ± 0.30 [mean ± SE]) compared to placebo (1.7 ± 0.27) (p = 0.016). The 20 mg/kg arm had a 2.0 ± 0.28 improvement in CGI-I, which was not statistically significant compared to placebo (p = 0.65). Suramin was generally safe and well tolerated over 14 weeks; most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity.

    "title": "Retinoic acid regulation of homoeostatic synaptic plasticity and its relationship to cognitive disorders.",
    "abstract": "There is increasing interest in retinoic acid (RA) as a regulator of the complex biological processes underlying the cognitive functions performed by the brain. The importance of RA in brain function is underlined by the brain's high efficiency in converting vitamin A into RA. One crucial action of RA in the brain is dependent on RA receptor α (RARα) transport out of the nucleus, where it no longer regulates transcription but carries out non-genomic functions. RARα, when localised in the cytoplasm, particularly in neuronal dendrites, acts as a translational suppressor. It regulates protein translation as a crucial part of the mechanism maintaining homoeostatic synaptic plasticity, which is characterised by neuronal changes necessary to restore and balance the excitability of neuronal networks after perturbation events. Under normal conditions of neurotransmission, RARα without ligand suppresses the translation of proteins. When neural activity is reduced, RA synthesis is stimulated, and RA signalling via RARα derepresses the translation of proteins and synergistically with the fragile X mental retardation protein allows the synthesis of Ca2+ permeable α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors that re-establish normal levels of synaptic activity. Homoeostatic synaptic plasticity underlies many cognitive processes, so its impairment due to dysregulation of RA signalling may be involved in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, which is also associated with FMRP. A full understanding of RA signalling control of homoeostatic synaptic plasticity may point to treatments."

    "abstract": "The fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, has been one of the finest systems for decoding myriad puzzles across different domains of biology. Beyond addressing the fundamental problems, it has been used as a fantastic model organism for human disease research. Being an insect, <i>Drosophila</i> has a robust and advanced olfactory system that has been used many times as a model neuronal circuit to study fundamental questions in neurobiology. The circuit is well-explored at anatomical, physiological, and functional levels. It provides several advantages for the study of neurobiological disorders, such as spatiotemporally regulated misexpression or knockdown of disease proteins, genetic tractability, well-studied neuroanatomy, simple behavioural training paradigms, and quantifiable assays. Hence, <i>Drosophila</i> olfaction has been a favourite choice for the study of several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, fragile X syndrome, etc. This review aims to discuss earlier progress and future scope in using the <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory system for modelling human neurological pathophysiology for conducting fundamental and applied research. A major goal of research in biological science is to alleviate human disease burden. Diverse experimental systems are required to address different aspects of disease aetiology. <i>Drosophila</i> is one of the finest <i>in vivo</i> systems; its olfactory system is arguably the most well-characterized circuit for modelling human neurological disorders. A vast amount of research has been conducted to decipher cellular, molecular, and even cognitive aspects of human disorders using the <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory system. This review aims at summarizing such research progress to date and critically analysing the suitability of this system for modelling more complex neurological conditions."

    "abstract": "There are no approved pharmacotherapies for fragile X syndrome (FXS), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a mutation in the FMR1 promoter region that leads to various symptoms, including intellectual disability and auditory hypersensitivity. The gene that encodes inhibitory serotonin 1A receptors (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs) is differentially expressed in embryonic brain tissue from individuals with FXS, and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs are highly expressed in neural systems that are disordered in FXS, providing a rationale to focus on 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs as targets to treat symptoms of FXS. We examined agonist-labeled 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R densities in male and female Fmr1 knockout mice and found no differences in whole-brain 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R expression in adult control compared to Fmr1 knockout mice. However, juvenile Fmr1 knockout mice had lower whole-brain 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R expression than age-matched controls. Consistent with these results, juvenile Fmr1 knockout mice showed reduced behavioral responses elicited by the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R agonist (R)-8-OH-DPAT, effects blocked by the selective 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R antagonist, WAY-100635. Also, treatment with the selective 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R agonist, NLX-112, dose-dependently prevented audiogenic seizures (AGS) in juvenile Fmr1 knockout mice, an effect reversed by WAY-100635. Suggestive of a potential role for 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs in regulating AGS, compared to males, female Fmr1 knockout mice had a lower prevalence of AGS and higher expression of antagonist-labeled 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs in the inferior colliculus and auditory cortex. These results provide preclinical support that 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R agonists may be therapeutic for young individuals with FXS hypersensitive to auditory stimuli."

    "abstract": "The current study examined patterns of event-related potential (ERP) responses during a face processing task in groups of preschoolers uniquely impacted by autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including (1) children with ASD; (2) children with fragile X syndrome (FXS); (3) children with familial risk for ASD, but without a diagnosis (i.e., ASIBs); and (4) a low-risk control (LRC) group. Children with FXS have a high incidence of ASD diagnoses, but there have been no studies of the ERP response to faces in children with FXS and little work focused on children with ASD who have cognitive impairment. The current study examined children's ERP responses to faces and houses in four groups: LRC (N = 28, age = 5.2 years), ASIB (N = 23, age = 5.5 years), FXS (N = 19, age = 5.82 years), and ASD (N = 23, age = 5.5 years). The FXS and ASD groups were characterized by the presence of cognitive impairment. Pictures of upright and inverted faces and houses were presented while recording EEG with a 128-channel system. The N170 occurred at about 200 ms post stimulus onset, was largest on the posterior-lateral electrodes, and was larger for faces than houses. The P1 and N170 ERP components were larger for the FXS group than for the other three groups. The N170 ERP amplitude for the ASD and ASIB groups was smaller than both the LRC and FXS groups, and the LRC and FXS groups had the largest N170 responses on the right side. No difference was found in N170 latency between groups. The similarity of the ASD and ASIB responses suggest a common genetic or environmental origin of the reduced response. Although children with FXS have a high incidence of ASD outcomes, they differed from ASD and ASIB children in this study. Specifically, the children with FXS were hyperresponsive to all stimulus types while the ASD and ASIB groups showed attenuated responses for specific stimuli."

    "abstract": "Cerebellar syndromes are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and can be classified as hereditary, neurodegenerative non-hereditary, or acquired. Few data are available on the frequency of each form in the clinical setting. Growing interest is emerging regarding the genetic forms caused by triplet repeat expansions. Alleles with repeat expansion lower than the pathological threshold, termed intermediate alleles (IAs), have been found to be associated with disease manifestation. In order to assess the relevance of IAs as a cause of cerebellar syndromes, we enrolled 66 unrelated Italian ataxic patients and described the distribution of the different etiology of their syndromes and the frequency of IAs. Each patient underwent complete clinical, hematological, and neurophysiological assessments, neuroimaging evaluations, and genetic tests for autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (SCA) and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). We identified the following diagnostic categories: 28% sporadic adult-onset ataxia, 18% cerebellar variant of multiple system atrophy, 9% acquired forms, 9% genetic forms with full-range expansion, and 12% cases with intermediate-range expansion. The IAs were six in the FMR1 gene, two in the gene responsible for SCA8, and one in the ATXN2 gene. The clinical phenotype of patients carrying the IAs resembles, in most of the cases, the one associated with full-range expansion. Our study provides an exhaustive description of the causes of cerebellar ataxia, estimating for the first time the frequency of IAs in SCAs- and FXTAS-associated genes. The high percentage of cases with IAs supports further screening among patients with cerebellar syndromes."

    "title": "Systemic pharmacological suppression of neural activity reverses learning impairment in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome.",
    "abstract": "The enhancement of associative synaptic plasticity often results in impaired rather than enhanced learning. Previously, we proposed that such learning impairments can result from saturation of the plasticity mechanism (Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017), or, more generally, from a history-dependent change in the threshold for plasticity. This hypothesis was based on experimental results from mice lacking two class I major histocompatibility molecules, MHCI H2-K<sup>b</sup> and H2D<sup>b</sup> (MH-CI <i>K</i><sup><i>b</i></sup><i>D</i><sup><i>b</i>-/-</sup>), which have enhanced associative long-term depression at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses in the cerebellum (PF-Purkinje cell LTD). Here, we extend this work by testing predictions of the threshold metaplasticity hypothesis in a second mouse line with enhanced PF-Purkinje cell LTD, the <i>Fmr1</i> knockout mouse model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Mice lacking <i>Fmr1</i> gene expression in cerebellar Purkinje cells (L7-<i>Fmr1</i> KO) were selectively impaired on two oculomotor learning tasks in which PF-Purkinje cell LTD has been implicated, with no impairment on LTD-independent oculomotor learning tasks. Consistent with the threshold metaplasticity hypothesis, behavioral pre-training designed to reverse LTD at the PF-Purkinje cell synapses eliminated the oculomotor learning deficit in the L7-<i>Fmr1</i> KO mice, as previously reported in MHCI <i>K</i><sup><i>b</i></sup><i>D</i><sup><i>b</i>-/-</sup>mice. In addition, diazepam treatment to suppress neural activity and thereby limit the induction of associative LTD during the pre-training period also eliminated the learning deficits in L7-<i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. These results support the hypothesis that cerebellar LTD-dependent learning is governed by an experience-dependent sliding threshold for plasticity. An increased threshold for LTD in response to elevated neural activity would tend to oppose firing rate stability, but could serve to stabilize synaptic weights and recently acquired memories. The metaplasticity perspective could inform the development of new clinical approaches for addressing learning impairments in autism and other disorders of the nervous system."

    "abstract": "The serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin shows efficacy in treating neuropsychiatric disorders, though the mechanism(s) underlying its therapeutic effects remain unclear. We show that a similar psychedelic tryptamine, <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-dipropyltryptamine (DPT), completely prevents audiogenic seizures (AGS) in an <i>Fmr1</i> knockout mouse model of fragile X syndrome at a 10 mg/kg dose but not at lower doses (3 or 5.6 mg/kg). Despite showing in vitro that DPT is a serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonist (with that rank order of functional potency, determined with TRUPATH Gα/βγ biosensors), pretreatment with selective inhibitors of 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, or 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors did not block DPT's antiepileptic effects; a pan-serotonin receptor antagonist was also ineffective. Because 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor activation blocks AGS in <i>Fmr1</i> knockout mice, we performed a dose-response experiment to evaluate DPT's engagement of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors in vivo. DPT elicited 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>-dependent effects only at doses greater than 10 mg/kg, further supporting that DPT's antiepileptic effects were not 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>-mediated. We also observed that the selective sigma1 receptor antagonist, NE-100, did not impact DPT's antiepileptic effects, suggesting DPT engagement of sigma1 receptors was not a crucial mechanism. Separately, we observed that DPT and NE-100 at high doses caused convulsions on their own that were qualitatively distinct from AGS. In conclusion, DPT dose-dependently blocked AGS in <i>Fmr1</i> knockout mice, but neither serotonin nor sigma1 receptor antagonists prevented this action. Thus, DPT might have neurotherapeutic effects independent of its serotonergic psychedelic properties. However, DPT also caused seizures at high doses, showing that DPT has complex dose-dependent in vivo polypharmacology."

Although significant sex differences are observed in FXS, few studies have focused on the phenotypic characteristics as well as the differences in brain pathological changes and gene expression in FXS by sex. Therefore, we analyzed sex differences in autism-like behavior and dendritic spine development in two-month-old male and female Fmr1 KO and C57 mice and evaluated the mechanisms at transcriptome level. Results suggest that Fmr1 KO mice display sex differences in autism-like behavior and dendritic spine density. Compared to females, male had more severe effects on anxiety, repetitive stereotype-like behaviors, and socializing, with higher dendritic spine density. Furthermore, two male-biased and five female-biased expressed genes were screened based on KEGG pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses. In conclusion, our findings show mutations in the Fmr1 gene lead to aberrant expression of related genes and affect the sex-differentiated behavioral phenotypes of Fmr1 KO mice by affecting brain development and functional architecture, and suggest future studies should focus on including female subjects to comprehensively reflect the differentiation of FXS in both sexes and develop more precise and effective therapeutic strategies."

The Pragmatic Rating Scale-School Age (PRS-SA) captures ecologically valid metrics of pragmatic language impairments in these populations. It is traditionally scored based on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), which may limit the use of the PRS-SA more broadly in research and clinical contexts. This study evaluated the feasibility of the PRS-SA based on a shorter, semistructured conversational context compared to the ADOS in school-age autistic boys (<i>n</i> = 16) and boys with FXS + ASD (<i>n</i> = 16), matched on ASD traits. Differences across ADOS and conversational contexts and associations with ASD-related social difficulties were evaluated. Findings revealed differences in PRS-SA scores between ADOS and conversational contexts, but only for the FXS + ASD group. Limited associations were observed between PRS-SA scores and ASD traits. Results from this study indicate the feasibility of using the PRS-SA in a shorter conversational context than the ADOS to assess pragmatic language among autistic boys. For boys with FXS + ASD, contextual differences warrant careful consideration in future work."

Data derived from the Fragile X Online Registry With Accessible Research Database (FORWARD), a natural history study of FXS, were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate linear and logistic regression models to examine SS and signs of HA, their impact on behavioral regulation and limitations on the subject/family. The sample (N = 933) consisted of 720 males and 213 females. More males were affected with SS (87% vs. 68%) and signs of HA (92% vs. 79%). Subjects who were endorsed as having a strong sensory response had more comorbidities, including behavioral problems. The predominant SS was difficulty with eye gaze that increased with age in both genders. As individuals age, there was less use of non-medication therapies, such as occupational therapy (OT)/physical therapy (PT), but there was more use of psychopharmacological medications and investigational drugs for behaviors. Multiple regression models suggested that endorsing SS and signs of HA was associated with statistically significantly increased ABC-C-I subscale scores and limited participation in everyday activities. This study improves our understanding of SS and signs of HA as well as their impact in FXS. It supports the need for more research regarding these clinical symptoms, especially to understand how they contribute to well-known behavioral concerns."

To better understand the consequences of the absence of FMRP, we analyzed gene expression profiles and activities of cortical neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons obtained from FXS patients' induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) and IPSC-derived cells from FMR1 knock-out engineered using CRISPR-CAS9 technology. Multielectrode array recordings revealed in FMR1 KO and FXS patient cells, decreased mean firing rates; activities blocked by tetrodotoxin application. Increased expression of presynaptic mRNA and transcription factors involved in the forebrain specification and decreased levels of mRNA coding AMPA and NMDA subunits were observed using RNA sequencing on <i>FMR1</i> KO neurons and validated using quantitative PCR in both models. Intriguingly, 40% of the differentially expressed genes were commonly deregulated between NPCs and differentiating neurons with significant enrichments in FMRP targets and autism-related genes found amongst downregulated genes. Our findings suggest that the absence of FMRP affects transcriptional profiles since the NPC stage, and leads to impaired activity and neuronal differentiation over time, which illustrates the critical role of FMRP protein in neuronal development."

Treatment with a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet increased the percentage of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in both wild type and <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> mice during the dark cycle, which corresponded to decreased activity levels. Treatment with a ketogenic diet flattened diurnal sleep periodicity in both wild type and <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> mice. Differences in several sleep microstructure outcomes (number and length of sleep and wake bouts) supported the altered sleep states in response to a ketogenic diet and were correlated with altered rest-activity cycles. While actigraphy may be a less expensive, reduced labor surrogate for sleep EEG during the dark cycle, daytime resting in mice did not correlate with EEG sleep states."

    "title": "Exploration of SUMO2/3 Expression Levels and Autophagy Process in Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome: Addressing Study Limitations and Insights for Future Research.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder that appears in adult <i>FMR1</i> premutation carriers. The neuropathological hallmark of FXTAS is an intranuclear inclusion in neurons and astrocytes. Nearly 200 different proteins have been identified in FXTAS inclusions, being the small ubiquitin-related modifier 2 (SUMO2), ubiquitin and p62 the most highly abundant. These proteins are components of the protein degradation machinery. This study aimed to characterize SUMO2/3 expression levels and autophagy process in human <i>postmortem</i> brain samples and skin fibroblast cultures from FXTAS patients. Results revealed that FXTAS <i>postmortem</i> brain samples are positive for SUMO2/3 conjugates and supported the idea that SUMO2/3 accumulation is involved in inclusion formation. Insights from RNA-sequencing data indicated that SUMOylation processes are significantly upregulated in FXTAS samples. In addition, the analysis of the autophagy flux showed the accumulation of p62 protein levels and autophagosomes in skin fibroblasts from FXTAS patients. Similarly, gene set analysis evidenced a significant downregulation in gene ontology terms related to autophagy in FXTAS samples. Overall, this study provides new evidence supporting the role of SUMOylation and autophagic processes in the pathogenic mechanisms underlying FXTAS."

    "abstract": "Intellectual disability (ID) is a heterogeneous condition affecting brain development, function, and/or structure. The X-linked mode of inheritance of ID (X-linked intellectual disability; XLID) has a prevalence of 1 out of 600 to 1000 males. In the last decades, exome sequencing technology has revolutionized the process of disease-causing gene discovery in XLIDs. Nevertheless, so many of them still remain with unknown etiology. This study investigated four families with severe XLID to identify deleterious variants for possible diagnostics and prevention aims. Nine male patients belonging to four pedigrees were included in this study. The patients were studied genetically for Fragile X syndrome, followed by whole exome sequencing and analysis of intellectual disability-related genes variants. Sanger sequencing, co-segregation analysis, structural modeling, and in silico analysis were done to verify the causative variants. In addition, we collected data from previous studies to compare and situate our work with existing knowledge. In three of four families, novel deleterious variants have been identified in three different genes, including ZDHHC9 (p. Leu189Pro), ATP2B3 (p. Asp847Glu), and GLRA2 (p. Arg350Cys) and also with new clinical features and in another one family, a reported pathogenic variant in the L1CAM (p. Glu309Lys) gene has been identified related to new clinical findings. The current study's findings expand the existing knowledge of variants of the genes implicated in XLID and broaden the spectrum of phenotypes associated with the related conditions. The data have implications for genetic diagnosis and counseling."

    "abstract": "Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 protein (FMRP) deficiency leads to fragile X syndrome (FXS), an autism spectrum disorder. The role of FMRP in prenatal human brain development remains unclear. Here, we show that FMRP is important for human and macaque prenatal brain development. Both FMRP-deficient neurons in human fetal cortical slices and FXS patient stem cell-derived neurons exhibit mitochondrial dysfunctions and hyperexcitability. Using multiomics analyses, we have identified both FMRP-bound mRNAs and FMRP-interacting proteins in human neurons and unveiled a previously unknown role of FMRP in regulating essential genes during human prenatal development. We demonstrate that FMRP interaction with CNOT1 maintains the levels of receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1), a species-specific FMRP target. Genetic reduction of RACK1 leads to both mitochondrial dysfunctions and hyperexcitability, resembling FXS neurons. Finally, enhancing mitochondrial functions rescues deficits of FMRP-deficient cortical neurons during prenatal development, demonstrating targeting mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential treatment."

    "abstract": "Attention deficit is one of the most prominent and disabling symptoms in Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli contributes to attention difficulties by overwhelming and/or distracting affected individuals, which disrupts activities of daily living at home and learning at school. We find that auditory or visual distractors selectively impair visual discrimination performance in humans and mice with FXS but not in typically developing controls. In both species, males and females were examined. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) neurons were significantly modulated by incorrect responses in the poststimulus period during early distractor trials in WT mice, consistent with their known role as error signals. Strikingly, however, VIP cells from <i>Fmr1</i> <sup>-/-</sup> mice showed little modulation in error trials, and this correlated with their poor performance on the distractor task. Thus, VIP interneurons and their reduced modulatory influence on pyramidal cells could be a potential therapeutic target for attentional difficulties in FXS.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sensory hypersensitivity, impulsivity, and persistent inattention are among the most consistent clinical features of FXS, all of which impede daily functioning and create barriers to learning. However, the neural mechanisms underlying sensory over-reactivity remain elusive. To overcome a significant challenge in translational FXS research we demonstrate a compelling alignment of sensory over-reactivity in both humans with FXS and <i>Fmr1</i> <sup>-/-</sup> mice (the principal animal model of FXS) using a novel analogous distractor task. Two-photon microscopy in mice revealed that lack of modulation by VIP cells contributes to susceptibility to distractors. Implementing research efforts we describe here can help identify dysfunctional neural mechanisms associated not only with sensory issues but broader impairments, including those in learning and cognition."

    "abstract": "The neurodevelopmental disorder fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common monogenic cause of intellectual disability associated with autism spectrum disorder. Inaccessibility to developing human brain cells is a major barrier to studying FXS. Direct-to-neural precursor reprogramming provides a unique platform to investigate the developmental profile of FXS-associated phenotypes throughout neural precursor and neuron generation, at a temporal resolution not afforded by post-mortem tissue and in a patient-specific context not represented in rodent models. Direct reprogramming also circumvents the protracted culture times and low efficiency of current induced pluripotent stem cell strategies. We have developed a chemically modified mRNA (cmRNA) -based direct reprogramming protocol to generate dorsal forebrain precursors (hiDFPs) from FXS patient-derived fibroblasts, with subsequent differentiation to glutamatergic cortical neurons and astrocytes. We observed differential expression of mature neuronal markers suggesting impaired neuronal development and maturation in FXS- hiDFP-derived neurons compared to controls. FXS- hiDFP-derived cortical neurons exhibited dendritic growth and arborization deficits characterized by reduced neurite length and branching consistent with impaired neuronal maturation. Furthermore, FXS- hiDFP-derived neurons exhibited a significant decrease in the density of pre- and post- synaptic proteins and reduced glutamate-induced calcium activity, suggesting impaired excitatory synapse development and functional maturation. We also observed a reduced yield of FXS- hiDFP-derived neurons with a significant increase in FXS-affected astrocytes. This study represents the first reported derivation of FXS-affected cortical neurons following direct reprogramming of patient fibroblasts to dorsal forebrain precursors and subsequently neurons that recapitulate the key molecular hallmarks of FXS as it occurs in human tissue. We propose that direct to hiDFP reprogramming provides a unique platform for further study into the pathogenesis of FXS as well as the identification and screening of new drug targets for the treatment of FXS."

    "abstract": "Abnormal cellular and circuit excitability is believed to drive many core phenotypes in fragile X syndrome (FXS). The dentate gyrus is a brain area performing critical computations essential for learning and memory. However, little is known about dentate circuit defects and their mechanisms in FXS. Understanding dentate circuit dysfunction in FXS has been complicated by the presence of two types of excitatory neurons, the granule cells and mossy cells. Here we report that loss of FMRP markedly decreased excitability of dentate mossy cells, a change opposite to all other known excitability defects in excitatory neurons in FXS. This mossy cell hypo-excitability is caused by increased Kv7 function in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. By reducing the excitatory drive onto local hilar interneurons, hypo-excitability of mossy cells results in increased excitation/inhibition ratio in granule cells and thus paradoxically leads to excessive dentate output. Circuit-wide inhibition of Kv7 channels in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice increases inhibitory drive onto granule cells and normalizes the dentate output in response to physiologically relevant theta-gamma coupling stimulation. Our study suggests that circuit-based interventions may provide a promising strategy in this disorder to bypass irreconcilable excitability defects in different cell types and restore their pathophysiological consequences at the circuit level."

We have found elevated APP metabolites (total APP, secreted (s) APPα, and α-secretase adamalysins in the plasma and brain tissue of children with ASD). In this review, we highlight several lines of evidence supporting APP metabolites' potential contribution to macrocephaly in ASD. First, APP appears early in corticogenesis, placing APP in a prime position to accelerate growth in neurons and glia. APP metabolites are upregulated in neuroinflammation, another potential contributor to excessive brain growth in ASD. APP metabolites appear to directly affect translational signaling pathways, which have been linked to single gene forms of syndromic ASD (Fragile X Syndrome, PTEN, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex). Finally, APP metabolites, and microRNA, which regulates APP expression, may contribute to ASD brain overgrowth, particularly increased white matter, through ERK receptor activation on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/Rho GTPase pathway, favoring myelination."

    "abstract": "Fragile-X syndrome(FXS) is a neurological disease caused by abnormal repeats in the 5'untranslated region of the FMR1 gene leading to a defective fragile-X-messenger-ribonucleoprotein-1 (FMRP). Although relatively common in children, it is usually under-diagnosed especially in developing countries where genetic screening is not routinely practiced. So far, FXS lacks a laboratory biomarker that can be used for screening, severity scoring or therapeutic monitoring of potential new treatments. 110 subjects were recruited; 80 male children with suspected FXS and 30 matched healthy children. We evaluated the clinical utility of serum matrix metalloproteinase-9(MMP9) and amyloid-beta protein precursor(APP) as potential biomarkers for FXS. Out of 80 suspected children, 14 had full mutation, 8 had the premutation and 58 children had normal genotypes. No statistically-significant difference was detected between children with different genotypes concerning age of onset(P = 0.658), main clinical presentation(P = 0.388), clinical severity-score(P = 0.799), patient's disease-course(P = 0.719) and intellectual disability(P = 0.351). Both MMP9 and APP showed a statistically significant difference when comparing different genotype subgroups(P = 0.019 and < 0.001, respectively). Clinically, MMP9 levels were highest in children presenting with language defects, while APP was highest in children with neurodevelopmental delay. In receiver operating curve analysis, comparing full and premutation with the normal genotype group, MMP9 has an area-under-the-curve of 0.701(95 % CI 0.557-0.845), while APP was marginally better at 0.763(95 % CI 0.620-0.906). When combined together, elevated MMP9 or APP had excellent sensitivity > 95 % for picking-up FXS cases in the clinical setting. Screening for circulating biomarkers in the absence of FXS genetic diagnosis is justified. Our study is the first to evaluate both MMP9 and APP in FXS suspected children in a clinical setting and to assess their correlation with disease presentation and severity."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the single most common monogenetic cause of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in humans. FXS is caused by loss of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an mRNA-binding protein encoded on the X chromosome involved in suppressing protein translation. Sensory processing deficits have been a major focus of studies of FXS in both humans and rodent models of FXS, but olfactory deficits remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted experiments in wild-type (WT) and <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out (KO; <i>Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup></i> ) mice (males) that lack expression of the gene encoding FMRP to assess olfactory circuit and behavioral abnormalities. In patch-clamp recordings conducted in slices of the olfactory bulb, output mitral cells (MCs) in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice displayed greatly enhanced excitation under baseline conditions, as evidenced by a much higher rate of occurrence of spontaneous network-level events known as long-lasting depolarizations (LLDs). The higher probability of spontaneous LLDs (sLLDs), which appeared to be because of a decrease in GABAergic synaptic inhibition in glomeruli leading to more feedforward excitation, caused a reduction in the reliability of stimulation-evoked responses in MCs. In addition, in a go/no-go operant discrimination paradigm, we found that <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice displayed impaired discrimination of odors in difficult tasks that involved odor mixtures but not altered discrimination of monomolecular odors. We suggest that the <i>Fmr1</i> KO-induced reduction in MC response reliability is one plausible mechanism for the impaired fine odor discrimination.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Fragile X syndrome (FXS) in humans is associated with a range of debilitating deficits including aberrant sensory processing. One sensory system that has received comparatively little attention in studies in animal models of FXS is olfaction. Here, we report the first comprehensive physiological analysis of circuit defects in the olfactory bulb in the commonly-used <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out (KO) mouse model of FXS. Our studies indicate that <i>Fmr1</i> KO alters the local excitation/inhibition balance in the bulb, similar to what <i>Fmr1</i> KO does in other brain circuits, but through a novel mechanism that involves enhanced feedforward excitation. Furthermore, <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice display behavioral impairments in fine odor discrimination, an effect that may be explained by changes in neural response reliability."

    "abstract": "Trehalose is a naturally occurring sugar found in various food and pharmaceutical preparations with the ability to enhance cellular proteostasis and reduce the formation of toxic intracellular protein aggregates, making it a promising therapeutic candidate for various neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we explored the effectiveness of nutritional trehalose supplementation in ameliorating symptoms in a mouse model of Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), an incurable late onset manifestation of moderately expanded trinucleotide CGG repeat expansion mutations in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 gene (<i>FMR1</i>). An inducible mouse model of FXTAS expressing 90 CGG repeats in the brain had been previously developed, which faithfully captures hallmarks of the disorder, the formation of intracellular inclusions, and the disturbance of motor function. Taking advantage of the inducible nature of the model, we investigated the therapeutic potential of orally administered trehalose under two regimens, modelling disease prevention and disease treatment. Trehalose's effectiveness in combating protein aggregation is frequently attributed to its ability to induce autophagy. Accordingly, trehalose supplementation under the prevention regimen ameliorated the formation of intranuclear inclusions and improved the motor deficiencies resulting from the induced expression of 90 CGG repeats, but it failed to reverse the existing nuclear pathology as a treatment strategy. Given the favorable safety profile of trehalose, it is promising to further explore the potential of this agent for early stage FXTAS."

    "title": "RNA-Binding Proteins: A Role in Neurotoxicity?",
    "abstract": "Despite sustained efforts to treat neurodegenerative diseases, little is known at the molecular level to understand and generate novel therapeutic approaches for these malignancies. Therefore, it is not surprising that neurogenerative diseases are among the leading causes of death in the aged population. Neurons require sophisticated cellular mechanisms to maintain proper protein homeostasis. These cells are generally sensitive to loss of gene expression control at the post-transcriptional level. Post-translational control responds to signals that can arise from intracellular processes or environmental factors that can be regulated through RNA-binding proteins. These proteins recognize RNA through one or more RNA-binding domains and form ribonucleoproteins that are critically involved in the regulation of post-transcriptional processes from splicing to the regulation of association of the translation machinery allowing a relatively rapid and precise modulation of the transcriptome. Neurotoxicity is the result of the biological, chemical, or physical interaction of agents with an adverse effect on the structure and function of the central nervous system. The disruption of the proper levels or function of RBPs in neurons and glial cells triggers neurotoxic events that are linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), fragile X syndrome (FXS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) among many others. The connection between RBPs and neurodegenerative diseases opens a new landscape for potentially novel therapeutic targets for the intervention of these neurodegenerative pathologies. In this contribution, a summary of the recent findings of the molecular mechanisms involved in the plausible role of RBPs in RNA processing in neurodegenerative disease is discussed."

This review focuses on CGG STR expansions associated with NDDs and their impact on gene expression through repeat expansion-mediated epigenetic silencing. We explore the molecular mechanisms underlying CGG-repeat expansion and the resulting epigenetic modifications, such as DNA hypermethylation and gene silencing. Additionally, we discuss the involvement of other CGG STRs in neurodevelopmental diseases. Several examples, including FMR1, AFF2, AFF3, XYLT1, FRA10AC1, CBL, and DIP2B, highlight the complex relationship between CGG STR expansions and NDDs. Furthermore, recent advancements in this field are highlighted, shedding light on potential future research directions. Understanding the role of STRs, particularly CGG-repeats, in NDDs has the potential to uncover novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these challenging disorders."

Molecular mechanisms leading to fragile X-premutation-associated conditions (FXPAC) include cotranscriptional R-loop formations, <i>FMR1</i> mRNA toxicity through both RNA gelation into nuclear foci and sequestration of various CGG-repeat-binding proteins, and the repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN)-initiated translation of potentially toxic proteins.

While there is currently no cure for FXS, EEG is considered an important method to investigate the pathophysiology and evaluate behavioral and cognitive treatments. We conducted EEG microstate analysis to investigate resting brain dynamics in FXS participants. Resting-state recordings from 70 FXS participants and 71 chronological age-matched typically developing control (TDC) participants were used to derive microstates via modified k-means clustering. The occurrence, mean global field power (GFP), and global explained variance (GEV) of microstate C were significantly higher in the FXS group compared to the TDC group. The mean GFP was significantly negatively correlated with non-verbal IQ (NVIQ) in the FXS group, where lower NVIQ scores were associated with greater GFP. In addition, the occurrence, mean duration, mean GFP, and GEV of microstate D were significantly greater in the FXS group than the TDC group. The mean GFP and occurrence of microstate D were also correlated with individual alpha frequencies in the FXS group, where lower IAF frequencies accompanied greater microstate GFP and occurrence. Alterations in microstates C and D may be related to the two well-established cognitive characteristics of FXS, intellectual disabilities and attention impairments, suggesting that microstate parameters could serve as markers to study cognitive impairments and evaluate treatment outcomes in this population. Slowing of the alpha peak frequency and its correlation to microstate D parameters may suggest changes in thalamocortical dynamics in FXS, which could be specifically related to attention control.

However, the full profile of adaptive function in 3q29del has not been described nor has it been compared with other genomic syndromes associated with elevated risk for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Individuals with 3q29del (n = 32, 62.5% male) were evaluated using the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales, Third Edition, Comprehensive Parent/Caregiver Form (Vineland-3). We explored the relationship between adaptive behaviour and cognitive function, executive function, and neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric comorbidities in our 3q29del study sample, and we compared subjects with 3q29del with published data on fragile X syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes. Individuals with 3q29del had global deficits in adaptive behaviour that were not driven by specific weaknesses in any given domain. Individual neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diagnoses had a small effect on adaptive behaviour, and the cumulative number of comorbid diagnoses was significantly negatively associated with Vineland-3 performance. Both cognitive ability and executive function were significantly associated with adaptive behaviour, and executive function was a better predictor of Vineland-3 performance than cognitive ability. Finally, the severity of adaptive behaviour deficits in 3q29del was distinct from previously published data on comparable genomic disorders. Individuals with 3q29del have significant deficits in adaptive behaviour, affecting all domains assessed by the Vineland-3. Executive function is a better predictor of adaptive behaviour than cognitive ability in this population and suggests that interventions targeting executive function may be an effective therapeutic strategy."

Study inclusion criteria included individuals with FXS and (1) age 6-40 years, (2) full-scale IQ < 84, and (3) language ≥3-word phrases. ASD symptom severity was determined by Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2). Other measures identified non-verbal IQ, adaptive skills, and aberrant behaviors. Molecular measures included blood FMR1 and CYFIP1 mRNA levels, FMRP and MMP9 levels. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Spearman's correlations were used to compare ASD severity groups. Data from 54 individuals was included with no/mild (N = 7), moderate (N = 18), and severe (N = 29) ASD. Individuals with high ASD severity had lower adaptive behavior scores (47.48 ± 17.49) than the no/mild group (69.00 ± 20.45, p = 0.0366); they also had more challenging behaviors, lethargy, and stereotypic behaviors. CYFIP1 mRNA expression levels positively correlated with the ADOS-2 comparison score(r<sup>2</sup> = 0.33, p = 0.0349), with no significant correlations with other molecular markers. In conclusion, autism symptom severity is associated with more adverse cognitive and adaptive skills and specific behaviors in FXS, whereas CYFIP1 mRNA expression levels may be a potential biomarker for severity of ASD in FXS."

There is no racial/ethnic association with carrying a PM, but African American women historically experience barriers receiving quality healthcare in the USA. Obstacles to care may increase mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. Eight African American women with a PM were interviewed to explore disparities in receiving healthcare and to learn about psychosocial experiences during and after their diagnoses. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and independently coded by two researchers. A deductive-inductive approach was used, followed by thematic analysis to determine prominent themes. The average participant age was 52.3 ± 8.60 years, with a mean age at premutation diagnosis of 31 ± 5.95 years. Seven participants had children with FXS. Themes from interviews included healthcare experiences, family dynamics, and emotional/mental health after their diagnosis. Participants reported concerns about not being taken seriously by providers and mistrust of the medical institutions. Within families, participants reported denial, insensitivity, and isolation. Participants reported a high incidence of anxiety and depression. Both are symptoms of FXAND and stresses of systemic racism and sexism. The reported family dynamics around the news of a genetic diagnosis stand apart from other racial cohorts in fragile X research: interventions like family counseling sessions and inclusive support opportunities from national organizations could ease the impacts of a PM for African American women."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neuro-developmental disorder caused by silencing <i>Fmr1</i>, which encodes the RNA-binding protein FMRP. Although <i>Fmr1</i> is expressed in adult neurons, it has been challenging to separate acute from chronic effects of loss of <i>Fmr1</i> in models of FXS. We have used the precision of <i>Drosophila</i> genetics to test if <i>Fmr1</i> acutely affects adult neuronal plasticity <i>in vivo</i>, focusing on the s-LNv circadian pacemaker neurons that show 24 hour rhythms in structural plasticity. We found that over-expressing <i>Fmr1</i> for only 4 hours blocks the activity-dependent expansion of s-LNv projections without altering the circadian clock or activity-regulated gene expression. Conversely, acutely reducing <i>Fmr1</i> expression prevented s-LNv projections from retracting. One FMRP target that we identified in s-LNvs is <i>sif</i>, which encodes a Rac1 GEF. Our data indicate that FMRP normally reduces <i>sif</i> mRNA translation at dusk to reduce Rac1 activity. Overall, our data reveal a previously unappreciated rapid and direct role for FMRP in acutely regulating neuronal plasticity in adult neurons, and underscore the importance of RNA-binding proteins in this process."

We show that a unique peptide motif in NSP3 binds directly to the two central KH domains of FMRPs and that this interaction is disrupted by the I304N mutation found in a patient with fragile X syndrome. NSP3 binding to FMRPs disrupts their interaction with the stress granule component UBAP2L through direct competition with a peptide motif in UBAP2L to prevent FMRP incorporation into stress granules. Collectively, our results provide novel insight into how SARS-CoV-2 hijacks host cell proteins for efficient infection and provides molecular insight to the possible underlying molecular defects in fragile X syndrome."

    "title": "A Longitudinal Study of Executive Function in Daily Life in Male Fragile X Premutation Carriers and Association with FXTAS Conversion.",
    "abstract": "Men with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) often develop executive dysfunction, characterized by disinhibition, frontal dyscontrol of movement, and working memory and attention changes. Although cross-sectional studies have suggested that earlier executive function changes may precede FXTAS, the lack of longitudinal studies have made it difficult to address this hypothesis. This study included 66 <i>FMR1</i> premutation carriers (PC) ranging from 40-78 years (Mean=59.5) and 31 well-matched healthy controls (HC) ages 40-75 (Mean 57.7) at baseline. Eighty-four participants returned for 2-5 follow up visits over a duration of 1 to 9 years (Mean=4.6); 28 of the PC developed FXTAS. The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A) was completed by participants and their spouses/partners at each visit. Longitudinal mixed model regression analyses showed a greater decline with age in PC compared to HC on the Metacognition Index (MI; self-initiation, working memory, organization, task monitoring). Conversion to FXTAS was associated with worsening MI and Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI; inhibition, flexibility, emotion modulation). For spouse/partner report, FXTAS conversion was associated with worsening MI. Finally, BRIEF-A executive function problems at baseline significantly predicted later development of FXTAS. These findings suggest that executive function changes represent a prodrome of the later movement disorder."

    "abstract": "Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the <i>FMR1</i> premutation. Currently, it is not possible to determine when and if individual premutation carriers will develop FXTAS. Thus, with the aim to identify biomarkers for early diagnosis, development, and progression of FXTAS, along with associated dysregulated pathways, we performed blood proteomic profiling of premutation carriers (PM) who, as part of an ongoing longitudinal study, emerged into two distinct groups: those who developed symptoms of FXTAS (converters, CON) over time (at subsequent visits) and those who did not (non-converters, NCON). We compared these groups to age-matched healthy controls (HC). We assessed CGG repeat allele size by Southern blot and PCR analysis. The proteomic profile was obtained by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We identified several significantly differentiated proteins between HC and the PM groups at Visit 1 (V1), Visit 2 (V2), and between the visits. We further reported the dysregulated protein pathways, including sphingolipid and amino acid metabolism. Our findings are in agreement with previous studies showing that pathways involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics, as observed in other neurodegenerative disorders, are significantly altered and appear to contribute to the development of FXTAS. Lastly, we compared the blood proteome of the PM who developed FXTAS over time with the CSF proteome of the FXTAS patients recently reported and found eight significantly differentially expressed proteins in common. To our knowledge, this is the first report of longitudinal proteomic profiling and the identification of unique biomarkers and dysregulated protein pathways in FXTAS."

    "title": "Dysregulated COMT Expression in Fragile X Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Transcriptional and proteomics analyses in human fragile X syndrome (FXS) neurons identified markedly reduced expression of COMT, a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of catecholamines, including dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine. FXS is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. COMT encodes for catechol-o-methyltransferase and its association with neuropsychiatric disorders and cognitive function has been extensively studied. We observed a significantly reduced level of COMT in in FXS human neural progenitors and neurons, as well as hippocampal neurons from Fmr1 null mice. We show that deficits in COMT were associated with an altered response in an assay of dopaminergic activity in Fmr1 null mice. These findings demonstrate that loss of FMRP downregulates COMT expression and affects dopamine signaling in FXS, and supports the notion that targeting catecholamine metabolism may be useful in regulating certain neuropsychiatric aspects of FXS."

    "abstract": "The course of pathophysiological mechanisms involved in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) remains largely unknown. Previous proteomics and metabolomics studies conducted in blood samples collected from <i>FMR1</i> premutation carriers with FXTAS reported abnormalities in energy metabolism, and precursors of gluconeogenesis showed significant changes in plasma expression levels in <i>FMR1</i> premutation carriers who developed FXTAS. We conducted an analysis of postmortem human brain tissues from 44 donors, 25 brains with FXTAS, and 19 matched controls. We quantified the metabolite relative abundance in the inferior temporal gyrus and the cerebellum using untargeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics. We investigated how the metabolite type and abundance relate to the number of cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeats, to markers of neurodegeneration, and to the symptoms of FXTAS. A metabolomic analysis identified 191 primary metabolites, the data were log-transformed and normalized prior to the analysis, and the relative abundance was compared between the groups. The changes in the relative abundance of a set of metabolites were region-specific with some overlapping results; 22 metabolites showed alterations in the inferior temporal gyrus, while 21 showed differences in the cerebellum. The relative abundance of cytidine was decreased in the inferior temporal gyrus, and a lower abundance was found in the cases with larger CGG expansions; oleamide was significantly decreased in the cerebellum. The abundance of 11 metabolites was influenced by changes in the CGG repeat number. A histological evaluation found an association between the presence of microhemorrhages in the inferior temporal gyrus and a lower abundance of 2,5-dihydroxypyrazine. Our study identified alterations in the metabolites involved in the oxidative-stress response and bioenergetics in the brains of individuals with FXTAS. Significant changes in the abundance of cytidine and oleamide suggest their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for FXTAS."

    "title": "A Novel Head-Fixed Assay for Social Touch in Mice Uncovers Aversive Responses in Two Autism Models.",
    "abstract": "Social touch, an important aspect of social interaction and communication, is essential to kinship across animal species. How animals experience and respond to social touch has not been thoroughly investigated, in part because of the lack of appropriate assays. Previous studies that examined social touch in freely moving rodents lacked the necessary temporal and spatial control over individual touch interactions. We designed a novel head-fixed assay for social touch in mice, in which the experimenter has complete control to elicit highly stereotyped bouts of social touch between two animals. The user determines the number, duration, context, and type of social touch interactions, while monitoring an array of complex behavioral responses with high resolution cameras. We focused on social touch to the face because of its high translational relevance to humans. We validated this assay in two different models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out (KO) model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and maternal immune activation (MIA) mice. We observed higher rates of avoidance running, hyperarousal, and aversive facial expressions (AFEs) to social touch than to object touch, in both ASD models compared with controls. <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice showed more AFEs to mice of the same sex but whether they were stranger or familiar mice mattered less. Because this new social touch assay for head-fixed mice can be used to record neural activity during repeated bouts of social touch it could be used to uncover underlying circuit differences.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Social touch is important for communication in animals and humans. However, it has not been extensively studied and current assays to measure animals' responses to social touch have limitations. We present a novel head-fixed assay to quantify how mice respond to social facial touch with another mouse. We validated this assay in autism mouse models since autistic individuals exhibit differences in social interaction and touch sensitivity. We find that mouse models of autism exhibit more avoidance, hyperarousal, and aversive facial expressions (AFEs) to social touch compared with controls. Thus, this novel assay can be used to investigate behavioral responses to social touch and the underlying brain mechanisms in rodent models of neurodevelopmental conditions, and to evaluate therapeutic responses in preclinical studies."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome is caused by the expansion of CGG triplets in the <i>FMR1</i> gene, which generates epigenetic changes that silence its expression. The absence of the protein coded by this gene, FMRP, causes cellular dysfunction, leading to impaired brain development and functional abnormalities. The physical and neurologic manifestations of the disease appear early in life and may suggest the diagnosis. However, it must be confirmed by molecular tests. It affects multiple areas of daily living and greatly burdens the affected individuals and their families. Fragile X syndrome is the most common monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder; the diagnosis should be suspected in every patient with neurodevelopmental delay. Early interventions could improve the functional prognosis of patients with Fragile X syndrome, significantly impacting their quality of life and daily functioning. Therefore, healthcare for children with Fragile X syndrome should include a multidisciplinary approach."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDFXLEARN, the first-ever large multisite trial of effects of disease-targeted pharmacotherapy on learning, was designed to explore a paradigm for measuring effects of mechanism-targeted treatment in fragile X syndrome (FXS). In FXLEARN, the effects of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5) negative allosteric modulator (NAM) AFQ056 on language learning were evaluated in 3- to 6-year-old children with FXS, expected to have more learning plasticity than adults, for whom prior trials of mGluR5 NAMs have failed.METHODSAfter a 4-month single-blind placebo lead-in, participants were randomized 1:1 to AFQ056 or placebo, with 2 months of dose optimization to the maximum tolerated dose, then 6 months of treatment during which a language-learning intervention was implemented for both groups. The primary outcome was a centrally scored videotaped communication measure, the Weighted Communication Scale (WCS). Secondary outcomes were objective performance-based and parent-reported cognitive and language measures.RESULTSFXLEARN enrolled 110 participants, randomized 99, and had 91 who completed the placebo-controlled period. Although both groups made language progress and there were no safety issues, the change in WCS score during the placebo-controlled period was not significantly different between the AFQ056 and placebo-treated groups, nor were there any significant between-group differences in change in any secondary measures.CONCLUSIONDespite the large body of evidence supporting use of mGluR5 NAMs in animal models of FXS, this study suggests that this mechanism of action does not translate into benefit for the human FXS population and that better strategies are needed to determine which mechanisms will translate from preclinical models to humans in genetic neurodevelopmental disorders.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClincalTrials.gov NCT02920892.FUNDING SOURCESNeuroNEXT network NIH grants U01NS096767, U24NS107200, U24NS107209, U01NS077323, U24NS107183, U24NS107168, U24NS107128, U24NS107199, U24NS107198, U24NS107166, U10NS077368, U01NS077366, U24NS107205, U01NS077179, and U01NS077352; NIH grant P50HD103526; and Novartis IIT grant AFQ056X2201T for provision of AFQ056."

    "abstract": "Sigma receptors are protein chaperones with the unexpected characteristic of being activated by ligand binding. As such, they represent intriguing new targets for potential drug development. As a protein chaperone, these \"receptors\" escort proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to their destinations and act to correct misfolded proteins. The two subtypes of sigma receptors, named σ1 and σ2, are markedly distinct from each other. Agonists and antagonists at these receptors show promise as new drug targets, addressing a range of diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and cardiac disorders, and may also be analgesic agents and rehabilitation drugs for opioid use disorder. As an analgesic, sigma receptors seem to be more effective in treating neuropathic than nociceptive pain. New bifunctional compounds are being developed with opioids, because agents targeting sigma receptors may have an opioid-sparing effect. The pipeline of agents based on the sigma receptors is long and may treat things from Fragile X syndrome to Parkinson's disease to Huntington's disease to cancer. A novel agent ADV502 acts as a high-affinity σ1 antagonist and partial agonist at the µ-opioid receptor and may be an important agent both for the treatment of neuropathic cancer pain and for rehabilitation of opioid use disorder. Since there has been little recent innovation in pain medicine regarding new compounds and drug targets, drugs that affect the sigma receptor system seem promising and encouraging."

    "title": "Carrier Screening Programs for Cystic Fibrosis, Fragile X Syndrome, Hemoglobinopathies and Thalassemia, and Spinal Muscular Atrophy: A Health Technology Assessment.",
    "abstract": "We conducted a health technology assessment to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of carrier screening programs for cystic fibrosis (CF), fragile X syndrome (FXS), hemoglobinopathies and thalassemia, and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in people who are considering a pregnancy or who are pregnant. We also evaluated the budget impact of publicly funding carrier screening programs, and patient preferences and values. We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Non-randomized Studies (RoBANS), and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature search and conducted cost-effectiveness analyses comparing preconception or prenatal carrier screening programs to no screening. We considered four carrier screening strategies: 1) universal screening with standard panels; 2) universal screening with a hypothetical expanded panel; 3) risk-based screening with standard panels; and 4) risk-based screening with a hypothetical expanded panel. We also estimated the 5-year budget impact of publicly funding preconception or prenatal carrier screening programs for the given conditions in Ontario. To contextualize the potential value of carrier screening, we spoke with 22 people who had sought out carrier screening. We included 107 studies in the clinical evidence review. Carrier screening for CF, hemoglobinopathies and thalassemia, FXS, and SMA likely results in the identification of couples with an increased chance of having an affected pregnancy (GRADE: Moderate). Screening likely impacts reproductive decision-making (GRADE: Moderate) and may result in lower anxiety among pregnant people, although the evidence is uncertain (GRADE: Very low).We included 21 studies in the economic evidence review, but none of the study findings were directly applicable to the Ontario context. Our cost-effectiveness analyses showed that in the short term, preconception or prenatal carrier screening programs identified more at-risk pregnancies (i.e., couples that tested positive) and provided more reproductive choice options compared with no screening, but were associated with higher costs. While all screening strategies had similar values for health outcomes, when comparing all strategies together, universal screening with standard panels was the most cost-effective strategy for both preconception and prenatal periods. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of universal screening with standard panels compared with no screening in the preconception period were $29,106 per additional at-risk pregnancy detected and $367,731 per affected birth averted; the corresponding ICERs in the prenatal period were about $29,759 per additional at-risk pregnancy detected and $431,807 per affected birth averted.We estimated that publicly funding a universal carrier screening program in the preconception period over the next 5 years would require between $208 million and $491 million. Publicly funding a risk-based screening program in the preconception period over the next 5 years would require between $1.3 million and $2.7 million. Publicly funding a universal carrier screening program in the prenatal period over the next 5 years would require between $128 million and $305 million. Publicly funding a risk-based screening program in the prenatal period over the next 5 years would require between $0.8 million and $1.7 million. Accounting for treatment costs of the screened health conditions resulted in a decrease in the budget impact of universally provided carrier screening programs or cost savings for risk-based programs.Participants value the perceived potential positive impact of carrier screening programs such as medical benefits from early detection and treatment, information for reproductive decision-making, and the social benefit of awareness and preparation. There was a strong preference expressed for thorough, timely, unbiased information to allow for informed reproductive decision-making. Carrier screening for CF, FXS, hemoglobinopathies and thalassemia, and SMA is effective at identifying at-risk couples, and test results may impact preconception and reproductive decision-making.The cost-effectiveness and budget impact of carrier screening programs are uncertain for Ontario. Over the short term, carrier screening programs are associated with higher costs, and also higher chances of detecting at-risk pregnancies compared with no screening. The 5-year budget impact of publicly funding universal carrier screening programs is larger than that of risk-based programs. However, accounting for treatment costs of the screened health conditions results in a decrease in the total additional costs for universal carrier screening programs or in cost savings for risk-based programs.The people we spoke with who had sought out carrier screening valued the potential medical benefits of early detection and treatment, particularly the support and preparation for having a child with a potential genetic condition."

    "abstract": "Expansion of a CGG repeat in the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (<i>FMR1)</i> gene on the X chromosome is the cause of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). The repeat length of unaffected individuals varies between 5-40 repeats, whereas >200 repeats are observed in cases of FXS. The intermediate range between 55-200 repeats is considered the premutation range and is observed in roughly 1:300 females and 1:900 males in the general population. With the availability of large-scale whole genome sequence (WGS) data and the development of computational tools to detect repeat expansions, we systematically examined the role of <i>FMR1</i> premutation alleles in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) susceptibility, assess the prevalence, and consider the allelic stability between parents and offspring. We analyzed the WGS data of 22,053 subjects, including 32 FXS positive controls, 1359 population controls, and 5467 ASD families. We observed no <i>FMR1</i> full mutation range repeats among the ASD parent-offspring families but identified 180 family members with premutation range alleles, which represents a higher prevalence compared to the independent WGS control sample and previous reports in the literature. A sex-specific analysis between probands and unaffected siblings did not reveal a significant increase in the burden of premutation alleles in either males or females with ASD. PCR validation, however, suggests an overestimation of the frequency of <i>FMR1</i> premutation range alleles through computational analysis of WGS data. Overall, we show the utility of large-scale repeat expansion screening in WGS data and conclude that there is no apparent evidence of <i>FMR1</i> premutation alleles contributing to ASD susceptibility."

We conducted a meta-analysis and systematic literature review of 84 studies identified by searching PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science from 1977 to October 2022. This review focuses on the following issues: (1) specific neuroanatomic and histopathological features of DS as revealed by autopsy and modern neuroimaging modalities, (2) language and memory deficits in DS, (3) the relationships between these neuroanatomical and neuropsychological features, and (4) neuroanatomic and neuropsychological differences between DS and related neurodevelopmental syndromes. Numerous post-mortem and morphometric neuroimaging investigations of individuals with DS have reported complex changes in regional brain volumes, most notably in the hippocampal formation, temporal lobe, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and cerebellum. Moreover, neuropsychological assessments have revealed deficits in language development, emotional regulation, and memory that reflect these structural changes and are more severe than expected from general cognitive dysfunction. Individuals with DS also show relative preservation of multiple cognitive, linguistic, and social domains compared to normally developed controls and individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders. However, all these neurodevelopment disorders exhibit substantial heterogeneity among individuals. People with Down syndrome demonstrate unique neurodevelopmental abnormalities but cannot be regarded as a homogenous group. A comprehensive evaluation of individual intellectual skills is essential for all individuals with neurodevelopment disorders to develop personalized care programs."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder and the leading monogenic cause of autism and intellectual disability. For years, several efforts have been made to develop an effective therapeutic approach to phenotypically rescue patients from the disorder, with some even advancing to late phases of clinical trials. Unfortunately, none of these attempts have completely succeeded, bringing urgency to further expand and refocus research on FXS therapeutics. FXS arises at early stages of postnatal development due to the mutation and transcriptional silencing of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 gene (<i>FMR1</i>) and consequent loss of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) expression. Importantly, FMRP expression is critical for the normal adult nervous system function, particularly during specific windows of embryogenic and early postnatal development. Cellular proliferation, migration, morphology, axonal guidance, synapse formation, and in general, neuronal network establishment and maturation are abnormally regulated in FXS, underlying the cognitive and behavioral phenotypes of the disorder. In this review, we highlight the relevance of therapeutically intervening during critical time points of development, such as early postnatal periods in infants and young children and discuss past and current clinical trials in FXS and their potential to specifically target those periods. We also discuss potential benefits, limitations, and disadvantages of these pharmacological tools based on preclinical and clinical research."

Here, we compared the performance of seven different strategies in the analysis of a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome, involving the knockout of the <i>fmr1</i> gene that is the leading cause of autism spectrum disorder. Focusing on the cerebellum, we show that data-independent acquisition (DIA) and the tandem mass tag (TMT)-based real-time search method (RTS) generated the most informative profiles, generating 334 and 329 significantly altered proteins, respectively, although the latter still suffered from ratio compression. Label-free methods such as BoxCar and a conventional data-dependent acquisition were too noisy to generate a reliable profile, while TMT methods that do not invoke RTS showed a suppressed dynamic range. The TMT method using the TMTpro reagents together with complementary ion quantification (ProC) overcomes ratio compression, but current limitations in ion detection reduce sensitivity. Overall, both DIA and RTS uncovered known regulators of the syndrome and detected alterations in calcium signaling pathways that are consistent with calcium deregulation recently observed in imaging studies.

Data from 53 families were collected using forms that included sociodemographic and clinical information, as well as the Beach Center Family Quality of Life Scale, a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \"very dissatisfied\" (1) to \"very satisfied\" (5). The mean overall FQoL score was 3.56 ± 0.79; the emotional well-being domain had the lowest score (2.98 ± 1.11) and showed significant differences between the other domains: family interaction (3.81 ± 0.89; p < 0.001), parenting (3.66 ± 0.89; p < 0.001), physical and material well-being (3.48 ± 0.83; p < 0.001), and disability-related support (3.75 ± 0.98; p < 0.001). Physical and material well-being was the second-lowest domain and was statistically different from the family interaction domain (p = 0.013). Lower FQoL satisfaction ratings were found in families with children who had difficulty getting along with people of the same age (t(51) = -3.193, p = 0.002; d = 1.019) and difficulty in living together on a day-to-day basis (t(51) = -3.060, p = 0.004; d = 0.888). These results highlight the importance of proper emotional support for the family, emphasizing the need to provide assistance not only for individuals with FXS but also for other family members. Besides, we advocate for the adoption of public policies that provide financial assistance to families and the implementation of the Brazilian Policy of Comprehensive Care for People with Rare Diseases."

    "abstract": "Literature on the genotypic spectrum of Infantile Epileptic Spasms Syndrome (IESS) in children is scarce in developing countries. This multicentre collaboration evaluated the genotypic and phenotypic landscape of genetic IESS in Indian children. Between January 2021 and June 2022, this cross-sectional study was conducted at six centers in India. Children with genetically confirmed IESS, without definite structural-genetic and structural-metabolic etiology, were recruited and underwent detailed in-person assessment for phenotypic characterization. The multicentric data on the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of genetic IESS were collated and analyzed. Of 124 probands (60% boys, history of consanguinity in 15%) with genetic IESS, 105 had single gene disorders (104 nuclear and one mitochondrial), including one with concurrent triple repeat disorder (fragile X syndrome), and 19 had chromosomal disorders. Of 105 single gene disorders, 51 individual genes (92 variants including 25 novel) were identified. Nearly 85% of children with monogenic nuclear disorders had autosomal inheritance (dominant-55.2%, recessive-14.2%), while the rest had X-linked inheritance. Underlying chromosomal disorders included trisomy 21 (n = 14), Xq28 duplication (n = 2), and others (n = 3). Trisomy 21 (n = 14), ALDH7A1 (n = 10), SCN2A (n = 7), CDKL5 (n = 6), ALG13 (n = 5), KCNQ2 (n = 4), STXBP1 (n = 4), SCN1A (n = 4), NTRK2 (n = 4), and WWOX (n = 4) were the dominant single gene causes of genetic IESS. The median age at the onset of epileptic spasms (ES) and establishment of genetic diagnosis was 5 and 12 months, respectively. Pre-existing developmental delay (94.3%), early age at onset of ES (<6 months; 86.2%), central hypotonia (81.4%), facial dysmorphism (70.1%), microcephaly (77.4%), movement disorders (45.9%) and autistic features (42.7%) were remarkable clinical findings. Seizures other than epileptic spasms were observed in 83 children (66.9%). Pre-existing epilepsy syndrome was identified in 21 (16.9%). Nearly 60% had an initial response to hormonal therapy. Our study highlights a heterogenous genetic landscape and phenotypic pleiotropy in children with genetic IESS."

On the other hand, mitochondria are themselves regulated from a series of signaling proteins to achieve the best efficiency in producing energy, in establishing a network and in performing their own de novo synthesis or clearance. Dysfunctions in signaling processes that control mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and bioenergetics are increasingly associated with impairment in brain development and involved in a wide variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we review recent evidence proving the emerging role of mitochondria as master regulators of brain bioenergetics, highlighting their control skills in brain neurodevelopment and cognition. We analyze, from a mechanistic point of view, mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction as causally interrelated to the origins of typical genetic intellectual disability-related neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Down, Rett and Fragile X syndromes. Finally, we discuss whether mitochondria can become therapeutic targets to improve brain development and function from a holistic perspective."

    "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare disability causing female-oriented pediatric neurodevelopmental unmet medical need. RTT was recognized in 1966. However, over the past 56 years, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has authorized no effective treatment for RTT. Recently, Trofinetide was approved by the USFDA on 10 March 2023 as the first RTT treatment. This article underlines the pharmaceutical advancement, patent literature, and prospects of Trofinetide. The data for this study were gathered from the PubMed database, authentic websites (Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Neuren Pharmaceuticals, and USFDA), and free patent databases. Trofinetide was first disclosed by Neuren Pharmaceuticals in 2000 as a methyl group containing analog of the naturally occurring neuroprotective tripeptide called glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE). The joint efforts of Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Neuren Pharmaceuticals have developed Trofinetide. The mechanism of action of Trofinetide is not yet well established. However, it is supposed to improve neuronal morphology and synaptic functioning. The patent literature revealed a handful of inventions related to Trofinetide, providing excellent and unexplored broad research possibilities with Trofinetide. The development of innovative Trofinetide-based molecules, combinations of Trofinetide, patient-compliant drug formulations, and precise MECP2-mutation-related personalized medicines are foreseeable. Trofinetide is in clinical trials for some neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including treating Fragile X syndrome (FXS). It is expected that Trofinetide may be approved for treating FXS in the future. The USFDA-approval of Trofinetide is one of the important milestones for RTT therapy and is the beginning of a new era for the therapy of RTT, FXS, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), brain injury, stroke, and other NDDs."

    "abstract": "Phytocannabinoids, including the non-addictive cannabis component cannabidivarin (CBDV), have been reported to hold therapeutic potential in several neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Nonetheless, the therapeutic value of phytocannabinoids for treating Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a major NDD, remains unexplored. Here, we characterized the neurobehavioral effects of CBDV at doses of 20 or 100 mg/kg in the <i>Fmr1</i>-knockout (<i>Fmr1</i>-KO) mouse model of FXS using two temporally different intraperitoneal regimens: subchronic 10-day delivery during adulthood (Study 1: rescue treatment) or chronic 5-week delivery at adolescence (Study 2: preventive treatment). Behavioral tests assessing FXS-like abnormalities included anxiety, locomotor, cognitive, social and sensory alterations. Expression of inflammatory and plasticity markers was investigated in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. When administered during adulthood (Study 1), the effects of CBDV were marginal, rescuing at the lower dose only the acoustic hyper-responsiveness of <i>Fmr1</i>-KO mice and at both doses their altered hippocampal expression of neurotrophins. When administered during adolescence (Study 2), CBDV at both doses prevented the cognitive, social and acoustic alterations of adult <i>Fmr1</i>-KO mice and modified the expression of several inflammatory brain markers in both wild-type littermates and mutants. These findings warrant the therapeutic potential of CBDV for preventing neurobehavioral alterations associated with FXS, highlighting the relevance of its early administration."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and fetal alcohol syndrome disorders are both common causes of intellectual disability in children. When both conditions are present in the same individual, the resultant phenotype may make identification of clinical issues and management challenging. In this case report, we present a case of triplets who had significant in utero alcohol exposure; 2 of whom also have FXS and the other not having the fragile X mutation. The siblings with FXS have subtle differences in the physical phenotype compared with the other one, who has prominent features of partial fetal alcohol syndrome instead. However, all 3 siblings have intellectual impairment (although this is more severe in the 2 with FXS), meet diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder, and present with severe behavioral challenges. The clinical presentation of the 2 siblings with FXS is much more severe as compared to a child with FXS alone, and this is likely due to the additive effect of in utero alcohol exposure and environmental factors. We discuss the combination of these 2 pathologies and how this can affect the overall clinical presentation. In the management of children with FXS, evaluation for other risk factors that can have neurobehavioral sequelae is important, and these can affect clinical presentation and prognosis."

    "abstract": "Autistic traits are associated with mental health difficulties and risk of suicidal risk behaviors among adolescents. Little is known about how autistic traits affect the mental health of adolescents with rare neurodevelopmental disorders (RNDs). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between autistic traits, mental health difficulties, and suicidal risk behaviors in adolescents with RNDs. Parents (N = 93) completed the Child Behavior Checklist, Social Communication Questionnaire, and Social Responsiveness Scale about their adolescent (Mage = 13.1, SD = 2.3, 62.4% females) with an RND (e.g., sex chromosome aneuploidies, Fragile X syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome). The data were analyzed with hierarchical logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of suicidal risk behaviors (16.1%) was similar to that reported among autistic youth and was higher among boys than girls. More autistic traits were associated with suicidal risk behaviors in bivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, more anxiety/depressive symptoms were associated with more suicidal risk behaviors and externalizing problems associated with suicidal risk behaviors beyond autistic traits and anxiety/depressive symptoms. Adolescents with RNDs are at risk of suicidal risk behaviors, especially those with higher levels of autistic traits, anxiety/depressive symptoms, and externalizing problems. Assessment of autistic traits, mental health difficulties, and suicide risk may be indicated for adolescents with RNDs to determine if corresponding intervention is needed."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a hereditary form of autism spectrum disorder. It is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the Fmr1 gene, leading to a loss of Fragile X Protein (FMRP) expression. The loss of FMRP causes auditory hypersensitivity: FXS patients display hyperacusis and the Fmr1- knock-out (KO) mouse model for FXS exhibits auditory seizures. FMRP is strongly expressed in the cochlear nucleus and other auditory brainstem nuclei. We hypothesize that the Fmr1-KO mouse has altered gene expression in the cochlear nucleus that may contribute to auditory hypersensitivity. RNA was isolated from cochlear nuclei of Fmr1-KO and WT mice. Using next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq), the transcriptomes of Fmr1-KO mice and WT mice (n = 3 each) were compared and analyzed using gene ontology programs. We identified 270 unique, differentially expressed genes between Fmr1-KO and WT cochlear nuclei. Upregulated genes (67%) are enriched in those encoding secreted molecules. Downregulated genes (33%) are enriched in neuronal function, including synaptic pathways, some of which are ideal candidate genes that may contribute to hyperacusis. The loss of FMRP can affect the expression of genes in the cochlear nucleus that are important for neuronal signaling. One of these, Kcnab2, which encodes a subunit of the Shaker voltage-gated potassium channel, is expressed at an abnormally low level in the Fmr1-KO cochlear nucleus. Kcnab2 and other differentially expressed genes may represent pathways for the development of hyperacusis. Future studies will be aimed at investigating the effects of these altered genes on hyperacusis. N/A Laryngoscope, 134:1363-1371, 2024."

    "abstract": "<i>Cyfip1</i>, the gene encoding cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 1, has been of interest as an autism candidate gene for years. A potential role in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is suggested by its location on human chromosome 15q11-13, an instable region that gives rise to a variety of copy number variations associated with syndromic autism. In addition, the CYFIP1 protein acts as a binding partner to Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) in the regulation of translation initiation. Mutation of <i>FMR1</i>, the gene encoding FMRP, causes Fragile X syndrome, another form of syndromic autism. Here, in mice overexpressing CYFIP1, we study response properties of cerebellar Purkinje cells to activity of the climbing fiber input that originates from the inferior olive and provides an instructive signal in sensorimotor input analysis and plasticity. We find that CYFIP1 overexpression results in enhanced localization of the synaptic organizer neurexin 1 (NRXN1) at climbing fiber synaptic input sites on Purkinje cell primary dendrites and concomitant enhanced climbing fiber synaptic transmission (CF-EPSCs) measured using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from Purkinje cells <i>in vitro</i>. Moreover, using two-photon measurements of GCaMP6f-encoded climbing fiber signals in Purkinje cells of intact mice, we observe enhanced responses to air puff stimuli applied to the whisker field. These findings resemble our previous phenotypic observations in a mouse model for the human 15q11-13 duplication, which does not extend to the <i>Cyfip1</i> locus. Thus, our study demonstrates that CYFIP1 overexpression shares a limited set of olivo-cerebellar phenotypes as those resulting from an increased number of copies of non-overlapping genes located on chromosome 15q11-13."

Pragmatic language is universally impacted in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and pragmatic deficits are also common in other neurodevelopmental conditions, particularly those related to ASD, such as fragile X syndrome (FXS). This study used a multi-method, longitudinal approach to characterize potentially unique pragmatic profiles across different neurodevelopmental disabilities, and across contexts that varied in degree of social demand. The utility of computational linguistic analyses, as an efficient tool for capturing pragmatic abilities, was also explored. Pragmatic skills of boys with idiopathic ASD (ASD-O, <i>n</i> = 43), FXS with and without ASD (FXS-ASD, <i>n</i> = 57; FXS-O, <i>n</i> = 14), Down syndrome (DS, <i>n</i> = 22), and typical development (TD, <i>n</i> = 24) were compared using variables obtained from a standardized measure, narrative, and semi-naturalistic conversation at up to three time points. Pragmatic language was most significantly impacted among males with ASD-O and FXS-ASD across all three contexts, with more difficulties in the least structured context (conversation), and also some differences based on FXS comorbidity. Patterns of group differences were more nuanced for boys with FXS-O and DS, with context having less of an impact. Clinical groups demonstrated minimal changes in pragmatic skills with age, with some exceptions. Computational language measurement tools showed some utility for measuring pragmatic skills, but were not as successful as traditional methods at capturing differences between clinical groups. Overlap and differences between ASD and other forms of neurodevelopmental disability in general, and between idiopathic and syndromic ASD in particular, have important implications for developing precisely tailored assessment and intervention approaches, consistent with a personalized medicine approach to clinical study and care in ASD."

People affected with mutations in FMR1 have higher incidence of obesity, but the mechanisms are largely unknown. In the current study, we determined that male Fmr1 knockout mice (KO, Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup>), but not female Fmr1<sup>-/-</sup>, exhibit increased weight when compared to wild-type controls, similarly to humans with FMR1 mutations. No differences in food or water intake were found between groups; however, male Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> display lower locomotor activity, especially during their active phase. Moreover, Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> have olfactory dysfunction determined by buried food test, although they exhibit increased compulsive behavior, determined by marble burying test. Since olfactory brain regions communicate with hypothalamic regions that regulate food intake, including POMC neurons that also regulate locomotion, we examined POMC neuron innervation and numbers in Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> mice. POMC neurons express Fmrp, and POMC neurons in Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> have higher inhibitory GABAergic synaptic inputs. Consistent with increased inhibitory innervation, POMC neurons in the Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> mice exhibit lower activity, based on cFOS expression. Notably, Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> mice have fewer POMC neurons than controls, specifically in the rostral arcuate nucleus, which could contribute to decreased locomotion and increased body weight. These results suggest a role for Fmr1 in the regulation of POMC neuron function and the etiology of Fmr1-linked obesity."

Frontal facial photograph from 156 participants (14 patients with FXS and 142 controls) predominantly young-adults to adults, median age 18.9 age range 4-39yo, were uploaded. Automated face analysis was conducted by using the technology used in proprietary software tools called Face2Gene CLINIC and Face2Gene RESEARCH (version 17.6.2). To estimate the statistical power of the Face2Gene technology in distinguishing affected individuals from controls, a cross validation scheme was used. The similarity seen in the upper facial region (of males and females) is greater than the similarity seen in other parts of the face. Binary comparison of subjects with FXS versus non-FXS and subjects with FXS versus subjects with Down syndrome reveal an area under the curve values of 0.955 (p = 0.002) and 0.986 (p = 0.003).

Despite their extensive impact, statistics show that AIDs is associated with a higher risk of ND. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are critical in several illnesses and disorders, especially AID and ND. Therefore, the present study focused on understanding the underlying causes of the pathophysiology of diseases such as AID and ND through <i>in silico</i>-based research. In order to determine how circRNAs are related to various disease pathways, this study examined the gene expression data sets for Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and atrial fibrillation (AF). Our study identified and analyzed two circRNAs, their respective host genes (DHTKD1 and RAN) and their related miRNAs, which could serve as potential markers for treating disorders like myotonic dystrophy type 1, spinocerebellar ataxia and fragile X syndrome. Further, the circRNA-derived peptide was identified and analysed with the molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) followed by a principal component (PC) based free energy landscape (FEL) profile. The computational results obtained here provide a basis for the development of therapeutics against AD, RA and AF. Moreover, further functional studies are needed to validate their role in disease aetiology and to provide a detailed understanding of their association with AID and ND.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) encompass a wide array of debilitating symptoms, including sensory dysfunction and delayed language development. Auditory temporal processing is crucial for speech perception and language development. Abnormal development of temporal processing may account for the language impairments associated with ASD. Very little is known about the development of temporal processing in any animal model of ASD. In the current study, we quantify auditory temporal processing throughout development in the Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), a leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and ASD-associated behaviors. Using epidural electrodes in awake and freely moving wildtype (WT) and KO mice, we recorded auditory event related potentials (ERP) and auditory temporal processing with a gap-in-noise auditory steady state response (gap-ASSR) paradigm. Mice were recorded at three different ages in a cross sectional design: postnatal (p)21, p30 and p60. Recordings were obtained from both auditory and frontal cortices. The gap-ASSR requires underlying neural generators to synchronize responses to gaps of different widths embedded in noise, providing an objective measure of temporal processing across genotypes and age groups. We present evidence that the frontal, but not auditory, cortex shows significant temporal processing deficits at p21 and p30, with poor ability to phase lock to rapid gaps in noise. Temporal processing was similar in both genotypes in adult mice. ERP amplitudes were larger in Fmr1 KO mice in both auditory and frontal cortex, consistent with ERP data in humans with FXS. These data indicate cortical region-specific delays in temporal processing development in Fmr1 KO mice. Developmental delays in the ability of frontal cortex to follow rapid changes in sounds may shape language delays in FXS, and more broadly in ASD."

Here we show dysregulated cholesterol homeostasis in astrocytes generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from males with fragile X syndrome (FXS), which is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability. ABCA1 levels are reduced in FXS human and mouse astrocytes when compared with controls. Accumulation of cholesterol associates with increased desmosterol and polyunsaturated phospholipids in the lipidome of FXS mouse astrocytes. Abnormal astrocytic responses to cytokine exposure together with altered anti-inflammatory and cytokine profiles of human FXS astrocyte secretome suggest contribution of inflammatory factors to altered cholesterol homeostasis. Our results demonstrate changes of astrocytic lipid metabolism, which can critically regulate membrane properties and affect cholesterol transport in FXS astrocytes, providing target for therapy in FXS."

A hallmark of FXS in patients and the FXS mouse model (Fmr1 KO) is an overabundance of immature appearing dendritic spines in the cortex and hippocampus which is associated with behavioral deficits. Spine analysis in the different hippocampal subregions and at different developmental stages revealed that in adult mice, hippocampal spine pathology occurs specifically in the CA3 subregion, which plays a pivotal role in pattern completion processes important for efficient memory recall from parts of the initial memory stimulus. In line with this synaptic defect we document an impairment in memory recall during partially cued reference memory test in the Morris water maze task. This is accompanied by impaired recruitment of engram cells as well as impaired spine structural plasticity in the CA3 region. In order to promote hippocampal network development adolescent mice were either raised in an enriched environment or subjected to specific hippocampus-dependent spatial training. Intriguingly, only specific spatial training alleviated the cognitive symptoms and the spine phenotype shown in adult Fmr1 KO mice suggesting that specific stimulation of hippocampal networks during development might be used in the future as a therapeutic strategy."

The mechanisms underlying hyperacusis in FXS are still largely unknown and effective therapies are lacking. Big conductance calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channels were proposed as a therapeutic target to treat several behavioral disturbances in FXS preclinical models, but their role in mediating their auditory alterations was not specifically addressed. Furthermore, studies on the acoustic phenotypes of FXS animal models mostly focused on central rather than peripheral auditory pathways. Here, we provided an extensive characterization of the peripheral auditory phenotype of the <i>Fmr1</i>-knockout (KO) mouse model of FXS at adulthood. We also assessed whether the acute administration of Chlorzoxazone, a BKCa agonist, could rescue the auditory abnormalities of adult mutant mice. <i>Fmr1</i>-KO mice both at 3 and 6 months showed a hyperacusis-like startle phenotype with paradoxically reduced auditory brainstem responses associated with a loss of ribbon synapses in the inner hair cells (IHCs) compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates.

Female heterozygous (HET) carriers play a major role in the transmission of the pathology and present several FXS- and ASD-like behavioral alterations. Despite their clear genetic origins, FXS symptoms are known to be modulated by environmental factors, e.g., exposure to chronic stress, especially during critical life periods, such as pregnancy. Pregnancy, together with pups' care, constitutes maternal experience, i.e., another powerful environmental factor affecting several neurobehavioral functions in females. Here we investigated the impact of maternal experience on the long-term effects of stress in <i>Fmr1</i>-HET female mice. Our findings demonstrated that the behavioral abnormalities of HET females, i.e., hyperactivity and memory deficits, were unaffected by stress or maternal experience. In contrast, stress, independently of maternal experience, induced the appearance of cognitive deficits in WT mice. Maternal experience increased anxiety levels in all mice and enhanced their corticosterone levels, concomitantly promoting the effects of stress on social communication and adrenal glands. In translational terms, these results advance our understanding of the environmental modulation of the behavioral alterations observed in FXS female carriers and highlight the long-term impact of maternal experience and its interactions with chronic stress."

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was observed in 4/17 FXTAS cases, among which one was confirmed by histologic staining. Compared with seven control brains, FXTAS cases showed higher ratings of T2-hyperintensities (indicating cerebral small vessel disease) in the cerebellum, globus pallidus and frontoparietal white matter, and significant atrophy in the cerebellar white matter, red nucleus and dentate nucleus. PCA of FXTAS cases revealed negative associations of T2-hyperintensity ratings with anatomic volumes and iron content in the white matter, hippocampus and amygdala, that were independent from a highly correlated number of regions with ICH and iron content in subcortical nuclei. Post-hoc analysis confirmed PCA findings and further revealed increased iron content in the white matter, hippocampus and amygdala in FXTAS cases compared to controls, after adjusting for T2-hyperintensity ratings.

Cell-type-specific translational profiling of the FXS mouse striatum reveals differentially translated mRNAs, providing critical information concerning potential therapeutic targets.

Sleep loss itself negatively impacts cognitive function, yet the contribution of sleep loss to impaired cognition in FXS is vastly understudied. One untested possibility is that disrupted cognition in FXS is exacerbated by abnormal sleep. We hypothesized that restoration of sleep-dependent mechanisms could improve functions such as memory consolidation in FXS. We examined whether administration of ML297, a hypnotic drug acting on G-protein-activated inward-rectifying potassium channels, could restore sleep phenotypes and improve disrupted memory consolidation in <i>Fmr1 <sup>-/y</sup></i> mice. Using 24-h polysomnographic recordings, we found that <i>Fmr1 <sup>-/y</sup></i> mice exhibit reduced non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and fragmented NREM sleep architecture, alterations in NREM EEG spectral power (including reductions in sleep spindles), and reduced EEG coherence between cortical areas. These alterations were reversed in the hours following ML297 administration. Hypnotic treatment following contextual fear or spatial learning also ameliorated disrupted memory consolidation in <i>Fmr1 <sup>-/y</sup></i> mice. Hippocampal activation patterns during memory recall was altered in <i>Fmr1 <sup>-/y</sup></i> mice, reflecting an altered balance of activity among principal neurons vs. parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons. This phenotype was partially reversed by post-learning ML297 administration. These studies suggest that sleep disruption could have a major impact on neurophysiological and behavioral phenotypes in FXS, and that hypnotic therapy may significantly improve disrupted cognition in this disorder."

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, but new therapies have been impeded by a lack of understanding of the pathological mechanisms. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and fragile X syndrome are associated with alterations in the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP), which have been implicated in the development of ASD. Previously, we observed that transcripts associated with FMRP were down-regulated in TSC2-deficient neurons. In this study, we find that FMRP turnover is dysregulated in TSC2-deficient rodent primary neurons and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and is dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex. We also demonstrate that overexpression of FMRP can partially rescue hyperexcitability in TSC2-deficient iPSC-derived neurons. These data indicate that FMRP dysregulation represents an important pathological mechanism in the development of abnormal neuronal activity in TSC and illustrate a molecular convergence between these two neurogenetic disorders."

Here, we demonstrate that the main arm of the ISR, eIF2α phosphorylation (p-eIF2α), is suppressed in excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurons in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS; Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup>). We further show that the decrease in p-eIF2α is mediated via activation of mTORC1. Genetic reduction of p-eIF2α only in excitatory neurons is sufficient to increase general protein synthesis and cause autism-like behavior. In Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> mice, restoration of p-eIF2α solely in excitatory neurons reverses elevated protein synthesis and rescues autism-related phenotypes. Thus, we reveal a previously unknown causal relationship between excitatory neuron-specific translational control via the ISR pathway, general protein synthesis, and core phenotypes reminiscent of autism in a mouse model of FXS."

    "abstract": "Despite significant advances in understanding and treating social anxiety in the general population, progress in this area lags behind for individuals with intellectual disability. Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and is associated with an elevated prevalence rate of social anxiety. The phenotype of fragile X syndrome encompasses multiple clinically significant characteristics that are posed as risk markers for social anxiety in other populations. Here, evidence is reviewed that points to physiological hyperarousal, sensory sensitivity, emotion dysregulation, cognitive inflexibility, and intolerance of uncertainty as primary candidates for underlying mechanisms of heightened social anxiety in fragile X syndrome. A multilevel model is presented that provides a framework for future research to test associations."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common inherited cause of intellectual disabilities and single-gene cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), resulting from the loss of functional fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein (RBP) encoded by the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) methylation can lead to developmental diseases, including FXS, through various mechanisms mediated by 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine, N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine, etc. Emerging evidence suggests that modifications of some RNA species have been linked to FXS. However, the underlying pathological mechanism has yet to be elucidated. In this review, we reviewed the implication of RNA modification in FXS and summarized its specific characteristics for facilitating the identification of new therapeutic targets."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited human mental retardation that arises from expansion of a CGG repeat in the Fmr1 gene, causing loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). It is reported that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated facilitation of long-term potentiation (LTP) and fear memory are impaired in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice. In this study, biological, pharmacological, and electrophysiological techniques were performed to determine the roles of D-aspartate (D-Asp), a modulator of NMDAR, and its metabolizing enzyme D-aspartate oxidase (DDO) in Fmr1 KO mice. Levels of D-Asp were decreased in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC ); however, the levels of its metabolizing enzyme DDO were increased. Electrophysiological recordings indicated that oral drinking of D-Asp recovered LTP induction in mPFC from Fmr1 KO mice. Moreover, chronic oral administration of D-Asp reversed behavioral deficits of cognition and locomotor coordination in Fmr1 KO mice. The therapeutic action of D-Asp was partially through regulating functions of NMDARs and mGluR5/mTOR/4E-BP signaling pathways. In conclusion, supplement of D-Asp may benefit for synaptic plasticity and behaviors in Fmr1 KO mice and offer a potential therapeutic strategy for FXS."

Using all-optical in vivo approaches, we find that parvalbumin (PV) INs and their immature precursors are hypoactive and transiently decoupled from excitatory neurons in postnatal mouse somatosensory cortex (S1) of Fmr1 KO mice, a model of fragile X syndrome (FXS). This leads to a loss of parvalbumin INs (PV-INs) in both mice and humans with FXS. Increasing the activity of future PV-INs in neonatal Fmr1 KO mice restores PV-IN density and ameliorates transcriptional dysregulation in S1, but not circuit dysfunction. Critically, administering an allosteric modulator of Kv3.1 channels after the S1 critical period does rescue circuit dynamics and tactile defensiveness. Symptoms in FXS and related disorders could be mitigated by targeting PV-INs."

Blood was analyzed from 95 controls and 462 individuals (32% males) with FM and PM alleles. Brain tissues (62% males) were analyzed from 12 controls and 4 with FXS. There was a significant increase in intron 1 methylation, extending to a newly defined 3' epigenetic boundary in the FM compared with that in the control and PM groups (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), and this was consistent between the blood and brain tissues. A distinct intron 2 site showed a significant decrease in methylation for the FXS groups compared with the controls in both sexes (<i>p</i> < 0.01). In all female groups, most intron 1 (but not intron 2 sites) were sensitive to X inactivation. In all PM groups, methylation at the 3' epigenetic boundary and the proximal sites was significantly decreased compared with that in the control and FM groups (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). In conclusion, abnormal <i>FMR1</i> intron 1 and 2 methylation that was sensitive to X inactivation in the blood and brain tissues provided a novel avenue for the detection of PM and FM alleles through DNA methylation analysis."

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional gene regulation is a fundamental mechanism that helps regulate the development and healthy aging of the nervous system. Mutations that disrupt the function of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which regulate post-transcriptional gene regulation, have increasingly been implicated in neurological disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Fragile X Syndrome, and spinal muscular atrophy. Interestingly, although the majority of RBPs are expressed widely within diverse tissue types, the nervous system is often particularly sensitive to their dysfunction. It is therefore critical to elucidate how aberrant RNA regulation that results from the dysfunction of ubiquitously expressed RBPs leads to tissue specific pathologies that underlie neurological diseases. The highly conserved RBP and alternative splicing factor Caper is widely expressed throughout development and is required for the development of <i>Drosophila</i> sensory and motor neurons. Furthermore, <i>caper</i> dysfunction results in larval and adult locomotor deficits. Nonetheless, little is known about which proteins interact with Caper, and which RNAs are regulated by Caper. Here we identify proteins that interact with Caper in both neural and muscle tissue, along with neural specific Caper target RNAs. Furthermore, we show that a subset of these Caper-interacting proteins and RNAs genetically interact with <i>caper</i> to regulate <i>Drosophila</i> gravitaxis behavior."

Here, we propose to use conservative mutations that enhance the affinity of RNA-binding domains to overcome this limitation. As a proof of principle, we have designed and validated an affinity-enhanced K-homology (KH) domain mutant of the fragile X syndrome protein FMRP, a key regulator of neuronal development, and used this mutant to determine the domain's sequence preference and to explain FMRP recognition of specific RNA motifs in the cell. Our results validate our concept and our nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based workflow. While effective mutant design requires an understanding of the underlying principles of RNA recognition by the relevant domain type, we expect the method will be used effectively in many RNA-binding domains."

    "abstract": "This review discusses the discovery, epidemiology, pathophysiology, genetic etiology, molecular diagnosis, and medication-based management of fragile X syndrome (FXS). It also highlights the syndrome's variable expressivity and common comorbid and overlapping conditions. FXS is an X-linked dominant disorder associated with a wide spectrum of clinical features, including but not limited to intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, language deficits, macroorchidism, seizures, and anxiety. Its prevalence in the general population is approximately 1 in 5000-7000 men and 1 in 4000-6000 women worldwide. FXS is associated with the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene located at locus Xq27.3 and encodes the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). Most individuals with FXS have an FMR1 allele with > 200 CGG repeats (full mutation) and hypermethylation of the CpG island proximal to the repeats, which silences the gene's promoter. Some individuals have mosaicism in the size of the CGG repeats or in hypermethylation of the CpG island, both produce some FMRP and give rise to milder cognitive and behavioral deficits than in non-mosaic individuals with FXS. As in several monogenic disorders, modifier genes influence the penetrance of FMR1 mutations and FXS's variable expressivity by regulating the pathophysiological mechanisms related to the syndrome's behavioral features. Although there is no cure for FXS, prenatal molecular diagnostic testing is recommended to facilitate early diagnosis. Pharmacologic agents can reduce some behavioral features of FXS, and researchers are investigating whether gene editing can be used to demethylate the FMR1 promoter region to improve patient outcomes. Moreover, clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 and developed nuclease defective Cas9 (dCas9) strategies have promised options of genome editing in gain-of-function mutations to rewrite new genetic information into a specified DNA site, are also being studied."

Specifically, increased progranulin expression in the prefrontal cortex has been suggested to be pathologically relevant in male <i>Fmr1</i> knockout (<i>Fmr1</i> KO) mice, a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Further investigation into the role of progranulin in FXS is warranted to determine if therapies that reduce progranulin expression represent a viable strategy for treating patients with FXS. Several key knowledge gaps remain. The mechanism of increased progranulin expression in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice is poorly understood and the extent of progranulin's involvement in FXS-like phenotypes in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice has been incompletely explored. To this end, we have performed a thorough characterization of progranulin expression in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. We find that the phenomenon of increased progranulin expression is post-translational and tissue-specific. We also demonstrate for the first time an association between progranulin mRNA and FMRP, suggesting that progranulin mRNA is an FMRP target. Subsequently, we show that progranulin over-expression in <i>Fmr1</i> wild-type mice causes reduced repetitive behaviour engagement in females and mild hyperactivity in males but is largely insufficient to recapitulate FXS-associated behavioural, morphological, and electrophysiological abnormalities. Lastly, we determine that genetic reduction of progranulin expression on an <i>Fmr1</i> KO background reduces macroorchidism but does not alter other FXS-associated behaviours or biochemical phenotypes."

We and others have demonstrated that Fmr1 mutant mice present an altered response to immune stimuli. However, whether this altered immune response can influence the Fmr1 mutant behavioral outcomes in response to inflammation has not been fully investigated. In the current study, we examine the behavioral sickness response of male wildtype and knockout mice to the innate immune stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.1 mg/kg) to determine if Fmr1 mutants have altered sickness behavior. We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure changes in the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) to determine that inflammation was induced in the mice. Sickness behavior was assessed in a wheel-running paradigm, and a tail suspension test was used to assess the depressive-like phenotype that follows sickness behavior in response to LPS. The ELISA using blood serum confirmed a significant increase in IL-6 in mice that were treated with LPS. Treated Fmr1 mutants exhibited decreased distance traveled in the wheel running after LPS administration, similar to treated controls. Another cohort of animals treated with LPS were tested in the tail suspension test and exhibited no alterations in immobility time in response to LPS. Together, our data suggest that Fmr1 mutant mice do not have altered sickness behavior in response to a low dose of LPS."

Surprisingly, there are no studies examining the canonical signal transduction pathway activated by mGlu5 receptors (i.e. polyphosphoinositide - PI - hydrolysis) in mouse models of autism. We have developed a method for in vivo assessment of PI hydrolysis based on systemic injection of lithium chloride followed by treatment with the selective mGlu5 receptor PAM, VU0360172, and measurement of endogenous inositolmonophosphate (InsP) in brain tissue. Here, we report that mGlu5 receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis was blunted in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and corpus striatum of Ube3a<sup>m-/p+</sup> mice modeling Angelman syndrome (AS), and in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of Fmr1 knockout mice modeling FXS. In vivo mGlu5 receptor-mediated stimulation of Akt on threonine 308 was also blunted in the hippocampus of FXS mice. These changes were associated with a significant increase in cortical and striatal Homer1 levels and striatal mGlu5 receptor and Gαq levels in AS mice, and with a reduction in cortical mGlu5 receptor and hippocampal Gαq levels, and an increase in cortical phospholipase-Cβ and hippocampal Homer1 levels in FXS mice. This is the first evidence that the canonical transduction pathway activated by mGlu5 receptors is down-regulated in brain regions of mice modeling monogenic autism."

Molecular and clinical evidence indicated that Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP) plays a role in different types of cancer, including breast cancer. FMRP is an RNA binding protein that regulates the metabolism of a large group of mRNAs coding for proteins involved in both neural processes and in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a pivotal mechanism that in cancer is associated to tumor progression, aggressiveness and chemoresistance. Here, we carried out a retrospective case-control study of 127 patients, to study the expression of FMRP and its correlation with metastasis formation in breast cancer. Consistent with previous findings, we found that FMRP levels are high in tumor tissue. Two categories have been analyzed, tumor with no metastases (referred as control tumors, 84 patients) and tumor with distant metastatic repetition, (referred as cases, 43 patients), with a follow-up of 7 years (mean). We found that FMRP levels were lower in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm in the cases compared to control tumors. Next, within the category cases (tumor with metastases) we evaluated FMRP expression in the specific sites of metastasis revealing a nuclear staining of FMRP. In addition, FMRP expression in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartment was significantly lower in patients who developed brain and bone metastases and higher in hepatic and pulmonary sites. While further studies are required to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of FMRP expression and direct or inverse correlation with the secondary metastatic site, our findings suggest that FMRP levels might be considered a prognostic factor for site-specific metastasis."

Targeted MAP1B gene activation in healthy human neurons or MAP1B gene triplication in ASD patient-derived neurons inhibit morphological and physiological maturation. Activation of Map1b in adult male mouse prefrontal cortex excitatory neurons impairs social behaviors. We show that elevated MAP1B sequesters components of autophagy and reduces autophagosome formation. Both MAP1B knockdown and autophagy activation rescue deficits of both ASD and FXS patients' neurons and FMRP-deficient neurons in ex vivo human brain tissue. Our study demonstrates conserved FMRP regulation of MAP1B in primate neurons and establishes a causal link between MAP1B elevation and deficits of FXS and ASD."

Surprisingly, the <i>FMR1 (Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1)</i> gene is transcribed in >70% of the FXS tissues. In all <i>FMR1</i>-expressing FXS tissues, <i>FMR1</i> RNA itself is mis-spliced in a CGG expansion-dependent manner to generate the little-known <i>FMR1</i>-217 RNA isoform, which is comprised of <i>FMR1</i> exon 1 and a pseudo-exon in intron 1. <i>FMR1</i>-217 is also expressed in FXS premutation carrier-derived skin fibroblasts and brain tissues. We show that in cells aberrantly expressing mis-spliced <i>FMR1</i>, antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment reduces <i>FMR1</i>-217, rescues full-length <i>FMR1</i> RNA, and restores FMRP (Fragile X Messenger RibonucleoProtein) to normal levels. Notably, <i>FMR1</i> gene reactivation in transcriptionally silent FXS cells using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzadC), which prevents DNA methylation, increases <i>FMR1</i>-217 RNA levels but not FMRP. ASO treatment of cells prior to 5-AzadC application rescues full-length <i>FMR1</i> expression and restores FMRP. These findings indicate that misregulated RNA-processing events in blood could serve as potent biomarkers for FXS and that in those individuals expressing <i>FMR1-217</i>, ASO treatment may offer a therapeutic approach to mitigate the disorder."

As FXS enters the mainstream of well-understood genetic disorders and technological advancements improve genetic tests, it should be clearer to clinical providers what a full FXS assessment could include to provide high quality information for care. For individuals with FXS who are high functioning, their families and clinical professionals would benefit from knowing more genetic findings, including, most importantly, methylation status, but also the FMR1 protein (FMRP) level and mRNA level.

Expanded CGG repeat RNAs form stable secondary structures, which in turn support repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation to produce toxic peptides. The parameters that impact RAN translation initiation efficiency are not well understood. Here we used a Drosophila melanogaster model of FXTAS to evaluate the role of the eIF4G family of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (EIF4G1, EIF4GII and EIF4G2/DAP5) in modulating RAN translation and CGG repeat-associated toxicity. DAP5 knockdown robustly suppressed CGG repeat-associated toxicity and inhibited RAN translation. Furthermore, knockdown of initiation factors that preferentially associate with DAP5 (such as EIF2β, EIF3F and EIF3G) also selectively suppressed CGG repeat-induced eye degeneration. In mammalian cellular reporter assays, DAP5 knockdown exhibited modest and cell-type specific effects on RAN translation. Taken together, these data support a role for DAP5 in CGG repeat associated toxicity possibly through modulation of RAN translation."

Participants included 35 women with the FMR1 premutation and 45 age-matched women without the FMR1 premutation who served as a comparison group. Three sustained /a/ vowels were analyzed for pitch (mean F0), variability of pitch (standard deviation of F0), and overall vocal quality (jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio).

Vocal quality abnormalities differentiated women with the FMR1 premutation from the comparison group and were evident even in the absence of other clinically evident motor deficits.

This structure is pivotal in social behavior control, consisting mainly of spiny projection neurons (SPNs), distinguished by dopamine D1 or D2 receptor expression, connectivity, and associated behavioral functions. This study aims to examine how FMRP absence differentially affects SPN cellular properties, which is crucial for categorizing FXS cellular endophenotypes. We utilized a novel <i>Fmr1-/y</i>::<i>Drd1a-tdTomato</i> mouse model, which allows <i>in-situ</i> identification of SPN subtypes in FXS mice. Using RNA-sequencing, RNAScope and <i>ex-vivo</i> patch-clamp in adult male mice NAc, we comprehensively compared the intrinsic passive and active properties of SPN subtypes. <i>Fmr1</i> transcripts and their gene product, FMRP, were found in both SPNs subtypes, indicating potential cell-specific functions for <i>Fmr1</i>. The study found that the distinguishing membrane properties and action potential kinetics typically separating D1- from D2-SPNs in wild-type mice were either reversed or abolished in <i>Fmr1-/y</i>::<i>Drd1a-tdTomato</i> mice. Interestingly, multivariate analysis highlighted the compound effects of <i>Fmr1</i> ablation by disclosing how the phenotypic traits distinguishing each cell type in wild-type mice were altered in FXS. Our results suggest that the absence of FMRP disrupts the standard dichotomy characterizing NAc D1- and D2-SPNs, resulting in a homogenous phenotype. This shift in cellular properties could potentially underpin select aspects of the pathology observed in FXS. Therefore, understanding the nuanced effects of FMRP absence on SPN subtypes can offer valuable insights into the pathophysiology of FXS, opening avenues for potential therapeutic strategies."

Characterized with sensory dysfunction, FXS is the result of gene silencing of <i>Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1)</i> and loss of its product, Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). The mechanisms underlying altered critical period and sensory dysfunction in FXS are obscure. Here, we performed genetic and surgical deprivation of peripheral auditory inputs in wildtype and <i>Fmr1</i> knockout (KO) mice across ages and investigated the effects of global FMRP loss on deafferentation-induced neuronal changes in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) and auditory brainstem responses. The degree of neuronal cell loss during the critical period was unchanged in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. However, the closure of the critical period was delayed. Importantly, this delay was temporally coincidental with reduced hearing sensitivity, implying an association with sensory inputs. Functional analyses further identified early-onset and long-lasting alterations in signal transmission from the spiral ganglion to the VCN, suggesting a peripheral site of FMRP action. Finally, we generated conditional <i>Fmr1</i> KO (cKO) mice with selective deletion of FMRP in spiral ganglion but not VCN neurons. cKO mice recapitulated the delay in the VCN critical period closure in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice, confirming an involvement of cochlear FMRP in shaping the temporal features of neuronal critical periods in the brain.

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the absence of the mRNA-binding protein fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). Because FMRP is a highly pleiotropic protein controlling the expression of hundreds of genes, viral vector-mediated gene replacement therapy is viewed as a potential viable treatment to correct the fundamental underlying molecular pathology inherent in the disorder. Here, we studied the safety profile and therapeutic effects of a clinically relevant dose of a self-complementary adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector containing a major human brain isoform of FMRP after intrathecal injection into wild-type and fragile X-KO mice. Analysis of the cellular transduction in the brain indicated primarily neuronal transduction with relatively sparse glial expression, similar to endogenous FMRP expression in untreated wild-type mice. AAV vector-treated KO mice showed recovery from epileptic seizures, normalization of fear conditioning, reversal of slow-wave deficits as measured via electroencephalographic recordings, and restoration of abnormal circadian motor activity and sleep. Further assessment of vector efficacy by tracking and analyzing individual responses demonstrated correlations between the level and distribution of brain transduction and drug response. These preclinical findings further demonstrate the validity of AAV vector-mediated gene therapy for treating the most common genetic cause of cognitive impairment and autism in children."

    "abstract": "The lack of psychometrically sound outcome measures has been a barrier to evaluating the efficacy of treatments proposed for core symptoms of intellectual disability (ID). Research on Expressive Language Sampling (ELS) procedures suggest it is a promising approach to measuring treatment efficacy. ELS entails collecting samples of a participant's talk in interactions with an examiner that are naturalistic but sufficiently structured to ensure consistency and limit examiner effects on the language produced. In this study, we extended previous research on ELS by analyzing an existing dataset to determine whether psychometrically adequate composite scores reflecting multiple dimensions of language can be derived from ELS procedures administered to 6- to 23-year-olds with fragile X syndrome (n = 80) or Down syndrome (n = 78). Data came from ELS conversation and narration procedures administered twice in a 4-week test-retest interval. We found that several composites emerged from variables indexing syntax, vocabulary, planning processes, speech articulation, and talkativeness, although there were some differences in the composites for the two syndromes. Evidence of strong test-retest reliability and construct validity of two of three composites were obtained for each syndrome. Situations in which the composite scores would be useful in evaluating treatment efficacy are outlined."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a developmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability and autistic-like behaviors. These symptoms are supposed to result from dysregulated translation in pre- and postsynapses, resulting in aberrant synaptic plasticity. Although most drug development research on FXS has focused on aberrant postsynaptic functions by excess translation in postsynapses, the effect of drug candidates on FXS in presynaptic release is largely unclear. In this report, we developed a novel assay system using neuron ball culture with beads to induce presynapse formation, allowing for the analysis of presynaptic phenotypes, including presynaptic release. Metformin, which is shown to rescue core phenotypes in FXS mouse model by normalizing dysregulated translation, ameliorated the exaggerated presynaptic release of neurons of FXS model mouse using this assay system. Furthermore, metformin suppressed the excess accumulation of the active zone protein Munc18-1, which is supposed to be locally translated in presynapses. These results suggest that metformin rescues both postsynaptic and presynaptic phenotypes by inhibiting excess translation in FXS neurons."

    "abstract": "Anxiety is heightened in individuals with intellectual disability, particularly in those with specific neurogenetic syndromes. Assessment of anxiety for these individuals is hampered by a lack of appropriate measures that cater for communication impairment, differences in presentation, and overlapping features with co-occurring conditions. Here, we adopt a multi-method approach to identify fine-grained behavioural and physiological (via salivary cortisol) responses to anxiety presses in people with fragile X (FXS; n = 27; M<sub>age</sub> = 20.11 years; range 6.32 - 47.04 years) and Cornelia de Lange syndromes (CdLS; n = 27; M<sub>age</sub> = 18.42 years; range 4.28 - 41.08 years), two neurogenetic groups at high risk for anxiety, compared to neurotypical children (NT; n = 21; M<sub>age</sub> = 5.97 years; range 4.34 - 7.30 years). Results indicate that physical avoidance of feared stimuli and proximity seeking to a familiar adult are prominent behavioural indicators of anxiety/stress in FXS and CdLS. Heightened pervasive physiological arousal was identified in these groups via salivary cortisol. An association between autistic characteristics and anxiety was evident in the FXS group but not in the CdLS group pointing to syndrome-specific nuances in the association between anxiety and autism. This study furthers understanding of the behavioural and physiological presentation of anxiety in individuals with intellectual disability and progresses theoretical developments regarding the development and maintenance of anxiety at the intersection of autism."

    "abstract": "Collectively, neurodevelopmental disorders are highly prevalent, but more than a third of neurodevelopmental disorders have an identifiable genetic etiology, each of which is individually rare. The genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders are often involved in early brain development, neuronal signaling, or synaptic plasticity. Novel treatments for many genetic neurodevelopmental disorders are being developed, but disease-relevant clinical outcome assessments and biomarkers are limited. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a promising noninvasive potential biomarker of brain function. It has been used extensively in epileptic disorders, but its application in neurodevelopmental disorders needs further investigation. In this review, we explore the use of EEG in 3 of the most prevalent genetic neurodevelopmental disorders-Angelman syndrome, Rett syndrome, and fragile X syndrome. Quantitative analyses of EEGs, such as power spectral analysis or measures of connectivity, can quantify EEG signatures seen on qualitative review and potentially correlate with phenotypes. In both Angelman syndrome and Rett syndrome, increased delta power on spectral analysis has correlated with clinical markers of disease severity including developmental disability and seizure burden, whereas spectral power analysis on EEG in fragile X syndrome tends to demonstrate abnormalities in gamma power. Further studies are needed to establish reliable relationships between quantitative EEG biomarkers and clinical phenotypes in rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorders."

    "abstract": "Specific and effective treatments for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are lacking due to a poor understanding of disease mechanisms. Here we test the idea that similarities between diverse ASD mouse models are caused by deficits in common molecular pathways at neuronal synapses. To do this, we leverage the availability of multiple genetic models of ASD that exhibit shared synaptic and behavioral deficits and use quantitative mass spectrometry with isobaric tandem mass tagging (TMT) to compare their hippocampal synaptic proteomes. Comparative analyses of mouse models for Fragile X syndrome (<i>Fmr1</i> knockout), cortical dysplasia focal epilepsy syndrome (<i>Cntnap2</i> knockout), <i>PTEN</i> hamartoma tumor syndrome (<i>Pten</i> haploinsufficiency), ANKS1B syndrome (<i>Anks1b</i> haploinsufficiency), and idiopathic autism (BTBR+) revealed several common altered cellular and molecular pathways at the synapse, including changes in oxidative phosphorylation, and Rho family small GTPase signaling. Functional validation of one of these aberrant pathways, Rac1 signaling, confirms that the <i>ANKS1B</i> model displays altered Rac1 activity counter to that observed in other models, as predicted by the bioinformatic analyses. Overall similarity analyses reveal clusters of synaptic profiles, which may form the basis for molecular subtypes that explain genetic heterogeneity in ASD despite a common clinical diagnosis. Our results suggest that ASD-linked susceptibility genes ultimately converge on common signaling pathways regulating synaptic function and propose that these points of convergence are key to understanding the pathogenesis of this disorder."

One prevailing theory posits that the shorter, premutation expansion uniquely causes extreme neurotoxic increases in FMR1 mRNA (i.e., four to eightfold increases), but evidence to support this hypothesis is largely derived from analysis of peripheral blood. We applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing to postmortem frontal cortex and cerebellum from 7 individuals with premutation and matched controls (n = 6) to assess cell type-specific molecular neuropathology. We found only modest upregulation (~1.3-fold) of FMR1 in some glial populations associated with premutation expansions. In premutation cases, we also identified decreased astrocyte proportions in the cortex. Differential expression and gene ontology analysis demonstrated altered neuroregulatory roles of glia. Using network analyses, we identified cell type-specific and region-specific patterns of FMR1 protein target gene dysregulation unique to premutation cases, with notable network dysregulation in the cortical oligodendrocyte lineage. We used pseudotime trajectory analysis to determine how oligodendrocyte development was altered and identified differences in early gene expression in oligodendrocyte trajectories in premutation cases specifically, implicating early cortical glial developmental perturbations. These findings challenge dogma regarding extremely elevated <i>FMR1</i> increases in FXTAS and implicate glial dysregulation as a critical facet of premutation pathophysiology, representing potential unique therapeutic targets directly derived from the human condition."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome is a neuro-developmental disease affecting intellectual abilities and social interactions. <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> represents a consolidated model to study neuronal pathways underlying this syndrome, especially because the model recapitulates complex behavioural phenotypes. <i>Drosophila</i> Fragile X protein, or FMRP, is required for a normal neuronal structure and for correct synaptic differentiation in both the peripheral and central nervous systems, as well as for synaptic connectivity during development of the neuronal circuits. At the molecular level, FMRP has a crucial role in RNA homeostasis, including a role in transposon RNA regulation in the gonads of <i>D. m.</i> Transposons are repetitive sequences regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels to avoid genomic instability. De-regulation of transposons in the brain in response to chromatin relaxation has previously been related to neurodegenerative events in <i>Drosophila</i> models. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that FMRP is required for transposon silencing in larval and adult brains of <i>Drosophila</i> \"loss of function\" dFmr1 mutants. This study highlights that flies kept in isolation, defined as asocial conditions, experience activation of transposable elements. In all, these results suggest a role for transposons in the pathogenesis of certain neurological alterations in Fragile X as well as in abnormal social behaviors."

From October 15, 2018, to December 10, 2021, North Carolina parents could obtain FMR1 premutation results about their newborns through a voluntary expanded newborn screening research study. The study provided confirmatory testing, parental testing, and genetic counseling. We developed web-based educational materials to augment information about fragile X premutation conveyed by a genetic counselor. Many genetics education materials are developed for the lay population. However, relatively little research is published on how well individuals understand these materials. We conducted three rounds of iterative user testing interviews to help refine web-based educational materials that support understanding and self-paced learning. The participants included 25 parents with a 2-year college degree or less and without a child identified with fragile X syndrome, premutation, or gray-zone allele. Content analysis of interview transcripts resulted in iterative changes and ultimately saturation of findings. Across all rounds of interviews, there were two terms that were commonly misunderstood (fragile and carrier) and two terms that elicited initial misconceptions that were overcome by participants. Many also had difficulty understanding the relationship between fragile X premutation and fragile X syndrome as well as appreciating the implications of having a \"fragile X gene.\" Website layout, formatting, and graphics also influenced comprehension. Despite iterative changes to the content, certain issues with understandability persisted. The findings support the need for user testing to identify misconceptions that may interfere with understanding and using genetic information. Here, we describe a process used to develop and refine evidence-based, understandable parental resources on fragile X premutation. Additionally, we provide recommendations to address ongoing educational challenges and discuss the potential impact of bias on the part of expert content developers."

    "abstract": "STEP (STriatal-Enriched Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase) is a brain-specific phosphatase that plays an important role in controlling signaling molecules involved in neuronal activity and synaptic development. The striatum is the main location of the STEP enzyme. An imbalance in STEP61 activity is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). It can contribute to the development of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), schizophrenia, fragile X syndrome (FXS), Huntington's disease (HD), alcoholism, cerebral ischemia, and stress-related diseases. The molecular structure, chemistry, and molecular mechanisms associated with STEP61's two major substrates, Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPAr) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), are crucial in understanding the relationship between STEP61 and associated illnesses. STEP's interactions with its substrate proteins can alter the pathways of long-term potentiation and long-term depression. Therefore, understanding the role of STEP61 in neurological illnesses, particularly Alzheimer's disease-associated dementia, can provide valuable insights for possible therapeutic interventions. This review provides valuable insights into the molecular structure, chemistry, and molecular mechanisms associated with STEP61. This brain-specific phosphatase controls signaling molecules involved in neuronal activity and synaptic development. This review can aid researchers in gaining deep insights into the complex functions of STEP61."

    "abstract": "Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) play important roles in many neuronal processes and are believed to be involved in synaptic plasticity underlying the encoding of experience, including classic paradigms of learning and memory. These receptors have also been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome and autism. Internalization and recycling of these receptors in the neuron are important mechanisms to regulate the activity of the receptor and control the precise spatiotemporal localization of these receptors. Applying a \"molecular replacement\" approach in hippocampal neurons derived from mice, we demonstrate a critical role for protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1) in regulating the agonist-induced internalization of mGluR1. We show that PICK1 specifically regulates the internalization of mGluR1, but it does not play any role in the internalization of the other member of group I mGluR family, mGluR5. Various regions of PICK1 viz., the N-terminal acidic motif, PDZ domain, and BAR domain play important roles in the agonist-mediated internalization of mGluR1. Finally, we demonstrate that PICK1-mediated internalization of mGluR1 is critical for the resensitization of the receptor. Upon knockdown of endogenous PICK1, mGluR1s stayed on the cell membrane as inactive receptors, incapable of triggering the MAP kinase signaling. They also could not induce AMPAR endocytosis, a cellular correlate for mGluR-dependent synaptic plasticity. Thus, this study unravels a novel role for PICK1 in the agonist-mediated internalization of mGluR1 and mGluR1-mediated AMPAR endocytosis that might contribute to the function of mGluR1 in neuropsychiatric disorders."

    "abstract": "Here, we describe an approach to correct the genetic defect in fragile X syndrome (FXS) via recruitment of endogenous repair mechanisms. A leading cause of autism spectrum disorders, FXS results from epigenetic silencing of FMR1 due to a congenital trinucleotide (CGG) repeat expansion. By investigating conditions favorable to FMR1 reactivation, we find MEK and BRAF inhibitors that induce a strong repeat contraction and full FMR1 reactivation in cellular models. We trace the mechanism to DNA demethylation and site-specific R-loops, which are necessary and sufficient for repeat contraction. A positive feedback cycle comprising demethylation, de novo FMR1 transcription, and R-loop formation results in the recruitment of endogenous DNA repair mechanisms that then drive excision of the long CGG repeat. Repeat contraction is specific to FMR1 and restores the production of FMRP protein. Our study therefore identifies a potential method of treating FXS in the future."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is an X-linked disorder leading to the loss of expression of <i>FMR1</i>-protein product, FMRP. The absence or deficiency of FMRP is thought to result in the characteristic FXS phenotypes, including intellectual disability. Identifying the relationship between FMRP levels and IQ may be critical to better understand underlying mechanisms and advance treatment development and planning. A sample of 80 individuals with FXS (67% male), aged 8-45 years, completed IQ testing and blood draw via venipuncture to determine the relationship between IQ scores and FMRP levels as well as the normalcy of IQ distributions. In females with FXS only, higher FMRP levels were associated with higher IQ. In contrast, males with FXS showed a downward shifted but otherwise normal distribution of IQ scores. Our findings offer a paradigm-shifting views of FXS-males with FXS have normally distributed IQ that is downshifted 5 standard deviations. Our novel work provides evidence of a \"FXS standard curve\", and is a critical step towards establishing molecular markers of disease severity in FXS. There is much future work to better understand the mechanism by which FMRP loss leads to intellectual disability and what biological/genetic and socio-environmental factors contribute to variation in IQ."

We examined the Fragile X premutation effect on cognition, and we assumed that there is a direct correlation between the continuous spectrum of specific learning and attention deficits to the number of CGG repeats on the <i>FMR1</i> gene. A total of 108 women were referred to our center due to a related Fragile X syndrome (FXS) patient, 79 women carried a premutation of 56-199 repeats, and 19 women carried a full mutation of more than 200 CGG repeats on <i>FMR1</i> gene. Genetic results of CGG repeats, demographic information, structured questionnaires for ADHD, learning disabilities of language and mathematics, and independence level were analyzed in women carrying the <i>FMR1</i> premutation and compared to the group carrying the full mutation. Women with FXS and FXTAS were excluded. When analyzed as a continuum, there was a significant increase in the following complaints which were associated with a higher number of repeats: specific daily function skills such as driving a car, writing checks, disorientation in directions, and also specific learning difficulties such as spelling and math difficulties. Additionally, when tested as a categorical independent variable, we observe that women with the full mutation were more likely to have ADHD or other learning disability diagnoses in the past than during premutation (<200 CGG repetitions). Specific learning and attention difficulties and resulting daily function difficulties correlate with an increased number of CGG repeats and are more likely to be associated as a common feature of premutation and full mutation in a female premutation carrier. Despite evidence of learning and attention difficulties, it is encouraging that most female carriers of the premutation and full mutation function well in most areas. Nevertheless, they face significant difficulties in specific areas of functioning such as driving, and confusion in times and schedules. Those daily function skills are mostly impacted by dyscalculia, right and left disorientation, and attention difficulties. This may aid to design specific interventions to address specific learning deficits in order to improve daily function skills and quality of life."

Four-month-old (mo) male mice with deletion of the FMR1 gene exhibit a mild increase in cortical and cancellous femoral bone mass. However, consequences of absence of FMR1 in bone of young/aged male/female mice and the cellular basis of the skeletal phenotype remain unknown. We found that absence of FMR1 results in improved bone properties with higher bone mineral density in both sexes and in 2- and 9-mo mice. The cancellous bone mass is higher only in females, whereas, cortical bone mass is higher in 2- and 9-mo males, but higher in 2- and lower in 9-mo female FMR1-knockout mice. Furthermore, male bones show higher biomechanical properties at 2mo, and females at both ages. Absence of FMR1 increases osteoblast/mineralization/bone formation and osteocyte dendricity/gene expression in vivo/ex vivo/in vitro, without affecting osteoclasts in vivo/ex vivo. Thus, FMR1 is a novel osteoblast/osteocyte differentiation inhibitor, and its absence leads to age-, site- and sex-dependent higher bone mass/strength."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and a primary genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). FXS arises from the silencing of the <i>FMR1</i> gene causing the lack of translation of its encoded protein, the Fragile X Messenger RibonucleoProtein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein involved in translational control and in RNA transport along dendrites. Although a large effort during the last 20 years has been made to investigate the cellular roles of FMRP, no effective and specific therapeutic intervention is available to treat FXS. Many studies revealed a role for FMRP in shaping sensory circuits during developmental critical periods to affect proper neurodevelopment. Dendritic spine stability, branching and density abnormalities are part of the developmental delay observed in various FXS brain areas. In particular, cortical neuronal networks in FXS are hyper-responsive and hyperexcitable, making these circuits highly synchronous. Overall, these data suggest that the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance in FXS neuronal circuitry is altered. However, not much is known about how interneuron populations contribute to the unbalanced E/I ratio in FXS even if their abnormal functioning has an impact on the behavioral deficits of patients and animal models affected by neurodevelopmental disorders. We revise here the key literature concerning the role of interneurons in FXS not only with the purpose to better understand the pathophysiology of this disorder, but also to explore new possible therapeutic applications to treat FXS and other forms of ASD or ID. Indeed, for instance, the re-introduction of functional interneurons in the diseased brains has been proposed as a promising therapeutic approach for neurological and psychiatric disorders."

Prior studies, however, have focused on between-person associations rather than coupling of within-person changes in gaze behaviors and arousal. In addition, there is debate about whether prompts to maintain eye contact are beneficial for individuals with FXS. In a study of young females (ages 6-16), we used eye tracking to assess gaze behavior and pupil dilation during social interactions in a group with FXS (<i>n</i> = 32) and a developmentally similar comparison group (<i>n</i> = 23). Participants engaged in semi-structured conversations with a female examiner during blocks with and without verbal prompts to maintain eye contact. We identified a social-behavioral and psychophysiological profile that is specific to females with FXS; this group exhibited lower mean levels of eye contact, significantly increased mean pupil dilation during conversations that included prompts to maintain eye contact, and showed stronger positive coupling between eye contact and pupil dilation. Our findings strengthen support for the perspective that gaze aversion in FXS reflects negative reinforcement of social avoidance behavior. We also found that behavioral skills training may improve eye contact, but maintaining eye contact appears to be physiologically taxing for females with FXS."

In FXS patients, electrophysiological studies have demonstrated a marked reduction in global alpha activity and regional increases in gamma oscillations associated with intellectual disability and sensory hypersensitivity. Since alpha activity is associated with a thalamocortical function with widely distributed modulatory effects on neocortical excitability, insight into alpha physiology may provide insight into systems-level disease mechanisms. Herein, we took a data-driven approach to clarify the temporal and spatial properties of alpha and theta activity in participants with FXS. High-resolution resting-state EEG data were collected from participants affected by FXS (n = 65) and matched controls (n = 70). We used a multivariate technique to empirically classify neural oscillatory bands based on their coherent spatiotemporal patterns. Participants with FXS demonstrated: 1) redistribution of lower-frequency boundaries indicating a \"slower\" dominant alpha rhythm, 2) an anteriorization of alpha frequency activity, and 3) a correlation of increased individualized alpha power measurements with auditory neurosensory dysfunction. These findings suggest an important role for alterations in thalamocortical physiology for the well-established neocortical hyper-excitability in FXS and, thus, a role for neural systems level disruption to cortical hyperexcitability that has been studied primarily at the local circuit level in animal models."

Thirty school-aged males with FXS and 26 age and symptom-matched males with non-syndromic ASD, were administered a behavioral treatment probe designed to improve levels of social gaze during interactions with others. The treatment probe was administered by a trained behavior therapist over two days in our laboratory and included reinforcement of social gaze in two alternating training conditions - looking while listening and looking while speaking. Prior to each session, children in each group were taught progressive muscle relaxation and breathing techniques to counteract potential increased hyperarousal. Measures included the rate of learning in each group during treatment, in addition to levels of social gaze and heart rate obtained during administration of a standardized social conversation task administered prior to and following the treatment probe. Results showed that learning rates obtained during administration of the treatment probe were significantly less steep and less variable for males with FXS compared to males with non-syndromic ASD. Significant improvements in social gaze were also observed for males with FXS during the social conversation task. There was no effect of the treatment probe on heart rate in either group. These data reveal important differences in social learning between the two groups and have implications for early interventions in the two conditions."

Among all participants (N = 424), the degree of instability (expansion) was significantly higher (median 2.5 vs 2.0, P = 0.026) in participants with a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to those without. FMR1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in subjects with any psychiatric disorder diagnosis (P = 0.0017); specifically, in those with ADHD (P = 0.009), and with depression (P = 0.025). Somatic FMR1 expansion was associated with the presence of ADHD in female PM and FMR1 mRNA levels were associated with the presence of mental health disorders. The findings of our research are innovative as they suggest a potential role of the CGG expansion in the clinical phenotype of PM and may potentially guide clinical prognosis and management."

    "title": "FMRP phosphorylation and interactions with Cdh1 regulate association with dendritic RNA granules and MEF2-triggered synapse elimination.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) is necessary for experience-dependent, developmental synapse elimination and the loss of this process may underlie the excess dendritic spines and hyperconnectivity of cortical neurons in Fragile X Syndrome, a common inherited form of intellectual disability and autism. Little is known of the signaling pathways that regulate synapse elimination and if or how FMRP is regulated during this process. We have characterized a model of synapse elimination in CA1 neurons of organotypic hippocampal slice cultures that is induced by expression of the active transcription factor Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 (MEF2) and relies on postsynaptic FMRP. MEF2-induced synapse elimination is deficient in Fmr1 KO CA1 neurons, and is rescued by acute (24 h), postsynaptic and cell autonomous reexpression of FMRP in CA1 neurons. FMRP is an RNA binding protein that suppresses mRNA translation. Derepression is induced by posttranslational mechanisms downstream of metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling. Dephosphorylation of FMRP at S499 triggers ubiquitination and degradation of FMRP which then relieves translation suppression and promotes synthesis of proteins encoded by target mRNAs. Whether this mechanism functions in synapse elimination is not known. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of FMRP at S499 are both necessary for synapse elimination as well as interaction of FMRP with its E3 ligase for FMRP, APC/Cdh1. Using a bimolecular ubiquitin-mediated fluorescence complementation (UbFC) assay, we demonstrate that MEF2 promotes ubiquitination of FMRP in CA1 neurons that relies on activity and interaction with APC/Cdh1. Our results suggest a model where MEF2 regulates posttranslational modifications of FMRP via APC/Cdh1 to regulate translation of proteins necessary for synapse elimination."

This paper presents the current evidence for medicinal cannabis in this population. Preliminary evidence from open-label studies suggests the potential for medicinal cannabis to ameliorate some symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder. However, only one double-blind placebo-controlled trial has been completed, with inconclusive findings. Synthetic, transdermal cannabidiol gel has demonstrated efficacy for reducing social avoidance in a sub-group of children with Fragile X syndrome. Studies of medicinal cannabis are planned or underway for children and/or adolescents with autism, intellectual disability, Tourette's syndrome, anxiety, psychosis, anorexia nervosa and a number of specific neurodevelopmental syndromes. High quality evidence from double-blind placebo-controlled trials is needed to guide clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Sleep plays an integral role in supporting well-being, and sleep difficulties are common in mothers of individuals with developmental disabilities, including fragile X syndrome (FXS). This study assessed whether the effects of sleep quality on physical health and depression are exacerbated by genetic risk factors (CGG repeats) in FMR1 premutation carrier mothers of individuals with FXS. Poor sleep quality predicted a greater number of physical health conditions for mothers with CGG repeats in the mid-premutation range (90-110 repeats), but not for those in the lower (< 90 repeats) or higher (> 110 repeats) ends of the range. A significant association between poor sleep quality and maternal depressive symptoms was also observed, but there was no evidence that this effect varied by level of genetic vulnerability. This research extends our understanding of individual differences in the effects of sleep quality among mothers of individuals with FXS."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the single most common monogenetic cause of autism spectrum disorders in humans. FXS is caused by loss of expression of the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an mRNA-binding protein encoded on the X chromosome involved in suppressing protein translation. Sensory processing deficits have been a major focus of studies of FXS in both humans and rodent models of FXS, but olfactory deficits remain poorly understood. Here we conducted experiments in wild-type and <i>Fmr1</i> KO ( <i>Fmr1 <sup>-/y</sup></i> ) mice (males) that lack expression of the gene encoding FMRP to assess olfactory circuit and behavioral abnormalities. In patch-clamp recordings conducted in slices of the olfactory bulb, output mitral cells (MCs) in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice displayed greatly enhanced excitation, as evidenced by a much higher rate of occurrence of spontaneous network-level events known as long-lasting depolarizations (LLDs). The higher probability of LLDs did not appear to reflect changes in inhibitory connections onto MCs but rather enhanced spontaneous excitation of external tufted cells (eTCs) that provide feedforward excitation onto MCs within glomeruli. In addition, in a go/no-go operant discrimination paradigm, we found that <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice displayed impaired discrimination of odors in difficult tasks that involved odor mixtures but not altered discrimination of monomolecular odors. We suggest that the higher excitability of MCs in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice may impair fine odor discrimination by broadening odor tuning curves of MCs and/or altering synchronized oscillations through changes in transient inhibition. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) in humans is associated with a range of debilitating deficits including aberrant sensory processing. One sensory system that has received comparatively little attention in studies in animal models of FXS is olfaction. Here, we report the first comprehensive physiological analysis of circuit defects in the olfactory bulb in the commonly-used <i>Fmr1</i> knockout (KO) mouse model of FXS. Our studies indicate that <i>Fmr1</i> KO alters the local excitation/inhibition balance in the bulb - similar to what <i>Fmr1</i> KO does in other brain circuits - but through a novel mechanism that involves enhanced feedforward excitatory drive. Furthermore, <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice display behavioral impairments in fine odor discrimination, an effect that may be explained by enhanced neural excitability."

    "abstract": "There is a critical need for the development of improved outcome measures in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Because the majority of respondents of behavior outcome measures are caregivers or individuals with FXS, it is important to consider stakeholders' firsthand experiences when designing a caregiver- or self-report measure. The current research study aimed to understand experiences of completing commonly used caregiver-/self-report measures of behavior in FXS via focus groups. This study employed a focus group methodology. Semi-structured focus groups were conducted with 22 caregivers and 3 self-advocates. All interviews occurred via secured videoconferencing. A thematic analysis was used to identify major themes and subthemes. We identified four themes: (1) content of measure, (2) structure of the measure, (3) potential accommodations to complete measure, and (4) impact of measure on family. Importantly, focus groups revealed that certain aspects of content, structure, and implementation of the available measures were related to distress and negative emotions of caregivers of FXS and individuals with FXS themselves. The focus group data yielded a wide range of feedback and has significant implications, highlighting the critical need to take key stakeholder perspectives into account when using and/or developing caregiver- or self-report measures for FXS."

Mild to moderate intellectual disability (ID) is common in this population, and previous work by our team identified substantial deficits in adaptive behavior. However, the full profile of adaptive function in 3q29del has not been described, nor has it been compared to other genomic syndromes associated with elevated risk for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Individuals with 3q29del (n=32, 62.5% male) were evaluated using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition, Comprehensive Parent/Caregiver Form (Vineland-3). We explored the relationship between adaptive behavior and cognitive function, executive function, and neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric comorbidities in our 3q29del study sample, and we compared subjects with 3q29del to published data on Fragile X syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes. Individuals with 3q29del had global deficits in adaptive behavior that were not driven by specific weaknesses in any given domain. Individual neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diagnoses had a small effect on adaptive behavior, and the cumulative number of comorbid diagnoses was significantly negatively associated with Vineland-3 performance. Both cognitive ability and executive function were significantly associated with adaptive behavior, and executive function was a better predictor of Vineland-3 performance than cognitive ability. Finally, the severity of adaptive behavior deficits in 3q29del was distinct from previously published data on comparable genomic disorders. Individuals with 3q29del have significant deficits in adaptive behavior, affecting all domains assessed by the Vineland-3. Executive function is a better predictor of adaptive behavior than cognitive ability in this population and suggests that interventions targeting executive function may be an effective therapeutic strategy."

    "abstract": "As of 2022, 36 anti-seizure medications (ASMs) have been licensed for the treatment of epilepsy, however, adverse effects (AEs) are commonly reported. Therefore, ASMs with a wide margin between therapeutic effects and AEs are preferred over ASMs that are associated with a narrow margin between efficacy and risk of AEs. E2730 was discovered using in vivo phenotypic screening and characterized as an uncompetitive, yet selective, inhibitor of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter 1 (GAT1). Here, we describe the preclinical characteristics of E2730. Anti-seizure effects of E2730 were evaluated in several animal models of epilepsy: corneal kindling, 6 Hz-44 mA psychomotor seizure, amygdala kindling, Fragile X syndrome, and Dravet syndrome models. Effects of E2730 on motor coordination were assessed in accelerating rotarod tests. The mechanism of action of E2730 was explored by [<sup>3</sup> H]E2730 binding assay. The GAT1-selectivity over other GABA transporters was examined by GABA uptake assay of GAT1, GAT2, GAT3, or betaine/GABA transporter 1 (BGT-1) stably expressing HEK293 cells. To further investigate the mechanism for E2730-mediated inhibition of GAT1, in vivo microdialysis and in vitro GABA uptake assays were conducted under conditions of different GABA concentrations. E2730 showed anti-seizure effects in the assessed animal models with an approximately >20-‍fold margin between efficacy and motor incoordination. [<sup>3</sup> H]E2730 binding on brain synaptosomal membrane was abolished in GAT1-deficient mice, and E2730 selectively inhibited GAT1-mediated GABA uptake over other GABA transporters. In addition, results of GABA uptake assays showed that E2730-mediated inhibition of GAT1 positively correlated to the level of ambient GABA in vitro. E2730 also increased extracellular GABA concentration in hyperactivated conditions but not under basal levels in vivo. E2730 is a novel, selective, uncompetitive GAT1 inhibitor, which acts selectively under the condition of increasing synaptic activity, contributing to a wide margin between therapeutic effect and motor incoordination."

Here, we show that FMRP interacts with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) to regulate the formation and function of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCSs), structures that are critical for mitochondrial calcium (mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup>) homeostasis. FMRP-deficient cells feature excessive ERMCS formation and ER-to-mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of VDAC or other ERMCS components restored synaptic structure, function, and plasticity and rescued locomotion and cognitive deficits of the Drosophila dFmr1 mutant. Expressing FMRP C-terminal domain (FMRP-C), which confers FMRP-VDAC interaction, rescued the ERMCS formation and mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis defects in FXS patient iPSC-derived neurons and locomotion and cognitive deficits in Fmr1 knockout mice. These results identify altered ERMCS formation and mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis as contributors to FXS and offer potential therapeutic targets."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the best-known form of inherited intellectual disability caused by the loss-of-function mutation in a single gene. The <i>FMR1</i> gene mutation abolishes the expression of Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), which regulates the expression of many synaptic proteins. Cortical pyramidal neurons in postmortem FXS patient brains show abnormally high density and immature morphology of dendritic spines; this phenotype is replicated in the <i>Fmr1</i> knockout (KO) mouse. While FMRP is well-positioned in the dendrite to regulate synaptic plasticity, intriguing <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> data show that wild type neurons embedded in a network of <i>Fmr1</i> KO neurons or glia exhibit spine abnormalities just as neurons in <i>Fmr1</i> global KO mice. This raises the question: does FMRP regulate synaptic morphology and dynamics in a cell-autonomous manner, or do the synaptic phenotypes arise from abnormal pre-synaptic inputs? To address this question, we combined viral and mouse genetic approaches to delete FMRP from a very sparse subset of cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5 PyrNs) either during early postnatal development or in adulthood. We then followed the structural dynamics of dendritic spines on these <i>Fmr1</i> KO neurons by <i>in vivo</i> two-photon microscopy. We found that, while L5 PyrNs in adult <i>Fmr1</i> global KO mice have abnormally high density of thin spines, single-cell <i>Fmr1</i> KO in adulthood does not affect spine density, morphology, or dynamics. On the contrary, neurons with neonatal FMRP deletion have normal spine density but elevated spine formation at 1 month of age, replicating the phenotype in <i>Fmr1</i> global KO mice. Interestingly, these neurons exhibit elevated thin spine density, but normal total spine density, by adulthood. Together, our data reveal cell-autonomous FMRP regulation of cortical synaptic dynamics during adolescence, but spine defects in adulthood also implicate non-cell-autonomous factors."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited intellectual disability, is caused by the loss of expression of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that negatively regulates the expression of many postsynaptic as well as presynaptic proteins involved in action potential properties, calcium homeostasis and neurotransmitter release. FXS patients and mice lacking FMRP suffer from multiple behavioral alterations, including deficits in motor learning for which there is currently no specific treatment. We performed electron microscopy, whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and behavioral experiments to characterise the synaptic mechanisms underlying the motor learning deficits observed in Fmr1KO mice and the therapeutic potential of positive allosteric modulator of mGluR4. We found that enhanced synaptic vesicle docking of cerebellar parallel fiber to Purkinje cell Fmr1KO synapses was associated with enhanced asynchronous release, which not only prevents further potentiation, but it also compromises presynaptic parallel fiber long-term potentiation (PF-LTP) mediated by β adrenergic receptors. A reduction in extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration restored the readily releasable pool (RRP) size, basal synaptic transmission, β adrenergic receptor-mediated potentiation, and PF-LTP. Interestingly, VU 0155041, a selective positive allosteric modulator of mGluR4, also restored both the RRP size and PF-LTP in mice of either sex. Moreover, when injected into Fmr1KO male mice, VU 0155041 improved motor learning in skilled reaching, classical eyeblink conditioning and vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) tests, as well as the social behavior alterations of these mice. We cannot rule out that the activation of mGluR4s via systemic administration of VU0155041 can also affect other brain regions. Further studies are needed to stablish the effect of a specific activation of mGluR4 in cerebellar granule cells. Our study shows that an increase in synaptic vesicles, SV, docking may cause the loss of PF-LTP and motor learning and social deficits of Fmr1KO mice and that the reversal of these changes by pharmacological activation of mGluR4 may offer therapeutic relief for motor learning and social deficits in FXS."

This presents tremendous diagnostic challenges given the phenotypic overlap between autism and other diagnoses, including social anxiety, as well as variance in specific genetic disorders like fragile X syndrome (FXS). Biobehavioral measurement approaches integrate behavioral and biological data, and by so doing have the potential to address diagnostic challenges and shed light on the mechanisms underlying social impairments. The present study utilized a biobehavioral approach to evaluate how biologically based indices of baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and temperamental negative affect differ and predict autism and anxiety in a sample of 120 preschoolers with non-syndromic autism (nsASD) with co-occurring intellectual impairment, FXS, and neurotypical (NT) development. Results indicated that children with nsASD display elevated negative affect compared to both FXS and NT controls which did not differ from each other and females exhibited more negative affect relative to males. Interestingly, elevated negative affect predicted social anxiety, but not ASD in FXS. Baseline RSA did not differ across the groups; however, reduced RSA predicted elevated autism severity for the nsASD group but not those with FXS or NT development. Taken together, biobehavioral markers differentiated the groups in discrete ways that advance our understanding of autism and promote improved diagnostic clarity using objective measurement."

We examined the astrocytic regulation of aberrant firing of FXS neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells. Human FXS cortical neurons, co-cultured with human FXS astrocytes, fired frequent short-duration spontaneous bursts of action potentials compared with less frequent, longer-duration bursts of control neurons co-cultured with control astrocytes. Intriguingly, bursts fired by FXS neurons co-cultured with control astrocytes are indistinguishable from control neurons. Conversely, control neurons exhibit aberrant firing in the presence of FXS astrocytes. Thus, the astrocyte genotype determines the neuronal firing phenotype. Strikingly, astrocytic-conditioned medium, and not the physical presence of astrocytes, is capable of determining the firing phenotype. The mechanistic basis of this effect indicates that the astroglial-derived protein, S100β, restores normal firing by reversing the suppression of a persistent sodium current in FXS neurons."

The age of last visit or follow-up was 5.0 (2.7,6.8) years. The main clinical manifestations included motor retardation, mental retardation, multiple malformations, and skeletal deformity. Cases 1-4 were all all boys, showed myopathic gait, poor running and jumping, and significantly increased level of serum creatine kinase. Disease-causing variations in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene were confirmed by genetic testing. The 4 children were diagnosed with DMD or Becker muscular dystrophy combined with a second genetic disease, including hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, spinal muscular atrophy, fragile X syndrome, and cerebral cavernous malformations type 3, respectively. Cases 5-9 were clinically and genetically diagnosed as COL9A1 gene-related multiple epiphyseal dysplasia type 6 combined with NF1 gene-related neurofibromatosis type 1, COL6A3 gene-related Bethlem myopathy with WNT1 gene-related osteogenesis imperfecta type XV, Turner syndrome (45, X0/46, XX chimera) with TH gene-related Segawa syndrome, Chromosome 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome with DYNC1H1 gene-related autosomal dominant lower extremity-predominant spinal muscular atrophy-1, and ANKRD11 gene-related KBG syndrome combined with IRF2BPL gene-related neurodevelopmental disorder with regression, abnormal movement, language loss and epilepsy. DMD was the most common, and there were 6 autosomal dominant diseases caused by de novo heterozygous pathogenic variations. <b>Conclusions:</b> Pediatric patients with coexistence of double genetic diagnoses show complex phenotypes. When the clinical manifestations and progression are not fully consistent with the diagnosed rare genetic disease, a second rare genetic disease should be considered, and autosomal dominant diseases caused by de novo heterozygous pathogenic variation should be paid attention to. Trio-based whole-exome sequencing combining a variety of molecular genetic tests would be helpful for precise diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a hereditary disease that predominantly leads to intellectual disability (ID) in boys. It is the second prominent cause of ID, which manifests as a result of the atypical development of the cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) region. This irregular extension of the CGG region gives rise to methylation and silencing of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (<i>FMR1</i>) gene, causing a loss of the fragile X mental retardation 1 protein (FMRP). This reduction or loss of FMRP is the main cause of ID. It has a multisystemic involvement showing neuropsychiatric features such as ID, speech and language delay, autism spectrum disorder, sensory hyperarousal, social anxiety, abnormal eye contact, shyness, and aggressive behaviour. It is also known to cause musculoskeletal symptoms, ocular symptoms, cardiac abnormalities, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The management is challenging, and there is no known cure for the disease; hence an early diagnosis of the condition is needed through prenatal screening offered to couples with familial history of ID before conception. The management rests on non-pharmacological modalities, including applied behaviour analysis, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language therapy, and pharmacologic management through symptomatic treatment of comorbid behaviours and psychiatric problems and some forms of targeted therapy."

Because males express a more severe phenotype than females, research has focused largely on identifying neural abnormalities in all-male or both-sex populations with FXS. Therefore, very little is known about the neural alterations that contribute to cognitive behavioral symptoms in females with FXS. This cross-sectional study aimed to elucidate the large-scale resting-state brain networks associated with the multidomain cognitive behavioral phenotype in girls with FXS. We recruited 38 girls with full-mutation FXS (11.58 ± 3.15 years) and 32 girls without FXS (11.66 ± 2.27 years). Both groups were matched on age, verbal IQ, and multidomain cognitive behavioral symptoms. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected. Compared with the control group, girls with FXS showed significantly greater resting-state functional connectivity of the default mode network, lower nodal strength at the right middle temporal gyrus, stronger nodal strength at the left caudate, and higher global efficiency of the default mode network. These aberrant brain network characteristics map directly onto the cognitive behavioral symptoms commonly observed in girls with FXS. An exploratory analysis suggested that brain network patterns at a prior time point (time 1) were predictive of the longitudinal development of participants' multidomain cognitive behavioral symptoms. These findings represent the first examination of large-scale brain network alterations in a large sample of girls with FXS, expanding our knowledge of potential neural mechanisms underlying the development of cognitive behavioral symptoms in girls with FXS."

    "abstract": "The proteome of glutamatergic synapses is diverse across the mammalian brain and involved in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Among those is fragile X syndrome (FXS), an NDD caused by the absence of the functional RNA-binding protein FMRP. Here, we demonstrate how the brain region-specific composition of postsynaptic density (PSD) contributes to FXS. In the striatum, the FXS mouse model shows an altered association of the PSD with the actin cytoskeleton, reflecting immature dendritic spine morphology and reduced synaptic actin dynamics. Enhancing actin turnover with constitutively active RAC1 ameliorates these deficits. At the behavioral level, the FXS model displays striatal-driven inflexibility, a typical feature of FXS individuals, which is rescued by exogenous RAC1. Striatal ablation of Fmr1 is sufficient to recapitulate behavioral impairments observed in the FXS model. These results indicate that dysregulation of synaptic actin dynamics in the striatum, a region largely unexplored in FXS, contributes to the manifestation of FXS behavioral phenotypes."

Using live imaging of postnatal Rostral Migratory Stream (RMS) neurons in Fmr1-null mice, we observed that the absence of FMRP leads to delayed neuronal migration and altered trajectory, associated with defects of centrosomal movement. RNA-interference-induced knockdown of <i>Fmr1</i> shows that these migratory defects are cell-autonomous. Notably, the primary FMRP mRNA target implicated in these migratory defects is MAP1B (Microtubule-Associated Protein 1B). Knocking-down MAP1B expression effectively rescued most of the observed migratory defects. Finally, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms at play by demonstrating that the absence of FMRP induces defects in the cage of microtubules surrounding the nucleus of migrating neurons, which is rescued by MAP1B knockdown. Our findings reveal a novel neurodevelopmental role for FMRP in collaboration with MAP1B, jointly orchestrating neuronal migration by influencing the microtubular cytoskeleton."

    "title": "Targeted Treatments for Fragile X Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "The histories of targeted treatment trials in fragile X syndrome (FXS) are reviewed in animal studies and human trials. Advances in understanding the neurobiology of FXS have identified a number of pathways that are dysregulated in the absence of FMRP and are therefore pathways that can be targeted with new medication. The utilization of quantitative outcome measures to assess efficacy in multiple studies has improved the quality of more recent trials. Current treatment trials including the use of cannabidiol (CBD) topically and metformin orally have positive preliminary data, and both of these medications are available clinically. The use of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDE4D), BPN1440, which raised the level of cAMP that is low in FXS has very promising results for improving cognition in adult males who underwent a controlled trial. There are many more targeted treatments that will undergo trials in FXS, so the future looks bright for new treatments."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to focus on the main neurophysiological aspects of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the current pharmacological treatment used for the management of hyperactivity and attention deficits in children aged 6-20 years with a diagnosis of ASD, not associated with other genetic or epileptic disorders, such as Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), Tuberous Sclerosis, Kleefstra Syndrome or Angelman Syndrome. This mini review was conducted according to the <i>P</i>.I.C.O. model and according to the PRISMA guidelines. The keywords used were: <i>autism spectrum disorder</i>; <i>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</i>; <i>attention deficit disorder</i>; <i>methylphenidate</i>; <i>ritalin</i>; <i>ADHD</i>; <i>youth autism</i>; <i>childhood autism</i>; <i>childhood autism spectrum disorder</i>; <i>adolescent autism</i>. The strings produced were compared and selected by a third independent clinician. The PubMed and PsycArticles search yielded a total of 3,200 articles. For their inclusion, the 3,200 articles were examined by two clinicians who ultimately selected 28 (15 clinical trials and 13 reviews/meta-analyses) articles analysed according to their consistency with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three main aspects emerged from the review: (1) According to the existing literature, new randomized controlled trials are needed to ensure a better understanding of the most effective drug treatments for dual-diagnosed ASD-ADHD patients and of the related behavioural effects. Currently, the use of drugs varies depending on psychiatric comorbidity, symptoms, age and gender and there is no univocal reference therapy; (2) Methylphenidate (MPH) has currently been shown to be the most suitable drug for the treatment of hyperactivity and inattention in individuals diagnosed with ASD and ADHD; (3) There is a need to create and evaluate appropriate tests to analyse more specific patterns of behaviour presented in the two conditions."

    "abstract": "In the developmental remodeling of brain circuits, neurons are removed by glial phagocytosis to optimize adult behavior. Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) regulates neuron-to-glia signaling to drive glial phagocytosis for targeted neuron pruning. We find that FMRP acts in a mothers against decapentaplegic (Mad)-insulin receptor (InR)-protein kinase B (Akt) pathway to regulate pretaporter (Prtp) and amyloid precursor protein-like (APPL) signals directing this glial clearance. Neuronal RNAi of <i>Drosophila fragile X mental retardation 1</i> (<i>dfmr1</i>) elevates <i>mad</i> transcript levels and increases pMad signaling. Neuronal <i>dfmr1</i> and <i>mad</i> RNAi both elevate phospho-protein kinase B (pAkt) and delay neuron removal but cause opposite effects on InR expression. Genetically correcting pAkt levels in the <i>mad</i> RNAi background restores normal remodeling. Consistently, neuronal <i>dfmr1</i> and <i>mad</i> RNAi both decrease Prtp levels, whereas neuronal <i>InR</i> and <i>akt</i> RNAi increase Prtp levels, indicating FMRP works with pMad and insulin signaling to tightly regulate Prtp signaling and thus control glial phagocytosis for correct circuit remodeling. Neuronal <i>dfmr1</i> and <i>mad</i> and <i>akt</i> RNAi all decrease APPL levels, with the pathway signaling higher glial endolysosome activity for phagocytosis. These findings reveal a FMRP-dependent control pathway for neuron-to-glia communication in neuronal pruning, identifying potential molecular mechanisms for devising fragile X syndrome treatments."

Mutations of <i>FMR1</i> are also associated with reproductive disorders, such as early cessation of reproductive function in females. While progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of mental impairment, the causes of reproductive disorders are not clear. FMR1-associated reproductive disorders were studied exclusively from the endocrine perspective, while the <i>FMR1</i> role in neurons that control reproduction was not addressed. Here, we demonstrate that similar to women with <i>FMR1</i> mutations, female <i>Fmr1</i> null mice stop reproducing early. However, young null females display larger litters, more corpora lutea in the ovaries, increased inhibin, progesterone, testosterone, and gonadotropin hormones in the circulation. Ovariectomy reveals both hypothalamic and ovarian contribution to elevated gonadotropins. Altered mRNA and protein levels of several synaptic molecules in the hypothalamus are identified, indicating reasons for hypothalamic dysregulation. Increased vascularization of corpora lutea, higher sympathetic innervation of growing follicles in the ovaries of <i>Fmr1</i> nulls, and higher numbers of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in GnRH neurons, which are excitatory for GnRH neurons, contribute to increased FSH and LH, respectively. Unmodified and ovariectomized <i>Fmr1</i> nulls have increased LH pulse frequency, suggesting that <i>Fmr1</i> nulls exhibit hyperactive GnRH neurons, regardless of the ovarian feedback. These results reveal <i>Fmr1</i> function in the regulation of GnRH neuron secretion, and point to the role of GnRH neurons, in addition to the ovarian innervation, in the etiology of <i>Fmr1</i>-mediated reproductive disorders."

Hyperphagia, obesity, learning and behavioral problems, short stature with growth and other hormone deficiencies are identified during childhood. Those with the larger 15q11-q13 Type I deletion with the absence of four non-imprinted genes (<i>NIPA1, NIPA2, CYFIP1, TUBGCP5</i>) from the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 region are more severely affected compared with those with PWS having a smaller Type II deletion. <i>NIPA1</i> and <i>NIPA2</i> genes encode magnesium and cation transporters, supporting brain and muscle development and function, glucose and insulin metabolism and neurobehavioral outcomes. Lower magnesium levels are reported in those with Type I deletions. The <i>CYFIP1</i> gene encodes a protein associated with fragile X syndrome. The <i>TUBGCP5</i> gene is associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and compulsions, more commonly seen in PWS with the Type I deletion. When the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 region alone is deleted, neurodevelopment, motor, learning and behavioral problems including seizures, ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and autism may occur with other clinical findings recognized as Burnside-Butler syndrome. The genes in the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 region may contribute to more clinical involvement and comorbidities in those with PWS and Type I deletions."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of monogenic intellectual disability and autism, caused by the absence of the functional fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP). FXS features include increased and dysregulated protein synthesis, observed in both murine and human cells. Altered processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), consisting of an excess of soluble APPα (sAPPα), may contribute to this molecular phenotype in mice and human fibroblasts. Here we show an age-dependent dysregulation of APP processing in fibroblasts from FXS individuals, human neural precursor cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and forebrain organoids. Moreover, FXS fibroblasts treated with a cell-permeable peptide that decreases the generation of sAPPα show restored levels of protein synthesis. Our findings suggest the possibility of using cell-based permeable peptides as a future therapeutic approach for FXS during a defined developmental window."

    "abstract": "Motor skill learning induces changes in synaptic structure and function in the primary motor cortex (M1). In the fragile X syndrome (FXS) mouse model an impairment in motor skill learning and associated formation of new dendritic spines was previously reported. However, whether modulation of synaptic strength through trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) with motor skill training is impaired in FXS is not known. Here, we performed <i>in vivo</i> imaging of a tagged AMPA receptor subunit, GluA2, in layer (L)2/3 neurons in the primary motor cortex of wild-type (WT) and <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out (KO) male mice at different stages of learning a single forelimb-reaching task. Surprisingly, in the <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice, despite impairments in learning there was no deficit in motor skill training-induced spine formation. However, the gradual accumulation of GluA2 in WT stable spines, which persists after training is completed and past the phase of spine number normalization, is absent in the <i>Fmr1</i> KO mouse. These results demonstrate that motor skill learning not only reorganizes circuits through formation of new synapses, but also strengthens existing synapses through accumulation of AMPA receptors and GluA2 changes are better associated with learning than new spine formation."

    "abstract": "The fragile-X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is a canonical RNA-binding protein whose absence in humans leads to the development of the fragile-X syndrome, characterized by multiple phenotypes including neurodevelopmental disorders, intellectual disability, autism, and macroorchidism. The primary transcripts of the <i>FMR1</i> gene undergo extensive alternative splicing processes, and multiple protein isoforms are produced. The predominantly cytoplasmic isoforms are translational regulators, while the roles of the nuclear ones have been neglected. In this study, we discovered that nuclear FMRP isoforms specifically associate with DNA bridges, aberrant genomic structures that form during mitosis and whose accumulation can drive genome instability by inducing DNA damage. Further localization studies showed that a subset of FMRP-positive bridges contain proteins that have been shown to associate with specific DNA bridges known as ultrafine DNA bridges (UFBs) and surprisingly are RNA positive. Significantly, the depletion of nuclear FMRP isoforms promotes the accumulation of DNA bridges, correlating with the accumulation of DNA damages and cell death, unveiling an important function of these neglected isoforms."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited intellectual disability. FXS is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene, which leads to gene methylation, transcriptional silencing, and lack of expression of Fragile X Messenger Riboprotein (FMRP). Currently available FXS therapies are inefficient, and the disease severity is highly variable, making it difficult to predict disease trajectory and treatment response. We and others have recently shown that a subset of full-mutation, fully-methylated (FM-FM) males with FXS express low amounts of FMRP which could contribute to phenotypic variability. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, we developed a sensitive qRT-PCR assay to detect FMR1 mRNA in blood. This assay reproducibly detects trace amounts of FMR1 mRNA in a subset of FM-FM males, suggesting that current Southern Blot and PCR determination of FM-FM status is not always associated with complete transcriptional silencing. The functional relevance of trace-level FMR1 mRNA is confirmed by showing a positive correlation with cognitive function; however, phenotypic variability is not fully explained by FMR1 expression. These results corroborate the need for better molecular assays for FXS diagnosis and encourage studies to elucidate the factors contributing to the phenotypic variability of FXS."

    "abstract": "Behavioral difficulties in individuals with fragile X Syndrome (FXS) are one of the primary reasons families seek medical and psychological support. Among these, behavioral inflexibility is very common, and when left untreated, can negatively impact quality of life for the individuals with FXS and their families. Behavioral inflexibility refers to the difficulty in changing one's behaviors based on environmental demands or social contexts, thus impeding daily functioning, opportunities for learning, and social interactions. In addition to the individual and family impact, behavioral inflexibility is often recognized as a defining phenotype of FXS and appears to be specific to FXS when compared to other genetic forms of intellectual disability. Despite the pervasiveness and severity of behavioral inflexibility in FXS, there are limited measures that adequately assess behavioral inflexibility in FXS. We conducted semi-structured virtual focus groups with 22 caregivers, 3 self-advocates, and 1 professional to gather key stakeholders' perspectives on and experiences of inflexible behavior observed in FXS. Audio-recordings from focus groups were transcribed using NVivo, then verified and coded. Two trained professionals reviewed codes to extract primary themes. Six themes were extracted: (1) Intolerance of change, (2) Intolerance to uncertainty, (3) Repetitive interests and behaviors, (4) Family impact, (5) Change in behavior across the lifespan, and (6) Impact of the COVID pandemic. Our findings show common examples of these themes included intolerance to disruption to routine, perseverative questioning, watching the same things over and over, and caregivers having to extensively pre-plan for events. The purpose of the current study was to gain key stakeholders' perspectives <i>via</i> focus groups to elicit information and understand patterns of inflexible behaviors in FXS, with the goal of developing a disorder-specific measure to accurately assess behavioral inflexibility across the lifespan and in response to treatment. We were able to capture several phenotypic examples of behavioral inflexibility in FXS as well as their impact on individuals with FXS and their families. The wealth of information gained through our study will aid in our next steps of item generation for measure development of Ratings of Inflexibility in Genetic Disorders associated with Intellectual Disability - Fragile X Syndrome (RIGID-FX)."

In this chapter, we discuss the role of mGlu receptors in various forms of cognition and their underlying physiology, with an emphasis on cognitive dysfunction. Specifically, we highlight evidence that links mGlu physiology to cognitive dysfunction across brain disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Fragile X syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia. We also provide recent evidence demonstrating that mGlu receptors may elicit neuroprotective effects in particular disease states. Lastly, we discuss how mGlu receptors can be targeted utilizing positive and negative allosteric modulators as well as subtype specific agonists and antagonist to restore cognitive function across these disorders."

Thus, the identification of ASD in those with FXS is fundamental to ensuring access to appropriate supports to achieve good quality of life. Yet, optimal diagnostic methods and the exact rate of ASD comorbidity remains controversial, and description of ASD identification in the community in FXS has been limited. This study characterized ASD in a sample of 49 male youth with FXS across multiple diagnostic sources: parent-reported community diagnoses, classification derived from ADOS-2 and ADI-R thresholds, and clinical best-estimate classifications from an expert multidisciplinary team. High concordance was found between ADOS-2/ADI-R and clinical best estimate classifications, with both methods supporting ASD in ~ 75% of male youth with FXS. In contrast, 31% had a community diagnosis. Findings supported gross under-identification of ASD in male youth with FXS in community settings; 60% of those who met clinical best estimate criteria for ASD had not received a diagnosis in the community. Moreover, community diagnoses were poorly aligned with the presence of ASD symptoms as perceived by parents and professionals and, unlike clinical best estimate diagnoses, were not associated with cognitive, behavioral, or language features. Findings highlight under-identification of ASD in community settings as a significant barrier to service access for male youth with FXS. Clinical recommendations should emphasize the benefits of seeking a professional ASD evaluation for children with FXS who are noted to display key ASD symptoms."

We provide a systematic review of the rationale and current clinical trial evidence for CBP in the treatment of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders in children and adolescents. A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Trials was performed to identify articles published after 1980 about CBP for medical purposes in individuals aged 18 years or younger with selected neuropsychiatric or neurodevelopmental conditions. Risk of bias and quality of evidence was assessed for each article. Of 4466 articles screened, 18 were eligible for inclusion, addressing eight conditions (anxiety disorders (n = 1); autism spectrum disorder (n = 5); foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (n = 1); fragile X syndrome (n = 2); intellectual disability (n = 1); mood disorders (n = 2); post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 3); and Tourette syndrome (n = 3)). Only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) was identified. The remaining seventeen articles included one open-label trial, three uncontrolled before-and-after trials, two case series and 11 case reports, thus the risk of bias was high. Despite growing community and scientific interest, our systematic review identified limited and generally poor-quality evidence for the efficacy of CBP in neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders in children and adolescents. Large rigorous RCTs are required to inform clinical care. In the meantime, clinicians must balance patient expectations with the limited evidence available."

We combined tetraplet-primed PCR-capillary electrophoresis and whole exome sequencing (WES)/panel or array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) to identify the size of the CGG repeats and the mutations or copy number variations (CNVs) in the genome and in <i>FMR1</i>. The clinical features of FXS children were analyzed according to pediatricians' recording, parental questionnaires, the results of examinations and follow-up. The incidence of FXS in Chinese children with idiopathic NDD was 2.4% (42/1753) and in those with FXS, 2.38% had a deletion (1/42). Here, we present the clinical characteristics of 36 children with FXS. Overweight was observed in two boys. The average intelligence quotient (IQ)/development quotient (DQ) of all FXS patients was 48. The average ages of meaningful words and walking alone were 2 years and 10 months and 1 year and 7 months, respectively. The most frequent repetitive behavior was stimulated by hyperarousal to sensory stimulation. On social aspects, social withdrawal, social anxiety, and shyness accounted for 75%, 58%, and 56% of the total number of children, respectively. Approximately 60% of FXS children in this cohort were emotionally labile and prone to temper tantrums. Self-injury and aggression toward others could also be observed, at 19% and 28%, respectively. The most frequent behavioral problem was attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) seen in 64% and the most common facial features were a narrow and elongated face and large or prominent ears in 92% of patients. Screening of <i>FMR1</i> full mutation provides the possibility for patients' further medical supports and the clinical features of FXS children obtained in this study will increase the understanding and diagnosis of FXS."

Individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders frequently experience gastrointestinal problems that are primarily linked to gut microbial dysbiosis, inflammation, and increased intestinal permeability. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) are non-pharmacological agents that exert potential therapeutic effects against neurological disorders. However, it is unclear whether omega-3 PUFAs improve autistic behaviors in fragile X syndrome (FXS) by altering the gut microbial composition. Here, we describe gastrointestinal problems in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice. FMRP deficiency causes intestinal homeostasis dysfunction in mice. Fish oil (FO) as a source of omega-3 PUFAs reduces intestinal inflammation but increases the mRNA and protein levels of TJP3 in the colon of juvenile Fmr1 KO mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation from FO-fed Fmr1 KO mice increased the gut abundance of Akkermansia and Gordonibacter in recipient Fmr1 KO mice and improved gut homeostasis and autistic behaviors. Our findings demonstrate that omega-3 PUFAs improve autistic behaviors and gut homeostasis in FMRP-deficient mice by suppressing gut microbiota dysbiosis, thereby presenting a novel therapeutic approach for juvenile FXS treatment."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the most common inherited mental retardation diseases and is caused by the loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression. The metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) theory of FXS states that enhanced mGluR-dependent long-term depression (LTD) due to FMRP loss is involved in aberrant synaptic plasticity and autistic-like behaviors, but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism. Here, we found that only hippocampal mGluR-LTD was exaggerated in adolescent Fmr1 KO mice, while N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-LTD was intact in mice of all ages. This development-dependent alteration was related to the differential expression of caveolin-1 (Cav1), which is essential for caveolae formation. Knockdown of Cav1 restored the enhanced mGluR-LTD in Fmr1 KO mice. Moreover, hippocampal Cav1 expression in Fmr1 KO mice induced excessive endocytosis of the α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor subunit GluA2. This process relied on mGluR1/5 activation rather than NMDAR. Interference with Cav1 expression reversed these changes. Furthermore, massive cholesterol accumulation contributed to redundant caveolae formation, which provided the platform for mGluR-triggered Cav1 coupling to GluA2. Importantly, injection of the cholesterol scavenger methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Mβ-CD) recovered AMPA receptor trafficking and markedly alleviated hyperactivity, hippocampus-dependent fear memory, and spatial memory defects in Fmr1 KO mice. Together, our findings elucidate the important role of Cav1 in mediating mGluR-LTD enhancement and further inducing AMPA receptor endocytosis and suggest that cholesterol depletion by Mβ-CD during caveolae formation may be a novel and safe strategy to treat FXS."

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication along with repetitive stereotypic behaviors. Currently, there are no specific biomarkers for diagnostic screening or treatments available for autistic patients. Numerous genetic disorders are associated with high prevalence of ASD, including tuberous sclerosis complex, phosphatase and tensin homolog, and fragile X syndrome. Preclinical investigations in animal models of these diseases have revealed irregularities in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway as well as ASD-related behavioral defects. Reversal of the downstream molecular irregularities, associated with mTOR hyperactivation, improved the behavioral deficits observed in the preclinical investigations. Plant bioactive molecules have shown beneficial pre-clinical evidence in ASD treatment by modulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. In this review, we summarize the involvement of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway as well as the genetic alterations of the pathway components and its critical impact on the development of the autism spectrum disorder. Mutations in negative regulators of mTORC1, such as TSC1, TSC2, and PTEN, result in ASD-like phenotypes through the disruption of the mTORC1-mediated signaling. We further discuss the various naturally occurring phytoconstituents that have been identified to be bioactive and modulate the pathway to prevent its disruption and contribute to beneficial therapeutic effects in ASD."

BK channels are abundantly expressed throughout the brain and in different compartments within a single neuron, including axons, synaptic terminals, dendritic arbors, and spines.

Together with their ability to detect changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, BK channels control neuronal excitability and synaptic communication through diverse mechanisms. Moreover, increasing evidence indicates that dysfunction of BK channel-mediated effects on neuronal excitability and synaptic function has been implicated in several neurological disorders, including epilepsy, fragile X syndrome, mental retardation, and autism, as well as in motor and cognitive behavior. Here, we discuss current evidence highlighting the physiological importance of this ubiquitous channel in regulating brain function and its role in the pathophysiology of different neurological disorders."

Gene therapy may offer an efficient method to ameliorate the symptoms of this disorder. Methods An AAVphp.eb-hSyn-mFMR1IOS7 vector and an empty control were injected into the tail vein of adult <i>Fmr1</i> knockout (KO) mice and wildtype (WT) controls. The KO mice were injected with 2 × 10<sup>13</sup> vg/kg of the construct. The control KO and WT mice were injected with an empty vector. Four weeks following treatment, the animals underwent a battery of tests: open field, marble burying, rotarod, and fear conditioning. The mouse brains were studied for levels of the <i>Fmr1</i> product FMRP. Results: No significant levels of FMRP were found outside the CNS in the treated animals. The gene delivery was highly efficient, and it exceeded the control FMRP levels in all tested brain regions. There was also improved performance in the rotarod test and partial improvements in the other tests in the treated KO animals. Conclusion: These experiments demonstrate efficient, brain-specific delivery of <i>Fmr1</i> via peripheral administration in adult mice. The gene delivery led to partial alleviation of the <i>Fmr1</i> KO phenotypical behaviors. FMRP oversupply may explain why not all behaviors were significantly affected. Since AAV.php vectors are less efficient in humans than in the mice used in the current experiment, studies to determine the optimal dose using human-suitable vectors will be necessary to further demonstrate feasibility."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is rare genetic condition characterized by a repeat expansion (CGG) in the Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene where individuals with greater than 200 repeats are defined as full mutation. FXS clinical presentation often includes intellectual disability, and autism-like symptoms, including anxiety and sensory hypersensitivities. Individuals with 55 to <200 CGG repeats are said to have the FMR1 premutation, which is not associated with primary characteristics of the full mutation, but with an increased risk for anxiety, depression, and other affective conditions, as well as and impaired cognitive processing differences that vary in severity. Defining subgroups of premutation carriers based on distinct biological features may identify subgroups with varying levels of psychiatric, cognitive, and behavioral alterations. The current pilot study utilized 3 cluster subgroupings defined by previous k means cluster analysis on neuropsychiatric, cognitive, and resting EEG variables in order to examine basic sensory auditory chirp task-based EEG parameters from 33 females with the FMR1 premutation (ages 17-78). Based on the predefined, neuropsychiatric three-cluster solution, premutation carriers with increased neuropsychiatric features and higher CGG repeat counts (cluster 1) showed decreased stimulus onset response, similar to previous ERP findings across a number of psychiatric disorders but opposite to findings in individuals with full mutation FXS. Premutation carriers with increased executive dysfunction and resting gamma power (cluster 2) exhibited decreased gamma phase locking to a chirp stimulus, similar to individuals with full mutation FXS. Cluster 3 members, who were relatively unaffected by psychiatric or cognitive symptoms, showed the most normative task-based EEG metrics. Our findings suggest a spectrum of sensory processing characteristics present in subgroups of premutation carriers that have been previously understudied due to lack of overall group differences. Our findings also further validate the pre-defined clinical subgroups by supporting links between disturbances in well-defined neural pathways and behavioral alterations that may be informative for identifying the mechanisms supporting specific risk factors and divergent therapeutic needs in individuals with the FMR1 premutation."

    "title": "Characterization of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein expression in human nociceptors and their axonal projections to the spinal dorsal horn.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) regulates activity-dependent RNA localization and local translation to modulate synaptic plasticity throughout the central nervous system. Mutations in the FMR1 gene that hinder or ablate FMRP function cause Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), a disorder associated with sensory processing dysfunction. FXS premutations are associated with increased FMRP expression and neurological impairments including sex dimorphic presentations of chronic pain. In mice, FMRP ablation causes dysregulated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron excitability and synaptic vesicle exocytosis, spinal circuit activity, and decreased translation-dependent nociceptive sensitization. Activity-dependent, local translation is a key mechanism for enhancing primary nociceptor excitability that promotes pain in animals and humans. These works indicate that FMRP likely regulates nociception and pain at the level of the primary nociceptor or spinal cord. Therefore, we sought to better understand FMRP expression in the human DRG and spinal cord using immunostaining in organ donor tissues. We find that FMRP is highly expressed in DRG and spinal neuron subsets with substantia gelatinosa exhibiting the most abundant immunoreactivity in spinal synaptic fields. Here, it is expressed in nociceptor axons. FMRP puncta colocalized with Nav1.7 and TRPV1 receptor signals suggesting a pool of axoplasmic FMRP localizes to plasma membrane-associated loci in these branches. Interestingly, FMRP puncta exhibited notable colocalization with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity selectively in female spinal cord. Our results support a regulatory role for FMRP in human nociceptor axons of the dorsal horn and implicate it in the sex dimorphic actions of CGRP signaling in nociceptive sensitization and chronic pain."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of population-based, expanded reproductive carrier screening (RCS) for a 300 recessive gene panel from health service and societal perspectives. A microsimulation model (PreConMod) was developed using 2016 Australian Census data as the base population. Epidemiologic, health, and indirect cost data were based on literature review. The study assessed the incremental cost effectiveness ratio of expanded RCS compared with (1) no population screening and (2) 3-condition screening for cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and fragile X syndrome in a single birth cohort. Averted affected births and health service savings with expanded RCS were projected to year 2061. Both one-way and probability sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainty of the parameter inputs. Expanded RCS was cost saving compared with no population screening and cost effective compared with the 3-condition screening (incremental cost effectiveness ratio of Australian dollar [AUD] 6287 per quality-adjusted life year gained) at an uptake rate of 50% for RCS, 59% for in vitro fertilization and preimplantation genetic testing, 90% for prenatal diagnosis testing, and 50% for elective termination of affected pregnancies and a cost of AUD595 per couple screened. Our model predicts that expanded RCS would avert one-third of affected births in a single birth cohort and reduce lifetime health service spending by AUD632.0 million. Expanded RCS was estimated to be cost saving from the societal perspective. Expanded RCS is cost effective from health service and societal perspectives. Expanded RCS is projected to avert significantly more affected births and result in health service saving beyond those expected from 3-condition screening or no population screening."

    "abstract": "This study examined relationships among family characteristics, caregiver change in use of strategies, and child growth in spoken language over the course of a parent-implemented language intervention (PILI) that was developed to address some of the challenges associated with the fragile X syndrome (FXS) phenotype. Participants were 43 parent-child dyads from two different PILI studies, both of which taught parents various language facilitation strategies to support child language. Before starting the intervention, parents reported on their mental health, parenting stress, and parenting competence. This study focused on potential barriers to treatment gains by examining correlations between the measures of parent well-being and (a) parent change in use of intervention strategies taught in the PILI and (b) changes in child language outcomes from preto post-intervention. Parents in this study had elevated mental health symptoms across several domains and increased rates of parenting stress. Furthermore, although PILI resulted in treatment gains for both parents and children, a variety of parent mental health symptoms were found to be significantly and negatively associated with change in use of strategies and growth in child language over the course of the intervention. Some inconsistent findings also emerged regarding the relationships between parenting stress and competence and change in parent strategy use and growth in child language. This study provides preliminary evidence that parents who are experiencing significant mental health challenges may have a more difficult time participating fully in PILIs and that there may be subsequent effects on child outcomes. Future PILIs could benefit from addressing parent well-being as a substantial part of the intervention program."

    "abstract": "Outwardly directed aggressive behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities is a significant issue that may lead to poor quality of life, social exclusion and inpatient psychiatric admissions. Cognitive and behavioural approaches have been developed to manage aggressive behaviour but the effectiveness of these interventions on reducing aggressive behaviour and other outcomes are unclear. This is the third update of this review and adds nine new studies, resulting in a total of 15 studies in this review. To evaluate the efficacy of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions on outwardly directed aggressive behaviour compared to usual care, wait-list controls or no treatment in people with intellectual disability. We also evaluated enhanced interventions compared to non-enhanced interventions. We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was March 2022. We revised the search terms to include positive behaviour support (PBS). We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials of children and adults with intellectual disability of any duration, setting and any eligible comparator. We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were change in 1. aggressive behaviour, 2. ability to control anger, and 3. adaptive functioning, and 4. Our secondary outcomes were change in 5. mental state, 6. medication, 7. care needs and 8. quality of life, and 9. frequency of service utilisation and 10. user satisfaction data. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. We expressed treatment effects as mean differences (MD) or odds ratios (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, we pooled data using a fixed-effect model. This updated version comprises nine new studies giving 15 included studies and 921 participants. The update also adds new interventions including parent training (two studies), mindfulness-based positive behaviour support (MBPBS) (two studies), reciprocal imitation training (RIT; one study) and dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT; one study). It also adds two new studies on PBS. Most studies were based in the community (14 studies), and one was in an inpatient forensic service. Eleven studies involved adults only. The remaining studies involved children (one study), children and adolescents (one study), adolescents (one study), and adolescents and adults (one study). One study included boys with fragile X syndrome. Six studies were conducted in the UK, seven in the USA, one in Canada and one in Germany. Only five studies described sources of funding. Four studies compared anger management based on cognitive behaviour therapy to a wait-list or no treatment control group (n = 263); two studies compared PBS with treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 308); two studies compared carer training on mindfulness and PBS with PBS only (n = 128); two studies involving parent training on behavioural approaches compared to wait-list control or TAU (n = 99); one study of mindfulness to a wait-list control (n = 34); one study of adapted dialectal behavioural therapy compared to wait-list control (n = 21); one study of RIT compared to an active control (n = 20) and one study of modified relaxation compared to an active control group (n = 12). There was moderate-certainty evidence that anger management may improve severity of aggressive behaviour post-treatment (MD -3.50, 95% CI -6.21 to -0.79; P = 0.01; 1 study, 158 participants); very low-certainty evidence that it might improve self-reported ability to control anger (MD -8.38, 95% CI -14.05 to -2.71; P = 0.004, I<sup>2</sup> = 2%; 3 studies, 212 participants), adaptive functioning (MD -21.73, 95% CI -36.44 to -7.02; P = 0.004; 1 study, 28 participants) and psychiatric symptoms (MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.17; P = 0.002; 1 study, 28 participants) post-treatment; and very low-certainty evidence that it does not improve quality of life post-treatment (MD -5.60, 95% CI -18.11 to 6.91; P = 0.38; 1 study, 129 participants) or reduce service utilisation and costs at 10 months (MD 102.99 British pounds, 95% CI -117.16 to 323.14; P = 0.36; 1 study, 133 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence that PBS may reduce aggressive behaviour post-treatment (MD -7.78, 95% CI -15.23 to -0.32; P = 0.04, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 275 participants) and low-certainty evidence that it probably does not reduce aggressive behaviour at 12 months (MD -5.20, 95% CI -13.27 to 2.87; P = 0.21; 1 study, 225 participants). There was low-certainty evidence that PBS does not improve mental state post-treatment (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.49; P = 1.21; 1 study, 214 participants) and very low-certainty evidence that it might not reduce service utilisation at 12 months (MD -448.00 British pounds, 95% CI -1660.83 to 764.83; P = 0.47; 1 study, 225 participants). There was very low-certainty evidence that mindfulness may reduce incidents of physical aggression (MD -2.80, 95% CI -4.37 to -1.23; P < 0.001; 1 study; 34 participants) and low-certainty evidence that MBPBS may reduce incidents of aggression post-treatment (MD -10.27, 95% CI -14.86 to -5.67; P < 0.001, I<sup>2</sup> = 87%; 2 studies, 128 participants). Reasons for downgrading the certainty of evidence were risk of bias (particularly selection and performance bias); imprecision (results from single, often small studies, wide CIs, and CIs crossing the null effect); and inconsistency (statistical heterogeneity). There is moderate-certainty evidence that cognitive-behavioural approaches such as anger management and PBS may reduce outwardly directed aggressive behaviour in the short term but there is less certainty about the evidence in the medium and long term, particularly in relation to other outcomes such as quality of life. There is some evidence to suggest that combining more than one intervention may have cumulative benefits. Most studies were small and there is a need for larger, robust randomised controlled trials, particularly for interventions where the certainty of evidence is very low. More trials are needed that focus on children and whether psychological interventions lead to reductions in the use of psychotropic medications."

    "abstract": "The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a proteolytic pathway that is essential for life maintenance and vital functions, and its disruption causes serious impairments, e.g., disease development. Thus, the UPS is properly regulated. Here we show novel UPS-related factors: the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) and Fmr1 autosomal homolog 1 (FXR1) proteins and discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 4 (Dlg4) mRNA, which are associated with Fragile X syndrome, are involved in UPS activity. Fmr1-, Fxr1- and Dlg4-knockdown and Fmr1- and Fxr1-knockdown resulted in increased ubiquitination and proteasome activity, respectively. FXR1 protein was further confirmed to be associated with proteasomes, and Dlg4 mRNA itself was found to be involved in the UPS. Knockdown of these genes also affected neurite outgrowth. These findings provide new insights into the regulatory mechanism of the UPS and into the interpretation of the pathogenesis of diseases in which these genes are involved as UPS-related factors."

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a persistent impairment of social skills, including aspects of perception, interpretation, and response, combined with restricted and repetitive behavior. ASD is a complex and multifactorial condition, and its etiology could be attributed to genetic and environmental factors. Despite numerous clinical and experimental studies, no etiological factor, biomarker, and specific model of transmission have been consistently associated with ASD. However, an imbalance in cholesterol levels has been observed in many patients, more specifically, a condition of hypocholesterolemia, which seems to be shared between ASD and ASD-related genetic syndromes such as fragile X syndrome (FXS), Rett syndrome (RS), and Smith- Lemli-Opitz (SLO). Furthermore, it is known that alterations in cholesterol levels lead to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, impaired myelination and synaptogenesis. Thus, the aim of this review is to discuss the cholesterol metabolic pathways in the ASD context, as well as in genetic syndromes related to ASD, through clinical observations and animal models. In fact, SLO, FXS, and RS patients display early behavioral markers of ASD followed by cholesterol disturbances. Several studies have demonstrated the role of cholesterol in psychiatric conditions and how its levels modulate brain neurodevelopment. This review suggests an important relationship between ASD pathology and cholesterol metabolism impairment; thus, some strategies could be raised - at clinical and pre-clinical levels - to explore whether cholesterol metabolism disturbance has a generally adverse effect in exacerbating the symptoms of ASD patients."

Hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli contributes to attention difficulties by overwhelming and/or distracting affected individuals, which disrupts activities of daily living at home and learning at school. We find that auditory or visual distractors selectively impair visual discrimination performance in both humans and mice with FXS, but not their typically developing controls. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) neurons were significantly modulated by incorrect responses in the post-stimulus period during early distractor trials in WT mice, consistent with their known role as 'error' signals. Strikingly, however, VIP cells from <i>Fmr1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed little modulation in error trials, and this correlated with their poor performance on the distractor task. Thus, VIP interneurons and their reduced modulatory influence on pyramidal cells, could be a potential therapeutic target for attentional difficulties in FXS."

We conducted a postmortem MRI study of FXTAS to quantify cerebrovascular disease, brain atrophy, and iron content and examined their relationships using principal component analysis (PCA). Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was observed in 4/17 FXTAS cases among which one was confirmed by histologic staining. Compared with seven control brains, FXTAS cases showed higher ratings of T2-hyperintensities (indicating cerebral small vessel disease) in the cerebellum, globus pallidus, and frontoparietal white matter and significant atrophy in cerebellar white matter, red nucleus, and dentate nucleus. PCA of FXTAS cases revealed negative associations of T2-hyperintensity ratings with anatomic volumes and iron content in the white matter, hippocampus, and amygdala, that were independent from highly correlated number of regions with ICH and iron content in subcortical nuclei. Post hoc analysis confirmed PCA findings and further revealed increased iron content in the white matter, hippocampus, and amygdala in FXTAS cases than controls after adjusting for T2-hyperintensity ratings. These findings indicate that both ischemic and hemorrhagic brain damage may occur in FXTAS, with the former marked by demyelination/iron depletion and atrophy and the latter, ICH and iron accumulation in basal ganglia."

    "abstract": "Social touch, an important aspect of social interaction and communication, is essential to kinship across animal species. How animals experience and respond to social touch has not been thoroughly investigated, in part due to the lack of appropriate assays. Previous studies that examined social touch in freely moving rodents lacked the necessary temporal and spatial control over individual touch interactions. We designed a novel head-fixed assay for social touch in mice, in which the experimenter has complete control to elicit highly stereotyped bouts of social touch between two animals. The user determines the number, duration, context, and type of social touch interactions, while monitoring with high frame rate cameras an array of complex behavioral responses. We focused on social touch to the face because of their high translational relevance to humans. We validated this assay in two different models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the <i>Fmr1</i> knockout model of Fragile X Syndrome and maternal immune activation mice. We observed increased avoidance, hyperarousal, and more aversive facial expressions to social touch, but not to object touch, in both ASD models compared to controls. Because this new social touch assay for head-fixed mice can be used to record neural activity during repeated bouts of social touch it should be of interest to neuroscientists interested in uncovering the underlying circuits."

    "abstract": "Males with fragile X syndrome (FXS) may have difficulty with social communication and language in addition to behavioral concerns such as noncompliance to maternal requests. Mothers vary in how they pose requests to their children, and contextual demands may also be a factor in compliance. This study examined the relationships between maternal requesting behaviors, maternal responsivity, child compliance, and task demands in adolescent males with FXS. 35 mother-son dyads completed three interactive tasks during in-home visits (puzzle, iPad games, snack). The adolescents also completed assessments of language and autism symptoms. The three interactive tasks were video-recorded, and behavior-by-behavior coding and transcription was completed. Comparing between tasks, mothers requested a behavior most often during the snack task and used a higher proportion of indirect requests during the iPad task. Adolescents were largely compliant across tasks, with average compliance equal to 70%. Adolescent compliance was predicted by maternal request frequency such that mothers who used more requests had adolescent sons who were less compliant. Maternal responsivity was higher for mothers of adolescents with FXS-only compared to those with FXS and high autism symptoms. Task demands may have influenced maternal requesting, which in turn may have impacted adolescent compliance. Compliance with requests is important for both social and educational aspects of life, and further study of requesting and compliance in FXS is needed to identify effective teaching and behavioral intervention methods."

In Drosophila disease models, we find both SHP2 mutations from human patients and corkscrew (csw) homolog LoF/GoF elevate glutamatergic transmission. Cell-targeted RNAi and neurotransmitter release analyses reveal a presynaptic requirement. Consistently, all mutants exhibit reduced synaptic depression during high-frequency stimulation. Both LoF and GoF mutants also show impaired synaptic plasticity, including reduced facilitation, augmentation, and post-tetanic potentiation. NS/NSML diseases are characterized by elevated MAPK/ERK signaling, and drugs suppressing this signaling restore normal neurotransmission in mutants. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is likewise characterized by elevated MAPK/ERK signaling. Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) binds csw mRNA and neuronal Csw protein is elevated in Drosophila fragile X mental retardation 1 (dfmr1) nulls. Moreover, phosphorylated ERK (pERK) is increased in dfmr1 and csw null presynaptic boutons. We find presynaptic pERK activation in response to stimulation is reduced in dfmr1 and csw nulls. Trans-heterozygous csw/+; dfmr1/+ recapitulate elevated presynaptic pERK activation and function, showing FMRP and Csw/SHP2 act within the same signaling pathway. Thus, a FMRP and SHP2 MAPK/ERK regulative mechanism controls basal and activity-dependent neurotransmission strength."

Two categories of pathological CGG repeats are associated with these disorders, full mutation alleles and shorter premutation alleles. Individuals with full mutation alleles develop fragile X syndrome, which causes autism and intellectual disability, whereas those with premutation alleles, which have shorter CGG expansions, can develop fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Thus, fragile X-related disorders can manifest as neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental disorders, depending on the size of the repeat expansion. Here, we review mouse models of fragile X-related disorders and discuss how they have informed our understanding of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders.

A small microduplication of 448.8 Kb containing only two genes was recently described in a patient with a 3q29 microduplication that was proposed as the minimal critical region of overlap of this syndrome. Molecular karyotyping (array-CGH) was performed on DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples using Agilent-California USA Human Genome CGH Microarray 4 × 180 K. The proband and his younger brother were further tested with a next generation sequencing (NGS) panel including genes implicated in autism spectrum disorder and in neurodevelopmental disorders. Quantitative real-time PCR was applied to verify the abnormal array-CGH findings. Here, we report on a family with two males with neurodevelopmental disorders and an unaffected sibling with a small 3q29 microduplication (432.8 Kb) inherited from an unaffected mother that involves only two genes: DGL1 and BDH1. The proband had an additional intragenic duplication inherited from the unaffected father. Further testing was negative for Fragile X syndrome and for genes implicated in autism spectrum disorder and in neurodevelopmental disorders. To the best of our knowledge, one of the family members here analyzed is the second reported case of a patient carrying a small 3q29 microduplication including only DGL1 and BDH1 genes and without any additional genetic aberration. The recognition of the clinical spectrum in patients with the critical region of overlap associated with the 3q29 duplication syndrome should prove valuable for predicting outcomes and providing more informed genetic counseling to patients with duplications in this region."

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the molecular functions of the nucleocytoplasmic FMRP protein, which, if absent or dysfunctional, causes the fragile X syndrome (FXS), largely revolves around its involvement in protein translation regulation in the cytoplasm. Recent studies have begun honing in on the nuclear and genomic functions of FMRP. We have shown that during DNA replication stress, cells derived from FXS patients sustain increased level of R-loop formation and DNA double strand breaks. Here, we describe a transcriptomic analysis of these cells in order to identify those genes most impacted by the loss of FMRP with and without replication stress. We show that FMRP loss causes transcriptomic changes previously reported in untreated conditions. Importantly, we also show that replication stress, in addition to causing excess of DSB, results in down-regulation of transcription in virtually all DNA repair pathways. This finding suggests that despite normal DNA damage response, FXS patient-derived cells experience R-loop-induced DNA breakage as well as impaired DNA repair functions, effectively a double jeopardy. We suggest that it is imperative to deepen the understanding of the nuclear functions, particularly a genome protective function, of FMRP, which will lead to discoveries of novel therapeutic interventions for the FXS."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a monogenic condition that leads to intellectual disability along with behavioral and learning difficulties. Among behavioral and learning difficulties, cognitive flexibility impairments are among the most commonly reported in FXS, which significantly impacts daily living. Despite the extensive use of the <i>Fmr1</i> knockout (KO) mouse to understand molecular, synaptic and behavioral alterations related to FXS, there has been limited development of translational paradigms to understand cognitive flexibility that can be employed in both animal models and individuals with FXS to facilitate treatment development. To begin addressing this limitation, a parallel set of studies were carried out that investigated probabilistic reversal learning along with other behavioral and cognitive tests in individuals with FXS and <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. Fifty-five adolescents and adults with FXS (67% male) and 34 age- and sex-matched typically developing controls (62% male) completed an initial probabilistic learning training task and a probabilistic reversal learning task. In males with FXS, both initial probabilistic learning and reversal learning deficits were found. However, in females with FXS, we only observed reversal learning deficits. Reversal learning deficits related to more severe psychiatric features in females with FXS, whereas increased sensitivity to negative feedback (lose:shift errors) unexpectedly appear to be adaptive in males with FXS. Male <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice exhibited both an initial probabilistic learning and reversal learning deficit compared to that of wildtype (WT) mice. Female <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice were selectively impaired on probabilistic reversal learning. In a prepotent response inhibition test, both male and female <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice were impaired in learning to choose a non-preferred spatial location to receive a food reward compared to that of WT mice. Neither male nor female <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice exhibited a change in anxiety compared to that of WT mice. Together, our findings demonstrate strikingly similar sex-dependent learning disturbances across individuals with FXS and <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. This suggests the promise of using analogous paradigms of cognitive flexibility across species that may speed treatment development to improve lives of individuals with FXS."

FXS patients exhibit severe syndromic features and behavioral alterations, including anxiety, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and aggression, in addition to cognitive impairment and seizures. At present, there are no effective treatments or cures for FXS. Previously, we have found the divergence of BDNF-TrkB signaling trajectories is associated with spine defects in early postnatal developmental stages of Fmr1 KO mice. Here, young fragile X mice were intraperitoneal injection with 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a high affinity tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) agonist. 7,8-DHF ameliorated morphological abnormities in dendritic spine and synaptic structure and rescued synaptic and hippocampus-dependent cognitive dysfunction. These observed improvements of 7,8-DHF involved decreased protein levels of BDNF, p-TrkB<sup>Y816</sup>, p-PLCγ, and p-CaMKII in the hippocampus. In addition, 7,8-DHF intervention in primary hippocampal neurons increased p-TrkB<sup>Y816</sup> and activated the PLCγ1-CaMKII signaling pathway, leading to improvement of neuronal morphology. This study is the first to account for early life synaptic impairments, neuronal morphological, and cognitive delays in FXS in response to the abnormal BDNF-TrkB pathway. Present studies provide novel evidences about the effective early intervention in FXS mice at developmental stages and a strategy to produce powerful impacts on neural development, synaptic plasticity, and behaviors."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a global neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the expansion of CGG trinucleotide repeats (≥200) in the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (<i>FMR1</i>) gene. FXS is the hallmark of Fragile X-associated disorders (FXD) and the most common monogenic cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. There are several animal models used to study FXS. In the FXS model of <i>Drosophila</i>, the only ortholog of <i>FMR1</i>, <i>dfmr1</i>, is mutated so that its protein is missing. This model has several relevant phenotypes, including defects in the circadian output pathway, sleep problems, memory deficits in the conditioned courtship and olfactory conditioning paradigms, deficits in social interaction, and deficits in neuronal development. In addition to FXS, a model of another FXD, Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), has also been established in <i>Drosophila.</i> This review summarizes many years of research on FXD in <i>Drosophila</i> models."

    "abstract": "While whole genome sequencing and long-read sequencing have become widely available, more and more focuses are on noncoding expanded repeats. Indeed, more than half of noncoding repeat expansions related to diseases have been identified in the five years. An exciting aspect of the progress in this field is an identification of a phenomenon called repeat motif-phenotype correlation. Repeat motif-phenotype correlation in noncoding repeat expansion diseases is first found in benign adult familial myoclonus epilepsy. The concept is extended in the research of CGG repeat expansion diseases. In this review, we focus on newly identified CGG repeat expansion diseases, update the concept of repeat motif-phenotype correlation in CGG repeat expansion diseases, and propose a clinical concept of FNOP (fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease, and oculopharyngodistal myopathy)-spectrum disorder, which shares clinical features and thus probably share some common disease pathophysiology, to further facilitate discussion and progress in this field."

    "title": "The comparison of expressed emotion of parents of individuals with fragile X syndrome to other intellectual disabilities.",
    "abstract": "Parenting children and young adults with intellectual disabilities, including individuals with fragile X syndrome and Down syndrome, is challenging, joyful, and complicated. Exploring how parents talk about their children, and the quality of the parent/child relationship can provide insight into the home environment and interactional patterns of the family. Expressed emotion (EE) is a measurement of a family's emotional climate based on a parent or caregiver's report of warmth, emotional overinvolvement, hostility, and criticism. The purpose of this study was to describe EE for a sample of parents of individuals with intellectual disabilities and to determine any differences in EE amongst individuals within subgroups. Based on previous research about fragile X syndrome and family systems, we hypothesized that there would be significant differences between the disability groups (higher EE in families with children/young adults with fragile X syndrome). Results showed relatively high proportions of EE across groups of individuals with intellectual disabilities, however, there were no significant differences between the subgroups. Null findings suggest that differences in EE may not relate directly to a child's specific genetic condition. Rather, increased EE in caregiver populations may simply reflect well-documented stressors related to stigma, caregiver burden, and limited community supports. Critical statements were infrequent, however, over half of the participants reported dissatisfaction with their situation, and many were categorized as having emotional overinvolvement, as measured by frequent statements of intense worry and self-sacrifice. Findings point to potential utility in family-level interventions focused on providing structured caregiver therapy to manage excessive worry and grief related to a diagnosis of intellectual disability, and respite care to encourage caregiver independence and pursuit of personal care."

    "abstract": "Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) deficit resulted from mutations in its encoded fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) gene is a common inherited cause of Fragile X syndrome (FXS) characterized by intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The FMRP absence-induced altered gene expression in prefrontal cortex (PFC) are associated with autistic behaviors. However, there lacks a large-scale protein profiling in the PFC upon loss of FMRP. This study used a TMT-labeled proteomic analysis to identify a protein profile of the PFC in the Fmr1 knockout mouse. A total of 5886 proteins were identified in the PFC with 100 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in response to FMRP deficiency. Bioinformatical analyses showed that these DAPs were mostly enriched in immune system, extracellular part and complement and coagulation cascades. The complement and coagulation cascades include 6 upregulated proteins (SERPING1, C1QA, C3, FGA, FGB and FGG), which are associated with fibrin degradation, cell lysis, degranulation chemotaxis and phagocytosis linked to activation of immune and inflammatory responses. Thus, our data provide an altered protein profile upon loss of FMRP in the PFC, and suggest that the enhancement of complement and coagulation cascades might contribute to etiological and pathogenic roles of ASD in FXS. SIGNIFICANCE: The etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a group of neurobiological disorders characterized by deficits in social interaction barriers and other abnormal behaviors, is still elusive. Autistic-like phenotypes are present in both Fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients and FMRP-deficiency FXS models. Given that prefrontal cortex is a critical brain area for social interaction, the FMRP absence induced-changes of a subset of proteins might contribute to ASD in FXS. Using a comprehensive proteomic analysis, this study provides a prefrontal protein profile of the FMRP-absent mouse with a total of 100 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). Bioinformatic analyses suggest that these DAPs are mainly involved in the regulations of immune system and complement and coagulation cascades. We also show that 6 upregulated proteins (SERPING1, C1QA, C3, FGA, FGB and FGG) in the complement and coagulation cascades are associated with fibrin degradation, cell lysis, degranulation chemotaxis and phagocytosis regarding dysregulation of immune and inflammatory responses in the prefrontal cortex. Therefore, this study suggests that these FMRP-deficient DAPs in the prefrontal cortex might contribute to the etiology and pathogenesis of ASD in FXS."

    "abstract": "Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) is a conserved central intracellular signaling cascade involved in many aspects of neuronal development and plasticity. Converging evidence support investigation of ERK1/2 activity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We previously reported enhanced baseline lymphocytic ERK1/2 activation in autism, and now we extend our work to investigate the early phase kinetics of lymphocytic ERK1/2 activation in idiopathic ASD. Study participants included 67 individuals with ASD (3-25 years of age), 65 age- and sex-matched typical developing control (TDC) subjects, and 36 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched developmental disability control (DDC) subjects matched to those with ASD and IQ <90. We completed an additional analysis comparing results from ASD, TDC, and DDC groups with data from 37 individuals with Fragile X syndrome (FXS). All subjects had blood lymphocyte samples analyzed by flow cytometry following stimulation with phorbol ester and sequentially analyzed for ERK1/2 activation (phosphorylation) at several time points. The ASD group (mean = 5.81 minutes; SD = 1.5) had a significantly lower (more rapid) mean ERK1/2 T<sub>1/2</sub> activation value than both the DDC group (mean = 6.78 minutes; SD = 1.6; p = .00078) and the TDC group (mean = 6.4 minutes; SD = 1.5; p = .025). More rapid ERK1/2 T<sub>1/2</sub> activation times did correlate with increased social impairment across all study groups including the ASD cohort. Differences in ERK1/2 T<sub>1/2</sub> activation were more pronounced in younger than in older individuals in the primary analysis. The ASD group additionally had more rapid activation times than the FXS group, and the FXS group activation kinetics did not differ from those of the TDC and DDC groups. Our findings indicate that lymphocytic ERK1/2 activation kinetics are dysregulated in persons with ASD, marked by more rapid early phase activation. Group differences in ERK1/2 activation kinetics appear to be driven by findings from the youngest children analyzed. We worked to ensure sex and gender balance in the recruitment of human participants. We actively worked to promote sex and gender balance in our author group.

    "title": "Impaired dendritic spike generation in the Fragile X prefrontal cortex is due to loss of dendritic sodium channels.",
    "abstract": "Patients with Fragile X syndrome, the leading monogenetic cause of autism, suffer from impairments related to the prefrontal cortex, including working memory and attention. Synaptic inputs to the distal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex have a weak influence on the somatic membrane potential. To overcome this filtering, distal inputs are transformed into local dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes, which propagate to the soma and trigger action potential output. Layer 5 extratelencephalic (ET) prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons project to the brainstem and various thalamic nuclei and are therefore well positioned to integrate task-relevant sensory signals and guide motor actions. We used current clamp and outside-out patch clamp recording to investigate dendritic spike generation in ET neurons from male wild-type and Fmr1 knockout (FX) mice. The threshold for dendritic spikes was more depolarized in FX neurons compared to wild-type. Analysis of voltage responses to simulated in vivo 'noisy' current injections showed that a larger dendritic input stimulus was required to elicit dendritic spikes in FX ET dendrites compared to wild-type. Patch clamp recordings revealed that the dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> conductance was significantly smaller in FX ET dendrites. Taken together, our results suggest that the generation of Na<sup>+</sup> -dependent dendritic spikes is impaired in ET neurons of the PFC in FX mice. Considering our prior findings that somatic D-type K<sup>+</sup> and dendritic hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated-channel function is reduced in ET neurons, we suggest that dendritic integration by PFC circuits is fundamentally altered in Fragile X syndrome. KEY POINTS: Dendritic spike threshold is depolarized in layer 5 prefrontal cortex neurons in Fmr1 knockout (FX) mice. Simultaneous somatic and dendritic recording with white noise current injections revealed that larger dendritic stimuli were required to elicit dendritic spikes in FX extratelencephalic (ET) neurons. Outside-out patch clamp recording revealed that dendritic sodium conductance density was lower in FX ET neurons."

    "title": "Role of the endocannabinoid system in fragile X syndrome: potential mechanisms for benefit from cannabidiol treatment.",
    "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence suggest a central role for the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in the neuronal development and cognitive function and in the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome (FXS). This review describes the ECS, its role in the central nervous system, how it is dysregulated in FXS, and the potential role of cannabidiol as a treatment for FXS. FXS is caused by deficiency or absence of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) protein, FMRP, typically due to the presence of >200 cytosine, guanine, guanine sequence repeats leading to methylation of the FMR1 gene promoter. The absence of FMRP, following FMR1 gene-silencing, disrupts ECS signaling, which has been implicated in FXS pathogenesis. The ECS facilitates synaptic homeostasis and plasticity through the cannabinoid receptor 1, CB<sub>1</sub>, on presynaptic terminals, resulting in feedback inhibition of neuronal signaling. ECS-mediated feedback inhibition and synaptic plasticity are thought to be disrupted in FXS, leading to overstimulation, desensitization, and internalization of presynaptic CB<sub>1</sub> receptors. Cannabidiol may help restore synaptic homeostasis by acting as a negative allosteric modulator of CB<sub>1</sub>, thereby attenuating the receptor overstimulation, desensitization, and internalization. Moreover, cannabidiol affects DNA methylation, serotonin 5HT<sub>1A</sub> signal transduction, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor signaling, and dopamine D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptor signaling, which may contribute to beneficial effects in patients with FXS. Consistent with these proposed mechanisms of action of cannabidiol in FXS, in the CONNECT-FX trial the transdermal cannabidiol gel, ZYN002, was associated with improvements in measures of social avoidance, irritability, and social interaction, particularly in patients who are most affected, showing ≥90% methylation of the FMR1 gene."

    "abstract": "Expressive language impairments are common among school-age boys with fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autistic boys. Given the high co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among individuals with FXS, cross-condition comparisons can elucidate the specificity of such impairments as they relate to ASD. Language samples can provide fruitful information regarding individuals' grammatical skills in less structured formats relative to standardized measures. This study examined grammatical errors produced during a conversational language sample among 20 boys with FXS and co-occurring ASD (FXS + ASD) and 19 autistic boys matched on ASD severity. Language samples were coded for omissions and errors at the word and utterance levels. Participants' grammatical errors were also compared to separate mental age-matched and mean length of utterance-matched boys from a reference database. Boys with FXS + ASD and autistic boys produced similar rates of errors across all categories. Relative to their matched comparison groups, boys with FXS + ASD and autistic boys produced significantly more omissions during conversation. These findings suggest that omissions may be a unique grammatical marker associated with the ASD phenotype. Further examination of omissions across diagnostic groups would aid in clarifying the specificity of omissions in the language phenotype of ASD."

    "abstract": "Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of 55-200 CGG repeats (premutation) in the 5'-UTR of the FMR1 gene. Bidirectional transcription at FMR1 locus has been demonstrated and specific alternative splicing of the Antisense FMR1 (ASFMR1) gene has been proposed to have a contributing role in the pathogenesis of FXTAS. The structure of ASFMR1 gene is still uncharacterized and it is currently unknown how many isoforms of the gene are expressed and at what level in premutation carriers (PM) and if they may contribute to the premutation pathology. In this study, we characterized the ASFMR1 gene structure and the transcriptional landscape by using PacBio SMRT sequencing with target enrichment (IDT customized probe panel). We identified 45 ASFMR1 isoforms ranging in sizes from 523 bp to 6 Kb, spanning approximately 59 kb of genomic DNA. Multiplexing and sequencing of six human brain samples from PM samples and normal control (HC) were carried out on the PacBio Sequel platform. We validated the presence of these isoforms by qRT-PCR and Sanger sequencing and characterized the acceptor and donor splicing site consensus sequences. Consistent with previous studies conducted in other tissue types, we found a high expression of ASFMR1 isoform Iso131bp in brain samples of PM as compared to HC, while no differences in expression levels were observed for the newly identified isoforms IsoAS1 and IsoAS2. We investigated the role of the splicing regulatory protein Sam68 which we did not observe in the alternative splicing of the ASFMR1 gene. Our study provides a useful insight into the structure of ASFMR1 gene and transcriptional landscape along with the expression pattern of various newly identified novel isoforms and on their potential role in premutation pathology."

The most common inherited form of autism is Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by a mutation in <i>FMR1</i> Mutation of <i>fmr1</i> in zebrafish causes anxiety-like behavior, hyperactivity, and hypersensitivity in auditory and visual processing. Here, we show that zebrafish <i>fmr1</i>-/- mutant larvae of either sex also display changes in hunting behavior, tectal coding, and social interaction. During hunting, they were less successful at catching prey and displayed altered behavioral sequences. In the tectum, representations of prey-like stimuli were more diffuse and had higher dimensionality. In a social behavioral assay, they spent more time observing a conspecific but responded more slowly to social cues. However, when given a choice of rearing environment <i>fmr1</i>-/- larvae preferred one with reduced visual stimulation, and rearing them in this environment reduced genotype-specific effects on tectal excitability. Together, these results shed new light on how <i>fmr1</i>-/- changes the early development of neural systems and behavior in a vertebrate.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are caused by changes in early neural development. Animal models of ASDs offer the opportunity to study these developmental processes in greater detail than in humans. Here, we found that a zebrafish mutant for a gene which in humans causes one type of ASD showed early alterations in hunting behavior, social behavior, and how visual stimuli are represented in the brain. However, we also found that mutant fish preferred reduced visual stimulation, and rearing them in this environment reduced alterations in neural activity patterns. These results suggest interesting new directions for using zebrafish as a model to study the development of brain and behavior in ASDs, and how the impact of ASDs could potentially be reduced."

    "abstract": "Layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons receive predictive and sensory inputs in a compartmentalized manner at their apical and basal dendrites, respectively. To uncover how integration of sensory inputs is affected in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), we used two-photon glutamate uncaging to activate spines in the basal dendrites of L5 pyramidal neurons from a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common genetic cause of ASD. While subthreshold excitatory inputs integrate linearly in wild-type animals, surprisingly those with FXS summate sublinearly, contradicting what would be expected of sensory hypersensitivity classically associated with ASD. We next investigated the mechanism underlying this sublinearity by performing knockdown of the regulatory β4 subunit of BK channels, which rescued the synaptic integration, a result that was corroborated with numerical simulations. Taken together, these findings suggest that there is a differential impairment in the integration of feedforward sensory and feedback predictive inputs in L5 pyramidal neurons in FXS and potentially other forms of ASD, as a result of specifically localized subcellular channelopathies. These results challenge the traditional view that FXS and other ASD are characterized by sensory hypersensitivity, proposing instead a hyposensitivity of sensory inputs and hypersensitivity of predictive inputs onto cortical neurons."

The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of fragile X-associated neurodevelopmental disorders (FXAND) in a sample of young PM individuals. <b>Methods:</b> This was a retrospective study conducted through a medical record review of PM individuals who were seen either for clinical concerns (probands, 45.9%) or identified through the cascade testing (non-probands, 54.1%) of an affected sibling with fragile X syndrome. Information on the presence of autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, long-term psychiatric medication intake, and cognitive function, based on standardized assessments, was obtained. Molecular data, including CGG repeat number and <i>FMR1</i> mRNA levels, were also available for a subset of participants. Analysis included descriptive statistics and a test of comparison to describe the clinical profile of PM individuals pertinent to FXAND. <b>Results:</b> Participants included 61 individuals (52 males and 9 females) aged 7.8 to 20.0 years (mean 12.6 ± 3.4) with a mean full-scale IQ of 90.9 ± 22.7.

    "abstract": "Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset, X-linked, neurodegenerative disorder that affects premutation carriers of the FMR1 gene. FXTAS is often misdiagnosed as spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) or Parkinson's disease (PD). Herein, we sought to investigate the frequency, genotypic and phenotypic profile of FXTAS in two cohorts of Greek patients with late-onset movement disorders, one with cerebellar ataxia and the other with PD. In total, 90 index patients with late-onset cerebellar ataxia and 171 with PD were selected. None of the cases had male-to-male transmission. Genetic screening for the FMR1 premutation was performed using standard methodology. The FMR1 premutation was detected in two ataxia patients (2.2%) and two PD patients (1.2%). Additional clinical features in FXTAS patients from the ataxia cohort included neuropathy, mild parkinsonism, cognitive impairment and pyramidal signs. The FXTAS patients from the PD cohort had typical PD. We conclude that, in the Greek population, the FMR1 premutation is an important, albeit rare, cause of late-onset movement disorders. Routine premutation screening should be considered in SCA panel-negative late-onset ataxia cases. Directed premutation screening should be considered in all ataxia and PD cases with additional features suggestive of FXTAS. Our study highlights the importance of FMR1 genetic testing in the diagnosis of late-onset movement disorders."

Specifically, studies on autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, cerebral palsy, Angelman syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, Williams-Beuren syndrome, Cri-du-chat syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and West syndrome were searched. The objectives are to review observational and computational studies on the emergence of (pre-)babbling vocalisations and outline findings on acoustic characteristics of early verbal functions. A comprehensive review of the literature was performed including observational and computational studies focusing on spontaneous infant vocalisations at the pre-babbling age of TD children, individuals with genetic or neurodevelopmental disorders. While there is substantial knowledge about early vocal development in TD infants, the pre-babbling phase in infants with neurodevelopmental and genetic syndromes is scarcely scrutinised. Related approaches, paradigms, and definitions vary substantially and insights into the onset and characteristics of early verbal functions in most above-mentioned disorders are missing. Most studies focused on acoustic low-level descriptors (e.g. fundamental frequency) which bore limited clinical relevance. This calls for computational approaches to analyse features of infant typical and atypical verbal development. Pre-babbling vocalisations as precursor for future speech-language functions may reveal valuable signs for identifying infants at risk for atypical development. Observational studies should be complemented by computational approaches to enable in-depth understanding of the developing speech-language functions. By disentangling features of typical and atypical early verbal development, computational approaches may support clinical screening and evaluation."

Our recordings yielded 288 and 246 putative pyramidal cells from 7 WT and 7 Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> rats, respectively. On the first day of exploration of a novel environment, the firing rate and spatial tuning of CA1 pyramidal neurons was similar between wild-type (WT) and Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> rats. However, while CA1 pyramidal neurons from WT rats showed experience-dependent changes in firing and spatial tuning between the first and second day of exposure to the environment, these changes were decreased or absent in CA1 neurons of Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> rats. These findings were consistent with increased excitability of Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> CA1 neurons in ex vivo hippocampal slices, which correlated with reduced synaptic inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex. Lastly, activity patterns of CA1 pyramidal neurons were dis-coordinated with respect to hippocampal oscillatory activity in Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> rats. It is still unclear how the observed circuit function abnormalities give rise to behavioural deficits in Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> rats. Future experiments will focus on this connection as well as the contribution of other neuronal cell types in the hippocampal circuit pathophysiology associated with the loss of FMRP. It would also be interesting to see if hippocampal circuit deficits converge with those seen in other rodent models of intellectual disability. In conclusion, we found that hippocampal place cells from Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> rats show similar spatial firing properties as those from WT rats but do not show the same experience-dependent increase in spatial specificity or the experience-dependent changes in network coordination. Our findings offer support to a network-level origin of cognitive deficits in FXS."

    "title": "A simple high-throughput method for automated detection of Drosophila melanogaster light-dependent behaviours.",
    "abstract": "Like most living organisms, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster exhibits strong and diverse behavioural reactions to light. Drosophila is a diurnal animal that displays both short- and long-term responses to light, important for, instance, in avoidance and light wavelength preference, regulation of eclosion, courtship, and activity, and provides an important model organism for understanding the regulation of circadian rhythms both at molecular and circuit levels. However, the assessment and comparison of light-based behaviours is still a challenge, mainly due to the lack of a standardised platform to measure behaviour and different protocols created across studies. Here, we describe the Drosophila Interactive System for Controlled Optical manipulations (DISCO), a low-cost, automated, high-throughput device that records the flies' activity using infrared beams while performing LED light manipulations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this tool and validate its potential as a standard platform, we developed a number of distinct assays, including measuring the locomotor response of flies exposed to sudden darkness (lights-off) stimuli. Both white-eyed and red-eyed wild-type flies exhibit increased activity after the application of stimuli, while no changes can be observed in Fmr1 null allele flies, a model of fragile X syndrome. Next, to demonstrate the use of DISCO in long-term protocols, we monitored the circadian rhythm of the flies for 48 h while performing an alcohol preference test. We show that increased alcohol consumption happens intermittently throughout the day, especially in the dark phases. Finally, we developed a feedback-loop algorithm to implement a place preference test based on the flies' innate aversion to blue light and preference for green light. We show that both white-eyed and red-eyed wild-type flies were able to learn to avoid the blue-illuminated zones. Our results demonstrate the versatility of DISCO for a range of protocols, indicating that this platform can be used in a variety of ways to study light-dependent behaviours in flies."

    "abstract": "Short tandem repeats (STRs) compose approximately 3% of the genome, and mutations at STR loci have been linked to dozens of human diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Friedreich ataxia, Huntington disease, and fragile X syndrome. Improving our understanding of these mutations would increase our knowledge of the mutational dynamics of the genome and may uncover additional loci that contribute to disease. To estimate the genome-wide pattern of mutations at STR loci, we analyze blood-derived whole-genome sequencing data for 544 individuals from 29 three-generation CEPH pedigrees. These pedigrees contain both sets of grandparents, the parents, and an average of 9 grandchildren per family. We use HipSTR to identify de novo STR mutations in the 2nd generation of these pedigrees and require transmission to the third generation for validation. Analyzing approximately 1.6 million STR loci, we estimate the empirical de novo STR mutation rate to be 5.24 × 10<sup>-5</sup> mutations per locus per generation. Perfect repeats mutate about 2 × more often than imperfect repeats. De novo STRs are significantly enriched in Alu elements. Approximately 30% of new STR mutations occur within Alu elements, which compose only 11% of the genome, but only 10% are found in LINE-1 insertions, which compose 17% of the genome. Phasing these mutations to the parent of origin shows that parental transmission biases vary among families. We estimate the average number of de novo genome-wide STR mutations per individual to be approximately 85, which is similar to the average number of observed de novo single nucleotide variants."

During investigation of trends within clinical trials, we have identified a particularly high number of clinical trials involving PDE inhibitors, prompting us to further evaluate the current status of this class of therapeutic agents. In total, we have identified 87 agents with PDE-inhibiting capacity, of which 85 interact with PDE enzymes as primary target. We provide an overview of the clinical drug development with focus on the current clinical uses, novel molecules and indications, highlighting relevant clinical studies. We found that the bulk of current clinical uses for this class of therapeutic agents are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), vascular and cardiovascular disorders and inflammatory skin conditions. In COPD, particularly, PDE inhibitors are characterised by the compliance-limiting adverse reactions. We discuss efforts directed to appropriately adjusting the dose regimens and conducting structure-activity relationship studies to determine the effect of structural features on safety profile. The ongoing development predominantly concentrates on central nervous system diseases, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and fragile X syndrome; notable advancements are being also made in mycobacterial infections, HIV and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Our analysis predicts the diversification of PDE inhibitors' will continue to grow thanks to the molecules in preclinical development and the ongoing research involving drugs in clinical development."

    "abstract": "Lack of FMR1 protein results in fragile X syndrome (FXS), which is the most common inherited intellectual disability syndrome and serves as an excellent model disease to study molecular mechanisms resulting in neuropsychiatric comorbidities. We compared the transcriptomes of human neural progenitors (NPCs) generated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of three FXS and three control male donors. Altered expression of <i>RAD51C, PPIL3, GUCY1A2, MYD88, TRAPPC4, LYNX1,</i> and <i>GTF2A1L</i> in FXS NPCs suggested changes related to triplet repeat instability, RNA splicing, testes development, and pathways previously shown to be affected in FXS. LYNX1 is a cholinergic brake of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-dependent plasticity, and its reduced expression was consistent with augmented tPA-dependent radial glial process growth in NPCs derived from FXS iPSC lines. There was evidence of human iPSC line donor-dependent variation reflecting potentially phenotypic variation. NPCs derived from an FXS male with concomitant epilepsy expressed differently several epilepsy-related genes, including genes shown to cause the auditory epilepsy phenotype in the murine model of FXS. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted regulation of insulin-like growth factor pathway in NPCs modeling FXS with epilepsy. Our results demonstrated potential of human iPSCs in disease modeling for discovery and development of therapeutic interventions by showing early gene expression changes in FXS iPSC-derived NPCs consistent with the known pathophysiological changes in FXS and by revealing disturbed FXS progenitor growth linked to reduced expression of LYNX1, suggesting dysregulated cholinergic system."

    "abstract": "No proven prognosis is available for the neurodegenerative disorder fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Artificial neural network analyses (ANN) were used to predict FXTAS progression using data from 127 adults (noncarriers and FMR1 premutation carriers with and without FXTAS) with five outcomes from brain MRI imaging and 22 peripheral bioenergetic outcomes from two cell types. Diagnosis accuracy by ANN predictions ranged from 41.7 to 86.3% (depending on the algorithm used), and those misclassified usually presented a higher FXTAS stage. ANN prediction of FXTAS stages was based on a combination of two imaging findings (white matter hyperintensity and whole-brain volumes adjusted for intracranial volume) and four bioenergetic outcomes. Those at Stage 3 vs. 0-2 showed lower mitochondrial mass, higher oxidative stress, and an altered electron transfer consistent with mitochondrial unfolded protein response activation. Those at Stages 4-5 vs. 3 had higher oxidative stress and glycerol-3-phosphate-linked ATP production, suggesting that targeting mGPDH activity may prevent a worse prognosis. This was confirmed by the bioenergetic improvement of inhibiting mGPDH with metformin in affected fibroblasts. ANN supports the prospect of an unbiased molecular definition in diagnosing FXTAS stages while identifying potential targets for personalized medicine."

    "abstract": "In fragile X syndrome (FX), the leading monogenic cause of autism, excessive neuronal protein synthesis is a core pathophysiology; however, an overall increase in protein expression is not observed. Here, we tested whether excessive protein synthesis drives a compensatory rise in protein degradation that is protective for FX mouse model (Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup>) neurons. Surprisingly, although we find a significant increase in protein degradation through ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), this contributes to pathological changes. Normalizing proteasome activity with bortezomib corrects excessive hippocampal protein synthesis and hyperactivation of neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) in response to auditory stimulation. Moreover, systemic administration of bortezomib significantly reduces the incidence and severity of audiogenic seizures (AGS) in the Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> mouse, as does genetic reduction of proteasome, specifically in the IC. Together, these results identify excessive activation of the UPS pathway in Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> neurons as a contributor to multiple phenotypes that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading inherited monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Executive function (EF), necessary for adaptive goal-oriented behavior and dependent on frontal lobe function, is impaired in individuals with FXS. Yet, little is known how alterations in frontal lobe neural activity is related to EF deficits in FXS. Sixty-one participants with FXS (54% males) and 71 age- and sex-matched typically-developing controls (TDC; 58% males) completed a five-minute resting state electroencephalography (EEG) protocol and a computerized battery of tests of EF, the Test of Attentional Performance for Children (KiTAP). Following source localization (minimum-norm estimate), we computed debiased weighted phase lag index (dWPLI), a phase connectivity value, for pairings between 18 nodes in frontal regions for gamma (30-55 Hz) and alpha (10.5-12.5 Hz) bands. Linear models were generated with fixed factors of group, sex, frequency, and connection. Relationships between frontal connectivity and EF variables also were examined. Individuals with FXS demonstrated increased gamma band and reduced alpha band connectivity across all frontal regions and across hemispheres compared to TDC. After controlling for nonverbal IQ, increased error rates on EF tasks were associated with increased gamma band and reduced alpha band connectivity. Frontal connectivity findings are limited to intrinsic brain activity during rest and may not generalize to frontal connectivity during EF tasks or everyday function. We report gamma hyper-connectivity and alpha hypo-connectivity within source-localized frontal brain regions in FXS compared to TDC during resting-state EEG. For the first time in FXS, we report significant associations between EF and altered frontal connectivity, with increased error rate relating to increased gamma band connectivity and reduced alpha band connectivity. These findings suggest increased phase connectivity within gamma band may impair EF performance, whereas greater alpha band connectivity may provide compensatory support for EF. Together, these findings provide important insight into neurophysiological mechanisms of EF deficits in FXS and provide novel targets for treatment development."

    "title": "The feasibility and utility of hair follicle sampling to measure FMRP and FMR1 mRNA in children with or without fragile X syndrome: a pilot study.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability in males and the most common single gene cause of autism. This X-linked disorder is caused by an expansion of a trinucleotide CGG repeat (> 200 base pairs) on the promotor region of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 gene (FMR1). This leads to the deficiency or absence of the encoded protein, fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP). FMRP has a central role in the translation of mRNAs involved in synaptic connections and plasticity. Recent studies have demonstrated the benefit of therapeutics focused on reactivation of the FMR1 locus towards improving key clinical phenotypes via restoration of FMRP and ultimately disease modification. A key step in future studies directed towards this effort is the establishment of proof of concept (POC) for FMRP reactivation in individuals with FXS. For this, it is key to determine the feasibility of repeated collection of tissues or fluids to measure FMR1 mRNA and FMRP. Individuals, ages 3 to 22 years of age, with FXS and those who were typically developing participated in this single-site pilot clinical biomarker study. The repeated collection of hair follicles was compared with the collection of blood and buccal swabs for detection of FMR1 mRNA and FMRP and related molecules. There were n = 15 participants, of whom 10 had a diagnosis of FXS (7.0 ± 3.56 years) and 5 were typically developing (8.2 ± 2.77 years). Absolute levels of FMRP and FMR1 mRNA were substantially higher in healthy participants compared to full mutation and mosaic FXS participants and lowest in the FXS boys. Measurement of FMR1 mRNA and FMRP levels by any method did not show any notable variation by collection location at home versus office across the various sample collection methodologies of hair follicle, blood sample, and buccal swab. Findings demonstrated that repeated sampling of hair follicles in individuals with FXS, in both, home, and office settings, is feasible, repeatable, and can be used for measurement of FMR1 mRNA and FMRP in longitudinal studies."

A total of 2 ml of peripheral venous blood was collected from the child and their parents for the whole exome sequencing (WES) and copy number variation (CNV) detection. Male children were subjected to fragile X syndrome testing to determine the genetic mutations. For those with positive results, Sanger sequencing was performed to explore the mutations in the gene sites and pedigrees.

    "abstract": "There are no approved medicines for fragile X syndrome (FXS), a monogenic, neurodevelopmental disorder. Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies show alterations in resting-state cortical EEG spectra, such as increased gamma-band power, in patients with FXS that are also observed in <i>Fmr1</i> knockout models of FXS, offering putative biomarkers for drug discovery. Genes encoding serotonin receptors (5-HTRs), including 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>Rs, are differentially expressed in FXS, providing a rationale for investigating them as pharmacotherapeutic targets. Previously we reported pharmacological activity and preclinical neurotherapeutic effects in <i>Fmr1</i> knockout mice of an orally active 2-aminotetralin, (<i>S</i>)-5-(2'-fluorophenyl)-<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-amine (FPT). FPT is a potent (low nM), high-efficacy partial agonist at 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs and a potent, low-efficacy partial agonist at 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Rs. Here we report new observations that FPT also has potent and efficacious agonist activity at human 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>Rs. FPT's <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> values at 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>Rs were <5 nM, but it had nil activity (>10 μM <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>) at 5-HT<sub>1F</sub>Rs. We tested the effects of FPT (5.6 mg/kg, subcutaneous) on EEG recorded above the somatosensory and auditory cortices in freely moving, adult <i>Fmr1</i> knockout and control mice. Consistent with previous reports, we observed significantly increased relative gamma power in untreated or vehicle-treated male and female <i>Fmr1</i> knockout mice from recordings above the left somatosensory cortex (LSSC). In addition, we observed sex effects on EEG power. FPT did not eliminate the genotype difference in relative gamma power from the LSSC. FPT, however, robustly decreased relative alpha power in the LSSC and auditory cortex, with more pronounced effects in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. Similarly, FPT decreased relative alpha power in the right SSC but only in <i>Fmr1</i> knockout mice. FPT also increased relative delta power, with more pronounced effects in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice and caused small but significant increases in relative beta power. Distinct impacts of FPT on cortical EEG were like effects caused by certain FDA-approved psychotropic medications (including baclofen, allopregnanolone, and clozapine). These results advance the understanding of FPT's pharmacological and neurophysiological effects."

Perturbations of this gene expression network have been related to abnormal behavioral symptoms such as hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Considering the roles of FMRP in the modulation of mRNA translation, we investigated the differentially expressed genes which might be targeted to revert to normal and ameliorate behavioral symptoms. Gene expression data was analyzed and used the connectivity map (CMap) to understand the changes in gene expression in FXS and predict the effective drug candidates. We analyzed the GSE7329 dataset that had 15 control and 8 FXS patients' lymphoblastoid samples. Among 924 genes, 42 genes were selected as signatures for CMap analysis, and 24 associated drugs were found. Pirenperone was selected as a potential drug candidate for FXS for its possible antipsychotic effect. Treatment of pirenperone increased the expression level of Fmr1 gene. Moreover, pirenperone rescued the behavioral deficits in Fmr1 KO mice including hyperactivity, spatial memory, and impulsivity. These results suggest that pirenperone is a new drug candidate for FXS, which should be verified in future studies."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Serotonergic neurotransmission has a key role in the modulation of neuronal activity during development, and therefore, it has been hypothesized to be involved in ASD and co-occurring conditions including FXS. As serotonin is involved in synaptic remodeling and maturation, serotonergic insufficiency during childhood may have a compounding effect on brain patterning in neurodevelopmental disorders, manifesting as behavioral and emotional symptoms. Thus, compounds that stimulate serotonergic signaling such as psilocybin may offer promise as effective early interventions for developmental disorders such as ASD and FXS. The aim of the present study was to test whether different protocols of psilocybin administration mitigate cognitive deficits displayed by the recently validated Fmr1-<sup>Δ</sup>exon 8 rat model of ASD, which is also a model of FXS. Our results revealed that systemic and oral administration of psilocybin microdoses normalizes the aberrant cognitive performance displayed by adolescent Fmr1-<sup>Δ</sup>exon 8 rats in the short-term version of the novel object recognition test-a measure of exploratory behavior, perception, and recognition. These data support the hypothesis that serotonin-modulating drugs such as psilocybin may be useful to ameliorate ASD-related cognitive deficits. Overall, this study provides evidence of the beneficial effects of different schedules of psilocybin treatment in mitigating the short-term cognitive deficit observed in a rat model of FXS."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the loss of function of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FXS is one of the leading monogenic causes of intellectual disability (ID) and autism. Although it is caused by the failure of a single gene, FMRP that functions as an RNA binding protein affects a large number of genes secondarily. All these genes represent hundreds of potential targets and different mechanisms that account for multiple pathological features, thereby hampering the search for effective treatments. In this scenario, it seems desirable to reorient therapies toward more general approaches. Neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS-1), through its interaction with the guanine-exchange factor Ric8a, regulates the number of synapses and the probability of the release of a neurotransmitter, the two neuronal features that are altered in FXS and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Inhibitors of the NCS-1/Ric8a complex have been shown to be effective in restoring abnormally high synapse numbers as well as improving associative learning in FMRP mutant flies. Here, we demonstrate that phenothiazine FD44, an NCS-1/Ric8a inhibitor, has strong inhibition ability <i>in situ</i> and sufficient bioavailability in the mouse brain. More importantly, administration of FD44 to two different FXS mouse models restores well-known FXS phenotypes, such as hyperactivity, associative learning, aggressive behavior, stereotype, or impaired social approach. It has been suggested that dopamine (DA) may play a relevant role in the behavior and in neurodevelopmental disorders in general. We have measured DA and its metabolites in different brain regions, finding a higher metabolic rate in the limbic area, which is also restored with FD44 treatment. Therefore, in addition to confirming that the NCS-1/Ric8a complex is an excellent therapeutic target, we demonstrate the rescue effect of its inhibitor on the behavior of cognitive and autistic FXS mice and show DA metabolism as a FXS biochemical disease marker."

Sensitive measurement of cognitive change in this population is a critical need for clinical trials and other intervention studies, but well-validated outcome measures are scarce.

We administered the NIHTB-CB and a reference standard cross-validation measure (Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, Fifth Edition [SB5]) to 256 individuals with FXS, DS, and OID (ages 6-27 years). After 2 years of development, we retested 197 individuals. Group developmental changes in each cognitive domain of the NIHTB-CB and SB5 were assessed using latent change score models, and 2-year growth was evaluated at 3 age points (10, 16, and 22 years). Overall, effect sizes of growth measured by the NIHTB-CB tests were comparable with or exceeded those of the SB5. The NIHTB-CB showed significant gains in almost all domains in OID at younger ages (10 years), with continued gains at 16 years and stability in early adulthood (22 years). The FXS group showed delayed gains in attention and inhibitory control compared with OID. The DS group had delayed gains in receptive vocabulary compared with OID. Unlike the other groups, DS had significant growth in early adulthood in 2 domains (working memory and attention/inhibitory control). Notably, each group's pattern of NIHTB-CB growth across development corresponded to their respective pattern of SB5 growth. The NIHTB-CB is sensitive to developmental changes in individuals with ID. Comparison with levels and timing of growth on the cross-validation measure shows that the NIHTB-CB has potential to identify meaningful trajectories across cognitive domains and ID etiologies. Sensitivity to change within the context of treatment studies and delineation of clinically meaningful changes in NIHTB-CB scores, linked to daily functioning, must be established in future research to evaluate the battery more completely as a key outcome measure."

Previous studies have linked the structural and functional alterations in FXS with impaired sensory processing and sensory hypersensitivity, which may hinder the early development of cognitive functions such as language comprehension. In this study, we compared the P1 response of the auditory evoked potential and its habituation to repeated auditory stimuli in male children (2-7 years old) with and without FXS, and examined their association with clinical measures in these two groups. We collected high-density electroencephalography (EEG) data in an auditory oddball paradigm from 12 male children with FXS and 11 age- and sex-matched typically developing (TD) children. After standardized EEG pre-processing, we conducted a spatial principal component (PC) analysis and identified two major PCs-a frontal PC and a temporal PC. Within each PC, we compared the P1 amplitude and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) between the two groups, and performed a series of linear regression analysis to study the association between these EEG measures and several clinical measures, including assessment scores for language abilities, non-verbal skills, and sensory hypersensitivity. At the temporal PC, both early and late standard stimuli evoked a larger P1 response in FXS compared to TD participants. For temporal ITPC, the TD group showed greater habituation than the FXS group. However, neither group showed significant habituation of the frontal or temporal P1 response. Despite lack of habituation, exploratory analysis of brain-behavior associations observed that within the FXS group, reduced frontal P1 response to late standard stimuli, and increased frontal P1 habituation were both associated with better language scores. We identified P1 amplitude and ITPC in the temporal region as a contrasting EEG phenotype between the FXS and the TD groups. However, only frontal P1 response and habituation were associated with language measures. Larger longitudinal studies are required to determine whether these EEG measures could be used as biomarkers for language development in patients with FXS."

    "title": "The diagnostic experience of women with fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI).",
    "abstract": "The fragile X premutation occurs when there are 55-200 CGG repeats in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. An estimated 1 in 148 women carry a premutation, with 20-30% of these individuals at risk for fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). Diagnostic experiences of FXPOI have not previously been included in the literature, limiting insight on experiences surrounding the diagnosis. This study identifies barriers and facilitators to receiving a FXPOI diagnosis and follow-up care, which can inform care and possibly improve quality of life. We conducted qualitative interviews with 24 women with FXPOI exploring how FMR1 screening, physician education, and supportive care impacted their experience. Three subgroups were compared: women diagnosed through family history who have biological children, women diagnosed through family history who do not have biological children, and women diagnosed through symptoms of POI. Themes from interviews included hopes for broader clinician awareness of FXPOI, clear guidelines for clinical treatment, and proper fertility workups to expand reproductive options prior to POI onset. Participants also spoke of difficulty finding centralized sources of care. Our results indicate a lack of optimal care of women with a premutation particularly with respect to FMR1 screening for molecular diagnosis, short- and long-term centralized treatment, and clinical and emotional support. The creation of a \"FXPOI health navigator\" could serve as a centralized resource for the premutation patient population, assisting in connection to optimal treatment and appropriate referrals, including genetic counseling, mental health resources, advocacy organizations, and better-informed physicians."

We employed a pediatric cross-sectional sample (1,072 males, 338 females) from FORWARD, a clinic-based natural history study, to identify behavioral subtypes by latent class analysis. Input included co-occurring behavioral conditions, sleep and sensory problems, autistic behavior scales (SCQ, SRS-2), and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist revised for FXS (ABC<sub>FX</sub>). A 5-class solution yielded the most clinically meaningful, pharmacotherapy independent behavioral groups with distinctive SCQ, SRS-2, and ABC<sub>FX</sub> profiles, and adequate non-overlap (≥ 71%): \"Mild\" (31%), \"Moderate without Social Impairment\" (32%), \"Moderate with Social Impairment\" (7%), \"Moderate with Disruptive Behavior\" (20%), and \"Severe\" (9%).

    "abstract": "Individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) characteristically struggle with language and communication throughout the life course, but there is limited research on the development of communication before 24 months. The purpose of this study is to describe the early communication of infants and toddlers with FXS using the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales-Caregiver Questionnaire (CSBS-CQ), a standardized communication screening measure, as compared to the reported normative data of the CSBS-CQ and identify the percentage of infants and toddlers who scored within the range of concern. Documenting how children with FXS perform on screening measures can provide a quick snapshot of skills to help clinicians determine the need for services. Participants were 22 infants and toddlers with FXS between 6 and 29 months. Performance on the CSBS-CQ was compared to the measure's normative data. The CSBS-CQ was completed by mothers, and children were administered the Mullen Scales of Early Learning. Because co-occurring autism is common in FXS, the presence of autism was determined using a clinical best estimate procedure. Overall and within the domains and subdomains of the CSBS-CQ, infants and toddlers with FXS had significantly lower scores than the normative data. Further, 68.2% of our sample was in the range of concern for their overall communication score. The presence of autism led to consistently lower scores, and more infants and toddlers with FXS + autism scored within the range of concern. Our findings suggest that delays in early communication are evident in comparison to typically developing norms before 24 months. These findings also emphasize that infants and toddlers with FXS would likely benefit from early language intervention given that 68.2% of our sample was in the range of concern for their overall communication score. Early identification and developmental monitoring of children with FXS will help to determine concerns in communication and other domains of development. While early communication broadly may not be an early indicator of autism in FXS, some specific skills, such as eye gaze, may serve as such an indicator. Screening measures, like the CSBS-CQ, may help monitor both early communication impairments and autism symptoms. Infants and toddlers with FXS, regardless of autism status, will benefit from early language interventions."

    "abstract": "Based on the inclusive and methodologically rigorous framework provided by Ed Zigler's developmental approach, we previously challenged what we called, 'the mysterious myth of attention deficit', the fallacy of attention as a universal deficit among persons with intellectual disability (ID). In this latest update, we conducted a systematic review of studies of essential components of attention among persons with ID published in the interim since the last iteration of the mysterious myth narrative was submitted for publication approximately a decade ago. We searched the databases PubMed and PsycINFO for English-language peer-reviewed studies published from 1 January 2011 through 5 February 2021. In keeping with the developmental approach, the two essential methodological criteria were that the groups of persons with ID were aetiologically homogeneous and that the comparisons with persons with average IQs (or with available norms) were based on an appropriate index of developmental level, or mental age. Stringent use of these criteria for inclusion served to control for bias in article selection. Articles were then categorised based on aetiological group studied and component of visual attention. Based on these criteria, 18 articles were selected for inclusion out of the 2837 that were identified. The included studies involved 547 participants: 201 participants with Down syndrome, 214 participants with Williams syndrome and 132 participants with fragile X syndrome. The findings from these articles call attention to the complexities and nuances in understanding attentional functioning across homogeneous aetiological groups and highlight that functioning must be considered in relation to aetiology; factors associated with the individual, such as developmental level, motivation, styles and biases; and factors associated with both the task, such as context, focus, social and emotional implications, and levels of environmental complexity."

CONNECT-FX was a double-blind, randomized phase 3 trial assessing efficacy and safety of ZYN002, transdermal cannabidiol gel, for the treatment of behavioral symptoms in children and adolescents with FXS. Patients were randomized to 12 weeks of ZYN002 (250 mg or 500 mg daily [weight-based]) or placebo, as add-on to standard of care. The primary endpoint assessed change in social avoidance (SA) measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition FXS (ABC-C<sub>FXS</sub>) SA subscale in a full cohort of patients with a FXS full mutation, regardless of the FMR1 methylation status. Ad hoc analyses assessed efficacy in patients with ≥ 90% and 100% methylation of the promoter region of the FMR1 gene, in whom FMR1 gene silencing is most likely. A total of 212 patients, mean age 9.7 years, 75% males, were enrolled. A total of 169 (79.7%) patients presented with ≥ 90% methylation of the FMR1 promoter and full mutation of FMR1. Although statistical significance for the primary endpoint was not achieved in the full cohort, significant improvement was demonstrated in patients with ≥ 90% methylation of FMR1 (nominal P = 0.020). This group also achieved statistically significant improvements in Caregiver Global Impression-Change in SA and isolation, irritable and disruptive behaviors, and social interactions (nominal P-values: P = 0.038, P = 0.028, and P = 0.002). Similar results were seen in patients with 100% methylation of FMR1. ZYN002 was safe and well tolerated. All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild or moderate. The most common treatment-related TEAE was application site pain (ZYN002: 6.4%; placebo: 1.0%). In CONNECT-FX, ZYN002 was well tolerated in patients with FXS and demonstrated evidence of efficacy with a favorable benefit risk relationship in patients with ≥ 90% methylation of the FMR1 gene, in whom gene silencing is most likely, and the impact of FXS is typically most severe. The CONNECT-FX trial is registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03614663)."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a trinucleotide expansion on the FMR1 gene and characterized by intellectual disability, sensory hypersensitivity, executive function difficulties, and social anxiety. Recently, efforts to define neural biomarkers for FXS have highlighted disruptions to power in the alpha frequency band; however the dynamic mechanisms supporting these findings are poorly understood. The current study aimed to explore the temporal and hemispheric dynamics supporting alpha phenotypes in FXS and their relationship with neural phenotypes related to auditory processing using electroencephalography during an auditory evoked task. Adolescents and adults (<i>N</i> = 36) with FXS and age/sex matched typically developing controls (<i>N</i> = 40) completed an auditory chirp task. Frontal alpha power in the prestimulus period was decomposed into \"bursts\" using percentile thresholding, then assessed for number of bursts per second (burst count) and burst length. Data were compared across left and right hemispheres to assess lateralization of neural activity. Individuals with FXS showed more differences in alpha power compared to TDC primarily in the right hemisphere. Notably, alpha hemisphere outcomes in males with FXS were driven by the number of times they entered a dynamically relevant period of alpha (burst count) rather than length of time spent in alpha. Females with FXS showed reduced burst counts but remained in sustained high alpha states for longer periods of time. Length of time spent in alpha may reflect a modulatory or compensatory mechanism capable of recovering sensory processing abilities in females with FXS resulting in a less severe clinical presentation. Right hemisphere abnormalities may impact sensory processing differences between males and females with FXS. The relationship between alpha burst length, count, sex, and hemisphere may shed light on underlying mechanisms for previously observed alpha power abnormalities in FXS and their variation by sex."

    "title": "Acute and Repeated Administration of NLX-101, a Selective Serotonin-1A Receptor Biased Agonist, Reduces Audiogenic Seizures in Developing Fmr1 Knockout Mice.",
    "abstract": "Fragile XSyndrome (FXS) is a leading known genetic cause of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and intellectual disability. A consistent and debilitating phenotype of FXS is sensory hypersensitivity that manifests strongly in the auditory domain and may lead to delayed language and high anxiety. The mouse model of FXS, the Fmr1 KO mouse, also shows auditory hypersensitivity, an extreme form of which is seen as audiogenic seizures (AGS). The midbrain inferior colliculus (IC) is critically involved in generating audiogenic seizures and IC neurons are hyper-responsive to sounds in developing Fmr1 KO mice. Serotonin-1A receptor (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>) activation reduces IC activity. Therefore, we tested whether 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> activation is sufficient to reduce audiogenic seizures in Fmr1 KO mice. A selective and post-synaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor biased agonist, 3-Chloro-4-fluorophenyl-[4-fluoro-4-[[(5-methylpyrimidin-2-ylmethyl)amino]methyl]piperidin-1-yl] methanone (NLX-101, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8 or 2.4 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to Fmr1 KO mice 15 min before seizure induction. Whereas the 0.6 mg/kg dose was ineffective in reducing seizures, the 1.2, 1.8 and 2.4 mg/kg doses of NLX-101 dramatically reduced seizures and increased mouse survival. Treatment with a combination of NLX-101 and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor antagonists prevented the protective effects of NLX-101, indicating that NLX-101 acts selectively through 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors to reduce audiogenic seizures. NLX-101 (1.8 mg/kg) was still strongly effective in reducing seizures even after repeated administration over 5 days, suggesting an absence of tachyphylaxis to the effects of the compound. Together, these studies point to a promising treatment option targeting post-synaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors to reduce auditory hypersensitivity in FXS, and potentially across autism spectrum disorders."

Premutation alleles (PM) (55-200 CGG repeats) are associated with tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), and autistic problems. To screen the frequency of premutation carriers using molecular diagnostic assays, in a cohort of Egyptian males with suspected clinical features of (FXS) checking for the presence of premutation alleles. The current study comprised 192 Egyptian male children, 92 participants presented with intellectual disability, delayed language development, autistic-like features, behavioral difficulties, anxiety, seizures, and depression compared to 100 healthy males. All cases were subjected to clinical and neuroimaging assessments, when indicated as well as molecular analysis using methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Thirty-four premutation carriers out of 92 Egyptian males (37%) of CGG repeats (55 to 200) were illustrated with elevated FMR1 mRNA expression level (p-value < 0.001). Additionally, 2 intermediate (IM) cases (0.03%) (45-55 CGG repeats) showed poor increase in expression level (p-value = 0.02838) plus 6 full mutation (FM) patients (0.07%) with (> 200 CGG repeats) (p-value < 0.001) resulted in FMR1 gene silence. Molecular diagnostic assay including (MS-PCR) and (qRT-PCR) proved to be a sensitive and rapid screening tool for the detection of premutation cases. Furthermore, the presence of positive correlation between FMR1 mRNA expression levels with CGG repeats in premutation cases could serve as a potential diagnostic marker. Application of these diagnostic tools on larger number clinically suspected cases is recommended."

    "abstract": "Social attention is a critical skill for learning and development. Social attention difficulties are present in both non-syndromic autism spectrum disorder (nsASD) and fragile X syndrome (FXS), and our understanding of these difficulties is complicated by heterogeneity in both disorders, including co-occurring diagnoses like intellectual disability and social anxiety. Existing research largely utilizes a single index of social attention and rarely includes children with intellectual impairment or uses a cross-syndrome approach. This study investigated whether multi-trait social attention profiles including naturalistic initial eye contact, facial attention, and social scene attention differ in preschool children with nsASD and FXS matched on developmental ability (DQ) and contrasted to neurotypical (NT) controls. The relationship between DQ, ASD severity, and social anxiety and social attention profiles was also examined. Initial eye contact related to social scene attention, implicating that naturalistic social attention is consistent with responses during experimental conditions. Reduced eye contact and lower social scene attention characterized nsASD and FXS. Children with nsASD displayed less facial attention than FXS and NT children, who did not differ. Lower DQ and elevated ASD severity associated with decreased eye contact in nsASD and FXS, and lower DQ was associated with lower social scene attention in FXS. Sex, social anxiety, and age were not associated with social attention. These findings suggest social attention profiles of children with nsASD are highly similar to, yet distinct from, children with FXS. Children with nsASD may present with a global social attention deficit whereas FXS profiles may reflect context-dependent social avoidance."

    "abstract": "Motor behavior requires the balanced production and integration of a variety of neural cell types. Motor neurons are positioned in discrete locations in the spinal cord, targeting specific muscles to drive locomotive contractions. Specialized spinal interneurons modulate and synchronize motor neuron activity to achieve coordinated motor output. Changes in the ratios and connectivity of spinal interneurons could drastically alter motor output by tipping the balance of inhibition and excitation onto target motor neurons. Importantly, individuals with Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and associated autism spectrum disorders often have significant motor challenges, including repetitive behaviors and epilepsy. FXS stems from the transcriptional silencing of the gene Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1), which encodes an RNA binding protein that is implicated in a multitude of crucial neurodevelopmental processes, including cell specification. Our work shows that Fmrp regulates the formation of specific interneurons and motor neurons that comprise early embryonic motor circuits. We find that zebrafish <i>fmr1</i> mutants generate surplus ventral lateral descending (VeLD) interneurons, an early-born cell derived from the motor neuron progenitor domain (pMN). As VeLD interneurons are hypothesized to act as central pattern generators driving the earliest spontaneous movements, this imbalance could influence the formation and long-term function of motor circuits driving locomotion. <i>fmr1</i> embryos also show reduced expression of proteins associated with inhibitory synapses, including the presynaptic transporter vGAT and the postsynaptic scaffold Gephyrin. Taken together, we show changes in embryonic motor circuit formation in <i>fmr1</i> mutants that could underlie persistent hyperexcitability."

The global prevalence of POI is approximately about 1.1%, and it severely affects female fertility. Nevertheless, bibliometric analysis in this field is extremely limited. We aimed to visualize the research hotspots and trends of POI using bibliometric analysis and tried to predict the future development of this field. The original articles regarding POI were culled from the Web of Science Core Collection. Countries, institutions, journals, authors, and keywords in this field were visually analyzed by employing CiteSpace software and Microsoft Excel 2021 software. A total of 2,999 publications were included for further bibliometric analysis after screening the titles and abstracts stringently. The number of literature regarding POI significantly increased yearly. These publications come from 78 countries. The USA was dominant in the field of POI in terms of the number of publications (865), average citations per item (57.36), and <i>h</i>-index (112). The <i>Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale Inserm</i> is the most high-yield institution in this field with 351 publications. <i>Fertility and Sterility</i> ranked first with the highest number of publications (152), followed by <i>Human Reproduction</i> (138). According to the keyword cluster analysis from 2000 to 2021, the eight keyword clusters encountered frequently were apoptosis, osteoporosis, fertility preservation, mutation, fragile x syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, DNA repair, ovarian reserve. Keyword citation burst analysis revealed that whole-exome sequencing, ovarian tissue cryopreservation, and DNA repair had a citation burst until 2021. Great progress has been made in POI research over the past 20 years, which is widely researched but unevenly developed in the world. In terms of influence, the United States may be in the lead. The research hotspots in POI are mainly pathogenesis and treatment, including genetic mutation, hormone therapy, fertility preservation, and stem cell transplantation."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a major neurodevelopmental disorder and the most common monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). FXS is caused by a mutation in the X-linked FMR1 gene leading to the absence of the FMRP protein, inducing several behavioral deficits, including motor, emotional, cognitive, and social abnormalities. Beside its clear genetic origins, FXS can be modulated by environmental factors, e.g., stress exposure: indeed the behavioral phenotype of FXS, as well as of ASD patients can be exacerbated by the repeated experience of stressful events, especially early in life. Here we investigated the long-term effects of prenatal exposure to unpredictable chronic stress on the behavioral phenotype of the Fmr1-knock-out (KO) mouse model for FXS and ASD. Mice were tested for FXS- and ASD-relevant behaviors first at adulthood (3 months) and then at aging (18 months), in order to assess the persistence and the potential time-related progression of the stress effects. Stress induced the selective emergence of behavioral deficits in Fmr1-KO mice that were evident in spatial memory only at aging. Stress also exerted several age-specific behavioral effects in mice of both genotypes: at adulthood it enhanced anxiety levels and reduced social interaction, while at aging it enhanced locomotor activity and reduced the complexity of ultrasonic calls. Our findings underline the relevance of gene-environment interactions in mouse models of neurodevelopmental syndromes and highlight the long-term behavioral impact of prenatal stress in laboratory mice."

We further demonstrate the rapid ubiquitination of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein, FMRP, and the AMPA receptor subunit, GluA1, which are known to be key events in the regulation of synaptic protein synthesis and plasticity.

Little is known, however, concerning the impact of behavioral treatments for these behaviors on functional brain connectivity in this population. As part of a larger study, boys with FXS (mean age 13.23 ± 2.31 years) and comparison boys with ASD (mean age 12.15 ± 2.76 years) received resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans prior to and following social gaze training administered by a trained behavior therapist in our laboratory. Network-agnostic connectome-based predictive modeling of pretreatment resting-state functional connectivity data revealed a set of positive (FXS > ASD) and negative (FXS < ASD) edges that differentiated the groups significantly and consistently across all folds of cross-validation. Following administration of the brief training, the FXS and ASD groups demonstrated reorganization of connectivity differences. The divergence in the spatial pattern of reorganization response, based on functional connectivity differences pretreatment, suggests a unique pattern of response to treatment in the FXS and ASD groups. These results provide further support for implementing targeted behavioral treatments to ameliorate syndrome-specific behavioral features in FXS."

To mimic human neuron development in vivo, we coinjected neural precursor cells derived from FXS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and neural precursor cells derived from corrected isogenic control induced pluripotent stem cells into the brain of neonatal immune-deprived mice. The transplanted cells populated the brain and a proportion differentiated into neurons and glial cells. Immunofluorescence and single and bulk RNA sequencing analyses showed accelerated maturation of FXS neurons after an initial delay. Additionally, we found increased percentages of Arc- and Egr-1-positive FXS neurons and wider dendritic protrusions of mature FXS striatal medium spiny neurons. This transplantation approach provides new insights into the alterations of neuronal development in FXS by facilitating physiological development of cells in a 3-dimensional context."

Here, we describe an optimized methodology, based on combined use of DiI and immunofluorescence, for rapid and sensitive characterization of the structure and composition of spines in native brain tissue. We successfully demonstrate the applicability of this approach by examining the properties of hippocampal spines in juvenile <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice, a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome. We find that mutant mice display pervasive dysgenesis of spines evidenced by an overabundance of both abnormally elongated thin spines and cup-shaped spines, in combination with reduced density of mushroom spines. We further find that mushroom spines expressing the actin-binding protein Synaptopodin-a marker for spine apparatus-are more prevalent in mutant mice. Previous work identified spines with Synaptopodin/spine apparatus as the locus of mGluR-LTD, which is abnormally elevated in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. Altogether, our data suggest this enhancement may be linked to the preponderance of this subset of spines in the mutant. Overall, these findings demonstrate the sensitivity and versatility of the optimized methodology by uncovering a novel facet of spine dysgenesis in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice."

    "abstract": "How fragile X syndrome protein (FMRP) binds mRNAs and regulates mRNA metabolism remains unclear. Our previous work using human neuronal cells focused on mRNAs targeted for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which we showed are generally bound by FMRP and destabilized upon FMRP loss. Here, we identify >400 high-confidence FMRP-bound mRNAs, only ∼35% of which are NMD targets. Integrative transcriptomics together with SILAC-LC-MS/MS reveal that FMRP loss generally results in mRNA destabilization and more protein produced per FMRP target. We use our established RIP-seq technology to show that FMRP footprints are independent of protein-coding potential, target GC-rich and structured sequences, and are densest in 5' UTRs. Regardless of where within an mRNA FMRP binds, we find that FMRP protects mRNAs from deadenylation and directly binds the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein. Our results reveal how FMRP sequesters polyadenylated mRNAs into stabilized and translationally repressed complexes, whose regulation is critical for neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity."

Assessment of mosaicism for active-unmethylated alleles has prognostic utility. This study examined relationships between FMR1 methylation in different tissues with FMR1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and intellectual functioning in 87 males with FXS (1.89-43.17 years of age). Methylation sensitive Southern blot (mSB) and Methylation Specific-Quantitative Melt Aanalysis (MS-QMA) were used to examine FMR1 methylation. FMR1 mRNA levels in blood showed strong relationships with FMR1 methylation assessed using MS-QMA in blood (n = 68; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.597; p = 1.4 × 10<sup>-10</sup> ) and buccal epithelial cells (BEC) (n = 62; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.24; p = 0.003), with these measures also showing relationships with intellectual functioning scores (p < 0.01). However, these relationships were not as strong for mSB, with ~40% of males with only FM alleles that were 100% methylated and non-mosaic by mSB, showing methylation mosaicism by MS-QMA. This was confirmed through presence of detectable levels of FMR1 mRNA in blood. In summary, FMR1 methylation levels in blood and BEC examined by MS-QMA were significantly associated with FMR1 mRNA levels and intellectual functioning in males with FXS. These relationships were not as strong for mSB, which underestimated prevalence of mosaicism."

    "abstract": "Loss of functional fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) causes fragile X syndrome, the leading form of inherited intellectual disability and the most common monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorders. FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that controls neuronal mRNA localization and translation. FMRP is thought to inhibit translation elongation after being recruited to target transcripts via binding RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) within the coding sequence. Here, we directly test this model and report that FMRP inhibits translation independent of mRNA G4s. Furthermore, we found that the RGG box motif together with its natural C-terminal domain forms a noncanonical RNA-binding domain (ncRBD) that is essential for translational repression. The ncRBD elicits broad RNA-binding ability and binds to multiple reporter mRNAs and all four homopolymeric RNAs. Serial deletion analysis of the ncRBD identified that the regions required for mRNA binding and translational repression overlap but are not identical. Consistent with FMRP stalling elongating ribosomes and causing the accumulation of slowed 80S ribosomes, transcripts bound by FMRP via the ncRBD cosediment with heavier polysomes and were present in puromycin-resistant ribosome complexes. Together, this work identifies a ncRBD and translational repression domain that shifts our understanding of how FMRP inhibits translation independent of mRNA G4s."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the loss of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP) encoded by the <i>FMR1</i> gene. Gene therapy using adeno-associated virus (AAV) to restore FMRP expression is a promising therapeutic strategy. However, so far AAV gene therapy tests for FXS only utilized rodent FMRPs driven by promoters other than the human <i>FMR1</i> promoter. Restoration of human FMRP in appropriate cell types and at physiological levels, preferably driven by the human <i>FMR1</i> promoter, would be more suitable for its clinical use. Herein, we generated two human <i>FMR1</i> promoter subdomains that effectively drive gene expression. When AAVs expressing two different human FMRP isoforms under the control of a human <i>FMR1</i> promoter subdomain were administered into bilateral ventricles of neonatal <i>Fmr1</i> <sup>-/y</sup> and wild-type (WT) mice, both human FMRP isoforms were expressed throughout the brain in a pattern reminiscent to that of mouse FMRP. Importantly, human FMRP expression attenuated social behavior deficits and stereotyped and repetitive behavior, and reversed dysmorphological dendritic spines in <i>Fmr1</i> <sup>-/y</sup> mice, without affecting WT mouse behaviors. Our results demonstrate that human <i>FMR1</i> promoter can effectively drive human FMRP expression in the brain to attenuate <i>Fmr1</i> <sup>-/y</sup> mouse deficits, strengthening the notion of using AAV gene therapy for FXS treatment."

    "title": "Increased Serum Levels of miR-125b and miR-132 in Fragile X Syndrome: A Preliminary Study.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, identified as the most common cause of hereditary intellectual disability and monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), caused by the loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA-binding protein, a regulator of translation that plays an important role in neurodevelopment, and its loss causes cognitive and behavioral deficits. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small molecules that regulate gene expression in diverse biological processes. Previous studies found that the interaction of FMRP with miR-125b and miR-132 regulates the maturation and synaptic plasticity in animal models and miRNA dysregulation plays a role in the pathophysiology of FXS. The present study aimed to analyze the expression of miR-125b-5p and miR-132-3p in the serum of patients with FXS. The expressions of circulating miRNAs were studied in the serum of 10 patients with FXS and 20 controls using the real-time quantitative retrotranscribed method analyzed by relative quantification. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were generated to assess the diagnostic values of the miRNAs. We found that both miR-125b and miR-132 were increased in the serum of patients with FXS compared with controls and likely involved with FMRP loss. The AUC (95% confidence interval) of miR-125b and miR-132 was 0.94 (0.86-1.0) and 0.89 (0.77-1.0), respectively. Databases allowed for the identification of possible target genes for miR-125b and miR-132, whose products play an important role in the homeostasis of the nervous system. Our results indicate that serum miR-125b and miR-132 may serve as potential biomarkers for FXS. The increased expression of circulating miR-125b and miR-132 seems to be associated with the genotype of FXS. Predicted gene targets of the differentially regulated miRNAs are involved in cognitive performance and ASD phenotype. This study provides Class III evidence that miR-125b and miR-132 distinguish men with FXS from normal controls."

    "title": "Chloride imbalance in Fragile X syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Developmental changes in ionic balance are associated with crucial hallmarks in neural circuit formation, including changes in excitation and inhibition, neurogenesis, and synaptogenesis. Neuronal excitability is largely mediated by ionic concentrations inside and outside of the cell, and chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) ions are highly influential in early neurodevelopmental events. For example, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of the mature central nervous system (CNS). However, during early development GABA can depolarize target neurons, and GABAergic depolarization is implicated in crucial neurodevelopmental processes. This developmental shift of GABAergic neurotransmission from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing output is induced by changes in Cl<sup>-</sup> gradients, which are generated by the relative expression of Cl<sup>-</sup> transporters Nkcc1 and Kcc2. Interestingly, the GABA polarity shift is delayed in Fragile X syndrome (FXS) models; FXS is one of the most common heritable neurodevelopmental disorders. The RNA binding protein FMRP, encoded by the gene Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein-1 (Fmr1) and absent in FXS, appears to regulate chloride transporter expression. This could dramatically influence FXS phenotypes, as the syndrome is hypothesized to be rooted in defects in neural circuit development and imbalanced excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) neurotransmission. In this perspective, we summarize canonical Cl<sup>-</sup> transporter expression and investigate altered gene and protein expression of Nkcc1 and Kcc2 in FXS models. We then discuss interactions between Cl<sup>-</sup> transporters and neurotransmission complexes, and how these links could cause imbalances in inhibitory neurotransmission that may alter mature circuits. Finally, we highlight current therapeutic strategies and promising new directions in targeting Cl<sup>-</sup> transporter expression in FXS patients."

    "abstract": "The K-homology (KH) domains are small, structurally conserved domains found in proteins of different origins characterized by a central conserved βααβ \"core\" and a GxxG motif in the loop between the two helices of the KH core. In the eukaryotic KHI type, additional αβ elements decorate the \"core\" at the C-terminus. Proteins containing KH domains perform different functions and several diseases have been associated with mutations in these domains, including those in the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA-binding protein crucial for the control of RNA metabolism whose lack or mutations lead to fragile X syndrome (FXS). Among missense mutations, the R138Q substitution is in the KH0 degenerated domain lacking the classical GxxG motif. By combining equilibrium and kinetic experiments, we present a characterization of the folding mechanism of the KH0 domain from the FMRP wild-type and of the R138Q variant showing that in both cases the folding mechanism implies the accumulation of an on-pathway transient intermediate. Moreover, by exploiting a battery of biophysical techniques, we show that the KH0 domain has the propensity to form amyloid-like aggregates in mild conditions in vitro and that the R138Q mutation leads to a general destabilization of the protein and to an increased fibrillogenesis propensity."

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an early onset, developmental disorder whose genetic cause is heterogeneous and complex. In total, 70% of ASD cases are due to an unknown etiology. Among the monogenic causes of ASD, fragile X syndrome (FXS) accounts for 2-4% of ASD cases, and 60% of individuals with FXS present with ASD. Epigenetic changes, specifically DNA methylation, which modulates gene expression levels, play a significant role in the pathogenesis of both disorders. Thus, in this study, using the Human Methylation EPIC Bead Chip, we examined the global DNA methylation profiles of biological samples derived from 57 age-matched male participants (2-6 years old), including 23 subjects with ASD, 23 subjects with FXS with ASD (FXSA) and 11 typical developing (TD) children. After controlling for technical variation and white blood cell composition, using the conservatory threshold of the false discovery rate (FDR ≤ 0.05), in the three comparison groups, TD vs. AD, TD vs. FXSA and ASD vs. FXSA, we identified 156, 79 and 3100 differentially methylated sites (DMS), and 14, 13 and 263 differential methylation regions (DMRs). Interestingly, several genes differentially methylated among the three groups were among those listed in the SFARI Gene database, including the <i>PAK2</i>, <i>GTF2I</i> and <i>FOXP1</i> genes important for brain development. Further, enrichment analyses identified pathways involved in several functions, including synaptic plasticity. Our preliminary study identified a significant role of altered DNA methylation in the pathology of ASD and FXS, suggesting that the characterization of a DNA methylation signature may help to unravel the pathogenicity of FXS and ASD and may help the development of an improved diagnostic classification of children with ASD and FXSA. In addition, it may pave the way for developing therapeutic interventions that could reverse the altered methylome profile in children with neurodevelopmental disorders."

    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders are a heterogeneous group of behaviorally defined disorders with both genetic and environmental risk factors. Given that many neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by impaired learning and/or intellectual abilities, behavioral paradigms that assess cognition in animal models have been effective tools in delineating underlying genetic variants that impact disease pathophysiology. For example, learning and memory paradigms in the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have been successfully used to study risk genes and biological pathways associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including fragile X syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, and CHARGE syndrome. While these established Drosophila behavioral paradigms have historically been used to investigate genetic risk factors, they also have many other applications, including use in developmental neurotoxicology studies to determine environmental risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders. There is, however, a deficit of step-by-step protocols that describe how to apply learning and memory assays in fruit flies to developmental neurotoxicology studies. Here, we describe two quantitative behavioral paradigms for Drosophila-predator-induced oviposition and courtship conditioning-that can be used to measure different forms of learning and memory in the context of a developmental neurotoxicology study. Non-associative learning and memory are measured here by examining female Drosophila oviposition behavior in response to endoparasitoid wasps, while associative learning and memory are measured in males using courtship conditioning. Our protocols outline procedures for oral toxicant exposure of developing fruit flies, culturing of endoparasitoid wasps, measuring Drosophila oviposition activity, and assessing conditioned courtship in order to identify the impact of toxicants on learning and memory in both females and males. As an example, we present the protocols using bisphenol A, a chemical utilized in the synthesis of polycarbonate plastics, to determine its impacts on learning and memory. These protocols are inexpensive and relatively simple to perform, and can be used by labs that are new to Drosophila behavioral research to evaluate how toxicant exposure influences learning and memory in male and female flies. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

    "abstract": "Fragile X-associated premature ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) is among a family of disorders caused by expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat sequence located in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome. Women with FXPOI have a depleted ovarian follicle population, resulting in amenorrhea, hypoestrogenism, and loss of fertility before the age of 40. FXPOI is caused by expansions of the CGG sequence to lengths between 55 and 200 repeats, known as a FMRI premutation, however the mechanism by which the premutation drives disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Two main hypotheses exist, which describe an mRNA toxic gain-of-function mechanism or a protein-based mechanism, where repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation results in the production of an abnormal protein, called FMRpolyG. Here, we have developed an in vitro granulosa cell model of the FMR1 premutation by ectopically expressing CGG-repeat RNA and FMRpolyG protein. We show that expanded CGG-repeat RNA accumulated in intranuclear RNA structures, and these aggregates were able to cause significant granulosa cell death independent of FMRpolyG expression. Using an innovative RNA pulldown, mass spectrometry-based approach we have identified proteins that are specifically sequestered by CGG RNA aggregates in granulosa cells in vitro, and thus may be deregulated as consequence of this interaction. Furthermore, we have demonstrated reduced expression of three proteins identified via our RNA pulldown (FUS, PA2G4 and TRA2β) in ovarian follicles in a FMR1 premutation mouse model. Collectively, these data provide evidence for the contribution of an mRNA gain-of-function mechanism to FXPOI disease biology."

    "abstract": "Fragile X-Syndrome (FXS) represents the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and the leading monogenic cause of Autism Spectrum Disorders. In most cases, this disease results from the absence of expression of the protein FMRP encoded by the <i>FMR1</i> gene (Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1). FMRP is mainly defined as a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein regulating the local translation of thousands of target mRNAs. Interestingly, FMRP is also able to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. However, to date, its roles in the nucleus of mammalian neurons are just emerging. To broaden our insight into the contribution of nuclear FMRP in mammalian neuronal physiology, we identified here a nuclear interactome of the protein by combining subcellular fractionation of rat forebrains with pull- down affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis. By this approach, we listed 55 candidate nuclear partners. This interactome includes known nuclear FMRP-binding proteins as Adar or Rbm14 as well as several novel candidates, notably Ddx41, Poldip3, or Hnrnpa3 that we further validated by target-specific approaches. Through our approach, we identified factors involved in different steps of mRNA biogenesis, as transcription, splicing, editing or nuclear export, revealing a potential central regulatory function of FMRP in the biogenesis of its target mRNAs. Therefore, our work considerably enlarges the nuclear proteins interaction network of FMRP in mammalian neurons and lays the basis for exciting future mechanistic studies deepening the roles of nuclear FMRP in neuronal physiology and the etiology of the FXS."

    "abstract": "FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that represses the translation of specific mRNAs. In neurons, its depletion determines the exaggerated translation of mRNAs leading to dendritic and axonal aberrant development, two peculiar features of Fragile X syndrome patients. However, how FMRP binds to translational machinery to regulate the translation of its mRNA targets is not yet fully understood. Here, we show that FMRP localizes on translational machinery by interacting with the ribosomal binding protein, Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1). The binding of FMRP to RACK1 removes the translational repressive activity of FMRP and promotes the translation of <i>PSD-95</i> mRNA, one specific target of FMRP. This binding also results in a reduction in the level of FMRP phosphorylation. We also find that the morphological abnormalities induced by <i>Fmr1</i> siRNA in cortical neurons are rescued by the overexpression of a mutant form of RACK1 that cannot bind ribosomes. Thus, these results provide a new mechanism underlying FMRP activity that contributes to altered development in FXS. Moreover, these data confirm the role of ribosomal RACK1 as a ribosomal scaffold for RNA binding proteins."

    "abstract": "The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an mRNA binding protein that is essential for neural circuit assembly and synaptic plasticity. Loss of functional FMRP leads to Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by sensory dysfunction including abnormal auditory processing. While the central mechanisms of FMRP regulation have been studied in the brain, whether FMRP is expressed in the auditory periphery and how it develops and functions remains unknown. In this study, we characterized the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of FMRP immunoreactivity in the inner ear of mice, rats, gerbils, and chickens. Across species, FMRP was expressed in hair cells and supporting cells, with a particularly high level in immature hair cells during the prehearing period. Interestingly, the distribution of cytoplasmic FMRP displayed an age-dependent translocation in hair cells, and this feature was conserved across species. In the auditory ganglion (AG), FMRP immunoreactivity was detected in neuronal cell bodies as well as their peripheral and central processes. Distinct from hair cells, FMRP intensity in AG neurons was high both during development and after maturation. Additionally, FMRP was evident in mature glial cells surrounding AG neurons. Together, these observations demonstrate distinct developmental trajectories across cell types in the auditory periphery. Given the importance of peripheral inputs to the maturation of auditory circuits, these findings implicate involvement of FMRP in inner ear development as well as a potential contribution of periphery FMRP to the generation of auditory dysfunction in FXS."

This study is designed to better understand these symptoms in school-age girls, particularly as they relate to age, social skills, and functional outcomes. We compared 58 girls aged 6 to 16 years with FXS with 46 age-matched, sex-matched, and developmentally matched peers without FXS on measures of anxiety, depression, social skills, adaptive behavior, and quality of life. Girls with FXS 10.5 years and older demonstrated significantly higher levels of depression, withdrawal, and social avoidance than girls younger than 10.5 years with FXS ( p -values < 0.01). Girls in the comparison group did not show any age-related differences on these measures. The older FXS cohort also showed associations between social communication and interaction skills, adaptive behavior, and measures of anxiety and depression ( p -values < 0.05) not seen in the comparison group, regardless of age. We found that age seems to play an important role in the development of mood symptoms and that such symptoms are uniquely correlated with social communication and reciprocal social interaction behaviors and adaptive functioning in girls with FXS after puberty. These data suggest a critical window of intervention for girls with FXS in the improvement of social interaction skills and the prevention of social avoidance and symptoms of anxiety and depression, with the ultimate goal of improving quality of life and promoting greater independence."

Namely, preclinical models of both conditions show overactivity of the mTOR signaling pathway as well as GABAergic alterations. However, despite its potential clinical relevance for these disorders, the GABAergic system has not been systematically studied in humans. In the present study, we used an extensive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) assessment battery in combination with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to provide a comprehensive picture of the main inhibitory neurotransmitter system in patients with FXS and NF1. Forty-three participants took part in the TMS session (15 FXS, 10 NF1, 18 controls) and 36 in the MRS session (11 FXS, 14 NF1, 11 controls). Results show that, in comparison to healthy control participants, individuals with FXS and NF1 display lower GABA concentration levels as measured with MRS. TMS result show that FXS patients present increased GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated inhibition compared to controls and NF1 patients, and that GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated intracortical inhibition was associated with increased excitability specifically in the FXS groups. In line with previous reports, correlational analyses between MRS and TMS measures did not show significant relationships between GABA-related metrics, but several TMS measures correlated with glutamate+glutamine (Glx) levels assessed with MRS. Overall, these results suggest a partial overlap in neurophysiological alterations involving the GABA system in NF1 and FXS, and support the hypothesis that MRS and TMS assess different aspects of the neurotransmitter systems."

Excitatory synapses have a wide range of PSD95 lifetimes extending from hours to several months, with distinct spatial distributions in dendrites, neurons, and brain regions. Synapses with short protein lifetimes are enriched in young animals and in brain regions controlling innate behaviors, whereas synapses with long protein lifetimes accumulate during development, are enriched in the cortex and CA1 where memories are stored, and are preferentially preserved in old age. Synapse protein lifetime increases throughout the brain in a mouse model of autism and schizophrenia. Protein lifetime adds a further layer to synapse diversity and enriches prevailing concepts in brain development, aging, and disease."

Symptomatology includes both traditional Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) anxiety disorders and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related anxiety traits. Some genetic disorders such as Cornelia de Lange (CdLS) and fragile X syndromes (FXS) are at very high risk of anxiety and afford the opportunity to examine prevalence, profiles and associated person characteristics. However, prevalence and associated characteristics of anxiety in these high-risk groups remain poorly described and understood. The aim of the current study was to examine the prevalence and profile of DSM-5 and ASD-related anxiety symptomatology in individuals with CdLS and FXS and associated behavioural and cognitive characteristics. Questionnaires and interviews assessing DSM-5 and ASD-related anxiety were conducted with caregivers of individuals with CdLS (n = 49) and FXS (n = 36). DSM-5 anxiety symptomatology was present in both groups with high co-morbidity across anxiety diagnoses. ASD-related anxiety was also prevalent with specific difficulties related to intolerance of uncertainty identified in both groups. Symptomatology was persistent over the lifespan for both groups. Anxiety type was partially associated with repetitive behaviour but not measures of overall ASD phenomenology in CdLS. DSM-5 and ASD-related anxiety are common in these high-risk syndromes associated with ID. Prospective syndrome specific presentations and associations, which may implicate specific underlying mechanisms, are discussed. Clinicians should be aware of the risk and difficulties involved in assessment of anxiety in individuals with ID, including atypical types, to ensure these individuals do not \"miss\" diagnoses and support in general clinical practice."

The aim of this study was to investigate patterns of participation by healthcare providers (HCP) and the community in screening. Participation in a Victorian program screening for CF, SMA and FXS between September 2013 and October 2018 was analysed. Requesting HCP and patient data were extracted from screening request forms. Data were analysed with respect to profession of requesting HCP, and characteristics of women screened (age, pregnancy status, socioeconomic status, geographic location, and family history of CF, SMA or FXS). In total, 21 172 women and 1288 HCPs participated in the program over this period. There was a steep socioeconomic gradient in screening uptake, with nearly half the women screened (10 349) being in the highest socioeconomic quintile. The screening rate was much higher in metropolitan areas than in regional areas. Obstetricians made most of the requests for screening, whereas 20% of requests were by GPs. Most participating GPs only made a single screening request (78%) and very few GPs made >100 screening requests compared with obstetricians (0.2% vs 17%). GPs were more likely to screen women before pregnancy compared with obstetricians (47% vs 11%). Approximately 1.5% of Victorian women of child-bearing age and 3% of pregnant Victorian women were screened by this program over the period of this study. This study highlights the translation gap between recommendations and practice, with marked inequity of access to reproductive genetic carrier screening in relation to socioeconomic status and geography. Increased participation by GPs could improve community access to reproductive genetic carrier screening, particularly access to preconception screening. Addressing the causes of inequity of access will allow more women and couples the opportunity to make informed choices about participation in screening."

Sensory and especially auditory hypersensitivity is a key symptom in patients, which is well mimicked in the <i>Fmr1 -/-</i> mouse model. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying FXS's acoustic hypersensitivity in particular remain poorly understood. Here, we categorized spike response patterns to pure tones of different frequencies and intensities from neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC), a central integrator in the ascending auditory pathway. Based on this categorization we analyzed differences in response patterns between IC neurons of wild-type (WT) and <i>Fmr1 -/-</i> mice. Our results report broadening of frequency tuning, an increased firing in response to monaural as well as binaural stimuli, an altered balance of excitation-inhibition, and reduced response latencies, all expected features of acoustic hypersensitivity. Furthermore, we noticed that all neuronal response types in <i>Fmr1 -/-</i> mice displayed enhanced offset-rebound activity outside their excitatory frequency response area. These results provide evidence that the loss of <i>Fmr1</i> not only increases spike responses in IC neurons similar to auditory brainstem neurons, but also changes response patterns such as offset spiking. One can speculate this to be an underlying aspect of the receptive language problems associated with Fragile X syndrome."

    "abstract": "The original Fragile X-associated Tremor Ataxia Syndrome Rating Scale (FXTAS-RS) contained 61 items, some requiring modifications to better meet recommendations for patient-focused rating scale development. Provide initial validation of a revised version of the FXTAS-RS for motor signs. We conducted a two-phase mixed-method approach. In Phase 1, revision, we implemented a Delphi technique identifying pertinent domains/subdomains and developing items through expert consensus. In Phase 2, content validation, we conducted cognitive pretesting assessing comprehensibility, comprehensiveness, and relevance of items to FXTAS motor signs. After five rounds of Delphi panel and two rounds of cognitive pretesting, the revised version of the FXTAS-RS was established with 18 items covering five domains and 13 subdomains of motor signs. Cognitive pretesting revealed adequate content validity for the assessment of FXTAS motor signs. The revised FXTAS-RS has been successfully validated for content and it is now ready for large-scale field validation."

    "title": "Function of FMRP Domains in Regulating Distinct Roles of Neuronal Protein Synthesis.",
    "abstract": "The Fragile-X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) is an RNA binding protein that regulates translation of mRNAs essential for synaptic development and plasticity. FMRP interacts with a specific set of mRNAs, aids in their microtubule-dependent transport and regulates their translation through its association with ribosomes. However, the biochemical role of FMRP's domains in forming neuronal granules and associating with microtubules and ribosomes is currently undefined. We report that the C-terminus domain of FMRP is sufficient to bind to ribosomes akin to the full-length protein. Furthermore, the C-terminus domain alone is essential and responsible for FMRP-mediated neuronal translation repression. However, dendritic distribution of FMRP and its microtubule association is favored by the synergistic combination of FMRP domains rather than individual domains. Interestingly, we show that the phosphorylation of hFMRP at Serine-500 is important in modulating the dynamics of translation by controlling ribosome association. This is a fundamental mechanism governing the size and number of FMRP puncta that contain actively translating ribosomes. Finally through the use of pathogenic mutations, we emphasize the hierarchical contribution of FMRP's domains in translation regulation."

    "title": "Long-term follow-up of telehealth-enabled behavioral treatment for challenging behaviors in boys with fragile X syndrome.",
    "abstract": "A significant proportion of boys with fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common known genetic cause of intellectual disability, exhibit challenging behaviors such as aggression and self-injury that can cause significant distress to families. Recent evidence suggests that coaching caregivers to implement functional communication training (FCT) with their child via telehealth can help to ameliorate these behaviors in FXS. In the present study, we followed families who had participated in our previous randomized controlled trial of FCT to evaluate the longer-term effects of FCT on challenging behaviors in this population. In study 1, follow-up emails, phone calls, text messages, and letters were sent to caregivers of 48 boys with FXS who had completed our previous study conducted between 2016 and 2019. The main outcome measures administered at follow-up were the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) and the Parenting Stress Index, 4th Edition (PSI-4). In study 2, families who had received FCT treatment but whose child exhibited challenging behaviors daily at follow-up received a 1-h parent training booster session to determine whether the intervention effect could be recovered. Sixteen (66.7%) of 24 families who had received FCT treatment and 18 (75.0%) of 24 families who had received treatment as usual were traced and consented between March and August 2021. The mean follow-up time was 3.1 years (range, 1.4 to 4.2 years). Longitudinal mixed effects analyses indicated that boys who had received FCT were more likely to show improvements on the irritability and lethargy/social withdrawal subscales of the ABC-C over the follow-up interval compared to boys who had continued with treatment as usual. Four of the six boys who had received the booster parent training session via telehealth were reported to exhibit fewer forms of challenging behavior at a 4-week follow-up. Empowering parents to implement behavior analytic treatments with their child in their own home can have durable effects on maintaining low levels of challenging behaviors in boys with FXS. These data further support the need to implement parent-mediated interventions for challenging behaviors in this population at an early age. ClinicalTrials.gov, <sup>NCT03510156</sup> .

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing number of clinical trials involving children with neurodevelopmental disorders, appropriate and objective outcome measures for behavioral symptoms are still required. This study assessed the agreement between parents' and clinical researchers' ratings of behavioral problem severity in children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) and chromosome 15 imprinting disorders. The cohort comprised 123 children (64% males), aged 3-17 years, with FXS (n = 79), Prader-Willi (PWS; n = 19), Angelman (AS; n = 15), and Chromosome 15q duplication (n = 10) syndromes. Specific items from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition and Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition mapping to corresponding behavioral domains were selected ad-hoc, to assess behavioral problems. Inter-rater agreement for the cohort was slight for self-injury (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) = 0.12), fair for tantrums/aggression (0.24) and mannerisms/stereotypies (0.25), and moderate for hyperactivity (0.48). When stratified by diagnosis, ICC ranged from poor (0; self-injury, AS and PWS) to substantial (0.48; hyperactivity, females with FXS). The high level of inter-rater disagreement across most domains suggests that parents' and researchers' assessments led to discrepant appraisal of behavioral problem severity. These findings have implications for treatment targets and outcome measure selection in clinical trials, supporting a multi-informant approach."

    "abstract": "Fragile X premutation carriers are reported to have increased neuropsychiatric problems, and thus the term fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (FXAND) has been proposed. Unfortunately, published prevalence estimates of these phenomena are inconsistent. This systematic review clarified this issue by reviewing both fragile X premutation prevalence in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and psychiatric disorder prevalence in premutation carriers without fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Average prevalence was derived from studies that used semistructured clinical interviews, diagnostic criteria, and validated rating scales. Forty-six studies were reviewed. The rate of fragile X premutation in neurodevelopmental disorders was assessed from five studies. Probands with neurodevelopmental disorders were more likely than those in the general population to be premutation carriers. The rate of psychiatric disorders in premutation carriers was assessed from five studies for neurodevelopmental, 13 studies for mood, 12 studies for anxiety, and two studies for psychotic disorders. The phenotype and sex distribution among premutation carriers were similar to those with fragile X syndrome. Compared to control group and general population estimates, the most prevalent psychiatric disorders were neurodevelopmental disorders, anxiety disorders, and bipolar II disorder. Psychiatric disorders were also more common in males. Most studies relied only on past medical history to define the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, yielding variability in results. Future studies are needed to avoid bias by identifying cohorts from population-based sampling, to describe cohort demographic characteristics to elucidate differences in age and sex, and to prioritize the use of validated psychiatric assessment methods."

Conventional FXS genetic testing methods mainly focus on FMR1 CGG expansions and fail to identify AGG interruptions, rare intragenic variants, and large gene deletions. A long-range PCR and long-read sequencing-based assay termed comprehensive analysis of FXS (CAFXS) was developed and evaluated in Coriell and clinical samples by comparing to Southern blot analysis and triplet repeat-primed PCR (TP-PCR). CAFXS accurately detected the number of CGG repeats in the range of 93 to at least 940 with mass fraction of 0.5% to 1% in the background of normal alleles, which was 2-4-fold analytically more sensitive than TP-PCR. All categories of mutations detected by control methods, including full mutations in 30 samples, were identified by CAFXS for all 62 clinical samples. CAFXS accurately determined AGG interruptions in all 133 alleles identified, even in mosaic alleles. CAFXS successfully identified 2 rare intragenic variants including the c.879A > C variant in exon 9 and a 697-bp microdeletion flanking upstream of CGG repeats, which disrupted primer annealing in TP-PCR assay. In addition, CAFXS directly determined the breakpoints of a 237.1-kb deletion and a 774.0-kb deletion encompassing the entire FMR1 gene in 2 samples. Long-read sequencing-based CAFXS represents a comprehensive assay for identifying FMR1 CGG expansions, AGG interruptions, rare intragenic variants, and large gene deletions, which greatly improves the genetic screening and diagnosis for FXS."

It is often characterized, especially in males, by intellectual disability, anxiety, repetitive behavior, social communication deficits, delayed language development, and abnormal sensory processing. Recently, we identified electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers that are conserved between the mouse model of FXS (Fmr1 KO mice) and humans with FXS. In this report, we evaluate small molecule target engagement utilizing multielectrode array electrophysiology in the Fmr1 KO mouse and in humans with FXS. Neurophysiologic target engagement was evaluated using single doses of the GABA<sub>B</sub> selective agonist racemic baclofen (RBAC). In Fmr1 KO mice and in humans with FXS, baclofen use was associated with suppression of elevated gamma power and increase in low-frequency power at rest. In the Fmr1 KO mice, a baclofen-associated improvement in auditory chirp synchronization was also noted. Overall, we noted synchronized target engagement of RBAC on resting state electrophysiology, in particular the reduction of aberrant high frequency gamma activity, across species in FXS. This finding holds promise for translational medicine approaches to drug development for FXS, synchronizing treatment study across species using well-established EEG biological markers in this field. The human experiments are registered under NCT02998151."

    "abstract": "The number of reported cases of neurodevelopmental disorders has increased significantly in the last few decades, but the etiology of these diseases remains poorly understood. There is evidence of a fundamental link between genetic abnormalities and symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and the most common monogenetic inheritable form of ASDs is Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Previous studies indicate that FXS is linked to glutamate signaling regulation by the G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), which has been shown to have a regulatory role in neuroinflammation. We characterized the effect of knocking out mGluR5 in an organism known to have complex cognitive functions-the rat. The heterozygous phenotype is the most clinically relevant; therefore, we performed analysis in heterozygous pups. We showed developmental abnormalities in heterozygous mGluR5 knockout rats, as well as a significant increase in chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL) expression, a hallmark indicator of early onset inflammation. We quantified an increase in microglial density in the knockout pups and quantified morphological phenotypes representative of greater reactivity in the male vs. female and postnatal day 28 heterozygous pups compared to postnatal day 14 heterozygous pups. In response to injury, reactive microglia release matrix metalloproteases, contribute to extracellular matrix (ECM) breakdown, and are responsible for eradicating cellular and molecular debris. In our study, the changes in microglial density and reactivity correlated with abnormalities in the mRNA expression levels of ECM proteins and with the density of perineuronal nets. We saw atypical neuropsychiatric behavior in open field and elevated plus tests in heterozygous pups compared to wild-type litter and age-matched controls. These results demonstrate the pathological potential of the mGluR5 knockout in rats and further support the presence of neuroinflammatory roots in ASDs."

Despite a common genetic etiology, the affected individuals display heterogenous metabolic abnormalities including hypocholesterolemia. Although changes in the metabolism of fatty acids (FAs) have been reported in various neuropsychiatric disorders, it has not been explored in humans with FXS. In this study, we investigated the FA profiles of two different groups: (1) an Argentinian group, including FXS individuals and age- and sex-matched controls, and (2) a French-Canadian group, including FXS individuals and their age- and sex-matched controls. Since phospholipid FAs are an indicator of medium-term diet and endogenous metabolism, we quantified the FA profile in plasma phospholipids using gas chromatography. Our results showed significantly lower levels in various plasma FAs including saturated, monosaturated, ω-6 polyunsaturated, and ω-3 polyunsaturated FAs in FXS individuals compared to the controls. A decrease in the EPA/ALA (eicosapentaenoic acid/alpha linoleic acid) ratio and an increase in the DPA/EPA (docosapentaenoic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid) ratio suggest an alteration associated with desaturase and elongase activity, respectively. We conclude that FXS individuals present an abnormal profile of FAs, specifically FAs belonging to the ω-3 family, that might open new avenues of treatment to improve core symptoms of the disorder."

People with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the leading known heritable cause of ASD and intellectual disability, were uniquely vulnerable to pandemic-related changes. This study surveyed parent perspectives of the impact on 33 school-aged children with FXS across daily living skills, education, therapies, behaviors, health visits, and mask wearing. Academic performance was perceived to have decreased in most of the children (58%). Students in online school had the most reports of decline and those in person had the most reported improvement. Parents were significantly more satisfied with services that remained in person compared to those delivered online or in hybrid settings. Additionally, depression (75%), sleep problems (80%), attention problems (73%), and social skills (61%) were reported to have worsened the most. Parents reported that in addition to continuing with a structured schedule, the most helpful strategies were increasing face-to-face social interactions and outdoor activities. Future research should explore strategies to help online interventions and education to be more successful with individuals with FXS, given this may become a resource for families not geographically able to access in-person resources."

    "abstract": "Caregiver reports, clinical observations, and diagnostic assessments indicate that most individuals with fragile X syndrome experience high levels of chronic anxiety. However, anxiety is a challenging endpoint for outcome measurement in FXS because most individuals cannot reliably report internal emotional or body states. A comprehensive survey of the presence, frequency, and duration of anxiety-related symptoms and questions to elicit open-ended responses was completed by caregivers of 456 individuals with FXS, ages 2-81 years (87 female, 369 male) and 24 female and 2 male FXS self-advocates ages 15-66 years. Caregivers reported classic behavioral indicators of anxiety, such as avoidance, irritability, motor agitation, and physiological symptoms, as well as behavioral features in FXS such as repetitive behavior, aggression, and self-injury. Self-advocate accounts largely paralleled caregiver data. Factor analyses yielded four factors: (1) increased irritability, aggression, and self-injury; (2) increased physical movement, nervous activity, and restlessness; (3) physical and physiological features of anxiety; and (4) internalizing and gastrointestinal symptoms. Caregivers are capable of observing and reporting behaviors that are valid indicators of anxious states that are usually reported in self-report standardized assessments. These results support the development of an anxiety measure for FXS that minimizes problems with rater inference."

This involved identifying the reasons individuals with FXS continue to reside with family and the reservations caregivers have regarding future supports and living arrangements. We administered an anonymous online survey consisting of 34 questions assessing eligibility, living arrangements/supports, and future concerns. We found that most individuals with FXS were affected with moderate Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) and co-occurring behavioral conditions but had overall good health. The majority of individuals with FXS currently resided with family due to parental desire, their own desire, and the inability to live independently. For one-third of caregivers, the plan for future living arrangements is to continue residing with family members long-term. A large proportion of caregivers had not considered alternative arrangements or were unsure. More than 70% of caregivers of individuals with FXS are concerned about multiple aspects of the individual's future. Caregivers of younger individuals are the most concerned, but also believe they have time before they need to plan or are unable to currently assess the future need for support."

Size and methylation mosaicisms are commonly observed in FXS patients. Both types of mosaicisms might be associated with less severe phenotypes depending on the number of cells expressing FMRP. Although this dynamic mutation is the main underlying cause of FXS, other mechanisms, including point mutations or deletions, can lead to FXS. Several reports have demonstrated that <i>de novo</i> deletions including the entire or a portion of the <i>FMR1</i> gene end up with the absence of FMRP and, thus, can lead to the typical clinical features of FXS. However, very little is known about the clinical manifestations associated with <i>FMR1</i> gene deletions in mosaicism. Here, we report an FXS case caused by an entire hemizygous deletion of the <i>FMR1</i> gene caused by maternal mosaicism. This manuscript reports this case and a literature review of the clinical manifestations presented by carriers of <i>FMR1</i> gene deletions in mosaicism."

This is a qualitative study that utilized a voluntary-anonymous survey that consisted of questions regarding demographics, medical information, the form, type, brand, dose, and frequency of CBD use, the rationale for use, the perception of effects, side effects, and costs. The full survey contained a total of 34 questions, including multiple-choice, Likert-scale, and optional free-response questions. This research revealed that there are a wide range of types, brands, and doses of CBD being administered to individuals with FXS by their parents and caregivers. There were many reasons why CBD was chosen, the most common ones being that respondents had heard positive things about CBD from members of the community, the perception that CBD had fewer side effects than other medications, and because respondents felt that CBD was a more natural substance. Most of the parents and caregivers who responded agreed that CBD improved some of the symptoms of FXS and made a positive difference overall. CBD has the therapeutic potential to help relieve some FXS symptoms. Future research is necessary to understand the benefits of CBD in FXS."

This included infant siblings of children with ASD (ASIBs) and infants with fragile X syndrome (FXS). First, alternative head models for use with ASIBs and FXS were investigated. Head models created from the infant's own MRI were examined in relation to five head models based on average MRI templates. The results of the head model comparison identified group-specific (i.e., ASIB or FXS) head models created from a large collection of structural MRIs as the best substitution for the head model created from the participant's own structural MRI. Second, the cortical source analysis was completed on N290 data collected from a previous study to investigate brain areas associated with face sensitive ERP responses. Participants' own MRIs were used for head models when available, and the group-specific head model was used when the participants' own MRIs were not available. The results provide evidence for unique patterns of neural activation during face processing across infants at high and low risk for ASD and across etiologically distinct high-risk groups. All infants demonstrated greater activation to faces than toys in brain areas most associated with specialized face processing. Infants with FXS displayed higher levels of activation to faces across all areas analyzed, while ASIBs show more muted levels of activation. Overall, the results of the current study demonstrate the importance of group-specific head models for accurate cortical source analysis in infants at high risk for ASD. This also allows for further research on early distinctions in brain function based on risk status."

FMR1 presents multiple isoforms resulting from skipping of exons 12 and 14 and the use of alternative splice sites in exons 15 and 17. To investigate the expression of Fmr1 splicing variants during folliculogenesis in the rat. We used preantral, early antral and preovulatory follicles to isolate RNA and characterise, by fluorescent PCR followed by sequencing, all the isoforms present in the different follicular stages. We identified two isoforms resulting from splicing of exon 12, six isoforms resulting from splicing of exon 14 and 15 and one isoform for exon 17. The expression levels of the isoforms vary within each follicular stage but not between different stages of folliculogenesis. Importantly, we identify for the first time in rat, an isoform that contains exon 12 and two isoforms, one that includes and one that excludes exon 14 and use the third acceptor site in exon 15. Characterisation of the different FMR1 variants expressed during folliculogenesis will help to understand the potential distinct cellular roles of each of them and the possible implication in the development of FXPOI."

    "abstract": "Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and fragile X syndrome (FXS) are primary examples of fragile X-related disorders (FXDs) caused by abnormal expansion of CGG repeats above a certain threshold in the 5'-untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene. Both diseases have distinct clinical manifestations and molecular pathogenesis. FXTAS is a late-adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by a premutation (PM) allele (CGG expansion of 55-200 repeats), resulting in FMR1 gene hyperexpression. On the other hand, FXS is a neurodevelopmental disorder that results from a full mutation (FM) allele (CGG expansions of ≥200 repeats) leading to heterochromatization and transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene. The main challenge is to determine how CGG repeat expansion affects the fundamentally distinct nature of FMR1 expression in FM and PM ranges. Abnormal CGG repeat expansions form a variety of non-canonical DNA and RNA structures that can disrupt various cellular processes and cause distinct effects in PM and FM alleles. Here, we review these structures and how they are related to underlying mutations and disease pathology in FXS and FXTAS. Finally, as new CGG expansions within the genome have been identified, it will be interesting to determine their implications in disease pathology and treatment."

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs are enriched in neurons and play important roles in dendritic spine development and synaptic plasticity. MicroRNA activity is controlled by a wide range of RNA-binding proteins. FMRP, a highly conserved RNA-binding protein, has been linked to microRNA-mediated gene regulation in axonal development and dendritic spine formation. FMRP also participates in dendritic arbor morphogenesis, but whether and how microRNAs contribute to its function in this process remains to be elucidated. Here, using Drosophila larval sensory neurons, we show that a FMRP-associated microRNA, miR-276, functions in FMRP-mediated space-filling dendrite morphogenesis. Using EGFP microRNA sensors, we demonstrate that FMRP likely acts by regulating miR-276a RNA targeting rather than by modulating microRNA levels. Supporting this conclusion, miR-276a coimmunoprecipitated with FMRP and this association was dependent on the FMRP KH domains. By testing putative targets of the FMRP-miR-276a regulatory axis, we identified nejire as a FMRP-associated mRNA and, using EGFP reporters, showed that the nejire 3' untranslated region is a target of miR-276a in vivo. Genetic analysis places nejire downstream of the FMRP-miR-276a pathway in regulating dendrite patterning. Together, our findings support a model in which FMRP facilitates miR-276a-mediated control of nejire for proper dendrite space-filling morphology and shed light on microRNA-dependent dendrite developmental pathology of fragile X syndrome."

As compared to the plasma total form, the plasma MMP-9 active form better enables the discrimination of individuals with FXS from controls and correlates with the clinical profile. Our results highlight the importance of choosing the appropriate method to quantify plasma MMP-9 in future FXS clinical studies."

    "abstract": "Trinucleotide repeat (TNR) diseases are caused by the aberrant expansion of CXG (X = C, A, G and T) sequences in genomes. We have reported two small molecules binding to TNR, NCD, and NA, which strongly bind to CGG repeat (responsible sequence of fragile X syndrome) and CAG repeat (Huntington's disease). The NMR structure of NA binding to the CAG/CAG triad has been clarified, but the structure of NCD bound to the CGG/CGG triad remained to be addressed. We here report the structural determination of the NCD-CGG/CGG complex by NMR spectroscopy and the comparison with the NA-CAG/CAG complex. While the NCD-CGG/CGG structure shares the binding characteristics with that of the NA-CAG/CAG complex, a significant difference was found in the overall structure caused by the structural fluctuation at the ligand-bound site. The NCD-CGG/CGG complex was suggested in the equilibrium between stacked and kinked structures, although NA-CAG/CAG complex has only the stacked structures. The dynamic fluctuation of the NCD-CGG/CGG structure at the NCD-binding site suggested room for optimization in the linker structure of NCD to gain improved affinity to the CGG/CGG triad."

    "abstract": "Loss of fragile X retardation protein (FMRP) leads to fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common cause of inherited intellectual disability. Protein lysine acetylation (K-ac), a reversible post-translational modification of proteins, is associated with the regulation of brain development and neuropathies. However, a comprehensive hippocampal K-ac protein profile in response to FMRP deficiency has not been reported until now. Using LC-MS/MS to analyze the enriched K-ac peptides, this study identified 1629 K-ac hits across 717 proteins in the mouse hippocampus, and these proteins were enriched in several metabolic processes. Of them, 51 K-ac hits across 45 proteins were significantly changed upon loss of FMRP. These altered K-ac proteins were enriched in energy metabolic processes including carboxylic acid metabolism process, aerobic respiration and citrate cycle, linking with several neurological disorders such as lactic acidosis, Lewy body disease, Leigh disease and encephalopathies. In the mouse hippocampus and the hippocampal HT-22 cells, FMRP deficiency could induce altered K-ac modification of several key enzymes, decrease in ATP and increase in lactate. Thus, this study identified a global hippocampal lysine acetylome and an altered K-ac protein profile upon loss of FMRP linked to abnormal energy metabolism, implicating in the pathogenesis of FXS. SIGNIFICANCE: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common inherited neurodevelopment disorder characterized by intellectual disability and an increased risk for autism spectrum disorder. FXS is resulted from silencing of the FMR1 gene, which induces loss of its encoding protein FMRP. Molecular and metabolic changes of Fmr1-null animal models of FXS have been identified to potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of FXS. Here, we used a TMT-labeled quantitative proteomic analysis of the peptides enriched by anti-K-ac antibodies and identified a global K-ac protein profile in the mouse hippocampus with a total of 1629 K-ac peptides on 717 proteins. Of them, 51 K-ac peptides regarding 45 proteins altered in response to loss of FMRP, which were enriched in energy metabolic processes and were implicated in several neurological disorders. Thus this study for the first time provides a global hippocampal lysine acetylome upon FMRP deficiency linked to abnormal metabolic pathways, which may contribute to pathogenic mechanism of FXS."

    "abstract": "Inhibitory control (IC), the ability to suppress inappropriate responses, emerges late in the first year of life and improves across typical development, concurrent with brain maturation. The development of IC is critical to various social-emotional and behavioral functions, with IC difficulties being linked to numerous neurodevelopmental disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a single-gene disorder characterized by IC difficulties, and elevated rates of ADHD and ASD, making it a useful model for understanding the early development and consequences of IC. In this longitudinal study, we characterized IC trajectories across multiple time points between 16 and 71 months of age in young males with FXS (<i>n</i> = 79) relative to neurotypical (NT) controls (<i>n=</i>49). To explore the association between behavioral outcomes and IC, we identified a subsample of 50 children with longitudinal IC data and an outcome assessment for ADHD and ASD symptoms at age 5 (FXS: <i>n</i> = 26, NT: <i>n</i> = 24). Results indicated that, compared to their NT peers, young males with FXS exhibit differences in IC as early as 24 months, with group differences increasing through age 5. Additionally, we determined that lower IC levels at 24 months were associated with later ADHD symptoms and a decreasing slope in IC over time was associated with later ASD symptoms in male children with FXS. These findings help refine early developmental phenotypes of FXS and highlight IC as a potential target for early detection and intervention of ASD and ADHD symptoms in male children with FXS."

Based upon the number of DS-implicated transcripts bound by FMRP, we hypothesize that DS and FXS may share underlying mechanisms. Comparing DS and FXS human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) and glutamatergic neuron models, we identify increased protein expression of select targets and overlapping transcriptional perturbations. Moreover, acute upregulation of endogenous FMRP in DS patient cells using CRISPRa is sufficient to significantly reduce expression levels of candidate proteins and reverse 40% of global transcriptional perturbations. These results pinpoint specific molecular perturbations shared between DS and FXS that can be leveraged as a strategy for target prioritization; they also provide evidence for the functional relevance of previous associations between FMRP targets and disease-implicated genes."

    "abstract": "FMRP, the fragile X mental retardation protein coded by the FMR1 gene, is an RNA-binding protein that assists transport, stabilization and translational regulation of specific synaptic mRNAs. Its expression has been found in multiple cell types of central nervous system (CNS) including glial cells where its involvement in glutamate neurotransmitter homeostasis have been shown. Indeed, glutamate homeostasis deficit has been observed in absence of FMRP in-vivo in cortex and hippocampus structures as well as in vitro on astroglial cell culture. Interestingly, the retina which is an extension of the CNS is presenting electrophysiological alterations in absence of FMRP in both human and murine models suggesting neurotransmitter impairments. Therefore, we investigate the consequences of Fmrp absence on Glutamate-Glutamine cycle in whole retinas and primary retinal Müller cells culture which are the main glial cells of the retina. Using the Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> mice, we have shown in vivo and in vitro that the absence of Fmrp in Müller cells is characterized by loss of Glutamate-Glutamine cycle homeostasis due to a lower Glutamine Synthetase protein expression and activity. The lack of Fmrp in the retina induces a reduced flow of glutamine synthesis. Our data established for the first time in literature a direct link between the lack of Fmrp and neurotransmitter homeostasis in the retina."

    "abstract": "Clinical trials serve as the fundamental prerequisite for clinical therapy of human disease, which is primarily based on biomedical studies in animal models. Undoubtedly, animal models have made a significant contribution to gaining insight into the developmental and pathophysiological understanding of human diseases. However, none of the existing animal models could efficiently simulate the development of human organs and systems due to a lack of spatial information; the discrepancy in genetic, anatomic, and physiological basis between animals and humans limits detailed investigation. Therefore, the translational efficiency of the research outcomes in clinical applications was significantly weakened, especially for some complex, chronic, and intractable diseases. For example, the clinical trials for human fragile X syndrome (FXS) solely based on animal models have failed such as mGluR5 antagonists. To mimic the development of human organs more faithfully and efficiently translate in vitro biomedical studies to clinical trials, extensive attention to organoids derived from stem cells contributes to a deeper understanding of this research. The organoids are a miniaturized version of an organ generated in vitro, partially recapitulating key features of human organ development. As such, the organoids open a novel avenue for in vitro models of human disease, advantageous over the existing animal models. The invention of organoids has brought an innovative breakthrough in regeneration medicine. The organoid-derived human tissues or organs could potentially function as invaluable platforms for biomedical studies, pathological investigation of human diseases, and drug screening. Importantly, the study of regeneration medicine and the development of therapeutic strategies for human diseases could be conducted in a dish, facilitating in vitro analysis and experimentation. Thus far, the pilot breakthrough has been made in the generation of numerous types of organoids representing different human organs. Most of these human organoids have been employed for in vitro biomedical study and drug screening. However, the efficiency and quality of the organoids in recapitulating the development of human organs have been hindered by engineering and conceptual challenges. The efficiency and quality of the organoids are essential for downstream applications. In this article, we highlight the application in the modeling of human neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as FXS, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), and organoid-based drug screening. Additionally, challenges and weaknesses especially for limits of the brain organoid models in modeling late onset NDDs such as AD and PD., and future perspectives regarding human brain organoids are addressed."

Despite the unceasing efforts to develop therapeutic agents against FXS based on the pathophysiological changes observed in animal models of FXS and human patients, therapeutic candidates including mGluR signaling modulators have failed to provide sufficient effects. Based on the recent successful demonstration of an endogenous polyamine, agmatine, to improve the autism-like symptoms in the valproic acid animal model of autism, we investigated the effects of agmatine against FXS symptoms using Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice. We used male Fmr1 KO mice for behavioral tests such as marble burying, open-field test, memory tasks, social interaction tests and startle response to confirm the symptoms of FXS. We also checked the electrophysiological profile of neural activity in agmatine-treated Fmr1 KO mice. Agmatine reversed the compulsion, learning and memory deficits, hyperactivity, aberrant social interaction, and communication deficit in Fmr1 KO mice while it normalized the aberrant LTP and LTD in the hippocampus. The results highlight the potential of agmatine's novel disease-ameliorating effects in FXS, which warrants further studies to ascertain whether these findings translate into clinical effects in FXS patients."

    "abstract": "Many mutations in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affect a single allele, indicating a key role for gene dosage in ASD susceptibility. Recently, haplo-insufficiency of <i>ITGB3</i>, the gene encoding the extracellular matrix receptor β3 integrin, was associated with ASD. Accordingly, <i>Itgb3</i> knockout (KO) mice exhibit autism-like phenotypes. The pathophysiological mechanisms of <i>Itgb3</i> remain, however, unknown, and the potential of targeting this gene for developing ASD therapies uninvestigated. By combining molecular, biochemical, imaging, and pharmacological analyses, we establish that <i>Itgb3</i> haplo-insufficiency impairs cortical network excitability by promoting extra-synaptic over synaptic signaling of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5, which is similarly dysregulated in fragile X syndrome, the most frequent monogenic form of ASD. To assess the therapeutic potential of regulating <i>Itgb3</i> gene dosage, we implemented CRISPR activation and compared its efficacy with that of a pharmacological rescue strategy for fragile X syndrome. Correction of neuronal <i>Itgb3</i> haplo-insufficiency by CRISPR activation rebalanced network excitability as effectively as blockade of mGluR5 with the selective antagonist MPEP. Our findings reveal an unexpected functional interaction between two ASD genes, thereby validating the pathogenicity of <i>ITGB3</i> haplo-insufficiency. Further, they pave the way for exploiting CRISPR activation as gene therapy for normalizing gene dosage and network excitability in ASD."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), typically occurs as the result of a mutation silencing the Fmr1 gene, preventing production of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). FXS is characterized, in part, by hyperactivity, impaired behavioral flexibility, and the development of repetitive, or stereotyped, behaviors. While these phenotypes are influenced by striatal activity, few studies have examined FXS or FMRP in the context of striatal function. Here, we report enhanced repetitive behaviors in Fmr1 knockout (KO) compared to wild type (WT) mice according to multiple measures, including quantity and intensity of stereotypic behaviors in an open field and nose poking activity in an unbaited hole board test. However, using a baited version of the hole board assay, we see that KO mice do show some behavioral flexibility in that they make changes in their nose poking behavior following familiarization with an appetitive bait. By contrast, repeated exposure to cocaine (15 mg/kg) promotes repetitive behavior in both WT and KO mice, in a manner mostly independent of genotype. Branch length alterations in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) are similar between WT cocaine-treated and KO saline-treated mice, possibly suggesting shared synaptic mechanisms. Overall, we suggest that scoring open field behavior is a sensitive measure for repetitive sensory-motor behaviors in Fmr1 KO mice. In addition, our findings show that synaptic contacts onto MSNs in the DLS should be examined in conjunction with measures of stereotypical behavior."

Participants included 26 children with ASD and 18 with comorbid ASD and fragile X syndrome (ASD+FXS). Analyses were adjusted for age and IQ. The ASD group demonstrated greater improvement on WM training relative to the ASD+FXS group. Participants improved on WM and far transfer outcomes, however, there were no significant group differences in improvement except for repetitive behavior. Higher hyperactivity/impulsivity ratings predicted lower performance on visuospatial WM.

Mainly in the auditory modality, disturbed processing has been found in both fragile X patients and the corresponding genetic mouse model, the Fmr1 knockout mouse. Here, we tried to replicate the auditory deficits and assess whether also visual processing is affected, using electroencephalography readouts under freely behaving conditions in the second-generation Fmr1 knockout mice. No differences between wild-type and knockout animals were found in single auditory and visual evoked potentials in response to pure sine tones and full-field light flashes. Visual sensory gating was enhanced in the early but not the late components of the evoked potentials, but no changes were found in auditory sensory gating. The higher harmonics of the synchronisation response to flickering visual stimuli seemed to be reduced with 10, but not 20 or 40 Hz, stimulation. However, this effect was not reproduced in an independent second cohort of animals. No synchronisation differences were found in response to a chirp stimulus, of which the frequency steadily increased. Taken together, this study could not reproduce earlier reported increased amplitudes in auditory responses, nor could it convincingly show that synchronisation deficits found to be present in the auditory modality also existed in the visual modality. The discrepancies within this study as well as between various studies assessing sensory processing in the Fmr1 KO raise questions about the external validity of these phenotypes and warrant careful interpretation of these phenotypes."

Neural differentiation of FX human embryonic stem cells (hESC) mimics the neurodevelopment of FXS fetuses and thus serves as a good model to explore the mechanisms underlining the development of FXS. Isogenic hESC clones with and without the FX mutation that share the same genetic background were in vitro differentiated into neurons, and their transcriptome was analyzed by RNA sequencing. FX neurons inactivating <i>FMR1</i> expression presented delayed neuronal development and maturation, concomitant with dysregulation of the TGFβ/BMP signaling pathway, and genes related to the extracellular matrix. Migration assay showed decreased neurite outgrowth in FX neurons that was rescued by inhibition of the TGFβ/BMP signaling pathway. Our results provide new insights into the molecular pathway by which loss of FMRP affects neuronal network development. In FX neurons, the lack of FMRP dysregulates members of the BMP signaling pathway associated with ECM organization which, in a yet unknown mechanism, reduces the guidance of axonal growth cones, probably leading to the aberrant neuronal network function seen in FXS."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disabilities and the second most common cause after Down syndrome. FXS is an X-linked disorder due to a full mutation of the CGG triplet repeat of the FMR1 gene which codes for a protein that is crucial in synaptogenesis and maintaining functions of extracellular matrix-related proteins, key for the development of normal neuronal and connective tissue including collagen. In addition to neuropsychiatric and behavioral problems, individuals with FXS show physical features suggestive of a connective tissue disorder including loose skin and joint laxity, flat feet, hernias and mitral valve prolapse. Disturbed collagen leads to hypermobility, hyperextensible skin and tissue fragility with musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, immune and other organ involvement as seen in hereditary disorders of connective tissue including Ehlers−Danlos syndrome. Recently, FMR1 premutation repeat expansion or carrier status has been reported in individuals with connective tissue disorder-related symptoms. We examined a cohort of females with features of a connective tissue disorder presenting for genetic services using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a connective tissue disorder gene panel consisting of approximately 75 genes. In those females with normal NGS testing for connective tissue disorders, the FMR1 gene was then analyzed using CGG repeat expansion studies. Three of thirty-nine females were found to have gray zone or intermediate alleles at a 1:13 ratio which was significantly higher (p < 0.05) when compared with newborn females representing the general population at a 1:66 ratio. This association of connective tissue involvement in females with intermediate or gray zone alleles reported for the first time will require more studies on how the size variation may impact FMR1 gene function and protein directly or in relationship with other susceptibility genes involved in connective tissue disorders."

We observed that the progeny of mice fed a Westernized diet (WD) with low fiber and extra fat exhibited higher frequencies of stereotypy, hyperactivity, cranial features and lower FMRP protein expression, similar to what is typically observed in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) in humans. We hypothesized that gut dysbiosis and inflammation during pregnancy influenced the prenatal uterine environment, leading to abnormal phenotypes in offspring. We found that oral in utero supplementation with a beneficial anti-inflammatory probiotic microbe, <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i>, was sufficient to inhibit FXS-like phenotypes in offspring mice. Cytokine profiles in the pregnant WD females showed that their circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (Il)-17 were increased relative to matched gravid mice and to those given supplementary <i>L. reuteri</i> probiotic. To test our hypothesis of prenatal contributions to this neurodevelopmental phenotype, we performed Caesarian (C-section) births using dissimilar foster mothers to eliminate effects of maternal microbiota transferred during vaginal delivery or nursing after birth. We found that foster-reared offspring still displayed a high frequency of these FXS-like features, indicating significant in utero contributions. In contrast, matched foster-reared progeny of <i>L. reuteri</i>-treated mothers did not exhibit the FXS-like typical features, supporting a key role for microbiota during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that diet-induced dysbiosis in the prenatal uterine environment is strongly associated with the incidence of this neurological phenotype in progeny but can be alleviated by addressing gut dysbiosis through probiotic supplementation."

To date, 27 patients with VSVS have been reported in the literature. Materials and Methods: We describe a 23-year-old male patient with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who was admitted to the gastroenterological hospital with signs of pseudomembranous colitis. ASD was first noted in the patient at the age of 2.5 years. Later, he developed epileptic seizures and important growth retardation. Prior to the hospitalization, chromosomal aberrations, Fragile X syndrome, and aminoacidopathies/aminoacidurias associated with ASD were excluded. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was prescribed to the patient at 23 years old. Results: The patient had a heterozygous carrier of “de novo” variant c.662C > T (p.S221L) in exon 4 of the DEAF1 gene. c.662C > T had not been previously described in genomic databases. According to the ACMG criteria, this missense variant was considered to be pathogenic. VSVS was diagnosed in the patient. Conclusions: The phenotype of the patient is very similar to the data presented in the world literature. However, growth retardation and cachexia, which have not been described previously in the articles, are of interest."

PubMed bibliographic database was searched from date of inception to May 2021. PRISMA 2020 guidelines were followed with the flowchart, table of included studies, list of excluded studies, and checklist provided. Filters applied included human research and English. Only original research articles were included in the final set, but review articles were used to identify secondary citations of primary studies. All articles were reviewed for appropriateness by 2 authors and summarized. Inclusion criteria were met by 145 articles (Down syndrome = 29, FXS = 55, tuberous sclerosis complex = 11, Williams syndrome = 18, Prader-Willi syndrome = 24, Angelman syndrome = 8). Each syndrome review was summarized separately and further subdivided into articles related to underlying neurobiology, behaviors associated with ED, assessment, and targeted intervention. FXS had the most thorough research base, followed by Down syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome, with the other syndromes having more limited available research. Very limited research was available regarding intervention for all disorders except FXS. Core underlying characteristics of S-IDs appear to place youth at higher risk for ED, but further research is needed to better assess and treat ED in S-IDs.

    "abstract": "Early development marks a period of rapid learning facilitated by children's natural curiosity about the people around them. In children with typical development, these early social attentional preferences set the foundation for learning about and from the surrounding world of people. Much of this learning happens using joint attention, the ability to coordinate attention between people and objects of mutual interest. It is well documented that decreased gaze use is commonly observed in individuals with autism and individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Despite the growing body of research comparing phenotypic similarities between individuals with autism and individuals with FXS, no studies have directly compared joint attention performance between these groups. In the present study, we considered the similarities and differences in joint attention between preschool-aged boys with autism or FXS, and the relation between joint attention, language, and other phenotypic characteristics known to differ between boys with autism and boys with FXS. Although joint attention appeared similar, between-group differences emerged when controlling for the influence of age, non-verbal IQ, and autism symptom severity. Differences were also observed when considering how joint attention performance related to other aspects of the phenotype. For example, strong positive associations were observed between joint attention and language performance in boys with autism but not boys with FXS, even after controlling for non-verbal IQ. In contrast, the negative association between joint attention and anxiety symptom severity was significant and stronger in boys with FXS than in autism. These data offer preliminary insights into the similarities and differences between the autism and FXS phenotypes."

Data support the potential therapeutic use of mGluR modulators in the treatment of anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and other psychiatric disorders, pain, epilepsy, as well as neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. For each of the three mGluR groups, compounds have been constructed that produce either potentiation or functional blockade. PET ligands for mGlu5Rs have been studied in a range of patient populations and several mGlu5R antagonists have been tested for potential efficacy in patients including mavoglurant, diploglurant, basimglurant, GET 73, and ADX10059. Efficacy with mGlu5R antagonists has been reported in trials with patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease; data from patients with Parkinson's disease or Fragile X syndrome have not been as robust as hoped. Fenobam was approved for use as an anxiolytic prior to its recognition as an mGlu5R antagonist. mGlu2/3R agonists (pomaglumated methionil) and mGlu2R agonists (JNJ-40411813, AZD 8529, and LY2979165) have been studied in patients with schizophrenia with promising but mixed results. Antagonists of mGlu2/3Rs (decoglurant and TS-161) have been studied in depression where TS-161 has advanced into a planned Phase 2 study in treatment-resistant depression.

    "abstract": "Converging evidence indicates that the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), which absent or mutated in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), plays a role in many types of cancers. However, while FMRP roles in brain development and function have been extensively studied, its involvement in the biology of brain tumors remains largely unexplored. Here we show, in human glioblastoma (GBM) biopsies, that increased expression of FMRP directly correlates with a worse patient outcome. In contrast, reductions in FMRP correlate with a diminished tumor growth and proliferation of human GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) in vitro in a cell culture model and in vivo in mouse brain GSC xenografts. Consistently, increased FMRP levels promote GSC proliferation. To characterize the mechanism(s) by which FMRP regulates GSC proliferation, we performed GSC transcriptome analyses in GSCs expressing high levels of FMRP, and in these GSCs after knockdown of FMRP. We show that the WNT signalling is the most significantly enriched among the published FMRP target genes and genes involved in ASD. Consistently, we find that reductions in FMRP downregulate both the canonical WNT/β-Catenin and the non-canonical WNT-ERK1/2 signalling pathways, reducing the stability of several key transcription factors (i.e. β-Catenin, CREB and ETS1) previously implicated in the modulation of malignant features of glioma cells. Our findings support a key role for FMRP in GBM cancer progression, acting via regulation of WNT signalling."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders, spurring decades of intense research and a multitude of mouse models. So far, these models do not recapitulate the genetic underpinning of classical FXS-CGG repeat-induced methylation of the <i>Fmr1</i> locus-and their findings have failed to translate into the clinic. We sought to answer whether this disparity was because of low repeat length and generated a novel mouse line with 341 repeats, <i>Fmr1<sup>hs341</sup></i> , which is the largest allele in mice reported to date. This repeat length is significantly longer than the 200 repeats generally required for methylation of the repeat tract and promoter region in FXS patients, which leads to silencing of the <i>FMR1</i> gene. Bisulfite sequencing fails to detect the robust methylation expected of FXS in <i>Fmr1<sup>hs341</sup></i> mice. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting results also do not resemble FXS and instead produce a biochemical profile consistent with the fragile X-associated premutation disorders. These findings suggest that repeat length is unlikely to be the core determinant preventing methylation in mice, and other organisms phylogenetically closer to humans may be required to effectively model FXS."

    "title": "Screening for Fragile X Syndrome Among Filipino Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.",
    "abstract": "Individuals with autism spectrum disorder present with difficulties in social communication, restricted interests or behaviors and other co-morbidities. About 2 to 10% of cases of autism have a genetic cause, and Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is reported in 0 to 6.5% of individuals with autism. However, the FXS and premutation prevalence among Filipino children has never been reported. The aim of the study was to establish the presence of FXS or premutation carriers among Filipino children with autism and to describe the phenotypic characteristic of cases identified. Blood was collected from 235 children aged 2-6 years old and diagnosed with autism. Samples were analyzed using PCR methods to amplify CGG repeats in the FMRI gene. The diagnosis of autism was confirmed through the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2. Additional characteristics were documented from a physical examination, Griffiths Scales of Child Development assessment and a parent-answered questionnaire using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. Fragile X testing through PCR methods in 235 children with diagnosed autism showed 220 (93.6%) were negative, no full mutations, 1 (0.436%) premutation carrier and 14 (5.95%) cases contained intermediate alleles. The FXS testing was limited to confirmed cases of autism, which is considered a high-risk group and does not provide prevalence for the general Filipino population. Subjects were self-referred or referred by clinicians, which may not represent the Filipino autism population with a bias towards those with means for clinical consultations and ability to travel to the place of testing. Samples were not measured for mosaicism, DNA methylation or AGG interspersion patterns. These may have effects on the CGG repeat expansion and overall presentation of FXS. Findings from a single premutation carrier cannot characterize features distinctly present in Filipinos with the mutation. Nevertheless, these results support the data that the prevalence of FXS in Asian populations may be lower than non-Asian populations. This can contribute to a better understanding of FXS and genetic causes of autism in the Philippines and other Asian populations."

    "title": "Basolateral Amygdala Hyperexcitability Is Associated with Precocious Developmental Emergence of Fear-Learning in Fragile X Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder and the most common monogenic cause of intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, and anxiety disorders. Loss of fragile x mental retardation protein results in disruptions of synaptic development during a critical period of circuit formation in the BLA. However, it is unknown how these alterations impact microcircuit development and function. Using a combination of electrophysiologic and behavioral approaches in both male (<i>Fmr1</i>-/y) and female (<i>Fmr1</i>-/-) mice, we demonstrate that principal neurons in the <i>Fmr1</i>KO BLA exhibit hyperexcitability during a sensitive period in amygdala development. This hyperexcitability contributes to increased excitatory gain in fear-learning circuits. Further, synaptic plasticity is enhanced in the BLA of <i>Fmr1</i>KO mice. Behavioral correlation demonstrates that fear-learning emerges precociously in the <i>Fmr1</i>KO mouse. Early life 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo [5,4-c]pyridin-3ol intervention ameliorates fear-learning in <i>Fmr1KO</i> mice. These results suggest that critical period plasticity in the amygdala of the <i>Fmr1</i>KO mouse may be shifted to earlier developmental time points.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In these studies, we identify early developmental alterations in principal neurons in the Fragile X syndrome BLA. We show that, as early as P14, excitability and feedforward excitation, and synaptic plasticity are enhanced in Fmr1KO lateral amygdala. This correlates with precocious emergence of fear-learning in the <i>Fmr1</i>KO mouse. Early life 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo [5,4-c]pyridin-3ol intervention restores critical period plasticity in WT mice and ameliorates fear-learning in the <i>Fmr1</i>KO mouse."

Besides its hypoglycemic effects, metformin also can improve cognitive or mood functions in some T2DM patients; moreover, it has been reported that metformin exerts beneficial effects on many neurological disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Fragile X syndrome (FXS); however, the mechanism underlying metformin in the brain is not fully understood. Neurotransmission between neurons is fundamental for brain functions, and its defects have been implicated in many neurological disorders. Recent studies suggest that metformin appears not only to regulate synaptic transmission or plasticity in pathological conditions but also to regulate the balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) in neural networks. In this review, we focused on and reviewed the roles of metformin in brain functions and related neurological disorders, which would give us a deeper understanding of the actions of metformin in the brain."

    "title": "Diagnostic Overshadowing: Insidious Neuroregression Mimicking Presentation of Autism Spectrum Disorder.",
    "abstract": "Zac is a 13-year-old boy who presented with his parents to developmental-behavioral pediatrics seeking diagnostic clarity. He was born by vaginal delivery at full term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. Developmental milestones were met at typical ages until he was noted to have language delay and to be hyperactive and impulsive on entering preschool at age 4 years. Although he used some phrases in speech, he often used physical force to take toys from other children, rather than using words.On entering preschool at age 4 years, he was noted to have language delay (i.e., continued use of phrase speech only) and to be hyperactive and impulsive. An evaluation to determine eligibility for an Individualized Education Program (IEP) was completed and found him to have delays in cognition, receptive language, expressive language, social-emotional, and adaptive skills. His fine motor skills were in the low average range, and his gross motor skills were in the average range. He was admitted into an early childhood special education program, and aggressive behavior and hyperactivity decreased in the structured classroom.At age 7 years, Zac was re-evaluated by the school district and found to have moderate intellectual disability (ID). Chromosomal microarray analysis and testing for Fragile X syndrome were normal. He was noted to enjoy interacting with other children and adults, but his play was very immature (e.g., preference for cause/effect toys). He was able to respond appropriately when asked his name and age, but he also frequently demonstrated echolalia. He was also evaluated by his primary care physician and found to meet the criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation (ADHD). Treatment with methylphenidate was initiated but discontinued after a brief time because of increased aggressive behaviors.Owing to continued significant tantrums, aggressive tendencies, and inability to communicate his basic needs, Zac was evaluated at a local Regional Center (statewide system for resources and access to services for individuals with developmental disabilities) at age 10 years and found to meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and previous diagnosis of ID was confirmed. Zac received applied behavior analysis (ABA), but this was discontinued after 1 year because of a combination of a change in the insurance provider and parental perception that the therapy had not been beneficial.Zac became less hyperactive and energetic as he grew older. By the time Zac presented to the developmental-behavioral clinic at age 13 years, he was consistently using approximately 30 single words and was no longer combining words into phrases. He had a long latency in responding to verbal and nonverbal cues and seemed to be quite withdrawn. Physical examination revealed scoliosis and hand tremors while executing fine motor tasks. Seizures were not reported, but neuromotor regression was apparent from the examination and history. Laboratory studies including thyroid-stimulating hormone, free T4, creatine kinase, very-long-chain fatty acids, lactate, pyruvate, urine organic acids, and plasma amino acids were normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated abnormal T2 hyperintensities in the periventricular and deep cerebral white matter and peridentate cerebellar white matter, consistent with a \"tigroid\" pattern seen in metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and other white matter neurodegenerative diseases. Arylsulfatase A mutation was detected with an expanded ID/ASD panel, and leukocyte arylsulfatase activity was low, confirming the diagnosis of juvenile-onset MLD.Are there behavioral markers and/or historical caveats that clinicians can use to distinguish between ASD/ID with coexisting ADHD and a neurodegenerative disorder with an insidious onset of regression?"

    "abstract": "Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) is a technique classically employed by chemists and physicists to produce a coherent signal of signature vibrations of molecules. However, these vibrational signatures are also characteristic of molecules within anatomical tissue such as the brain, making it increasingly useful and applicable for Neuroscience applications. For example, CARS can measure lipids by specifically exciting chemical bonds within these molecules, allowing for quantification of different aspects of tissue, such as myelin involved in neurotransmission. In addition, compared to other techniques typically used to quantify myelin, CARS can also be set up to be compatible with immunofluorescent techniques, allowing for co-labeling with other markers such as sodium channels or other components of synaptic transmission. Myelination changes are an inherently important mechanism in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis or other neurological conditions such as Fragile X Syndrome or autism spectrum disorders is an emerging area of research. In conclusion, CARS can be utilized in innovative ways to answer pressing questions in Neuroscience and provide evidence for underlying mechanisms related to many different neurological conditions."

In this study, we investigated the applicability of fragile X syndrome (FXS) testing in unexplained ID/GDD individuals with negative or absent genetic testing. In this study, we used the triplet repeat primed polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the value and application of fragile X testing in unexplained ID/GDD individuals with negative or absent genetic testing (<i>n</i> = 681) from three hospitals. Of the 681 ID/GDD individuals with negative or absent genetic testing results detected by FXS testing, 12 men and one woman were positive. This corresponded to a diagnostic yield of 1.9% for FXS testing in our cohort. All FXS individuals had either a family history of ID/GDD or suggestive clinical features. The detection yield of FXS testing in ID/GDD individuals who completed genetic testing (2.70%, 12/438) was significantly higher than in individuals without any genetic testing (0.40%, 1/243). This is the first report of FXS testing in ID/GDD individuals who lacked previous genetic testing, which promotes standardization of the FXS diagnostic process. These results highlight the utility of FXS testing of unexplained ID/GDD individuals with negative results from standard genetic testing. In the era of next-generation sequencing, FXS testing is more suitable as a second-tier choice and provides clinicians and geneticists with auxiliary references for tracing the etiology of ID/GDD."

Even though speech-language deficits are among the key symptoms of both conditions, little is known about infant vocalisation acoustics for an automatic earlier identification of affected individuals. To bridge this gap, we applied intelligent audio analysis methodology to a compact dataset of 4454 home-recorded vocalisations of 3 individuals with FXS and 3 individuals with RTT aged 6 to 11 months, as well as 6 age- and gender-matched typically developing controls (TD). On the basis of a standardised set of 88 acoustic features, we trained linear kernel support vector machines to evaluate the feasibility of automatic classification of (a) FXS vs TD, (b) RTT vs TD, (c) atypical development (FXS+RTT) vs TD, and (d) FXS vs RTT vs TD. In paradigms (a)-(c), all infants were correctly classified; in paradigm (d), 9 of 12 were so. Spectral/cepstral and energy-related features were most relevant for classification across all paradigms. Despite the small sample size, this study reveals new insights into early vocalisation characteristics in FXS and RTT, and provides technical underpinnings for a future earlier identification of affected individuals, enabling earlier intervention and family counselling."

    "abstract": "CGG repeat expansions in the FMR1 5'UTR cause the neurodegenerative disease Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). These repeats form stable RNA secondary structures that support aberrant translation in the absence of an AUG start codon (RAN translation), producing aggregate-prone peptides that accumulate within intranuclear neuronal inclusions and contribute to neurotoxicity. Here, we show that the most abundant RAN translation product, FMRpolyG, is markedly less toxic when generated from a construct with a non-repetitive alternating codon sequence in place of the CGG repeat. While exploring the mechanism of this differential toxicity, we observed a +1 translational frameshift within the CGG repeat from the arginine to glycine reading frame. Frameshifts occurred within the first few translated repeats and were triggered predominantly by RNA sequence and structural features. Short chimeric R/G peptides form aggregates distinct from those formed by either pure arginine or glycine, and these chimeras induce toxicity in cultured rodent neurons. Together, this work suggests that CGG repeats support translational frameshifting and that chimeric RAN translated peptides may contribute to CGG repeat-associated toxicity in FXTAS and related disorders."

    "abstract": "Environmental factors such as diet, gut microbiota, and infections have proven to have a significant role in epigenetic modifications. It is known that epigenetic modifications may cause behavioral and neuronal changes observed in neurodevelopmental disabilities, including fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism (ASD). Probiotics are live microorganisms that provide health benefits when consumed, and in some cases are shown to decrease the chance of developing neurological disorders. Here, we examined the epigenetic outcomes in offspring mice after feeding of a probiotic organism, <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> (<i>L. reuteri</i>), to pregnant mother animals. In this study, we tested a cohort of Western diet-fed descendant mice exhibiting a high frequency of behavioral features and lower FMRP protein expression similar to what is observed in FXS in humans (described in a companion manuscript in this same GENES special topic issue). By investigating 17,735 CpG sites spanning the whole mouse genome, we characterized the epigenetic profile in two cohorts of mice descended from mothers treated and non-treated with <i>L. reuteri</i> to determine the effect of prenatal probiotic exposure on the prevention of FXS-like symptoms. We found several genes involved in different neurological pathways being differentially methylated (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) between the cohorts. Among the key functions, synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, synaptic modulation, synaptic transmission, reelin signaling pathway, promotion of specification and maturation of neurons, and long-term potentiation were observed. The results of this study are relevant as they could lead to a better understanding of the pathways involved in these disorders, to novel therapeutics approaches, and to the identification of potential biomarkers for early detection of these conditions."

Despite intensive preclinical research in Fmr1-targeted transgenic mice, an effective treatment for FXS has yet to be developed. We previously demonstrated that ASP5736, a 5-Hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 5A receptor antagonist, ameliorated scopolamine-induced working memory deficits in mice, reference memory impairment in aged rats, and methamphetamine-induced positive symptoms and phencyclidine-induced cognitive impairment in animal models of schizophrenia. We hypothesized that ASP5736 may be effective for ameliorating similar behavior deficits in male Fmr1-targeted transgenic rats as a preclinical model of FXS. We evaluated the effect of acute oral administration of ASP5736 on the abnormal behavior of hyperactivity (0.01, 0.1 mg/kg), prepulse inhibition (0.01, 0.03, 0.1 mg/kg), and the novel object recognition task (0.1 mg/kg) in Frmr1-knockout (KO) rats. Fmr1-KO rats showed body weight gain, hyperactivity, abnormal sensory motor gating, and cognitive impairment. ASP5736 (0.1 mg/kg) reversed the hyperactivity and ameliorated the sensory motor gating deficits (0.03-0.1 mg/kg). ASP5736 (0.01 mg/kg) also improved cognitive impairment. ASP5736 is a potential drug candidate for FXS. Further studies are needed to confirm its clinical efficacy."

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most prevalent heritable cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders, and the <i>Drosophila</i> FXS disease model has been critical for the genetic screening discovery of new intercellular secretion mechanisms. Here, we focus on the roles of three major signaling pathways: BMP, Wnt, and insulin-like peptides.

All three of these secreted signaling pathways are strikingly altered in FXS disease models, giving new mechanistic insights into impaired cellular outcomes and neurological phenotypes. <i>Drosophila</i> provides a powerful genetic screening platform to expand understanding of these secretory mechanisms and to test cellular roles in both peripheral and central nervous systems. The studies demonstrate the importance of exploring broad genetic interactions and unexpected regulatory mechanisms.

FMRP loss or dysfunction leads to aberrant neuronal and synaptic activities in fragile X syndrome (FXS), which is characterized by intellectual disability, sensory abnormalities, and social communication problems. Studies of FMRP function and FXS pathogenesis have primarily been conducted with Fmr1 (the gene encoding FMRP) knockout in transgenic animals. Here we report an in vivo method for determining the cell-autonomous function of FMRP during the period of circuit assembly and synaptic formation using chicken embryos. This method employs stage-, site-, and direction-specific electroporation of a drug-inducible vector system containing Fmr1 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and an EGFP reporter. With this method, we achieved selective FMRP knockdown in the auditory ganglion (AG) and in one of its brainstem targets, the nucleus magnocellularis (NM), thus providing a component-specific manipulation within the AG-NM circuit. Additionally, the mosaic pattern of the transfection allows within-animal controls and neighboring neuron/fiber comparisons for enhanced reliability and sensitivity in data analyzing. The inducible vector system provides temporal control of gene editing onset to minimize accumulating developmental effects. The combination of these strategies provides an innovative tool to dissect the cell-autonomous function of FMRP in synaptic and circuit development."

    "abstract": "Dendritic spines are the principal site of excitatory synapse formation in the human brain. Several neurodevelopmental disorders cause spines to develop abnormally, resulting in altered spine number and morphology. Although spine development has been thoroughly characterized in the mammalian brain, spines are not unique to mammals. We have developed a genetic system in zebrafish to enable high-resolution in vivo imaging of spine dynamics during larval development. Although spiny neurons are rare in the larval zebrafish, pyramidal neurons (PyrNs) of the zebrafish tectum form an apical dendrite containing a dense array of dendritic spines. To characterize dendritic spine development, we performed mosaic genetic labeling of individual PyrNs labeled by an id2b:gal4 transgene. Our findings identify a developmental period during which PyrN dendrite growth is concurrent with spine formation. Throughout this period, motile, transient filopodia gradually transform into stable spines containing postsynaptic specializations. The utility of this system to study neurodevelopmental disorders was validated by examining spine development in fmr1 mutant zebrafish, a model of fragile X syndrome. PyrNs in fmr1 mutants exhibited pronounced defects in dendrite growth and spine stabilization. Taken together, these findings establish a genetic labeling system to study dendritic spine development in larval zebrafish. In the future, this system could be combined with high-throughput screening approaches to identify genes and drug targets that regulate spine formation."

Motor deficits are a shared feature of FXS and autism. The cerebellum has emerged as one of the target brain areas affected by neurodevelopmental diseases. Alterations in the cerebellar structure, circuits, and function may be the key drivers of impaired fine and gross motor skills in FXS and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). In this review, we briefly examined recent findings in FXS and present a discussion on the literature supporting motor skill deficits in FXS. Subsequently, we focused on neuropathological alterations in the cerebellum in FXS and FXTAS. We highlight studies that have directly examined the function of fragile X mental retardation protein and related epigenetic variations in the cerebellum. Overall, we obtained considerable supporting evidence for the hypothesis that cerebellar dysfunction is evident in FXS and FXTAS; however, compared with studies on other ASD models, studies on motor skills related to fragile X disorders are particularly rare and inconclusive. Hence, future research should address FXS-related motor and behavioral trajectories and examine the underlying mechanisms at both the cell and circuit levels."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and is characterized by autistic behaviors, childhood seizures, and deficits in learning and memory. FXS has a loss of function of the FMR1 gene that leads to a lack of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) expression. FMRP is critical for synaptic plasticity, spatial learning, and memory. Reelin is a large extracellular glycoprotein essential for synaptic plasticity and numerous neurodevelopmental processes. Reduction in Reelin signaling is implicated as a contributing factor in disease etiology in several neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, and autism. However, the role of Reelin in FXS is poorly understood. We demonstrate a reduction in Reelin in Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice, suggesting that a loss of Reelin activity may contribute to FXS. We demonstrate here that Reelin signaling enhancement via a single intracerebroventricular injection of the Reelin central fragment into Fmr1 KO mice can profoundly rescue cognitive deficits in hidden platform water maze and fear conditioning, as well as hyperactivity during the open field. Improvements in behavior were associated with rescued levels of post synaptic marker in Fmr1 KO mice when compared to controls. These data suggest that increasing Reelin signaling in FXS could offer a novel therapeutic for improving cognition in FXS."

There is also a higher incidence than in the general population of strabismus, otitis media, and mitral valve prolapse. In addition, one of the most common medical problems associated with FXS is an increased risk of seizures. A subset of individuals carrying the full mutation of the FMR1 gene and diagnosed with fragile X syndrome (FXS) are reported to experience seizures, mostly during the first 10 years of their life span. As part of a larger project to identify genetic variants that modify the risk of seizures, we collected clinical information from 49 carriers with FXS who experienced seizures and 46 without seizures. We compared seizure type and comorbid conditions based on the source of data as well as family history of seizures. We found that the concordance of seizure types observed by parents and medical specialists varied by type of seizure. The most common comorbid condition among those with seizures was autism spectrum disorder (47% per medical records vs. 33% per parent report compared with 19% among those without seizures per parent report); the frequency of other comorbid conditions did not differ among groups. We found a slightly higher frequency of family members who experienced seizures among the seizure group compared with the nonseizure group. This study confirms previously reported features of seizures in FXS, supports additional genetic factors, and highlights the importance of information sources, altogether contributing to a better understanding of seizures in FXS."

Neurological dysfunctions caused by environmental alterations and/or genetic mutation may share the same molecular or cellular mechanisms.

Enhanced activation of the hippocampal dorsal CA3 (dCA3) in BWT mice was observed during social preference tests. Optogenetic activation of dCA3 in naive mice impaired social discrimination, whereas chemogenetic silencing of dCA3 rescued social discrimination deficit in BWT mice. Hippocampal oxytocin (OXT) is reduced after whisker trimming. Neonatal intraventricular compensation of OXT relieved dCA3 over-activation and prevented social dysfunction. Neonatal knockdown of OXT receptor in dCA3 mimics the effects of BWT, and cannot be rescued by OXT treatment. Social behavior deficits in a fragile X syndrome mouse model (Fmr1 KO mice) could also be recovered by early life OXT treatment, through negating dCA3 over-activation. Here, a possible avenue to prevent social dysfunction is uncovered."

In male wild-type mice, chronic sleep restriction during development results in long-lasting impairments in behavior including hypoactivity, decreased sociability, and increased repetitive behavior. Disordered sleep is characteristic of many neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, the severity of behavioral symptoms is correlated with the degree of disordered sleep. We hypothesized that chronic developmental sleep restriction in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS) would exacerbate behavioral phenotypes. To test our hypothesis, we sleep-restricted <i>Fmr1</i> knockout (KO) mice for 3 h per day from P5 to P52 and subjected mice to behavioral tests beginning on P42. Contrary to our expectations, sleep restriction improved the hyperactivity and lack of preference for social novelty phenotypes in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice but had no measurable effect on repetitive activity. Sleep restriction also resulted in changes in regional distribution of myelin basic protein, suggesting effects on myelination. These findings have implications for the role of disrupted sleep in the severity of symptoms in FXS."

These expansions are highly repetitive and often hundreds to thousands of repeats in length, making accurate identification and determination of repeat length via PCR or sequencing challenging. Here we describe a protocol for monitoring repeat length in <i>Drosophila</i> models carrying 1,000 repeat <i>C9orf72</i>-related dipeptide repeat transgenes using Southern blotting. This protocol has been used regularly to check the length of these lines for over 100 generations with robust and repeatable results and can be implemented for monitoring any repeat expansion in <i>Drosophila</i>."

    "title": "Influence of Gestational Chlorpyrifos Exposure on ASD-like Behaviors in an fmr1-KO Rat Model.",
    "abstract": "Based on previous reports, exposure to pesticides could be linked to the prevalence increase of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Gestational exposure to chlorpyrifos (CPF) has been associated with ASD diagnosis in humans and ASD-like behaviors in rodents. However, ASD severity degree results from the complex relationship between genetic background and environmental factors. Thus, animals with a genetic vulnerability and prenatally exposed to CPF could have a more severe ASD-like phenotype. Fragile X syndrome is one of the most common monogenic causes of ASD, characterized by a mutation in the X chromosome which alters the expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Based on this, some fmr1 knockout (KO) rodent models have been developed to study the physiological and genetic basis of ASD. Both fmr1-KO and wild-type male rats (F2 generation) were used in the present study. F1 pregnant females were randomly exposed to 1 mg/kg/mL/day of CPF (s.c.) from GD12.5-15.5 or vehicle. Different behavioral, developmental, and molecular variables were analyzed in F2 males. KO rats were heavier, emitted altered USVs, were socially inefficient, reacted more to a novel stimulus, were hyperactive when exploring a new context, but hypoactive when exploring anxiety-inducing environments, and had an upregulated hippocampal expression of the grin2c gene. When exposed to low doses of CPF during gestation, these KO rats showed decreased climbing capacity, dysfunctional social interaction, and increased hippocampal expression for kcc1 and 5ht2c genes. Gestational CPF exposure increased the ASD-like phenotype in those animals with a genetic vulnerability, although its effect was less generalized than expected. It is the first time that this additive effect of CPF exposure and the fmr1-KO genetic vulnerability model is explored concerning social traits or any other behavior."

    "abstract": "The field of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) has undergone significant progress over the last decade. Direct haplotyping has been successfully applied for NIPD of few single-gene disorders. However, technical issues remain for triplet-repeat expansions. The objective of this study was to develop an NIPD approach for couples at risk of transmitting dynamic mutations. This method includes targeted enrichment for linked-read libraries and targeted maternal plasma DNA sequencing. We also developed an innovative Bayesian procedure to integrate the Hoobari fetal genotyping model for inferring the fetal haplotype and the targeted gene variant status. Our method of directly resolving parental haplotypes through targeted linked-read sequencing was smoothly performed using blood samples from families with Huntington's disease or myotonic dystrophy type 1. The Bayesian analysis of transmission of parental haplotypes allowed defining the genotype of five fetuses. The predicted variant status of four of these fetuses was in agreement with the invasive prenatal diagnosis findings. Conversely, no conclusive result was obtained for the NIPD of fragile X syndrome. Although improvements should be made to achieve clinically acceptable accuracy, our study shows that linked-read sequencing and parental haplotype phasing can be successfully used for NIPD of triplet-repeat expansion diseases.Trial registration: NCT04698551_date of first registration: 07/01/2021."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, has been one of the first neurodevelopmental disorders in which molecular and neuronal mechanisms of disease were identified, leading to the concept of targeting the underlying disease to reverse symptoms. Translating findings in basic science and animal models to humans with FXS has proven difficult. These challenges have prompted the FXS field to organize to build interlocking projects and initiatives to improve consistency of supportive care, make clinical research accessible to families, generate collaborative research on natural history, outcome measures and biomarkers, and create clinical trial consortia and novel trial designs. This work has resulted in improved success in recent clinical trials, providing key steps toward regulatory approval of disease-targeted treatments for FXS. Progress in the FXS field has informed translation of transformative new disease-targeted therapies for other monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders."

Patients of fragile X syndrome (FXS) also manifest symptoms, e.g. deficits in social behaviors, that are core traits with ASD. Several studies demonstrated that a mutual defect in retinoic acid (RA) signaling was observed in FXS and ASD. However, it is still unknown whether RA replenishment could pose a positive effect on autistic-like behaviors in FXS. Herein, we found that RA signaling was indeed down-regulated when the expression of <i>FMR1</i> was impaired in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, RA supplementation rescued the atypical social novelty behavior, but failed to alleviate the defects in sociability behavior or hyperactivity, in <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out (KO) mouse model. The repetitive behavior and motor coordination appeared to be normal. The RNA sequencing results of the prefrontal cortex in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice indicated that deregulated expression of <i>Foxp2, Tnfsf10, Lepr</i> and other neuronal genes was restored to normal after RA treatment. Gene ontology terms of metabolic processes, extracellular matrix organization and behavioral pathways were enriched.

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, is caused by the lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression. FMRP is an mRNA binding protein with functions in mRNA transport, localization, and translational control. In Fmr1 knockout mice, dysregulated translation has been linked to pathophysiology, including abnormal synaptic function and dendritic morphology, and autistic-like behavioral phenotypes. The role of FMRP in morphology and function of excitatory neurons has been well studied in mice lacking Fmr1, but the impact of Fmr1 deletion on inhibitory neurons remains less characterized. Moreover, the contribution of FMRP in different cell types to FXS pathophysiology is not well defined. We sought to characterize whether FMRP loss in parvalbumin or somatostatin-expressing neurons results in FXS-like deficits in mice. We used Cre-lox recombinase technology to generate two lines of conditional knockout mice lacking FMRP in either parvalbumin or somatostatin-expressing cells and carried out a battery of behavioral tests to assess motor function, anxiety, repetitive, stereotypic, social behaviors, and learning and memory. In addition, we used fluorescent non-canonical amino acid tagging along with immunostaining to determine whether de novo protein synthesis is dysregulated in parvalbumin or somatostatin-expressing neurons. De novo protein synthesis was elevated in hippocampal parvalbumin and somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons in Fmr1 knockout mice. Cell type-specific deletion of Fmr1 in parvalbumin-expressing neurons resulted in anxiety-like behavior, impaired social behavior, and dysregulated de novo protein synthesis. In contrast, deletion of Fmr1 in somatostatin-expressing neurons did not result in behavioral abnormalities and did not significantly impact de novo protein synthesis. This is the first report of how loss of FMRP in two specific subtypes of inhibitory neurons is associated with distinct FXS-like abnormalities. The mouse models we generated are limited by whole body knockout of FMRP in parvalbumin or somatostatin-expressing cells and further studies are needed to establish a causal relationship between cellular deficits and FXS-like behaviors. Our findings indicate a cell type-specific role for FMRP in parvalbumin-expressing neurons in regulating distinct behavioral features associated with FXS."

    "abstract": "The fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene contains an expansion-prone CGG repeat within its 5' UTR. Alleles with 55-200 repeats are known as premutation (PM) alleles and confer risk for one or more of the FMR1 premutation (PM) disorders that include Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), Fragile X-associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI), and Fragile X-Associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (FXAND). PM alleles expand on intergenerational transmission, with the children of PM mothers being at risk of inheriting alleles with > 200 CGG repeats (full mutation FM) alleles) and thus developing Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). PM alleles can be somatically unstable. This can lead to individuals being mosaic for multiple size alleles. Here, we describe a detailed evaluation of somatic mosaicism in a large cohort of female PM carriers and show that 94% display some evidence of somatic instability with the presence of a series of expanded alleles that differ from the next allele by a single repeat unit. Using two different metrics for instability that we have developed, we show that, as with intergenerational instability, there is a direct relationship between the extent of somatic expansion and the number of CGG repeats in the originally inherited allele and an inverse relationship with the number of AGG interruptions. Expansions are progressive as evidenced by a positive correlation with age and by examination of blood samples from the same individual taken at different time points. Our data also suggests the existence of other genetic or environmental factors that affect the extent of somatic expansion. Importantly, the analysis of candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) suggests that two DNA repair factors, FAN1 and MSH3, may be modifiers of somatic expansion risk in the PM population as observed in other repeat expansion disorders."

Although postsynaptic forms of plasticity typically require local protein synthesis, whether and how local protein synthesis contributes to presynaptic changes remain unclear. Here, we examined the mouse hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 synapse, which expresses both structural and functional presynaptic plasticity and contains presynaptic fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein involved in postsynaptic protein-synthesis-dependent plasticity. We report that MF boutons contain ribosomes and synthesize protein locally. The long-term potentiation of MF-CA3 synaptic transmission (MF-LTP) was associated with the translation-dependent enlargement of MF boutons. Remarkably, increasing in vitro or in vivo MF activity enhanced the protein synthesis in MFs. Moreover, the deletion of presynaptic FMRP blocked structural and functional MF-LTP, suggesting that FMRP is a critical regulator of presynaptic MF plasticity. Thus, presynaptic FMRP and protein synthesis dynamically control presynaptic structure and function in the mature mammalian brain."

Among these, a genetic etiology can be identified in 20-40% of cases when a full genetic work-up is completed. The Fragile X premutation state (characterized by the presence of 55-200 CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene) is a relatively newly identified disease state that has since been associated with several disorders including fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) and most recently, fragile X-associated neurodevelopmental disorders (FXAND) which commonly includes anxiety and depression. In addition to these associated disorders, extant literature and clinical observations have suggested an association between the premutation state and ASD. In this paper, we review the literature pertinent to this and discuss possible molecular mechanisms that may explain this association. This includes lowered levels of the FMR1 Protein (FMRP), GABA deficits, mitochondrial dysfunction and secondary genetic abnormalities that is seen in premutation carriers as well as their increased vulnerability to environmental stressors. Understanding these mechanisms can facilitate development of targeted treatment for specific sub-groups of ASD and premutation disorders in future."

The mPTP mediates leakage of protons across the IMM during low-conductance opening and is specifically inhibited by cyclosporine A (CsA). Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is a regulator of the mPTP, and tissue-specific differences have been found in CoQ content and open probability of the mPTP in forebrain and heart mitochondria in a newborn mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS, Fmr1 knockout). We developed a technique to determine the voltage threshold for mPTP opening in this mutant strain, exploiting the role of the mPTP as a proton leak channel. To do so, oxygen consumption and membrane potential (ΔΨ) were simultaneously measured in isolated mitochondria using polarography and a tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP<sup>+</sup>) ion-selective electrode during leak respiration. The threshold for mPTP opening was determined by the onset of CsA-mediated inhibition of proton leak at specific membrane potentials. Using this approach, differences in voltage gating of the mPTP were precisely defined in the context of CoQ excess. This novel technique will permit future investigation for enhancing the understanding of physiological and pathological regulation of low-conductance opening of the mPTP."

We treated adult male <i>Fmr1</i> KO and WT mice subacutely with three different classes of hypnotics (DORA-22, ramelteon, and zolpidem) and caffeine, a methylxanthine stimulant, and we tested the effects of treatments on sleep duration and behavior.

To address the validity of predictive models, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on behavioural phenotypes of the knock-out rodent model for Fragile X syndrome according to the PRISMA reporting guidelines. In addition, factors accountable for the heterogeneity between findings were analyzed. The knock-out model showed good translational validity and replicability for hyperactivity, cognitive and seizure phenotypes. Despite low replicability, translational validity was also found for social behaviour and sensory sensitivity, but not for attention, aggression and cognitive flexibility. Anxiety, acoustic startle and prepulse inhibition phenotypes, despite low replicability, were opposite to patient symptomatology. Subgroup analyses for experimental factors moderately explain the low replicability, these analyses were hindered by under-reporting of methodologies and environmental conditions. Together, the model has translational validity for most clinical phenotypes, but caution must be taken due to low effect sizes and high inter-study variability. These findings should be considered in view of other rodent models in preclinical research."

Diagnosing FXS is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the condition, subtle physical characteristics at the time of birth and similarity of phenotypes to other conditions. The medical complexity of FXS underscores an urgent need to develop more efficient and effective screening methods to identify individuals with FXS. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) and electronic health records (EHRs) to accelerate FXS diagnosis. The EHRs of 2.1 million patients served by the University of Wisconsin Health System (UW Health) were the main data source for this retrospective study. UW Health includes patients from south central Wisconsin, with approximately 33 years (1988-2021) of digitized health data. We identified all participants who received a code for FXS in the form of International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Ninth or Tenth Revision (ICD9 = 759.83, ICD10 = Q99.2). Only individuals who received the FXS code on at least two occasions (\"Rule of 2\") were classified as clinically diagnosed cases. To ensure the availability of sufficient data prior to clinical diagnosis to test the model, only individuals who were diagnosed after age 10 were included in the analysis. A supervised random forest classifier was used to create an AI-assisted pre-screening tool to identify cases with FXS, 5 years earlier than the time of clinical diagnosis based on their medical records. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was reported. The AUROC shows the level of success in identification of cases and controls (AUROC = 1 represents perfect classification). 52 individuals were identified as target cases and matched with 5200 controls. AI-assisted pre-screening tool successfully identified cases with FXS, 5 years earlier than the time of clinical diagnosis with an AUROC of 0.717. A separate model trained and tested on UW Health cases achieved the AUROC of 0.798. This result shows the potential utility of our tool in accelerating FXS diagnosis in real clinical settings. Earlier diagnosis can lead to more timely intervention and access to services with the goal of improving patients' health outcomes."

The mGluR Theory of FX predicts that pathological synaptic changes arise from the excessive translation of mRNAs downstream of mGlu<sub>1/5</sub> activation.

Our results identify a significant increase in the translation of ribosomal proteins (RPs) upon mGlu<sub>1/5</sub> stimulation that coincides with a reduced translation of long mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins. These changes are mimicked and occluded in Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> neurons. Inhibiting RP translation significantly impairs mGluR-LTD and prevents the length-dependent shift in the translating population. Together, these results suggest that pathological changes in FX result from a length-dependent alteration in the translating population that is supported by excessive RP translation."

Maternal FMR1 intermediate (45-54 repeats) and premutation (PM: 55-<200 repeats) alleles usually expand to full mutation (>200 repeats) alleles in offspring and consequently, cause fragile X syndrome (FXS) in them. In a prospective cohort study, Pakistani pregnant women in prenatal care were first screened for FMR1 expanded alleles. In the follow-up, pregnancy outcomes in women carrying FMR1 expanded alleles were recorded and their newborn offspring were also screened for FXS. In a total of 1950 pregnant women, 89 (4.6%) were detected carriers for FMR1 expanded alleles; however, rates of detection of expanded alleles were found significantly high in women with a history of FXS. In addition, miscarriages and birth of affected newborns with FXS were significantly more common in women carrying large size PM alleles and had a history of FXS (P = 0.0494 and P = 0.0494, respectively). The current study provides the first evidence of screening Pakistani pregnant women for FMR1 expanded alleles in prenatal care. Moreover, the miscarriage was also detected as a clinical predictor for FXS. Offspring would have a higher risk of developing FXS due to maternal FMR1 alleles expansions during transmission. This is the first prospective cohort study in Pakistan for finding FMR1 allelic status of pregnant women and their newborn offspring in follow-up. The robust offspring risk for FXS estimated in this study may be valuable information for genetic counseling of women carriers for FMR1 expanded alleles. The family history and miscarriage were detected as effective indicators for FXS carrier screening in Pakistani women."

We show that AKT supersedes UPF2 in exon-junction complexes (EJCs) that are devoid of RNPS1 but contain CASC3, defining an unanticipated insulin-stimulated EJC. Without altering UPF1 RNA binding or ATPase activity, AKT-mediated phosphorylation of the UPF1 CH domain at T151 augments UPF1 helicase activity, which is critical for NMD and also decreases the dependence of helicase activity on ATP. We demonstrate that upregulation of AKT signaling contributes to the hyperactivation of NMD that typifies Fragile X syndrome, as exemplified using FMR1-KO neural stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells."

We identify CPEB3, a protein implicated in memory consolidation, as an upstream effector critical to GluA2 mRNA expression in FXS. Increased GluA2 mRNA is translated into an increase in GluA2 subunits, a switch in synaptic AMPAR phenotype from GluA2-lacking, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable to GluA2-containing, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-impermeable, reduced inhibitory synaptic transmission, and loss of NMDAR-independent LTP at glutamatergic synapses onto CA1 inhibitory interneurons.

Metabolic pathways including translation and respiration are significantly upregulated across most cell types with the notable exception of excitatory neurons. These effects point to a potential difference in the activity of mTOR pathways, and together with other dysregulated pathways, suggest an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the Fmr1-knock out cortex that is exacerbated by astrocytes. Our data demonstrate that FMRP loss affects abundance of key cellular communication genes that potentially affect neuronal synapses and provide a resource for interrogating the biological basis of this disorder."

A primary focus of research has been to determine mRNA targets of the FXPs in vivo through pull-down techniques, and to validate them through in vitro binding studies; another approach has been to perform in vitro selection experiments to identify RNA sequence and structural targets. These mRNA targets can be further investigated as potential targets for FXS therapeutics. The most established RNA structural target of this family of proteins is the G-quadruplex. In this article, we report a 99 nucleotide RNA target that is bound by all three FXPs with nanomolar equilibrium constants. Furthermore, we determined that the last 102 amino acids of FMRP, which includes the RGG motif, were necessary and sufficient to bind this RNA target. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of only a few examples of non-G-quadruplex, non-homopolymer RNAs bound by the RGG motif/C-termini of FMRP."

    "abstract": "The etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains unclear, due to genetic heterogeneity and heterogeneity in symptoms across individuals. This study compares ASD symptomatology between monogenetic syndromes with a high ASD prevalence, in order to reveal syndrome specific vulnerabilities and to clarify how genetic variations affect ASD symptom presentation. We assessed ASD symptom severity in children and young adults (aged 0-28 years) with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS, <i>n</i> = 60), Angelman Syndrome (AS, <i>n</i> = 91), Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1, <i>n</i> = 279) and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC, <i>n</i> = 110), using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and Social Responsiveness Scale. Assessments were part of routine clinical care at the ENCORE expertise center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. First, we compared the syndrome groups on the ASD classification prevalence and ASD severity scores. Then, we compared individuals in our syndrome groups with an ASD classification to a non-syndromic ASD group (nsASD, <i>n</i> = 335), on both ASD severity scores and ASD symptom profiles. Severity scores were compared using MANCOVAs with IQ and gender as covariates. Overall, ASD severity scores were highest for the FXS group and lowest for the NF1 group. Compared to nsASD, individuals with an ASD classification in our syndrome groups showed less problems on the instruments' social domains. We found a relative strength in the AS group on the social cognition, communication and motivation domains and a relative challenge in creativity; a relative strength of the NF1 group on the restricted interests and repetitive behavior scale; and a relative challenge in the FXS and TSC groups on the restricted interests and repetitive behavior domain. The syndrome-specific strengths and challenges we found provide a frame of reference to evaluate an individual's symptoms relative to the larger syndromic population and to guide treatment decisions. Our findings support the need for personalized care and a dimensional, symptom-based diagnostic approach, in contrast to a dichotomous ASD diagnosis used as a prerequisite for access to healthcare services. Similarities in ASD symptom profiles between AS and FXS, and between NF1 and TSC may reflect similarities in their neurobiology. Deep phenotyping studies are required to link neurobiological markers to ASD symptomatology."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent cause of X-linked inherited intellectual disabilities (ID) and the most frequent monogenic form of autism spectrum disorders. It is caused by an expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat located in the 5'UTR of the <i>FMR1</i> gene, resulting in the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein, FMRP. Other mechanisms such as deletions or point mutations of the <i>FMR1</i> gene have been described and account for approximately 1% of individuals with FXS. Here, we report a 7-year-old boy with FXS with a <i>de novo</i> deletion of approximately 1.1 Mb encompassing several genes, including the <i>FMR1</i> and the <i>ASFMR1</i> genes, and several miRNAs, whose lack of function could result in the observed proband phenotypes. In addition, we also demonstrate that <i>FMR4</i> completely overlaps with <i>ASFMR1</i>, and there are no sequencing differences between both transcripts (i.e., <i>ASFMR1/FMR4</i> throughout the article)."

    "title": "Fmr1 exon 14 skipping in late embryonic development of the rat forebrain.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome, the major cause of inherited intellectual disability among men, is due to deficiency of the synaptic functional regulator FMR1 protein (FMRP), encoded by the FMRP translational regulator 1 (FMR1) gene. FMR1 alternative splicing produces distinct transcripts that may consequently impact FMRP functional roles. In transcripts without exon 14 the translational reading frame is shifted. For deepening current knowledge of the differential expression of Fmr1 exon 14 along the rat nervous system development, we conducted a descriptive study employing quantitative RT-PCR and BLAST of RNA-Seq datasets. We observed in the rat forebrain progressive decline of total Fmr1 mRNA from E11 to P112 albeit an elevation on P3; and exon-14 skipping in E17-E20 with downregulation of the resulting mRNA. We tested if the reduced detection of messages without exon 14 could be explained by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) vulnerability, but knocking down UPF1, a major component of this pathway, did not increase their quantities. Conversely, it significantly decreased FMR1 mRNA having exon 13 joined with either exon 14 or exon 15 site A. The forebrain in the third embryonic week of the rat development is a period with significant skipping of Fmr1 exon 14. This alternative splicing event chronologically precedes a reduction of total Fmr1 mRNA, suggesting that it may be part of combinatorial mechanisms downregulating the gene's expression in the late embryonic period. The decay of FMR1 mRNA without exon 14 should be mediated by a pathway different from NMD. Finally, we provide evidence of FMR1 mRNA stabilization by UPF1, likely depending on FMRP."

    "abstract": "A dynamic mutation in exon 1 of the FMR1 gene causes Fragile X-related Disorders (FXDs), due to the expansion of an unstable CGG repeat sequence. Based on the CGG sequence size, two types of FMR1 alleles are possible: “premutation” (PM, with 56-200 CGGs) and “full mutation” (FM, with >200 triplets). Premutated females are at risk of transmitting a FM allele that, when methylated, epigenetically silences FMR1 and causes Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a very common form of inherited intellectual disability (ID). Expansions events of the CGG sequence are predominant over contractions and are responsible for meiotic and mitotic instability. The CGG repeat usually includes one or more AGG interspersed triplets that influence allele stability and the risk of transmitting FM to children through maternal meiosis. A unique mechanism responsible for repeat instability has not been identified, but several processes are under investigations using cellular and animal models. The formation of unusual secondary DNA structures at the expanded repeats are likely to occur and contribute to the CGG expansion. This review will focus on the current knowledge about CGG repeat instability addressing the CGG sequence expands."

    "abstract": "Fragile X encompasses a range of genetic conditions, all of which result as a function of changes within the FMR1 gene and abnormal production and/or expression of the FMR1 gene products. Individuals with Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common heritable form of intellectual disability, have a full-mutation sequence (>200 CGG repeats) which brings about transcriptional silencing of FMR1 and loss of FMR protein (FMRP). Despite considerable progress in our understanding of FXS, safe, effective, and reliable treatments that either prevent or reduce the severity of the FXS phenotype have not been approved. While current FXS animal models contribute their own unique understanding to the molecular, cellular, physiological, and behavioral deficits associated with FXS, no single animal model is able to fully recreate the FXS phenotype. This review will describe the status and rationale in the development, validation, and utility of three emerging animal model systems for FXS, namely the nonhuman primate (NHP), Mongolian gerbil, and chicken. These developing animal models will provide a sophisticated resource in which the deficits in complex functions of perception, action, and cognition in the human disorder are accurately reflected and aid in the successful translation of novel therapeutics and interventions to the clinic setting."

    "abstract": "Expressive language sampling (ELS) is a frequently used tool for language analysis, as it can be used across widely ranging cognitive and language abilities. ELS can also evaluate pragmatic language, including excessive self-repetition, which is challenging to assess with traditional standardized assessments. This study explored how a well-established ELS protocol can assess three types of linguistic self-repetition in three neurodevelopmental disabilities: fragile X syndrome (FXS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and Down syndrome (DS). We examined its ability to differentiate between these disorders, the relationships between repetitive language and other participant characteristics, and initial construct validity. We found that the groups with FXS and ASD differed significantly on each of the three repetitive language measure, and that the group with DS differed from either ASD or FXS on two. Cognitive ability was significantly related to phrase repetition in the group with ASD. When the groups were combined, there was evidence of convergent and divergent validity. This study extends previous research on ELS and supports its use as a means to characterize pragmatic language. It also provides information about the relationships between repetitive language and other phenotypic characteristics."

It is therefore important to distinguish these disorders from each other as well as from typical development.

This review focuses on EEG and MEG studies of resting state in ASD and FXS, a neuroimaging paradigm frequently used with difficult-to-test populations. It compares the brain regions and frequency bands that appear to be impacted, either in power or connectivity, in each disorder; as well as how these abnormalities may result in the observed symptoms. It argues that the findings in these studies are inconsistent and do not fit neatly into existing models of ASD and FXS, then highlights the gaps in the literature and recommends future avenues of inquiry."

Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on male premutation carriers (CGG55–200) and prioritized candidate variants to screen for candidate genetic modifiers using a Drosophila model of FXTAS. We found 18 genes that genetically modulate CGG-associated neurotoxicity in Drosophila, such as Prosbeta5 (PSMB5), pAbp (PABPC1L), e(y)1 (TAF9), and CG14231 (OSGEPL1). Among them, knockdown of Prosbeta5 (PSMB5) suppressed CGG-associated neurodegeneration in the fly as well as in N2A cells. Interestingly, an expression quantitative trait locus variant in PSMB5, PSMB5rs11543947-A, was found to be associated with decreased expression of PSMB5 and delayed onset of FXTAS in human FMR1 premutation carriers. Finally, we demonstrate evidence that PSMB5 knockdown results in suppression of CGG neurotoxicity via both the RAN translation and RNA-mediated toxicity mechanisms, thereby presenting a therapeutic strategy for FXTAS."

Clinical diagnostic laboratories use Southern blot analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests to detect and/or size the FMR1 CGG repeats. The development of sensitive and high-throughput triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) assays has diminished the need to subject all samples to Southern blot analysis, which is both labor- and time-intensive.

We outline a protocol that is based on melting curve analysis of dTP-PCR amplicons for a rapid and cost-effective first-tier screening and identification of individuals with premutation and full-mutation expansions. We also describe a protocol that employs capillary electrophoresis to resolve the dTP-PCR amplicon fragments and to estimate the repeat sizes of normal (5 to 44 copies), intermediate (45 to 54 copies), and premutation alleles, as well as to detect full mutations and determine the structure of the FMR1 alleles. © 2022 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Girls with fragile X syndrome (FXS) often manifest significant symptoms of avoidance, anxiety, and arousal, particularly in the context of social interaction. However, little is currently known about the associations among neurobiological, biobehavioral such as eye gaze pattern, and social-cognitive dysfunction in real-world settings. In this study, we sought to characterize brain network properties and eye gaze patterns in girls with FXS during natural social interaction. Participants included 42 girls with FXS and 31 age- and verbal IQ-matched girls (control). Portable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and an eye gaze tracker were used to investigate brain network alterations and eye gaze patterns associated with social-cognitive dysfunction in girls with FXS during a structured face-to-face conversation. Compared to controls, girls with FXS showed significantly increased inter-regional functional connectivity and greater excitability within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), frontal eye field (FEF) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) during the conversation. Girls with FXS showed significantly less eye contact with their conversational partner and more unregulated eye gaze behavior compared to the control group. We also demonstrated that a machine learning approach based on multimodal data, including brain network properties and eye gaze patterns, was predictive of multiple domains of social-cognitive behaviors in girls with FXS. Our findings expand current knowledge of neural mechanisms and eye gaze behaviors underlying naturalistic social interaction in girls with FXS. These results could be further evaluated and developed as intermediate phenotypic endpoints for treatment trial evaluation in girls with FXS."

    "abstract": "Repeat diseases, such as fragile X syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Friedreich ataxia, Huntington disease, spinocerebellar ataxias, and some forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are caused by repetitive DNA sequences that are expanded in affected individuals. The age at which an individual begins to experience symptoms, and the severity of disease, are partially determined by the size of the repeat. However, the epigenetic state of the area in and around the repeat also plays an important role in determining the age of disease onset and the rate of disease progression. Many repeat diseases share a common epigenetic pattern of increased methylation at CpG islands near the repeat region. CpG islands are CG-rich sequences that are tightly regulated by methylation and are often found at gene enhancer or insulator elements in the genome. Methylation of CpG islands can inhibit binding of the transcriptional regulator CTCF, resulting in a closed chromatin state and gene down regulation. The downregulation of these genes leads to some disease-specific symptoms. Additionally, a genetic and epigenetic interplay is suggested by an effect of methylation on repeat instability, a hallmark of large repeat expansions that leads to increasing disease severity in successive generations. In this review, we will discuss the common epigenetic patterns shared across repeat diseases, how the genetics and epigenetics interact, and how this could be involved in disease manifestation. We also discuss the currently available stem cell and mouse models, which frequently do not recapitulate epigenetic patterns observed in human disease, and propose alternative strategies to study the role of epigenetics in repeat diseases."

    "abstract": "Sensory impairments commonly occur in patients with autism or intellectual disability. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one form of intellectual disability that is often comorbid with autism. In electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings obtained from humans with FXS, the ability of cortical regions to consistently synchronize, or \"phase-lock\", to modulated auditory stimuli is reduced compared to that of typically developing individuals. At the same time, less time-locked, \"non-phase-locked\" power induced by sounds is higher. The same changes occur in the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse - an animal model of FXS. We determined if Fmr1 deletion in a subset of brainstem auditory neurons plays any role in these EEG changes in the mouse. We reinstated FMRP expression in a subpopulation of brainstem auditory neurons in an otherwise Fmr1 KO control (conditional on; cON Fmr1) mouse and used EEG recordings to determine if reinstatement normalized, or \"rescued\", the phase-locking phenotype observed in the cON Fmr1 mouse. In determining rescue, this also meant that Fmr1 deletion in the same neuron population was necessary for the phenotype to occur. We find that Fmr1 reinstatement in a subset of brainstem neurons rescues certain aspects of the phase-locking phenotype but does not rescue the increase in non-phase-locked power. Unexpectedly, not all electrophysiological phenotypes observed in the Fmr1 KO were observed in the cON Fmr1 mouse used for the reinstatement experiments, and this was likely due to residual expression of FMRP in these Fmr1 KO controls. Fmr1 deletion in brainstem neurons is necessary for certain aspects of the decreased phase-locking phenotype in the Fmr1 KO, but not necessary for the increase in non-phase-locked power induced by a sound. The most likely brainstem structure underlying these results is the inferior colliculus. We also demonstrate that low levels of FMRP can rescue some EEG phenotypes but not others. This latter finding provides a foundation for how symptoms in FXS individuals may vary due to FMRP levels and that reinstatement of low FMRP levels may be sufficient to alleviate particular symptoms."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited form of intellectual disability, is caused by loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). GABAergic system dysfunction is one of the hallmarks of FXS, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report that FMRP interacts with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) and modulates its single-channel activity. Specifically, FMRP regulates spontaneous GABA<sub>A</sub>R opening through modulating its single-channel conductance and open probability in dentate granule cells. FMRP loss reduces spontaneous GABA<sub>A</sub>R activity underlying tonic inhibition, while N-terminal FMRP fragment (aa 1-297) is sufficient to rapidly normalize tonic inhibition in Fmr1 knockout (KO) granule cells. FMRP-GABA<sub>A</sub>R interaction is supported by co-immunoprecipitation of FMRP with at least one GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit, the α5. Functionally, FMRP-GABA<sub>A</sub>R interaction ensures accuracy of coincidence detection of granule cells, which is markedly reduced in Fmr1 KOs. Our study reveals a mechanism underlying FMRP regulation of the GABAergic system and information processing in the hippocampus."

Epigenetic silencing of FMR1 results in loss of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Although most studies to date have focused on excitatory neurons, recent evidence suggests that GABAergic inhibitory networks are also affected. To investigate human GABAergic neurogenesis, we established a method to reproducibly derive inhibitory neurons from multiple FXS and control human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines. Electrophysiological analyses suggested that the developing FXS neurons had a delay in the GABA functional switch, a transition in fetal development that converts the GABAA channel's function from depolarization to hyperpolarization, with profound effects on the developing brain. To investigate the cause of this delay, we analyzed 14 400 single-cell transcriptomes from FXS and control cells at 2 stages of GABAergic neurogenesis. While control and FXS cells were similar at the earlier time point, the later-stage FXS cells retained expression of neuroblast proliferation-associated genes and had lower levels of genes associated with action potential regulation, synapses, and mitochondria compared with controls. Our analysis suggests that loss of FMRP prolongs the proliferative stage of progenitors, which may result in more neurons remaining immature during the later stages of neurogenesis. This could have profound implications for homeostatic excitatory-inhibitory circuit development in FXS, and suggests a novel direction for understanding disease mechanisms that may help to guide therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most prevalent inherited intellectual disability and one of the most common monogenic forms of autism, is caused by a loss of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1). We have previously shown that FMR1 represses the levels and activities of ubiquitin ligase MDM2 in young adult FMR1-deficient mice, and treatment by a MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 rescues both hippocampal neurogenic and cognitive deficits in FMR1-deficient mice when analyzed shortly after the administration. However, it is unknown whether Nutlin-3 treatment can have long-lasting therapeutic effects. We treated 2-month-old young adult FMR1-deficient mice with Nutlin-3 for 10 days and then assessed the persistent effect of Nutlin-3 on both cognitive functions and adult neurogenesis when mice were 6-month-old mature adults. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the persistent effects of Nutlin-3, we analyzed the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells isolated from these mice and assessed the transcriptome of the hippocampal tissues of treated mice. We found that transient treatment with Nutlin-3 of 2-month-old young adult FMR1-deficient mice prevents the emergence of neurogenic and cognitive deficits in mature adult FXS mice at 6 months of age. We further found that the long-lasting restoration of neurogenesis and cognitive function might not be mediated by changing intrinsic properties of adult neural stem cells. Transcriptomic analysis of the hippocampal tissue demonstrated that transient Nultin-3 treatment leads to significant expression changes in genes related to the extracellular matrix, secreted factors, and cell membrane proteins in the FMR1-deficient hippocampus. Our data indicates that transient Nutlin-3 treatment in young adults leads to long-lasting neurogenic and behavioral changes likely through modulating adult neurogenic niche that impact adult neural stem cells. Our results demonstrate that cognitive impairments in FXS may be prevented by an early intervention through Nutlin-3 treatment."

Under the catalytic regulation of relevant enzymes, m6A participates in the body's pathophysiological processes via mediating RNA transcription, splicing, translation, and decay. In the past, we mainly focused on the regulation of m6A in tumors such as hematological tumors, cervical cancer, breast cancer. In recent years, it has been found that m6A is enriched in mRNAs of neurogenesis, cell cycle, and neuron differentiation. Its regulation in the nervous system is gradually being recognized. When the level of m6A modification and the expression levels of relevant enzyme proteins are changed, it will cause neurological dysfunction and participate in the occurrence and conversion of neurological diseases. Recent studies have found that the m6A modification and its associated enzymes were involved in major depressive disorder, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Fragile X syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury, and they also play a key role in the development of neurological diseases and many other neurological diseases. This paper mainly reviewed the recent progress of m6A modification-related enzymes, focusing on the impact of m6A modification and related enzyme-mediated regulation of gene expression on the central nervous system diseases, so as to provide potential targets for the prevention of neurological diseases."

    "title": "Multiple Early-Life Seizures Alters Neonatal Communicative Behavior in Fmr1 Knockout Mice.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability and a significant contributor to Autism Spectrum Disorder. Individuals with FXS are subject to developing numerous comorbidities, one of the most prevalent being seizures. In the present study, we investigated how seizures affected neonatal communicative behavior in the FXS mouse model. On postnatal day (PD) 7 through 11, we administered 3 flurothyl seizures per day to both Fmr1 knockout and wild-type C57BL/6J male mice. Ultrasonic vocalizations were recorded on PD12. Statistically significant alterations were found in both spectral and temporal measurements across seizure groups. We found that induction of seizures across PD7-11 resulted in an increased fundamental frequency (pitch) of ultrasonic vocalizations produced (p < 0.05), a longer duration of calls (p < 0.05), and a greater cumulative duration of calls (p < 0.05) in both genotypes. Induction of seizures across PD7-11 also resulted in a decreased latency to the first emitted vocalization (p < 0.05) and a decrease in mean power (loudness) for their vocalizations (p < 0.05). Early-life seizures also resulted in an increase in the number of downward and frequency step call types (p < 0.05). There was a significant increase in the number of chevron calls emitted from the Fmr1 knockout mice that received seizures compared to knockout control and wild-type seizure mice (p < 0.05). Overall, this study provides evidence that early-life seizures result in communication impairments and that superimposing seizures in Fmr1 knockout mice does produce an additional deficit in vocalization."

    "title": "Large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel haploinsufficiency leads to sensory deficits in the visual system: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Mutations in the genes encoding the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, especially KCNMA1 encoding its α-subunit, have been linked to several neurological features, including intellectual disability or autism. Associated with neurodevelopmental phenotypes, sensory function disturbances are considered to be important clinical features contributing to a variety of behavioral impairments. Large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels are important in regulating neurotransmission in sensory circuits, including visual pathways. Deficits in visual function can contribute substantially to poor quality of life, while therapeutic approaches aimed at addressing such visual deficits represent opportunities to improve neurocognitive and neurobehavioral outcomes. We describe the case of a 25-year-old Caucasian male with autism spectrum disorder and severe intellectual disability presenting large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel haploinsufficiency due to a de novo balanced translocation (46, XY, t [9; 10] [q23;q22]) disrupting the KCNMA1 gene. The visual processing pathway of the subject was evaluated using both electroretinography and visual contrast sensitivity, indicating that both retinal bipolar cell function and contrast discrimination performance were reduced by approximately 60% compared with normative control values. These findings imply a direct link between KCNMA1 gene disruption and visual dysfunction in humans. In addition, the subject reported photophobia but did not exhibit strabismus, nystagmus, or other visual findings on physical examination. This case study of a subject with large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel haploinsufficiency and photophobia revealed a visual pathway deficit at least at the retinal level, with diminished retinal light capture likely due to bipolar cell dysfunction and an associated loss of contrast sensitivity. The data suggest that large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels play an important role in the normal functioning of the visual pathway in humans, and that their disruption may play a role in visual and other sensory system symptomatology in large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channelopathies or conditions where disruption of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel function is a relevant feature of the pathophysiology, such as fragile X syndrome. This work suggests that the combined use of physiological (electroretinography) and functional (contrast sensitivity) approaches may have utility as a biomarker strategy for identifying and characterizing visual processing deficits in individuals with large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channelopathy.

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable form of mental retardation and monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). FXS is due to a mutation in the X-linked FMR1 gene and is characterized by motor, cognitive and social alterations, mostly overlapping with ASD behavioral phenotypes. The severity of these symptoms and their timing may be exacerbated and/or advanced by environmental adversity interacting with the genetic mutation. We therefore tested the effects of the prenatal exposure to unpredictable chronic stress on the behavioral phenotype of juveniles of both sexes in the Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mouse model of FXS. Mice underwent behavioral tests at 7-8 weeks of age, that is, when most of the relevant behavioral alterations are absent or mild in Fmr1-KOs. Stress induced the early appearance of deficits in spontaneous alternation in KO male mice, without exacerbating the behavioral phenotype of mutant females. In males stress also altered social interaction and communication, but mostly in WT mice, while in females it induced effects on locomotion and communication in mice of both genotypes. Our data therefore highlight the sex-dependent relevance of early environmental stressors to interact with genetic factors to influence the appearance of selected FXS- and ASD-like phenotypes."

    "abstract": "Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDDs), such as Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder, usually manifest at birth or early childhood. IDDs are characterized by significant impairment in intellectual and adaptive functioning, and both genetic and environmental factors underpin IDD biology. Molecular and genetic stratification of IDDs remain challenging mainly due to overlapping factors and comorbidity. Advances in high throughput sequencing, imaging, and tools to record behavioral data at scale have greatly enhanced our understanding of the molecular, cellular, structural, and environmental basis of some IDDs. Fueled by the \"big data\" revolution, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies have brought a whole new paradigm shift in computational biology. Evidently, the ML-driven approach to clinical diagnoses has the potential to augment classical methods that use symptoms and external observations, hoping to push the personalized treatment plan forward. Therefore, integrative analyses and applications of ML technology have a direct bearing on discoveries in IDDs. The application of ML to IDDs can potentially improve screening and early diagnosis, advance our understanding of the complexity of comorbidity, and accelerate the identification of biomarkers for clinical research and drug development. For more than five decades, the IDDRC network has supported a nexus of investigators at centers across the USA, all striving to understand the interplay between various factors underlying IDDs. In this review, we introduced fast-increasing multi-modal data types, highlighted example studies that employed ML technologies to illuminate factors and biological mechanisms underlying IDDs, as well as recent advances in ML technologies and their applications to IDDs and other neurological diseases. We discussed various molecular, clinical, and environmental data collection modes, including genetic, imaging, phenotypical, and behavioral data types, along with multiple repositories that store and share such data. Furthermore, we outlined some fundamental concepts of machine learning algorithms and presented our opinion on specific gaps that will need to be filled to accomplish, for example, reliable implementation of ML-based diagnosis technology in IDD clinics. We anticipate that this review will guide researchers to formulate AI and ML-based approaches to investigate IDDs and related conditions."

    "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) mitochondria generate heat via uncoupled respiration due to excessive proton leak through uncoupling proteins (UCPs). We previously found hyperthermia in a newborn mouse model of fragile X syndrome and excessive leak in Fmr1 KO forebrain mitochondria caused by CoQ deficiency. The inefficient thermogenic nature of Fmr1 mutant forebrain mitochondria was reminiscent of BAT metabolic features. Thus, we aimed to characterize BAT mitochondrial function in these hyperthermic mice using a top-down approach. Although there was no change in steady-state levels of UCP1 expression between strains, BAT weighed significantly less in Fmr1 mutants compared with controls. Fmr1 KO BAT mitochondria demonstrated impaired substrate oxidation, lower mitochondrial membrane potentials and rates of respiration, and CoQ deficiency. The CoQ analog decylubiquinone normalized CoQ-dependent electron flux and unmasked excessive proton leak. Unlike mutant forebrain, where such deficiency resulted in pathological proton leak, CoQ deficiency within BAT mitochondria resulted largely in abnormal substrate oxidation. This suggests that CoQ is important in BAT for uncoupled respiration to produce heat during development. Although our data provide further evidence of a link between fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and CoQ biosynthesis, the results highlight the importance of CoQ in developing tissues and suggest tissue-specific differences from CoQ deficiency. Because BAT mitochondria are primarily responsible for regulating core body temperature, the defects we describe in Fmr1 KOs could manifest as an adaptive downregulated response to hyperthermia or could result from FMRP deficiency directly."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited intellectual disability caused by a deficiency in Fragile X mental retardation 1 (<i>Fmr1</i>) gene expression. Recent studies have proposed the importance of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 1 (CPEB1) in FXS pathology; however, the molecular interaction between <i>Fmr1</i> mRNA and CPEB1 has not been fully investigated. Here, we revealed that CPEB1 co-localized and interacted with <i>Fmr1</i> mRNA in hippocampal and cerebellar neurons and culture cells. Furthermore, CPEB1 knockdown upregulated <i>Fmr1</i> mRNA and protein levels and caused aberrant localization of Fragile X mental retardation protein in neurons. In an FXS cell model, CPEB1 knockdown upregulated the mRNA levels of several mitochondria-related genes and rescued the intracellular heat shock protein family A member 9 distribution. These findings suggest that CPEB1 post-transcriptionally regulated <i>Fmr1</i> expression through the 3' untranslated region, and that CPEB1 knockdown might affect mitochondrial function."

Subtypes include (A) disorders with known genetic abnormalities including fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis and (B) idiopathic ASD, conditions with unknown etiologies. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging technology that can be utilized <i>in vivo</i> for dynamic and quantitative research, and is a valuable tool for exploring pathophysiological mechanisms, evaluating therapeutic efficacy, and accelerating drug development in ASD. Recently, several imaging studies on ASD have been published and physiological changes during ASD progression was disclosed by PET. This paper reviews the specific radioligands for PET imaging of critical biomarkers in ASD, and summarizes and discusses the similar and different discoveries in outcomes of previous studies. It is of great importance to identify general physiological changes in cerebral glucose metabolism, cerebral blood flow perfusion, abnormalities in neurotransmitter systems, and inflammation in the central nervous system in ASD, which may provide excellent points for further ASD research."

Four guanine molecules form a square planar arrangement, termed G-quartet, which are stacked on top of each other to form the G4 structure in DNA (G4DNA) and in RNA (G4RNA). Recent studies have revealed that G4DNA and G4RNA are folded in cells, which suggested their biological and pharmacological significance in DNA replication, transcription, epigenetic modification, and RNA metabolism. So far, we have reported the following; 1) G4 is a target of cognitive function therapy for ATR-X intellectual disability syndrome, in which mutations are found in a G4 binding protein ATRX. 2) G4 is formed in heterochromatin depending on neuronal development. 3) G4 promotes prionoids in a CGG triplet repeat disease, Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). 4) 5-aminolevulinic acid is a potential candidate drug for treating some neurological diseases through the G4 binding ability. In this review, we summarized the significant roles of G4 in neurological diseases."

    "abstract": "Drug trials of the central nervous system(CNS) have been plagued with uninformative failures, often because of the difficulties of knowing definitively whether dosing achieved was sufficient to modulate the intended CNS target at adequate concentrations to produce pharmacodynamic or dose-related changes in readouts of brain function. Key design elements can be introduced into early-stage trials to get at this issue. This commentary builds on a review of earlier clinical studies in Fragile X syndrome to explore the extent to which the chain of evidence is in place to allow for interpretation of the results as ruling in or out the utility of modulating one or another molecular target to treat this disorder. Recent and current biomarker studies in Fragile X syndrome occurring subsequent to the clinical studies are reviewed to see if they might address any chain of evidence gaps. Despite the strong preclinical basis for targeting molecular mechanisms, the lack of efficacy seen in clinical studies remains uninterpretable, with regard to ruling in or out the utility of targeting the mechanism in a clinical population, given the absence of studies, which address whether doses of administered drug impacted the targeted brain mechanism. The value of pursuing clinical studies of compounds targeted to novel mechanisms in the absence of clinical pharmacological evidence of some anticipated mediating pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic signals is questionable. One or more biomarkers of a drug effect on brain function are needed to establish dose dependent CNS effects that allow one to interpret clinical results as ruling in or out a mechanism and providing a firm basis for continuing or not, as well as informing dose selection in any clinical efficacy trials. Initiatives to address this general need in pediatric psychopharmacology are highlighted."

    "abstract": "Aberrant neurogenesis is a major factor in psychiatric and neurological disorders that have significantly attracted the attention of neuroscientists. Curcumin is a primary constituent of curcuminoid that exerts several positive pharmacological effects on aberrant neurogenesis. First, it is important to understand the different processes of neurogenesis, and whether their dysfunction promotes etiology as well as the development of many psychiatric and neurological disorders; then investigate mechanisms by which curcumin affects neurogenesis as an active participant in pathophysiological events. Based on scientometric studies and additional extensive research, we explore the mechanisms by which curcumin regulates adult neurogenesis and in turn affects psychiatric diseases, i.e., depression and neurological disorders among them traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Gulf War Illness (GWI) and Fragile X syndrome (FXS). This review aims to elucidate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of curcumin on adult neurogenesis in various psychiatric and neurological disorders. Specifically, we discuss the regulatory role of curcumin in different activities of neural stem cells (NSCs), including proliferation, differentiation, and migration of NSCs. This is geared toward providing novel application prospects of curcumin in treating psychiatric and neurological disorders by regulating adult neurogenesis."

Our study aims to examine the specific hallmarks of psychopathology and behavioral phenotypes in four different age ranges: infancy and toddlerhood, early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence, in both genetic syndromes. The sample included 44 patients with CdLS (48% boys, age = 6.67 ± 4.36) and 31 with RSTS (48% boys, age = 6.89 ± 4.58) recruited through follow-ups. Cognitive, behavioral, and autism assessments were carried out with Griffith's scales or the Leiter-R, the Child Behavior Checklist, and the Child Autism Rating Scales 2. Multiple ANOVA 2 × 4 were run to outline behavioral phenotypic age-related syndromic markers and ANCOVA to value the weight of IQ and ASD-related traits on the psychopathological outcome. Findings showed that anxiety is a crucial phenotypic hallmark, independent of IQ but associated with autistic traits, that increases from infancy to adolescence in both CdLS and RSTS. Being aware of the developmental challenges that growing children are called to face is essential for drawing up proper standards of assessment turning into target age-related interventions, ensuring these patients personalized healthcare and improvement in life quality."

Based on behavioral and neurophysiological evidence, we tentatively subdivided the syndromes on primarily hyper-sensitive (Fragile X, Angelman) and hypo-sensitive (Phelan-McDermid, Rett, Tuberous Sclerosis, Neurofibromatosis 1), pointing to the way of segregation of heterogeneous idiopathic ASD, that includes both hyper-sensitive and hypo-sensitive individuals. This segmentation links abnormalities in different genes, such as <i>FMR1, UBE3A, GABRB3, GABRA5, GABRG3, SHANK3, MECP2, TSC1, TSC2</i>, and <i>NF1</i>, that are causative to the above-mentioned syndromes and associated with synaptic transmission and cell growth, as well as with translational and transcriptional regulation and with sensory sensitivity. Excitation/inhibition imbalance related to GABAergic signaling, and the interplay of tonic and phasic inhibition in different brain regions might underlie this relationship. However, more research is needed. As most genetic syndromes are very rare, future investigations in this field will benefit from multi-site collaboration with a common protocol for electrophysiological and event-related potential (EEG/ERP) research that should include an investigation into all modalities and stages of sensory processing, as well as potential biomarkers of GABAergic signaling (such as 40-Hz ASSR)."

FXS is a neurodevelopmental disability characterized by intellectual impairment, seizures, autistic behavior, anxiety, and obesity. Here, we analyzed body weight as a function of mouse age, diet, and genotype to determine the effect of diet (soy, casein, and grain-based) on weight gain. We also assessed plasma protein biomarker expression and behavior in response to diet. Juvenile <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> mice fed a soy protein-based rodent chow throughout gestation and postnatal development exhibit increased weight gain compared to mice fed a casein-based purified ingredient diet or grain-based, low phytoestrogen chow. Adolescent and adult <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> mice fed a soy-based infant formula diet exhibited increased weight gain compared to reference diets. Increased body mass was due to increased lean mass. Wild-type male mice fed soy-based infant formula exhibited increased learning in a passive avoidance paradigm, and <i>Fmr1<sup>KO</sup></i> male mice had a deficit in nest building. Thus, at the systems level, consumption of soy-based diets increases weight gain and affects behavior. At the molecular level, a soy-based infant formula diet was associated with altered expression of numerous plasma proteins, including the adipose hormone leptin and the β-amyloid degrading enzyme neprilysin. In conclusion, single-source, soy-based diets may contribute to the development of obesity and the exacerbation of neurological phenotypes in developmental disabilities, such as FXS."

    "abstract": "Absence of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP) causes autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability, commonly referred to as the Fragile X syndrome. FMRP is a negative regulator of protein translation and is essential for neuronal development and synapse formation. FMRP is a target for several post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation and methylation, which tightly regulate its cellular functions. Studies have indicated the involvement of FMRP in a multitude of cellular pathways, and an absence of FMRP was shown to affect several neurotransmitter receptors, for example, the GABA receptor and intracellular signaling molecules such as Akt, ERK, mTOR, and GSK3. Interestingly, many of these molecules function as protein kinases or phosphatases and thus are potentially amendable by pharmacological treatment. Several treatments acting on these kinase-phosphatase systems have been shown to be successful in preclinical models; however, they have failed to convincingly show any improvements in clinical trials. In this review, we highlight the different protein kinase and phosphatase studies that have been performed in the Fragile X syndrome. In our opinion, some of the paradoxical study conclusions are potentially due to the lack of insight into integrative kinase signaling networks in the disease. Quantitative proteome analyses have been performed in several models for the FXS to determine global molecular processes in FXS. However, only one phosphoproteomics study has been carried out in <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and it showed dysfunctional protein kinase and phosphatase signaling hubs in the brain. This suggests that the further use of phosphoproteomics approaches in Fragile X syndrome holds promise for identifying novel targets for kinase inhibitor therapies."

Indicators of the intergenerational family relationship between premutation carrier mothers and their adolescent or adult son/daughter with FXS included a measure of the quality of the relationship, as well as descriptions provided by mothers of their relationship with their son/daughter (positive remarks, critical remarks). Maladaptive behaviors decreased, maternal positive remarks increased, and maternal critical remarks and relationship quality remained stable over time. Bidirectional effects of change were observed in predicting maladaptive behaviors and maternal positive remarks, although maladaptive behaviors more strongly predicted positive remarks than the reciprocal association. This research suggests prioritizing maladaptive behaviors in the context of family interventions."

Deficits of primary cilia cause ciliopathies, leading to the pathogenesis of various developmental disorders; however, the contribution of primary cilia to neurodevelopmental disorders is largely unknown. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetically inherited disorder and is the most common known cause of autism spectrum disorders. FXS is caused by the silencing of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, which encodes for the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Here, we discovered a reduction in the number of primary cilia and the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in cerebellar Bergmann glia of Fmr1 KO mice. We further found reduced granule neuron precursor (GNP) proliferation and thickness of the external germinal layer (EGL) in Fmr1 KO mice, implicating that primary ciliary deficits in Bergmann glia may contribute to cerebellar developmental phenotypes in FXS, as Shh signaling through primary cilia in Bergmann glia is known to mediate proper GNP proliferation in the EGL. Taken together, our study demonstrates that FMRP loss leads to primary ciliary deficits in cerebellar Bergmann glia which may contribute to cerebellar deficits in FXS."

Exposure to stress is also known to be anxiogenic. However, the effects of stress on animal models of ASDs remains less explored. Hence, in the present study we examined the impact of acute foot shock stress on anxiety-like behavior in two monogenic rat models of ASDs, fragile X mental retardation 1 knockout (Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup>) and phosphatase and tensin homolog heterozygous (Pten<sup>+/-</sup>). Before exposure to stress, the basal levels of anxiety-like behavior in both Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> and Pten<sup>+/-</sup> rats were comparable to that seen in wild-type (WT) control rats in an open-field arena. After exposure to the foot shock stress, however, Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> rats showed the highest levels of anxiety-like behavior. WT animals also showed enhanced anxiety-like behavior but not as robustly as the Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> animals. In Pten<sup>+/-</sup> animals, on the other hand, the same stressor did not elicit any anxiogenic effects. In a separate group of rats, the efficacy of the acute foot shock in triggering a stress response was confirmed wherein a comparable surge in circulating corticosterone was seen in all three experimental groups. Thus, the same acute stress led to different effects on anxiety-like behavior in different rodent models of ASDs, suggesting that vulnerability to stress-induced changes in anxiety may vary with the underlying genetic mutations."

    "abstract": "Individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) have significant delays in cognition and language, as well as anxiety, symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, and challenging behaviors such as hyperactivity and aggression. Biological mothers of children with FXS, who are themselves <i>FMR1</i> premutation or full mutation carriers, are at elevated risk for mental health challenges in addition to experiencing stress associated with parenting a child with significant disabilities. However, little is known about fathers in these families, including the ways in which parental well-being influences the mother-father relationship and the impact of child characteristics on paternal and couple functioning. The current study examined features of, and relationships between, parental well-being, couple well-being, and child functioning in 23 families of young boys with FXS. Mothers and fathers independently completed multiple questionnaires about their individual well-being, couple functioning, and child behavior. One parent per family also completed an interview about the child's adaptive skills. Results suggest that both mothers and fathers in these families experience clinically significant levels of mental health challenges and elevated rates of parenting stress relative to the general population. Findings also indicate that the couples' relationship may be a source of strength that potentially buffers against some of the daily stressors faced by these families. Additionally, parents who reported less parenting stress had higher couples satisfaction and dyadic coping. Finally, parents of children with less severe challenging behaviors exhibited fewer mental health challenges, less parenting stress, and higher levels of both couples satisfaction and dyadic coping. Parents of children with higher levels of adaptive behavior also reported less parenting stress and higher couples satisfaction. Overall, this study provides evidence that families of children with FXS need access to services that not only target improvements in the child's functioning, but also ameliorate parental stress. Family-based services that include both mothers and fathers would lead to better outcomes for all family members."

Next, we established a model system for FMR1 silencing using a construct containing the FXS-related mutation upstream to a reporter gene. This construct was methylated in vitro and introduced into a genome-wide loss-of-function (LOF) library established in haploid human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), allowing the identification of genes whose functional loss reversed the methylation-induced silencing of the FMR1 reporter. Selected candidate genes were further analyzed in haploid- and FXS-patient-derived PSCs, highlighting the epigenetic and metabolic pathways involved in FMR1 regulation. Our work sheds light on the mechanisms responsible for CGG-expansion-mediated FMR1 inactivation and offers novel targets for therapeutic FMR1 reactivation."

    "abstract": "Genetic studies of hippocampal granule neuron development have been used to elucidate cellular functions of Pten and Fmr1. While mutations in each gene cause neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and fragile X syndrome, how Pten and Fmr1 function alone or together during normal development is not known. Moreover, Pten mRNA is bound by the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) RNA binding protein, but how this physical interaction impinges on phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN) expression is not known. To understand the interaction of PTEN and FMRP, we investigated the dentate gyrus granule neuron development in Pten and Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice. Interestingly, heterozygosity of Pten restored Fmr1 KO cellular phenotypes, including dendritic arborization, and spine density, while PTEN protein expression was significantly increased in Fmr1 KO animals. However, complete deletion of both Pten and Fmr1 resulted in a dramatic increase in dendritic length, spine density, and spine length. In addition, overexpression of PTEN in Fmr1 KO Pten heterozygous background reduced dendritic length, arborization, spine density, and spine length including pS6 levels. Our findings suggest that PTEN levels are negatively regulated by FMRP, and some Fmr1 KO phenotypes are caused by dysregulation of PTEN protein. These observations provide evidence for the genetic interaction of PTEN and FMRP and a possible mechanistic basis for the pathogenesis of Fmr1-related fragile X neurodevelopmental disorders."

With immunoprecipitation, we showed that FMRP binds staufen mRNA to stabilize postsynaptic transcripts. Staufen is known to target actin-binding, GluRIIA anchor Coracle, and we confirmed that Staufen binds to coracle mRNA. We found that FMRP and Staufen act sequentially to co-regulate postsynaptic Coracle expression, and showed that Coracle, in turn, controls GluRIIA levels and synaptic bouton development. Consistently, we found that dfmr1, staufen and coracle mutants elevate neurotransmission strength. We also identified that FMRP, Staufen and Coracle all suppress pMad activation, providing a trans-synaptic signaling linkage between postsynaptic GluRIIA levels and presynaptic bouton development. This work supports an FMRP-Staufen-Coracle-GluRIIA-pMad pathway regulating structural and functional synapse development."

    "title": "Using weighted communication scoring procedures in naturalistic play samples: Preliminary validation in preschool-aged boys with autism or fragile X syndrome.",
    "abstract": "In the present study, we provide a preliminary evaluation of the validity and reliability of using weighting procedures to measure communication in play samples for preschool-aged boys with autism or fragile X syndrome (FXS). Because weighting procedure communication scores (WPCSs) reflect growth in both communicative frequency and complexity, establishing the psychometrics of the component scores, in addition to the overall metric, affords investigators the opportunity to describe growth within and across skills. Results, for both groups, provide support regarding the psychometric appropriateness (i.e., convergent validity, divergent validity, and internal consistency) for all WPCSs. That said, a trend was observed for reliability scores to be slightly lower or more variable in boys with autism than in boys with FXS. Finally, although significant associations were observed in the associations between WPCSs across play contexts, contexts effects were observed for all three WPCSs. Together, results from this study provide promising preliminary data indicating the utility of using WPCSs in children with neurodevelopmental disabilities. Lay Summary: Language supports long-term positive outcomes; it is important to identify accurate and flexible ways of measuring language in children over time. We considered the effectiveness of using a procedure that considers changes in the number of communication acts and the types of acts produced during a play session by preschool-aged boys with autism or fragile X syndrome. These procedures were found to be valid and reliable."

    "abstract": "Neurological disorders encompass an extremely broad range of conditions, including those that present early in development and those that progress slowly or manifest with advanced age. Although these disorders have distinct underlying etiologies, the activation of shared pathways, e.g., integrated stress response (ISR) and the development of shared phenotypes (sleep deficits) may offer clues toward understanding some of the mechanistic underpinnings of neurologic dysfunction. While it is incontrovertibly complex, the relationship between sleep and persistent stress in the brain has broad implications in understanding neurological disorders from development to degeneration. The convergent nature of the ISR could be a common thread linking genetically distinct neurological disorders through the dysregulation of a core cellular homeostasis pathway."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is caused by a trinucleotide expansion leading to silencing of the FMR1 gene and lack of expression of Fragile X Protein (FXP, formerly known as Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, FMRP). Phenotypic presentation of FXS is highly variable, and the lack of reproducible, sensitive assays to detect FXP makes evaluation of peripheral FXP as a source of clinical variability challenging. We optimized a Luminex-based assay to detect FXP in dried blot spots for increased reproducibility and sensitivity by improving reagent concentrations and buffer conditions. The optimized assay was used to quantify FXP in 187 individuals. We show that the optimized assay is highly reproducible and detects a wide range of FXP levels. Mosaic individuals had, on average, higher FXP levels than fully methylated individuals, and trace amounts of FXP were consistently detectable in a subset of individuals with full mutation FXS. IQ scores were positively correlated with FXP levels in males and females with full mutation FXS demonstrating the clinical utility of this method. Our data suggest trace amounts of FXP detectable in dried blood spots of individuals with FXS could be clinically relevant and may be used to stratify individuals with FXS for optimized treatment."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form of familial intellectual disability. FXS results from the lack of the RNA-binding protein FMRP and is associated with the deregulation of signaling pathways downstream of mGluRI receptors and upstream of mRNA translation. We previously found that diacylglycerol kinase kappa (DGKk), a main mRNA target of FMRP in cortical neurons and a master regulator of lipid signaling, is downregulated in the absence of FMRP in the brain of Fmr1-KO mouse model. Here we show that adeno-associated viral vector delivery of a modified and FMRP-independent form of DGKk corrects abnormal cerebral diacylglycerol/phosphatidic acid homeostasis and FXS-relevant behavioral phenotypes in the Fmr1-KO mouse. Our data suggest that DGKk is an important factor in FXS pathogenesis and provide preclinical proof of concept that its replacement could be a viable therapeutic strategy in FXS."

Here we present a symptom and circuit-specific approach to rescue deficits of reward learning in Fmr1 knockout mice, a model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common monogenetic cause of inherited mental disability and autism. We use high-throughput, ecologically-relevant automated tests of cognition and social behavior to assess effectiveness of the circuit-targeted injections of designer nanoparticles, loaded with TIMP metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 protein (TIMP-1). Further, to investigate the impact of our therapeutic strategy on neuronal plasticity we perform long-term potentiation recordings and high-resolution electron microscopy. We show that central amygdala-targeted delivery of TIMP-1 designer nanoparticles reverses impaired cognition in Fmr1 knockouts, while having no impact on deficits of social behavior, hence corroborating symptom-specificity of the proposed approach. Moreover, we elucidate the neural correlates of the highly specific behavioral rescue by showing that the applied therapeutic intervention restores functional synaptic plasticity and ultrastructure of neurons in the central amygdala. Thus, we present a targeted, symptom-specific and mechanism-based strategy to remedy cognitive deficits in Fragile X syndrome."

Fragile X mental retardation protein, a putative translation suppressor, is significantly reduced in FXS. The prevailing hypothesis is that rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) are increased by the absence of this regulatory protein. We have previously reported increased rCPS in the <i>Fmr1</i> knockout mouse model of FXS. To address the hypothesis in human subjects, we measured rCPS in young men with FXS with L-[1-<sup>11</sup>C]leucine PET. In previous studies we had used sedation during imaging, and we did not find increases in rCPS as had been seen in the mouse model. Since mouse measurements were conducted in awake animals, we considered the possibility that sedation may have confounded our results. In the present study we used a modified and validated PET protocol that made it easier for participants with FXS to undergo the study awake. We compared rCPS in 10 fragile X participants and 16 healthy controls all studied while awake. Contrary to the prevailing hypothesis and findings in <i>Fmr1</i> knockout mice, results indicate that rCPS in awake participants with FXS are decreased in whole brain and most brain regions by 13-21% compared to healthy controls."

Here, we investigated the role of PDE2A in ASD pathogenesis using two rat models that reflect one of either the genetic or environmental factors involved in the human disease: the genetic Fmr1-<sup>Δ</sup>exon 8 rat model and the environmental rat model based on prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA, 500 mg/kg). Prior to behavioral testing, the offspring was treated with the PDE2A inhibitor BAY607550 (0.05 mg/kg at infancy, 0.1 mg/kg at adolescence and adulthood). Socio-communicative symptoms were assessed in both models through the ultrasonic vocalization test at infancy and three-chamber test at adolescence and adulthood, while cognitive impairments were assessed by the novel object recognition test in Fmr1-<sup>Δ</sup>exon 8 rats (adolescence and adulthood) and by the inhibitory avoidance test in VPA-exposed rats (adulthood). PDE2A enzymatic activity in VPA-exposed infant rats was also assessed. In line with the increased PDE2A enzymatic activity previously observed in the brain of Fmr1-KO animals, we found an altered upstream regulation of PDE2A activity in the brain of VPA-exposed rats at an early developmental age (p < 0.05). Pharmacological inhibition of PDE2A normalized the communicative (p < 0.01, p < 0.05), social (p < 0.001, p < 0.05), and cognitive impairment (p < 0.001) displayed by both Fmr1-<sup>Δ</sup>exon 8 and VPA-exposed rats. Altogether, these data highlight a key role of PDE2A in brain development and point to PDE2A inhibition as a promising pharmacological approach for the deficits common to both FXS and ASD."

    "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated that the amygdala is enlarged in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the precise onset of this enlargement during infancy, how it relates to later diagnostic behaviors, whether the timing of enlargement in infancy is specific to the amygdala, and whether it is specific to ASD (or present in other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as fragile X syndrome) are all unknown. Longitudinal MRIs were acquired at 6-24 months of age in 29 infants with fragile X syndrome, 58 infants at high likelihood for ASD who were later diagnosed with ASD, 212 high-likelihood infants not diagnosed with ASD, and 109 control infants (1,099 total scans). Infants who developed ASD had typically sized amygdala volumes at 6 months, but exhibited significantly faster amygdala growth between 6 and 24 months, such that by 12 months the ASD group had significantly larger amygdala volume (Cohen's d=0.56) compared with all other groups. Amygdala growth rate between 6 and 12 months was significantly associated with greater social deficits at 24 months when the infants were diagnosed with ASD. Infants with fragile X syndrome had a persistent and significantly enlarged caudate volume at all ages between 6 and 24 months (d=2.12), compared with all other groups, which was significantly associated with greater repetitive behaviors. This is the first MRI study comparing fragile X syndrome and ASD in infancy, demonstrating strikingly different patterns of brain and behavior development. Fragile X syndrome-related changes were present from 6 months of age, whereas ASD-related changes unfolded over the first 2 years of life, starting with no detectable group differences at 6 months. Increased amygdala growth rate between 6 and 12 months occurs prior to social deficits and well before diagnosis. This gradual onset of brain and behavior changes in ASD, but not fragile X syndrome, suggests an age- and disorder-specific pattern of cascading brain changes preceding autism diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form of inherited X-linked pathology, associated with an intellectual and developmental disability, and currently considered the first monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Low levels of total cholesterol reported in the serum of FXS patients, and evidence that FMRP targets a subset of mRNAs encoding proteins of lipid synthesis and transport suggests that the cholesterol metabolism impairments could be involved in FXS. Thus, the aim of the presented work was to investigate the modulations of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and its end-products in a recently developed <i>Fmr1-Δexon 8</i> rat model of FXS. Here, we show that this experimental model mimics what is found in FXS patients, exhibiting a lower serum cholesterol content, accompanied by a reduction in food intake and body weight compared to WT animals. Moreover, alterations of proteins committed to cholesterol synthesis and uptake have been observed in the amygdala, prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. Interestingly, the end-products show a brain region-dependent modulation in <i>Fmr1-Δexon 8</i> rats. Overall, our results demonstrate that the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is altered in some brain regions of this preclinical model of FXS. This finding has relevance for future studies to delve deeper into the involvement of this metabolic process in FXS, and thus its possible role as a therapeutic target."

Approximately 20% of women carrying an <i>FMR1</i> premutation (PM) allele (55-200 CGG repeat) develop FXPOI. Repeat Associated Non-AUG (RAN)-translation dependent on the variable CGG-repeat length is thought to cause FXPOI, due to the production of a polyglycine-containing <i>FMR1</i> protein, FMRpolyG. Peripheral blood monocyte cells (PBMCs) and granulosa cells (GCs) were collected to detect FMRpolyG and its cell type-specific expression in <i>FMR1</i> PM carriers by immunofluorescence staining (IF), Western blotting (WB), and flow cytometric analysis (FACS). For the first time, FMRpolyG aggregates were detected as ubiquitin-positive inclusions in PBMCs from PM carriers, whereas only a weak signal without inclusions was detected in the controls. The expression pattern of FMRpolyG in GCs was comparable to that in the lymphocytes. We detected FMRpolyG as a 15- to 25-kDa protein in the PBMCs from two <i>FMR1</i> PM carriers, with 124 and 81 CGG repeats. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that FMRpolyG was significantly higher in the T cells from PM carriers than in those from non-PM carriers. The detection of FMRpolyG aggregates in the peripheral blood and granulosa cells of PM carriers suggests that it may have a toxic potential and an immunological role in ovarian damage in the development of FXPOI."

There are further genes which have \"retardation\" or abbreviations for \"retardation\" in their names or full designations, including FMR1, FMR2, FXR1, FXR2, NUFIP1, AFF1, CYFIP1, etc. \"Retardation\" was commonly used as a term in years past, but now any reference, even in an abbreviation, is offensive. This article discusses the stigmatisation associated with \"retardation\", which leads to discrimination; the inaccuracy of using \"retardation\" in these designations; and the breadth of fragile X syndrome being beyond that of neurodiversity. A more inclusive terminology is called for, one which ceases to use any reference to \"retardation\". Precedents for offensive gene names being altered is set out. The proposal is to approach the HGNC (HUGO [Human Genome Organisation] Gene Nomenclature Committee) for new terminology to be enacted. Ideas from other researchers in the field are welcomed."

The goal of the present study was to explore syndrome-specific pragmatic profiles of adults with FXS and WS based on the assessment of the observance of Gricean maxims of conversation. The participants were 12 Spanish-speaking adults (6 FXS/6 WS), without a diagnosis of ASD, whose extensive naturalistic conversations (71,859 words) were transcribed and coded with the CHILDES/TALKBANK tools and the PREP-CORP pragmatic protocol. Violations of the maxims of conversation were analyzed, and indexes of cooperation and conversational response were obtained. Both groups showed reduced verbal production and repetitive dysfluencies; prominent features in the FXS profile were higher proportion of non-contingent language, perseverations of topic and form, and impulsive conversational responses; in the WS profile, salient characteristics were higher proportion of tangential utterances, reformulations, and conversational responses reflecting overly literal interpretation. Pragmatic profiles of violation of conversational maxims reflect specific communication skills impaired in adults with FXS and WS and raise the need for assessment and intervention methods that specifically address their social communication abilities."

    "title": "Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein and Cerebral Expression of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Subtype 5 in Men with Fragile X Syndrome: A Pilot Study.",
    "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence suggest that a deficiency of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) mediates dysfunction of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) in the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most commonly known single-gene cause of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Nevertheless, animal and human studies regarding the link between FMRP and mGluR5 expression provide inconsistent or conflicting findings about the nature of those relationships. Since multiple clinical trials of glutamatergic agents in humans with FXS did not demonstrate the amelioration of the behavioral phenotype observed in animal models of FXS, we sought measure if mGluR5 expression is increased in men with FXS to form the basis for improved clinical trials. Unexpectedly marked reductions in mGluR5 expression were observed in cortical and subcortical regions in men with FXS. Reduced mGluR5 expression throughout the living brains of men with FXS provides a clue to examine FMRP and mGluR5 expression in FXS. In order to develop the findings of our previous study and to strengthen the objective tools for future clinical trials of glutamatergic agents in FXS, we sought to assess the possible value of measuring both FMRP levels and mGluR5 expression in men with FXS. We aimed to show the value of measurement of FMRP levels and mGluR5 expression for the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with FXS and related conditions. We administered 3-[18F]fluoro-5-(2-pyridinylethynyl)benzonitrile ([18F]FPEB), a specific mGluR5 radioligand for quantitative measurements of the density and the distribution of mGluR5s, to six men with the full mutation (FM) of FXS and to one man with allele size mosaicism for FXS (FXS-M). Utilizing the seven cortical and subcortical regions affected in neurodegenerative disorders as indicator variables, adjusted linear regression of mGluR5 expression and FMRP showed that mGluR5 expression was significantly reduced in the occipital cortex and the thalamus relative to baseline (anterior cingulate cortex) if FMRP levels are held constant (F(7,47) = 6.84, p < 0.001).These findings indicate the usefulness of cerebral mGluR5 expression measured by PET with [18F]FPEB and FMRP values in men with FXS and related conditions for assessments in community facilities within a hundred-mile radius of a production center with a cyclotron. These initial results of this pilot study advance our previous study regarding the measurement of mGluR5 expression by combining both FMRP levels and mGluR5 expression as tools for meaningful clinical trials of glutamatergic agents for men with FXS. We confirm the feasibility of this protocol as a valuable tool to measure FMRP levels and mGluR5 expression in clinical trials of individuals with FXS and related conditions and to provide the foundations to apply precision medicine to tailor treatment plans to the specific needs of individuals with FXS and related conditions."

This protein interacts with specific miRNAs and can cause a range of neurological disorders. Therefore, miRNAs could act as a novel class of biomarkers for common CNS diseases. This study aimed to test this theory by exploring the expression profiles of various miRNAs in Iranian using deep sequencing-based technologies and validating the miRNAs affecting the expression of the FMR1 gene. Blood samples were taken from 15 patients with FXS (9 males, 6 females) and 12 controls. 25 miRNAs were differentially expressed in individuals with FXS compared to controls. Levels of 9 miRNAs were found to be significantly changed (3 upregulated and 6 downregulated). In Patients, the levels of hsa-miR-532-5p, hsa-miR-652-3p and hsa-miR-4797-3p were significantly upregulated while levels of hsa-miR-191-5p, hsa-miR-181-5p, hsa-miR-26a-5p, hsa-miR-30e-5p, hsa-miR-186-5p, and hsa-miR-4797-5p exhibited significant downregulation; and these dysregulations were confirmed by RT-qPCR.

    "abstract": "Carriers of the FMR1 premutation are at increased risk of developing a late-onset progressive neurodegenerative disease, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), characterized by intention tremor, gait ataxia, and cognitive decline. Cross-sectional studies to date have provided evidence that neuropsychological changes, such as executive function alterations, or subtle motor changes, may precede the onset of formal FXTAS, perhaps characterizing a prodromal state. However, the lack of longitudinal data has prevented the field from forming a clear picture of progression over time within individuals, and we lack consensus regarding early markers of risk and measures that may be used to track response to intervention. This was a longitudinal study of 64 male FMR1 premutation carriers (Pm) without FXTAS at study entry and 30 normal controls (Nc), aged 40 to 80 years (Pm M = 60.0 years; Nc M = 57.4 years). Fifty of the Pm and 22 of the Nc were re-assessed after an average of 2.33 years, and 37 Pm and 20 Nc were re-assessed a third time after an average of another 2.15 years. Eighteen of 64 carriers (28%) converted to FXTAS during the study to date. Neuropsychological assessments at each time point, including components of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), tapped domains of episodic and working memory, inhibitory control, visual attention, planning, executive control of movement, and manual speed and dexterity. Age-based mixed models were used to examine group differences in change over time on the outcomes in the full sample, and differences were further evaluated in 15 trios (n = 45; 15 Pm \"converters,\" 15 Pm \"nonconverters,\" 15 Nc) that were one-one matched on age, education, and socioeconomic status. Compared to Nc, Pm showed significantly greater rates of change over time in visual working memory, motor dexterity, inhibitory control, and manual movement speed. After multiple comparison correction, significant effects remained for motor dexterity. Worsening inhibitory control and slower manual movements were related to progression in FXTAS stage, but these effects became statistically non-significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. Higher FMR1 mRNA correlated with worsening manual reaction time but did not survive multiple comparisons and no other molecular measures correlated with neuropsychological changes. Finally, trio comparisons revealed greater rate of decline in planning and manual movement speed in Pm converters compared to Pm nonconverters. Accelerated decline in executive function and subtle motor changes, likely mediated by frontocerebellar circuits, may precede, and then track with the emergence of formal FXTAS symptoms. Further research to develop and harmonize clinical assessment of FMR1 carriers across centers is needed to prepare for future prophylactic and treatment trials for this disorder."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of seizures in individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) is ~25%; however, there are no reports of spontaneous seizures in the Fmr1 knockout mouse model of FXS. Herein, we report that 48% of adult (median age P96), Fmr1 knockout mice from our colony were found expired in their home cages. We observed and recorded adult Fmr1 knockout mice having spontaneous convulsions in their home cages. In addition, we captured by electroencephalography an adult Fmr1 knockout mouse having a spontaneous seizure-during preictal, ictal, and postictal phases-which confirmed the presence of a generalized seizure. We did not observe this phenotype in control conspecifics or in juvenile (age <P35) Fmr1 knockout mice. We hypothesized that chronic, random, noise perturbations during development caused the phenotype. We recorded decibels (dB) in our vivarium. The average was 61 dB, but operating the automatic door to the vivarium caused spikes to 95 dB. We modified the door to eliminate noise spikes, which reduced unexpected deaths to 33% in Fmr1 knockout mice raised from birth in this environment (P = 0.07). As the modifications did not eliminate unexpected deaths, we further hypothesized that building vibrations may also be a contributing factor. After installing anti-vibration pads underneath housing carts, unexpected deaths of Fmr1 knockout mice born and raised in this environment decreased to 29% (P < 0.01 compared to the original environment). We also observed significant sex effects, for example, after interventions to reduce sound and vibration, significantly fewer male, but not female, Fmr1 knockout mice died unexpectedly (P < 0.001). The spontaneous seizure phenotype in our Fmr1 knockout mice could serve as a model of seizures observed in individuals with FXS, potentially offering a new translationally-valid phenotype for FXS research. Finally, these observations, although anomalous, serve as a reminder to consider gene-environment interactions when interpreting data derived from Fmr1 knockout mice."

    "abstract": "Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics was used to examine protein expression in skeletal muscle from mice with moderate and severe cancer cachexia to study mechanisms underlying varied cachexia severity. Weight loss of 10% (moderate) and 20% (severe) was induced by injection of colon-26 cancer cells in 10-week old Balb/c mice. In moderate cachexia, enriched pathways reflected fibrin formation, integrin/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and innate immune system, suggesting an acute phase response and fibrosis. These pathways remained enriched in severe cachexia; however, energy-yielding pathways housed in mitochondria were prominent additions to the severe state. These enrichments suggest distinct muscle proteome expression patterns that differentiate cachexia severity. When analyzed with two other mouse models, eight differentially expressed targets were shared including serine protease inhibitor A3N (Serpina3n), synaptophysin-like protein 2 (Sypl2), Isocitrate dehydrogenase [NAD] subunit alpha, mitochondrial (Idh3a), peroxisomal acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 (Acox1), collagen alpha-1(VI) chain (Col6a1), myozenin 3 (Myoz3), UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (Ugp2), and solute carrier family 41 member 3 (Slc41a3). Acox1 and Idh3a control lipid oxidation and NADH generation in the TCA cycle, respectively, and Col6a1 comprises part of type VI collagen with reported profibrotic functions, suggesting influential roles in cachexia. A potential target was identified in fragile X mental retardation syndrome-related protein 1 (FXR1), an RNA-binding protein not previously implicated in cancer cachexia. FXR1 decreased in cachexia and related linearly with weight change and myofiber size. These findings suggest distinct mechanisms associated with cachexia severity and potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets."

    "title": "Verbal inhibition declines among older women with high FMR1 premutation expansions: A prospective study.",
    "abstract": "The FMR1 premutation has been associated with difficulties in executive functioning, including verbal inhibition. However, little is known about the longitudinal profiles of verbal inhibition among FMR1 premutation carriers, particularly in women, and how individual factors such as aging and CGG repeat length may contribute to changes in verbal inhibition over time. The present study examined verbal inhibition performance (i.e., inhibition errors) on the Hayling Sentence Completion Task in a cohort of 92 women with the FMR1 premutation across two timepoints approximately three years apart. We examined the effects of age, CGG repeat length, and their interactions on verbal inhibition over time. We also evaluated whether response latency affected verbal inhibition errors. We found no significant change in verbal inhibition in the full cohort during the three-year study period. However, a subset of FMR1 premutation carriers, namely older participants with higher CGG repeats, evidenced greater declines in verbal inhibition over time. Longer response latencies did not compensate for verbal inhibition errors. The findings suggest that a subset of women with the FMR1 premutation may be at earlier, increased risk for changes in executive functioning, which if confirmed, should be considered as part of the clinical profile associated with the premutation."

    "abstract": "Cap-adjacent nucleotides of animal, protist and viral mRNAs can be O-methylated at the 2' position of the ribose (cOMe). The functions of cOMe in animals, however, remain largely unknown. Here we show that the two cap methyltransferases (CMTr1 and CMTr2) of Drosophila can methylate the ribose of the first nucleotide in mRNA. Double-mutant flies lack cOMe but are viable. Consistent with prominent neuronal expression, they have a reward learning defect that can be rescued by conditional expression in mushroom body neurons before training. Among CMTr targets are cell adhesion and signaling molecules. Many are relevant for learning, and are also targets of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Like FMRP, cOMe is required for localization of untranslated mRNAs to synapses and enhances binding of the cap binding complex in the nucleus. Hence, our study reveals a mechanism to co-transcriptionally prime mRNAs by cOMe for localized protein synthesis at synapses."

    "title": "Early environmental enrichment for autism spectrum disorder Fmr1 mice models has positive behavioral and molecular effects.",
    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity characterized by hallmark impairments in social functioning and repetitive behaviors. Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading single-gene form of autism spectrum disorder, is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability. Environmental enrichment has been shown to improve several aspects of brain development and affect histopathological, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes. However, the optimal time window to initiate it and improve cognitive and emotional development is largely unexplored. In the current study, we determined the longitudinal trends of BDNF-TrkB expression and dendritic development in FXS mice. Additionally, FXS mice were housed in an enriched environment when they showed significantly different BDNF-TrkB pathways and the phenotype of dendritic spines on postnatal day 10 (P10) until P60. The environmental enrichment delayed and attenuated some neurological alterations in FXS mice and prevented the development of cognitive and anxiety-related abnormalities and repetitive stereotyped behaviors. The correlation between neurotrophin-related pathways and multiple autistic-like behaviors was confirmed. Transcriptional profiling indicates that environmental enrichment increases the differences in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal gene expression associated with the neural system and behavioral development. Our results provide novel evidence on the usefulness of early intervention for neurodevelopmental disorders as a strategy to facilitate positive effects on neural development and behaviors by acting on the BDNF/TrkB-PLCγ1-CaMKII pathway."

In present study fragile X PM carrier screening was performed in total 808 women who were consulting primary health care centers for preconception care in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region of Pakistan between April, 2018 and December, 2020. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for detection of PM carrier women and the CGG repeats number was confirmed by Southern blotting and capillary electrophoresis. The prevalence rate for PM carriers among preconception women was found to be 0.7% that was contributed by 0.5% women in risk group (RG1) with family history of ID and 0.2% in risk group 2 (RG2) with family history of ASD. PM carrier women had at least one affected child or sibling. In addition, the preconception women with FMR1 PM alleles were found to be at increased risk for primary ovary insufficiency (RG1: P = 0.0265, RG2: P = 0.0389), postpartum depression (RG1: P = 0.0240, RG2: P = 0.0501) and neuropsychiatric disorders (RG1: P = 0.0389, RG2: P = 0.0432). Current study provides first evidence of fragile X PM carrier screening in Pakistani preconception women in primary care consultation. Findings of current study may help to improve preconception care and to reduce burden of fragile X associated disorders in our population."

    "abstract": "Obesity and related metabolic disorders are epidemic diseases. Promoting thermogenesis and a functional increase in the browning of white adipocytes may counteract obesity. On the other hand, the molecular mechanism that regulates brown and beige fat-mediated thermogenesis is unclear. This article reports a molecular network led by cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2) that negatively regulates adipocyte browning in white adipocytes. Although the function of CYFIP2 in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and autism have been reported, its physiological roles in adipocytes remain elusive. Therefore, this study examined the physiological consequences of its deprivation in cultured 3T3-L1 white adipocytes using loss-of-function studies. Combined real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis showed that the loss of CYFIP2 induces fat browning, as evidenced by the gene and protein expression levels of the brown fat-associated markers. A deficiency of CYFIP2 promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and significantly enhanced the expression of the core set beige fat-specific genes (Cd137, Cidea, Cited1, Tbx1, and Tmem26) and proteins (PGC-1α, PRDM16, and UCP1). In addition, a CYFIP2 deficiency promoted lipid catabolism and suppressed adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and autophagy. A mechanistic study showed that the loss of CYFIP2 induces browning in white adipocytes, independently via the activation of mTORC1 and suppression of the GABA-BR signaling pathway. The present data revealed a previously unidentified mechanism of CYFIP2 in the browning of white adipocytes and emphasized the potential of CYFIP2 as a pharmacotherapeutic target for treating obesity and other metabolic disorders."

    "abstract": "Short tandem repeats are repetitive nucleotide sequences robustly distributed in the human genome. Their expansion underlies the pathogenesis of multiple neurological disorders, including Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, and myotonic dystrophies, known as repeat expansion disorders (REDs). Several molecular pathomechanisms associated with toxic RNA containing expanded repeats (RNA<sup>exp</sup> ) are shared among REDs and contribute to disease progression, however, detailed mechanistic insight into those processes is limited. To deepen our understanding of the interplay between toxic RNA<sup>exp</sup> molecules and multiple protein partners, in this review, we discuss the roles of selected RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that interact with RNA<sup>exp</sup> and thus act as \"partners in crime\" in the progression of REDs. We gather current findings concerning RBPs involved at different stages of the RNA<sup>exp</sup> life cycle, such as transcription, splicing, transport, and AUG-independent translation of expanded repeats. We argue that the activity of selected RBPs can be unique or common among REDs depending on the expanded repeat type. We also present proteins that are functionally depleted due to sequestration on RNA<sup>exp</sup> within nuclear foci and those which participate in RNA<sup>exp</sup> -dependent innate immunity activation. Moreover, we discuss the utility of selected RBPs as targets in the development of therapeutic strategies.

This disease results from the loss of <i>fragile X mental retardation protein</i> expression due to the expansion of CGG repeats located on the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (<i>FMR1</i>) gene. In the present study, the peripheral blood-mesenchymal stem cells (PB-MSCs) of two female full mutation carriers were differentiated into neuronal cells by the suppression of bone morphogenesis pathway signaling. Then, the expression of genes adjacent to CGG repeats expansion, including SLIT and NTRK-like protein 2 (<i>SLITRK2</i>), SLIT and NTRK-like protein 4 (<i>SLITRK4</i>), methyl CpG binding protein 2 (<i>MECP2</i>), and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-3 (<i>GABRA3</i>), were evaluated in these cells using SYBR Green real-time polymerase chain reaction. The obtained results indicated that the expression of <i>SLITRK2</i> and <i>SLITRK4</i> were upregulated and downregulated in the neuron-like cells differentiated from the PB-MSCs of females with <i>FMR1</i> full mutation, compared to that of the normal females, respectively. Furthermore, the expression of <i>MECP2</i> and <i>GABRA3</i> genes were observed to be related to the phenotypic differences observed in the female <i>FMR1</i> full mutation carriers. The observed association of expression of genes located upstream of the <i>FMR1</i> gene with phenotypic differences in the female carriers could increase the understanding of novel therapeutic targets for patients with mild symptoms of FXS and the patients affected by other <i>FMR1</i>-related disorders."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability, is caused by a developmentally regulated silencing of the <i>FMR1</i> gene, but its effect on human neuronal network development and function is not fully understood. Here, we isolated isogenic human embryonic stem cell (hESC) subclones-one with a full FX mutation and one that is free of the mutation (control) but shares the same genetic background-differentiated them into induced neurons (iNs) by forced expression of <i>NEUROG-1</i>, and compared the functional properties of the derived neuronal networks. High-throughput image analysis demonstrates that FX-iNs have significantly smaller cell bodies and reduced arborizations than the control. Both FX- and control-neurons can discharge repetitive action potentials, and FX neuronal networks are also able to generate spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents with slight differences from the control, demonstrating that iNs generate more mature neuronal networks than the previously used protocols. MEA analysis demonstrated that FX networks are hyperexcitable with significantly higher spontaneous burst-firing activity compared to the control. Most importantly, cross-correlation analysis enabled quantification of network connectivity to demonstrate that the FX neuronal networks are significantly less synchronous than the control, which can explain the origin of the development of intellectual dysfunction associated with FXS."

Children with FXS are commonly co-diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, attention and learning problems, anxiety, aggressive behavior and sleep disorder, and early interventions have improved many behavior symptoms associated with FXS. In this review, we performed a literature search of original and review articles data of clinical trials and book chapters using MEDLINE (1990-2021) and ClinicalTrials.gov. While we have reviewed the biological importance of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the FXS phenotype, and current diagnosis techniques, the emphasis of this review is on clinical interventions. Early non-pharmacological interventions in combination with pharmacotherapy and targeted treatments aiming to reverse dysregulated brain pathways are the mainstream of treatment in FXS. Overall, early diagnosis and interventions are fundamental to achieve optimal clinical outcomes in FXS."

    "abstract": "Fragile X premutation carriers (55-200 CGG triplets) may develop a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), after the age of 50. The neuroradiologic markers of FXTAS are hyperintense T2-signals in the middle cerebellar peduncle-the MCP sign. We recently noticed abnormal T2-signals in the globus pallidus in male premutation carriers and controls but the prevalence and clinical significance were unknown. We estimated the prevalence of the MCP sign and pallidal T2-abnormalities in 230 male premutation carriers and 144 controls (aged 8-86), and examined the associations with FXTAS symptoms, CGG repeat length, and iron content in the cerebellar dentate nucleus and globus pallidus. Among participants aged ≥45 years (175 premutation carriers and 82 controls), MCP sign was observed only in premutation carriers (52 vs. 0%) whereas the prevalence of pallidal T2-abnormalities approached significance in premutation carriers compared with controls after age-adjustment (25.1 vs. 13.4%, <i>p</i> = 0.069). MCP sign was associated with impaired motor and executive functioning, and the additional presence of pallidal T2-abnormalities was associated with greater impaired executive functioning. Among premutation carriers, significant iron accumulation was observed in the dentate nucleus, and neither pallidal or MCP T2-abnormalities affected measures of the dentate nucleus. While the MCP sign was associated with CGG repeat length >75 and dentate nucleus volume correlated negatively with CGG repeat length, pallidal T2-abnormalities did not correlate with CGG repeat length. However, pallidal signal changes were associated with age-related accelerated iron depletion and variability and having both MCP and pallidal signs further increased iron variability in the globus pallidus. Only the MCP sign, not pallidal abnormalities, revealed independent associations with motor and cognitive impairment; however, the occurrence of <i>combined</i> MCP and pallidal T2-abnormalities may present a risk for greater cognitive impairment and increased iron variability in the globus pallidus."

FXTAS is one of the more common single-gene forms of late-onset ataxia and tremor that may have a more complex development in women, with atypical presentations. After a brief presentation of the atypical case of an Italian woman with FXTAS, who had several paroxysmal episodes suggestive of acute cerebellar and/or brainstem dysfunction, this article will revise the phenotype of FXTAS in women. Especially in females, FXTAS has a broad spectrum of symptoms, ranging from relatively severe diseases in mid-adulthood to mild cases beginning in later life. Female FXTAS and male FXTAS have a different symptomatic spectrum, and studies on the fragile X premutation should be conducted separately on women or men. Hopefully, a better understanding of the molecular processes involved in the polymorphic features of FXTAS will lead to more specific and effective therapies for this complex disorder."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) causes intellectual disability and is the known leading cause of autism. Common problems in FXS include behavior and social problems. Along with syndromic characteristics and autism comorbidity, environmental factors might influence these difficulties. This systematic review focuses on the last 20 years of studies concerning behavior and social problems in FXS, considering environmental and personal variables that might influence both problems. Three databases were reviewed, leading to fifty-one studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) problems remain the greatest behavior problems, with behavioral problems and social competence being stable during the 20 years. Some developmental trajectories might have changed due to higher methodological control, such as aggressive behavior and attention problems. The socialization trajectory from childhood to adolescence remains unclear. Comorbidity with autism in individuals with FXS increased behavior problems and worsened social competence profiles. At the same time, comparisons between individuals with comorbid FXS and autism and individuals with autism might help define the comorbid phenotype. Environmental factors and parental characteristics influenced behavior problems and social competence. Higher methodological control is needed in studies including autism symptomatology and parental characteristics. More studies comparing autism in FXS with idiopathic autism are needed to discern differences between conditions."

The mutation-driven expanded repeat tract occurs in specific genes and is composed of tri- to dodeca-nucleotide-long units. Mutant mRNA is a pathogenic factor or important contributor to the disease and has great potential as a therapeutic target. Although repeat expansion diseases are quite well known, there are limited studies concerning polyadenylation events for implicated transcripts that could have profound effects on transcript stability, localization, and translation efficiency. In this review, we briefly present polyadenylation and alternative polyadenylation (APA) mechanisms and discuss their role in the pathogenesis of selected diseases. We also discuss several methods for poly(A) tail measurement (both transcript-specific and transcriptome-wide analyses) and APA site identification-the further development and use of which may contribute to a better understanding of the correlation between APA events and repeat expansion diseases. Finally, we point out some future perspectives on the research into repeat expansion diseases, as well as APA studies."

Here, we demonstrate that disease-causing missense mutations in the conserved K homology (KH) RNA binding domains (RBDs) of FMRP cause defects in its ability to form RNA transport granules in neurons. Using molecular, genetic, and imaging approaches in the Drosophila FXS model system, we show that the KH1 and KH2 domains of FMRP regulate distinct aspects of neuronal FMRP granule formation, dynamics, and transport. Furthermore, mutations in the KH domains disrupt translational repression in cells and the localization of known FMRP target mRNAs in neurons. These results suggest that the KH domains play an essential role in neuronal FMRP granule formation and function which may be linked to the molecular pathogenesis of FXS."

This study examined the rates of cluttering in male young adults with FXS using expert clinical opinion, the alignment between expert clinical opinion and objectively quantified features of cluttering from language transcripts, and the association between cluttering and aspects of the FXS phenotype. Thirty-six men with FXS (aged 18-26 years; <i>M</i> = 22, <i>SD</i> = 2.35) contributed language samples and completed measures of nonverbal cognition, autism symptoms, anxiety, and symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The presence of cluttering was determined by the consensus of two clinical experts in fluency disorders based on characteristics exhibited in the language sample. Cluttering features (speech rate, disfluencies, etc.) were also objectively quantified from the language transcripts. Clinical experts determined that 50% of participants met the criteria for a cluttering diagnosis. Phrase repetitions were the most salient feature that distinguished individuals who cluttered. Although the presence of cluttering was not associated with autism symptoms or mean length of utterance, cluttering was more likely to occur when nonverbal cognitive ability was higher, ADHD symptoms were elevated, and anxiety symptoms were low. Half of the male young adults with FXS exhibited cluttering, which supports FXS as a genetic diagnosis that is highly enriched for risk of cluttering. Cluttering was associated with increased ADHD symptoms and cognitive ability and reduced anxiety symptoms. This study contributes a new description of the clinical presentation of cluttering in men with FXS and may lead to improved understanding of the potential underlying mechanisms of cluttering and eventual refinements to treatment and diagnosis."

Affected individuals have a high prevalence of hypocholesterolemia, however, the underlying mechanisms and the clinical significance remains unknown. We hypothesized that decrease in the plasma cholesterol levels is associated with an alteration of cholesterol content within the lipid rafts (LRs) which ultimately affects the clinical profile of FXS individuals. The platelets LRs were isolated by ultracentrifugation on sucrose gradient from 27 FXS and 25 healthy controls, followed by measurements of proteins, cholesterol, and gangliosides content. Autistic and adaptive behaviour of affected individuals were respectively assessed by the Social Communication Questionnaire and Adaptive Behavior Assessment System. Our results suggest a decrease in the cholesterol content of LRs in FXS individuals as compared to controls. As opposed to controls, LR cholesterol was significantly associated with plasma total cholesterol (r = 0.47; p = 0.042) in the FXS group. Furthermore, the correlation between LRs cholesterol and the clinical profile showed a significant association with autistic traits (r = - 0.67; p < 0.001) and adaptative behavior (r = 0.70; p < 0.001). These results support the clinical significance of LR cholesterol alterations in FXS. Further studies are warranted to investigate the implication of LRs in FXS pathophysiology and ASD."

This pipeline has been validated in-house by the developers but external testing using real-world datasets remains to be done. Resting and auditory event-related EEG data from 29 children ages 3-6 years with Fragile X Syndrome as well as simulated EEG data was used to evaluate HAPPE's noise reduction techniques, data standardization features, and data integration compared to traditional manualized processing. For the real EEG data, HAPPE pipeline showed greater trials retained, greater variance retained through independent component analysis (ICA) component removal, and smaller kurtosis than the manual pipeline; the manual pipeline had a significantly larger signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For simulated EEG data, correlation between the pure signal and processed data was significantly higher for manually-processed data compared to HAPPE-processed data. Hierarchical linear modeling showed greater signal recovery in the manual pipeline with the exception of the gamma band signal which showed mixed results. SNR and simulated signal retention was significantly greater in the manually-processed data than the HAPPE-processed data. Signal reduction may negatively affect outcome measures. The HAPPE pipeline benefits from less active processing time and artifact reduction without removing segments. However, HAPPE may bias toward elimination of noise at the cost of signal. Recommended implementation of the HAPPE pipeline for neurodevelopmental populations depends on the goals and priorities of the research."

Mixed-effect linear regression models were fit separately for males and females, and z scores for height and weight were regressed against age and adjusted for intellectual disability (ID) and psychotropic medication use. Mean height z score for both sexes decreased with age and was lower than normative data. Mean BMI z score was greater than normative data in both sexes, and this disparity increased with age. BMI z score in females was greater for those with moderate or severe ID than those with no or mild ID. Individuals taking antipsychotics had higher BMI z scores than those taking no or other medications; those taking anticonvulsants or stimulants had lower BMI z scores. Individuals with FXS are at elevated risk for overweight and obesity. The risk is higher in individuals taking antipsychotics and among females with severe ID.

Through the interaction with four G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) subtypes, adenosine subtly regulates neurotransmission, interfering with the dopaminergic, glutamatergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic, and endocannabinoid systems. The inhibitory and facilitating actions of adenosine on neurotransmission are mainly mediated by A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptors (ARs), respectively. Given their role in the CNS, ARs are promising therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric disorders where altered neurotransmission represents the most likely etiological hypothesis. Activating or blocking ARs with specific pharmacological agents could therefore restore the balance of altered neurotransmitter systems, providing the rationale for the potential treatment of these highly debilitating conditions. In this review, we summarize and discuss the most relevant studies concerning AR modulation in psychotic and mood disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, depression, and anxiety, as well as neurodevelopment disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and neuropsychiatric aspects of neurodegenerative disorders."

The control of [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>i</sub> levels is mediated by the chloride cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2, the former usually importing chloride and the latter exporting it. The GABA polarity shift has been extensively validated in several experimental conditions using often the NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist bumetanide. In spite of an intrinsic heterogeneity, this shift is abolished in many experimental conditions associated with developmental disorders including autism, Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, or maternal immune activation. Using bumetanide, an EMA- and FDA-approved agent, many clinical trials have shown promising results with the expected side effects. Kaila et al. have repeatedly challenged these experimental and clinical observations. Here, we reply to the recent reviews by Kaila et al. stressing that the GABA polarity shift is solidly accepted by the scientific community as a major discovery to understand brain development and that bumetanide has shown promising effects in clinical trials."

The present study explored the association between mosaicism type and cognitive and behavioral functioning in a large sample of males 3 years and older (n = 487) with FXS, participating in the Fragile X Online Registry with Accessible Research Database. Participants with methylation mosaicism were less severely cognitively affected as indicated by a less severe intellectual disability rating, higher intelligence quotient and adaptive behavior score, and lower social impairment score. In contrast, the presence of size mosaicism was not significantly associated with better cognitive and behavioral outcomes than full mutation. Our findings suggest that methylation mosaicism is associated with better cognitive functioning and adaptive behavior and less social impairment. Further research could assess to what extent these cognitive and behavioral differences depend on molecular diagnostic methods and the impact of mosaicism on prognosis of individuals with FXS."

In vivo analysis of polyphosphoinositides hydrolysis was performed to study the mGlu5-mediated intracellular signaling in the striatum of adult BTBR mice under basal conditions and after MTEP exposure. Expression of mGlu5 receptors and mGlu5 receptor-mediated polyphosphoinositides hydrolysis were considerably high in the striatum of BTBR mice, sensitive to MTEP treatment. Changes in the expression of genes encoding for proteins involved in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity, including Fmr1, Dlg4, Shank3, Brd4, bdnf-exon IX, Mef2c, and Arc, GriA2, Glun1, Nr2A, and Grm1, Grm2, GriA1, and Gad1 were also found. Behaviorally, BTBR mice showed high repetitive stereotypical behaviors, including self-grooming and deficits in social interactions. Acute or repeated injections with MTEP reversed the stereotyped behavior and the social interaction deficit. Similar effects were observed with the NMDA receptor blockers MK-801 or ketamine. These findings support a pivotal role of mGlu5 receptor abnormal expression and function in idiopathic ASD adult forms and unveil novel potential targets for therapy."

    "abstract": "The KCNT1 gene encodes the sodium-activated potassium channel that is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system of mammalians and plays an important role in reducing neuronal excitability. Structurally, the KCNT1 channel is absent of voltage sensor but possesses a long C-terminus including RCK1 and RCK2domain, to which the intracellular sodium and chloride bind to activate the channel. Recent publications using electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed the open and closed structural characteristics of the KCNT1 channel and co-assembly of functional domains. The activation of the KCNT1 channel regulates various physiological processes including nociceptive behavior, itch, spatial learning. Meanwhile, malfunction of this channel causes important pathophysiological consequences, including Fragile X syndrome and a wide spectrum of seizure disorders. This review comprehensively describes the structure, expression patterns, physiological functions of the KCNT1 channel and emphasizes the channelopathy of gain-of-function KCNT1 mutations in epilepsy."

    "abstract": "Repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) translation of CGG repeats in the 5'UTR of FMR1 produces toxic proteins that contribute to fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) pathogenesis. The most abundant RAN product, FMRpolyG, initiates predominantly at an ACG upstream of the repeat. Accurate FMRpolyG measurements in FXTAS patients are lacking. We used data-dependent acquisition and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mass spectrometry coupled with stable isotope labeled standard peptides to identify signature FMRpolyG fragments in patient samples. Following immunoprecipitation, PRM detected FMRpolyG signature peptides in transfected cells, and FXTAS tissues and cells, but not in controls. We identified two amino-terminal peptides: an ACG-initiated Ac-MEAPLPGGVR and a GUG-initiated Ac-TEAPLPGGVR, as well as evidence for RAN translation initiation within the CGG repeat itself in two reading frames. Initiation at all sites increased following cellular stress, decreased following eIF1 overexpression and was eIF4A and M7G cap-dependent. These data demonstrate that FMRpolyG is quantifiable in human samples and FMR1 RAN translation initiates via similar mechanisms for near-cognate codons and within the repeat through processes dependent on available initiation factors and cellular environment."

Studies examining this risk in unselected populations of female PM carriers are lacking. This retrospective cohort study analyzed carrier status, CGG repeat length, AGG interruption result, and reproductive risk refinement in a population of female patients who underwent routine carrier screening for FXS. A total of 1536 PM carriers (0.43%) were identified, 95% of whom had between 55 and 90 CGG repeats. A number of 1334 carriers underwent AGG interruption testing. The majority had at least one AGG interruption and received a lower reproductive risk for FXS following AGG interruption testing (89% and 85%, respectively) as compared to their risk calculated based on CGG repeat size alone. The average change in risk across the population following AGG interruption testing was -3.4%, with a range from -50.8% to 48.9%. This article describes the range of CGG repeats and AGG interruptions in an unselected population of female PM carriers and suggests that most carriers would benefit from AGG interruption testing to refine their reproductive risk of having a child with FXS."

This nature of mutation leads to the different kinds of neurological and neuromuscular disorders; among them, fragile-X syndrome is the main cause of intellectual disability in which the increasing number of CGG TNR in 5' untranslated region is the main reason for epigenetic silencing of Fragile X mental retardation 1 gene. The aim of this study is to decrease the CG content of the candidate region to facilitate amplification by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Bisulfite treatment of the genomic DNA results in conversion of unmethylated cytosine to uridine and may overcome the diagnostic pitfalls. The whole blood DNA was extracted and bisulfite treated. Then any simplification in PCR process of desire sequence were assayed through following conventional PCR using specifically designed primers for converted sequence. Bisulfite-treated PCR product of a nearby sequence confirmed our results as a conversion control. Both the control and the candidate sequences undergoing bisulfite treatment were successfully amplified by PCR. Decreasing the GC content of the sequence by bisulfite treating could be a new approach to overcome difficulties in amplifying GC-rich sequences."

Less is known about how pain manifests for the subpopulation of carriers that develop the motor and cognitive changes of fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and how pain may differ between men and women. We gathered data collected from 104 males and females with FXTAS related to chronic pain, comorbid conditions related to pain, and medications used for pain control to further explore the types of pain experienced and to better characterize how individuals with the fragile X premutation experience pain sensation across genders. We found that women experience significantly more pain symptoms than men, particularly allodynia (20 vs. 2.0%, <i>p</i> = 0.008), peripheral neuropathy pain (43.9 vs. 25.4%, <i>p</i> = 0.0488), migraine (43.9 vs. 14.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.0008), fibromyalgia (26.8 vs. 0%, <i>p</i> = 0.0071) and back pain (48.5 vs. 23.4%, <i>p</i> = 0.008). We found onset of peripheral neuropathy predicts the onset of ataxia (β = 0.63 ± 0.25, <i>p</i> = 0.019) and tremor (β = 0.56 ± 0.17, <i>p</i> = 0.004) across gender. Women also report significantly more anxiety (82.9 vs. 39.7%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), which has implications for ideal pain treatment. These pain symptoms need to be recognized in the medical history and treated appropriately, with consideration for overlapping comorbidities."

    "abstract": "Signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 (SIPA1)-like 1 (SIPA1L1; also known as SPAR1) has been proposed to regulate synaptic functions that are important in maintaining normal neuronal activities, such as regulating spine growth and synaptic scaling, as a component of the PSD-95/NMDA-R-complex. However, its physiological role remains poorly understood. Here, we performed expression analyses using super-resolution microscopy (SRM) in mouse brain and demonstrated that SIPA1L1 is mainly localized to general submembranous regions in neurons, but surprisingly, not to PSD. Our screening for physiological interactors of SIPA1L1 in mouse brain identified spinophilin and neurabin-1, regulators of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, but rejected PSD-95/NMDA-R-complex components. Furthermore, <i>Sipa1l1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed normal spine size distribution and NMDA-R-dependent synaptic plasticity. Nevertheless, <i>Sipa1l1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed aberrant responses to α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (a spinophilin target) or adenosine A1 receptor (a neurabin-1 target) agonist stimulation, and striking behavioral anomalies, such as hyperactivity, enhanced anxiety, learning impairments, social interaction deficits, and enhanced epileptic seizure susceptibility. Male mice were used for all experiments. Our findings revealed unexpected properties of SIPA1L1, suggesting a possible association of SIPA1L1 deficiency with neuropsychiatric disorders related to dysregulated GPCR signaling, such as epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, or fragile X syndrome (FXS).<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 (SIPA1)-like 1 (SIPA1L1) is thought to regulate essential synaptic functions as a component of the PSD-95/NMDA-R-complex. In our screening for physiological SIPA1L1-interactors, we identified G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-signaling regulators. Moreover, SIPA1L1 knock-out (KO) mice showed striking behavioral anomalies, which may be relevant to GPCR signaling. Our findings revealed an unexpected role of SIPA1L1, which may open new avenues for research on neuropsychiatric disorders that involve dysregulated GPCR signaling. Another important aspect of this paper is that we showed effective methods for checking PSD association and identifying native protein interactors that are difficult to solubilize. These results may serve as a caution for future claims about interacting proteins and PSD proteins, which could eventually save time and resources for researchers and avoid confusion in the field."

    "abstract": "Sensory hypersensitivity, especially in the auditory system, is a common symptom in Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common monogenic form of intellectual disability. However, linking phenotypes across genetic background strains of mouse models has been a challenge and could underly some of the issues with translatability of drug studies to the human condition. This study is the first to characterize the auditory brain stem response (ABR), a minimally invasive physiological readout of early auditory processing that is also used in humans, in a commonly used mouse background strain model of FXS, C57BL/6J. We measured morphological features of pinna and head and used ABR to measure the hearing range, and monaural and binaural auditory responses in hemizygous males, homozygous females, and heterozygous females compared with those in wild-type mice. Consistent with previous study, we showed no difference in morphological parameters across genotypes or sexes. There was no significant difference in hearing range between the sexes or genotypes, however there was a trend towards high frequency hearing loss in male FXS mice. In contrast, female mice with homozygous FXS had a decreased amplitude of wave IV of the monaural ABR, while there was no difference in males for amplitudes and no change in latency of ABR waveforms across sexes and genotypes. Finally, males with FXS had an increased latency of the binaural interaction component (BIC) at 0 interaural timing difference compared with that in wild-type males. These findings further clarify auditory brain stem processing in FXS by adding more information across genetic background strains allowing for a better understanding of shared phenotypes."

    "abstract": "Substantial evidence now suggests an association between the FMR1 genotype and female fertility. The aim of this study was to determine whether a high normal FMR1 allele (35-54 repeats) affects in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes in Chinese women. A total of 120 women with 210 IVF cycles were retrospectively recruited in this study. The patients were divided into two groups based on the FMR1 repeat lengths at allele 2 (normal repeat group: <35 repeats; high repeat group: 35-54 repeats). The observed primary outcomes were the clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate. No associations were observed between the high normal FMR1 allele and lower clinical pregnancy rate or live birth rate after adjusting for maternal age, education, work status, duration of infertility and number of embryos transferred (aOR 0.633, 95% CI 0.249-1.601, p = 0.337; aOR 0.325, 95% CI 0.094-1.118, p = 0.075; respectively). However, after additionally adjusting for anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) level, there was a weak but significant association between high normal sized CGG repeats and a lower live birth rate (aOR 0.218, 95% CI 0.057-0.836, p = 0.026). The rate of available embryos showed a decreasing trend in patients with a high normal FMR1 allele, although the difference was not statistically significant after adjusting for maternal age, education, work status, duration of infertility and AMH level (aOR 0.905, 95% CI 0.810-1.011, p = 0.078). Furthermore, the number of CGG repeats in either allele was not associated with the live birth rate after adjusting for all confounding factors (aOR 0.832, 95% CI 0.677-1.023, p = 0.081; aOR 0.865, 95% CI 0.651-1.148, p = 0.315; respectively). In addition, no significant differences were found in the rates of good-quality embryos (p = 0.263), miscarriage (p = 0.861) or cycle cancellation (p = 0.295) between the groups. Taken together, in the Chinese population, individuals with high normal sized CGG repeats on the FMR1 gene have a higher risk of reduced live birth rates in childbearing age. Therefore, we recommend enhanced screening for fragile X syndrome in women of childbearing age in China. This study also suggests that the association between the FMR1 genotype and fertility in Chinese women merits further research."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS; MIM 300624) is an X-linked genetic disorder characterized by physical abnormalities associated with intellectual disability and a wide spectrum of neurological and psychiatric impairments. FXS occurs more frequently in males, 1 in 5000 males and 1 in 8000 females accounting for 1-2% of overall intellectual disability (ID). In more than 99% of patients, FXS results from expansions of a CGG triplet repeat (>200 in male) of the FMR1 gene. In the last years an increasing number, albeit still limited, of FXS subjects carrying FMR1 mutations including deletions, splicing errors, missense, and nonsense variants was reported. Nevertheless, the studies concerning the functional consequences of mutations in the FMR1 gene are rare so far and, therefore, we do not have sufficient knowledge regarding the genotype/phenotype correlation. We report a child carrying a hemizygous missense FMR1 (NM_002024.5:c.1325G > A p.Arg442Gln) variant, maternally inherited, associated with facial abnormalities, developmental delay, and social and communication deficits assessed with formal neuropsychological tests. The study contributes to highlighting the clinical differences between the CGG triplet repeat dependent phenotype and FMR1variant dependent phenotype and it also confirms the pathogenicity of the variant being reported for the second time in the literature."

A common cause for primary ovarian insufficiency is fragile X premutation (FXPC), and data on the cardiovascular risk factors in women with FXPC are scarce. We aimed to assess the prevalences of abnormal metabolic components among FXPC. Clinical, anthropometric and laboratory data were collected from 71 women with FXPC and compared to 78 women referred for counseling in an in-vitro fertilization clinic (control group). The mean ± SD ages of the FXPC and control groups were 33.5 ± 5.6 and 36.2 ± 5.3 years, respectively (p = 0.003). In a logistic regression analysis, the FXPC group had increased risks for hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, central obesity and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, of 21.8-fold (95% CI 2.7-175, p = 0.004), 6.9-fold (95% CI 2.5-18.7, p < 0.0001), 3.1-fold (95% CI 1.4-6.9, p = 0.005) and 2.4-fold (95% CI 1.1-5.2, p = 0.03), compared to the control group. The FXPC group had 2.7-fold higher prevalence of two abnormal metabolic components; 19% met the full criteria of MetS, compared to 3% of the control group. Neither CGG repeats nor ovarian reserve markers were associated with metabolic risk. Carriers of fragile X premutation are at increased metabolic risk from early adulthood; waist circumference, glucose and lipid levels are particularly elevated. We recommend metabolic screening for all women with FMR1 premutation, to enable early interventions for prevention of long-term cardiovascular comorbidities."

    "abstract": "Targeted treatments for fragile X syndrome (FXS) have frequently failed to show efficacy in clinical testing, despite success at the preclinical stages. This has highlighted the need for more effective translational outcome measures. EEG differences observed in FXS, including exaggerated N1 ERP amplitudes, increased resting gamma power and reduced gamma phase-locking in the sensory cortices, have been suggested as potential biomarkers of the syndrome. These abnormalities are thought to reflect cortical hyper excitability resulting from an excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (GABAergic) imbalance in FXS, which has been the target of several pharmaceutical remediation studies. EEG differences observed in humans also show similarities to those seen in laboratory models of FXS, which may allow for greater translational equivalence and better predict clinical success of putative therapeutics. There is some evidence from clinical trials showing that treatment related changes in EEG may be associated with clinical improvements, but these require replication and extension to other medications. Although the use of EEG characteristics as biomarkers is still in the early phases, and further research is needed to establish its utility in clinical trials, the current research is promising and signals the emergence of an effective translational biomarker."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading inherited cause of autism and intellectual disability, resulting from a mutation in the <i>FMR1</i> gene and subsequent loss of its protein product FMRP. Despite this simple genetic origin, FXS is a phenotypically complex disorder with a range of physical and neurocognitive disruptions. While numerous molecular and cellular pathways are affected by FMRP loss, there is growing evidence that circuit hyperexcitability may be a common convergence point that can account for many of the wide-ranging phenotypes seen in FXS. The mechanisms for hyperexcitability in FXS include alterations to excitatory synaptic function and connectivity, reduced inhibitory neuron activity, as well as changes to ion channel expression and conductance. However, understanding the impact of <i>FMR1</i> mutation on circuit function is complicated by the inherent plasticity in neural circuits, which display an array of homeostatic mechanisms to maintain activity near set levels. FMRP is also an important regulator of activity-dependent plasticity in the brain, meaning that dysregulated plasticity can be both a cause and consequence of hyperexcitable networks in FXS. This makes it difficult to separate the direct effects of <i>FMR1</i> mutation from the myriad and pleiotropic compensatory changes associated with it, both of which are likely to contribute to FXS pathophysiology. Here we will: (1) review evidence for hyperexcitability and homeostatic plasticity phenotypes in FXS models, focusing on similarities/differences across brain regions, cell-types, and developmental time points; (2) examine how excitability and plasticity disruptions interact with each other to ultimately contribute to circuit dysfunction in FXS; and (3) discuss how these synaptic and circuit deficits contribute to disease-relevant behavioral phenotypes like epilepsy and sensory hypersensitivity. Through this discussion of where the current field stands, we aim to introduce perspectives moving forward in FXS research."

Here, we report the results of the LovaMiX clinical trial, the first trial for FXS combining two disease-modifying drugs, lovastatin, and minocycline, which have both shown positive effects when used independently. <b>Aim:</b> The main goals of the study were to assess the safety and efficacy of a treatment combining lovastatin and minocycline for patients with FXS. <b>Design:</b> Pilot Phase II open-label clinical trial. Patients with a molecular diagnostic of FXS were first randomized to receive, in two-step titration either lovastatin or minocycline for 8 weeks, followed by dual treatment with lovastatin 40 mg and minocycline 100 mg for 2 weeks. Clinical assessments were performed at the beginning, after 8 weeks of monotherapy, and at week 20 (12 weeks of combined therapy). <b>Outcome Measures:</b> The primary outcome measure was the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) global score. Secondary outcome measures included subscales of the FXS specific ABC-C (ABC-C<sub>FX</sub>), the Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale (ADAMS), the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions (BRIEF), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale second edition (VABS-II). <b>Results:</b> Twenty-one individuals out of 22 completed the trial. There were no serious adverse events related to the use of either drugs alone or in combination, suggesting good tolerability and safety profile of the combined therapy. Significant improvement was noted on the primary outcome measure with a 40% decrease on ABC-C global score with the combined therapy. Several outcome measures also showed significance. <b>Conclusion:</b> The combination of lovastatin and minocycline is safe in patients for FXS individuals and appears to improve several elements of the behavior. These results set the stage for a larger, placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial to confirm the beneficial effects of the combined therapy."

Whether dysfunction in peripheral sensory system contributes to these deficits remains poorly understood. Satellite glial cells (SGCs), which envelop sensory neuron soma, play critical roles in regulating neuronal function and excitability. The potential contributions of SGCs to sensory deficits in FXS remain unexplored. Here we found major structural defects in sensory neuron-SGC association in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), manifested by aberrant covering of the neuron and gaps between SGCs and the neuron along their contact surface. Single-cell RNAseq analyses demonstrated transcriptional changes in both neurons and SGCs, indicative of defects in neuronal maturation and altered SGC vesicular secretion. We validated these changes using fluorescence microscopy, qPCR, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in combination with computational analyses using deep learning networks. These results revealed a disrupted neuron-glia association at the structural and functional levels. Given the well-established role for SGCs in regulating sensory neuron function, altered neuron-glia association may contribute to sensory deficits in FXS."

The present study contrasted cardiac startle response in pre-school-aged children with FXS, with and without ASD, to children with non-syndromic ASD (nsASD) and neurotypical controls (NT). The relationship of cardiac startle to non-verbal mental age (NVMA), ASD severity, and parent-reported anxiety was also examined. <b>Method:</b> Four age-matched groups of pre-school children participated including those with FXS without ASD (FXS-Only, <i>n</i> = 21), FXS with ASD (FXS+ASD, <i>n</i> = 17), nsASD (<i>n</i> = 42), and NT children (<i>n</i> = 27). Participants viewed a silent movie during which a single 200 ms 98-decibel white noise burst occurred. Cardiac activity was analyzed for pre-stimulus respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and the inter-beat intervals (IBI) at the auditory stimulus and 10 s post-stimulus. The Spence Pre-school Anxiety Scale, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2nd Edition, and Mullen Scales of Early Learning were examined in relation to startle response. <b>Results:</b> The nsASD group demonstrated heightened cardiac activity at the auditory stimulus and 10 s post-stimulus compared to the NT controls. Neither of the FXS groups showed differences from any other group. Higher pre-stimulus RSA was associated with reduced cardiac response across groups, while the relationship between cognitive ability and ASD severity to cardiac response varied between groups. Parent-reported anxiety was not associated with cardiac response for any group. <b>Conclusion:</b> These findings demonstrate group distinctions in cardiac responses to auditory startle. Although FXS and ASD share behavioral characteristics, the nsASD group showed a heightened cardiac startle response compared to the NT group that was not present in the FXS groups with or without ASD. Non-verbal mental age was associated with greater stimulus or post-stimulus reactivity for all groups except the FXS+ASD group, which showed no association between startle response and any clinical outcomes. Increased understanding of the relationship between physiological regulation and clinical outcomes will assist in identifying the timing and targets for effective interventions for individuals with neurodevelopmental disabilities."

Few studies have examined the variable expression of neuropsychiatric features in female PMCs, and whether heterogeneous presentation among female PMCs may reflect differential presentation of features in unique subgroups. In the current pilot study, we examined 41 female PMCs (ages 17-78 years) and 15 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched typically developing controls (TDC) across a battery of self-report, eye tracking, expressive language, neurocognitive, and resting state EEG measures to determine the feasibility of identifying discrete clusters. Secondly, we sought to identify the key features that distinguished these clusters of female PMCs. We found a three cluster solution using <i>k</i>-means clustering. Cluster 1 represented a psychiatric feature group (27% of our sample); cluster 2 represented a group with executive dysfunction and elevated high frequency neural oscillatory activity (32%); and cluster 3 represented a relatively unaffected group (41%). Our findings indicate the feasibility of using a data-driven approach to identify naturally occurring clusters in female PMCs using a multi-method assessment battery. CGG repeat count and its association with neuropsychiatric features differ across clusters. Together, our findings provide important insight into potential diverging pathophysiological mechanisms and risk factors for each female PMC cluster, which may ultimately help provide novel and individualized targets for treatment options."

CGG repeats containing FMR1 transcripts form the toxic ribonuclear aggregates, abrupt pre-mRNA splicing, and cause repeat-associated non-AUG translation, leading to the disease symptoms. Here, we utilized a small molecule library of ~ 250,000 members obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and implemented a shape-based screening approach to identify the candidate small molecules that mitigate toxic CGG RNA-mediated pathogenesis. The compounds obtained from screening were further assessed for their affinity and selectivity towards toxic CGG repeat RNA by employing fluorescence-binding experiment and isothermal calorimetry titration assay. Three candidate molecules B1, B4, and B11 showed high affinity and selectivity for expanded CGG repeats RNA. Further, NMR spectroscopy, gel mobility shift assay, CD spectroscopy, UV-thermal denaturation assay, and molecular docking affirmed their high affinity and selectivity for toxic CGG RNAs. Next, these lead compounds selectively improved the pre-mRNA alternative splicing defects with no perturbation in global splicing efficacy and simultaneously reduced the FMR1polyG protein aggregate formation without affecting the downstream expression of the gene. Taken together these findings, we addressed compound B1, B4, and B11 as potential lead molecules for developing promising therapeutics against FXTAS. Herein, this study, we have utilized shape similarity approach to screen the NCI library and found out the potential candidate which improves the pre-mRNA splicing defects and reduces FMR1polyG aggregations."

    "abstract": "Methylated FMR1 full-mutation expansions cause fragile X syndrome. FMR1 premutation carriers are susceptible to other late-onset conditions, and women with premutation are at risk of transmitting a fully expanded FMR1 allele to offspring. Identification of individuals with actionable FMR1 genotypes (full-mutation males and females, and premutation females at risk for primary ovarian insufficiency and/or having fragile X-affected offspring) can enable timely access to intervention services and genetic counseling. This study presents a rapid, first-tier test based on melting curve analysis of methylation-specific triplet-primed PCR amplicons (msTP-PCR MCA) for concurrent detection of FMR1 CGG-repeat expansions and their methylation status. The msTP-PCR MCA assay was optimized on 20 fragile X reference samples, and its performance was evaluated on 111 peripheral blood-derived DNA samples from patients who have undergone prior molecular testing with PCR and/or Southern blot analysis. The msTP-PCR MCA assay detected all samples with a methylated FMR1 CGG-repeat expansion, and had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values of 100%, 92.06%, 91.1%, and 100%, respectively. The msTP-PCR MCA assay identified premutation/full-mutation mosaicism down to 1%, detected skewed inactivation in females with FMR1 expansions, and enabled selective identification of all individuals with an actionable FMR1 genotype. The msTP-PCR MCA assay may aid in fragile X screening of at-risk populations and newborns and voluntary carrier screening of women of reproductive age."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability, learning disability, and autism spectrum disorder, is associated with an increased prevalence of certain medical conditions including seizures. The goal of this study was to better understand seizures in individuals with FXS using the Fragile X Online Registry with Accessible Research Database, a multisite observational study initiated in 2012 involving FXS clinics in the Fragile X Clinic and Research Consortium. Seizure data were available for 1,607 participants, mostly male (77%) and white (74.5%). The overall prevalence of at least one seizure was 12%, with this rate being significantly higher in males than females (13.7 vs. 6.2%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). As compared to individuals with FXS without seizures, those with seizures were more likely to have autism spectrum disorder, current sleep apnea, later acquisition of expressive language, more severe intellectual disability, hyperactivity, irritability, and stereotyped movements. The mean age of seizure onset was 6.4 (SD 6.1) years of age with the great majority (>80%) having onset of seizures which was before 10. For those with epilepsy, about half (52%) had seizures for more than 3 years. This group was found to have greater cognitive and language impairment, but not behavioral disruptions, compared with those with seizures for <3 years. Antiepileptic drugs were more often used in males (60.6%) than females (34.8%), and females more often required more than one medication. The most commonly used anticonvulsants were oxcarbazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam. The current study is the largest and first longitudinal study ever conducted to describe seizures in FXS. Overall, this study confirms previous reports of seizures in FXS and extends previous findings by further defining the cognitive and behavioral phenotype of those with epilepsy in FXS. Future studies should further investigate the natural history of seizures in FXS and the characteristics of seizures in FXS in adulthood."

    "title": "Dendritic spine membrane proteome and its alterations in autistic spectrum disorder.",
    "abstract": "Dendritic spines are small protrusions stemming from the dendritic shaft that constitute the primary specialization for receiving and processing excitatory neurotransmission in brain synapses. The disruption of dendritic spine function in several neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases leads to severe information-processing deficits with impairments in neuronal connectivity and plasticity. Spine dysregulation is usually accompanied by morphological alterations to spine shape, size and/or number that may occur at early pathophysiological stages and not necessarily be reflected in clinical manifestations. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one such group of diseases involving changes in neuronal connectivity and abnormal morphology of dendritic spines on postsynaptic neurons. These alterations at the subcellular level correlate with molecular changes in the spine proteome, with alterations in the copy number, topography, or in severe cases in the phenotype of the molecular components, predominantly of those proteins involved in spine recognition and adhesion, reflected in abnormally short lifetimes of the synapse and compensatory increases in synaptic connections. Since cholinergic neurotransmission participates in the regulation of cognitive function (attention, memory, learning processes, cognitive flexibility, social interactions) brain acetylcholine receptors are likely to play an important role in the dysfunctional synapses in ASD, either directly or indirectly via the modulatory functions exerted on other neurotransmitter receptor proteins and spine-resident proteins."

Appropriate outcome measures for FXS have been identified as a key area of research interest in order to evaluate future therapeutic trials. The Brief Observation of Social Communication Change-Minimally Verbal (BOSCC-MV), an outcome measure with strong psychometrics developed for autism spectrum disorder, has promise as an outcome measure to assess social communication change with FXS participants. We examined the BOSCC-MV via central coders in this multi-site-trial to assess its appropriateness for FXS. Eighteen minimally verbal males ages 3-12 years were enrolled and assessed on two consecutive days and 7 participants completed a third visit 6 months later. We examined test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, and both convergent and divergent validity with standard clinical measures including the Autism Diagnostic and Observation Schedule-2, Vineland 3, Social Responsiveness Scale, and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist. The BOSCC-MV in FXS demonstrated strong inter-rater and test-retest reliability, comparable to previous trials in idiopathic ASD. Strong convergent validity was found with Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 and Vineland-3. Divergent validity was demonstrated between BOSCC-MV and unrelated measures. The BOSCC-MV shows promise as a FXS social communication outcome measure, warranting further large-scale evaluation."

    "abstract": "While behavioral interventions remain the mainstay of treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), several potential targeted treatments addressing the underlying neurophysiology of ASD have emerged in the last few years. These are promising for the potential to, in future, become part of the mainstay treatment in addressing the core symptoms of ASD. Although it is likely that the development of future targeted treatments will be influenced by the underlying heterogeneity in etiology, associated genetic mechanisms influencing ASD are likely to be the first targets of treatments and even gene therapy in the future for ASD. In this article, we provide a review of current psychopharmacological treatment in ASD including those used to address common comorbidities of the condition and upcoming new targeted approaches in autism management. Medications including metformin, arbaclofen, cannabidiol, oxytocin, bumetanide, lovastatin, trofinetide, and dietary supplements including sulforophane and N-acetylcysteine are discussed. Commonly used medications to address the comorbidities associated with ASD including atypical antipsychotics, serotoninergic agents, alpha-2 agonists, and stimulant medications are also reviewed. Targeted treatments in Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common genetic disorder leading to ASD, provide a model for new treatments that may be helpful for other forms of ASD."

    "abstract": "Women who carry a premutation allele of the FMR1 gene are at increased vulnerability to an array of age-related symptoms and disorders, including age-related decline in select cognitive skills. However, the risk factors for age-related decline are poorly understood, including the potential role of family history and genetic factors. In other forms of pathological aging, early decline in syntactic complexity is observed and predicts the later onset of neurodegenerative disease. To shed light on the earliest signs of degeneration, the present study characterized longitudinal changes in the syntactic complexity of women with the FMR1 premutation across midlife, and associations with family history of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and CGG repeat length. Forty-five women with the FMR1 premutation aged 35-64 years at study entry participated in 1-5 longitudinal assessments spaced approximately a year apart (130 observations total). All participants were mothers of children with confirmed fragile X syndrome. Language samples were analyzed for syntactic complexity and participants provided information on family history of FXTAS. CGG repeat length was determined via molecular genetic testing. Hierarchical linear models indicated that women who reported a family history of FXTAS exhibited faster age-related decline in syntactic complexity than those without a family history, with that difference emerging as the women reached their mid-50 s. CGG repeat length was not a significant predictor of age-related change. Results suggest that women with the FMR1 premutation who have a family history of FXTAS may be at increased risk for neurodegenerative disease, as indicated by age-related loss of syntactic complexity. Thus, family history of FXTAS may represent a personalized risk factor for age-related disease. Follow-up study is needed to determine whether syntactic decline is an early indicator of FXTAS specifically, as opposed to being a more general age-related cognitive decline associated with the FMR1 premutation."

The underlying genetic causes of several of these diseases have been identified only in the past 2-3 years. These expansion disorders have substantial overlapping clinical, neuroimaging and histopathological features. The shared features suggest common mechanisms that could have implications for the development of therapies for this group of diseases - similar therapeutic strategies or drugs may be effective for various neurodegenerative disorders induced by non-coding CGG expansions. In this Review, we provide an overview of clinical and pathological features of these CGG repeat expansion diseases and consider the likely pathological mechanisms, including RNA toxicity, CGG repeat-associated non-AUG-initiated translation, protein aggregation and mitochondrial impairment. We then discuss future research needed to improve the identification and diagnosis of CGG repeat expansion diseases, to improve modelling of these diseases and to understand their pathogenesis. We also consider possible therapeutic strategies. Finally, we propose that CGG repeat expansion diseases may represent manifestations of a single underlying neuromyodegenerative syndrome in which different organs are affected to different extents depending on the gene location of the repeat expansion."

    "abstract": "Sensory hypersensitivity and somatosensory deficits represent the core symptoms of Fragile X syndrome (FXS). These alterations are believed to arise from changes in cortical sensory processing, while potential deficits in the function of peripheral sensory neurons residing in dorsal root ganglia remain unexplored. We found that peripheral sensory neurons exhibit pronounced hyperexcitability in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice, manifested by markedly increased action potential (AP) firing rate and decreased threshold. Unlike excitability changes found in many central neurons, no significant changes were observed in AP rising and falling time, peak potential, amplitude, or duration. Sensory neuron hyperexcitability was caused primarily by increased input resistance, without changes in cell capacitance or resting membrane potential. Analyses of the underlying mechanisms revealed reduced activity of HCN channels and reduced expression of HCN1 and HCN4 in <i>Fmr1</i> KO compared to WT. A selective HCN channel blocker abolished differences in all measures of sensory neuron excitability between WT and <i>Fmr1</i> KO neurons. These results reveal a hyperexcitable state of peripheral sensory neurons in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice caused by dysfunction of HCN channels. In addition to the intrinsic neuronal dysfunction, the accompanying paper examines deficits in sensory neuron association/communication with their enveloping satellite glial cells, suggesting contributions from both neuronal intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms to sensory dysfunction in the FXS mouse model."

    "abstract": "Synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling is essential for the maintenance of neurotransmission, with a number of neurodevelopmental disorders linked to defects in this process. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from a loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) encoded by the <i>FMR1</i> gene. Hyperexcitability of neuronal circuits is a key feature of FXS, therefore we investigated whether SV recycling was affected by the absence of FMRP during increased neuronal activity. We revealed that primary neuronal cultures from male <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out (KO) rats display a specific defect in activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE). ADBE is dominant during intense neuronal activity, and this defect resulted in an inability of <i>Fmr1</i> KO neurons to sustain SV recycling during trains of high-frequency stimulation. Using a molecular replacement strategy, we also revealed that a human FMRP mutant that cannot bind BK channels failed to correct ADBE dysfunction in KO neurons, however this dysfunction was corrected by BK channel agonists. Therefore, FMRP performs a key role in sustaining neurotransmitter release via selective control of ADBE, suggesting intervention via this endocytosis mode may correct the hyperexcitability observed in FXS.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) results in fragile X syndrome (FXS), however whether its loss has a direct role in neurotransmitter release remains a matter of debate. We demonstrate that neurons lacking FMRP display a specific defect in a mechanism that sustains neurotransmitter release during intense neuronal firing, called activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE). This discovery provides key insights into mechanisms of brain communication that occur because of loss of FMRP function. Importantly it also reveals ADBE as a potential therapeutic target to correct the circuit hyperexcitability observed in FXS."

To examine the feasibility of newborn screening for these chromosome 15 imprinting disorders at population scale. In this diagnostic study, the validation data set for the first-tier SNRPN test, called methylation-specific quantitative melt analysis (MS-QMA), included 109 PWS, 48 AS, 9 Dup15q, and 1190 population control newborn blood spots (NBS) and peripheral tissue samples from participants recruited from January 2000 to December 2016. The test data set included NBS samples from 16 579 infants born in 2011. Infants with an NBS identified as positive for PWS, AS, or Dup15q by the first-tier test were referred for droplet digital polymerase chain reaction, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and low-coverage whole-genome sequencing for confirmatory testing. Data analyses were conducted between February 12, 2015, and August 15, 2020. In the validation data set, the median age for the 77 patients with PWS was 3.00 years (IQR, 0.01-44.50 years); for the 46 patients with AS, 2.76 years (IQR, 0.028 to 49.00 years); and for the 9 patients with Dup15q, 4.00 years (IQR, 1.00 to 28.00 years). Thirty-eight patients (51.4%) in the PWS group, 20 patients (45.5%) in the AS group, and 6 patients (66.7%) in the Dup15q group who had sex reported were male. The validation data set showed MS-QMA sensitivity of 99.0% for PWS, 93.8% for AS, and 77.8% for Dup15q; specificity of 100% for PWS, AS, and Dup15q; positive predictive and negative predictive values of 100% for PWS and AS; and a positive predictive value of 87.5% and negative predictive value of 100% for Dup15q. In the test data set of NBS samples from 16 579 infants, 92 had a positive test result using a methylation ratio cut-off of 3 standard deviations from the mean. Of these patients, 2 were confirmed to have PWS; 2, AS; and 1, maternal Dup15q. With the use of more conservative PWS- and AS-specific thresholds for positive calls from the validation data set, 9 positive NBS results were identified by MS-QMA in this cohort. The 2 PWS and 2 AS calls were confirmed by second-tier testing, but the 1 Dup15q case was not confirmed. Together, these results provided prevalence estimates of 1 in 8290 for both AS and PWS and 1 in 16 579 for maternal Dup15q, with positive predictive values for first-tier testing at 67.0% for AS, 33.0% for PWS, and 44.0% for combined detection of chromosome 15 imprinting disorders for the validation data set. The findings of this diagnostic study suggest that it is feasible to screen for all chromosome 15 imprinting disorders using SNRPN methylation analysis, with 5 individuals identified with these disorders out of 16 579 infants screened."

Fragile X syndrome is caused by an expansion (full mutation ≥200 CGGs repeats, normal 10-45 CGGs) of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (<i>FMR1</i>) gene, epigenetic silencing of the gene, which leads to reduction or lack of the gene's product: the fragile X mental retardation protein. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed general and pharmacotherapy knowledge (GK and PTK) of fragile X syndrome and satisfaction with education in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) among senior medical students in Serbia (N=348), Georgia (N=112), and Colombia (N=58). A self-administered 18-item questionnaire included GK (8/18) and PTK (7/18) components and self-assessment of the participants education in NDDs (3/18). Roughly 1 in 5 respondents had correct answers on half or more facts about fragile X syndrome (GK>PTK), which ranged similarly 5-7 in Serbia, 6-8 in Georgia, and 5-8 in Colombia, respectively. No cohort had an average value greater than 9 (60%) that would represent passing score \"cut-off.\" None of the participants answered all the questions correctly. More than two-thirds of the participants concluded that they gained inadequate knowledge of NDDs during their studies, and that their education in this field should be more intense. In conclusion, there is a major gap in knowledge regarding fragile X syndrome among senior medical students in these three developing countries. The finding could at least in part be generalized to other developing countries aimed toward increasing knowledge and awareness of NDDs and fostering an institutional collaboration between developed and developing countries."

This complex neurodevelopmental disorder is caused by an alteration in the CGG trinucleotide expansion in fragile X mental retardation gene 1 (<i>FMR1</i>) leading to gene silencing and the subsequent loss of its product: fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMRP). Molecular diagnosis is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening followed by Southern blotting (SB) or Triplet primer-PCR (TP-PCR) to determine the number of CGG repeats in the <i>FMR1</i> gene. We performed, for the first time, screening in 247 Ecuadorian male individuals with clinical criteria to discard FXS. Analysis was carried out by the Genetics Service of the Hospital de Especialidades No. 1 de las Fuerzas Armadas (HE-1), Ecuador. The analysis was performed using endpoint PCR for CGG fragment expansion analysis of the <i>FMR1</i> gene. Twenty-two affected males were identified as potentially carrying the full mutation in FMR1 and thus diagnosed with FXS that is 8.1% of the sample studied. The average age at diagnosis of the positive cases was 13 years of age, with most cases from the geographical area of Pichincha (63.63%). We confirmed the familial nature of the disease in four cases. The range of CGG variation in the population was 12-43 and followed a modal distribution of 27 repeats. Our results were similar to those reported in the literature; however, since it was not possible to differentiate between premutation and mutation cases, we can only establish a molecular screening approach to identify an expanded CGG repeat, which makes it necessary to generate national strategies to optimize molecular tests and establish proper protocols for the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients, families, and communities at risk of presenting FXS."

However, there have been no published reports on the prevalence of FXS in ASD patients in Thailand. In this study, we present a pilot study to analyze the CGG repeat sizes of the <i>FMR1</i> gene in Thai autistic patients. We screened 202 unrelated Thai patients (168 males and 34 females) with nonsyndromic ASD and 212 normal controls using standard FXS molecular diagnosis techniques. The distributions of <i>FMR1</i> CGG repeat sizes in the ASD and normal control groups were similar, with the two most common alleles having 29 and 30 CGG repeats, followed by an allele with 36 CGG repeats. No <i>FMR1</i> full mutations or premutations were found in either ASD individuals or the normal controls. Interestingly, three ASD male patients with high normal CGG and intermediate CGG repeats (44, 46, and 53 CGG repeats) were identified, indicating that the prevalence of <i>FMR1</i> intermediate alleles in Thai ASD patients was approximately 1% while these alleles were absent in the normal male controls. Our study indicates that CGG repeat expansions of the <i>FMR1</i> gene may not be a common genetic cause of nonsyndromic ASD in Thai patients. However, further studies for mutations other than the CGG expansion in the <i>FMR1</i> gene are required to get a better information on FXS prevalence in Thai ASD patients."

Fragile X syndrome is the most common reason for inherited intellectual disability in the human population. The ways of the expansion development remain unclear. An important feature of expanded repeats is the ability to form stable alternative DNA secondary structures. There are hypotheses about the nature of repeat instability. It is proposed that these DNA secondary structures can block various stages of DNA metabolism processes, such as replication, repair and recombination and it is considered as the source of repeat instability. However, none of the hypotheses is fully confirmed or is the only valid one. Here, an experimental system for studying (CGG)n repeat expansion associated with transcription and TCR-NER is proposed. It is noteworthy that the aberrations of transcription are a poorly studied mechanism of (CGG)n instability. However, the proposed systems take into account the contribution of other processes of DNA metabolism and, therefore, the developed systems are universal and applicable for various studies. Transgenic cell lines carrying a repeat of normal or premutant length under the control of an inducible promoter were established and a method for repeat instability quantification was developed. One type of the cell lines contains an exogenous repeat integrated into the genome by the Sleeping Beauty transposon; in another cell line, the vector is maintained as an episome due to the SV40 origin of replication. These experimental systems can serve for finding the causes of instability and the development of therapeutic agents. In addition, a criterion was developed for the quantification of exogenous (CGG)n repeat instability in the transgenic cell lines' genome."

    "abstract": "The challenges of caring for children with complex health needs, such as intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are multiple and experienced by both caregivers and health professionals. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common single gene cause of ID and ASD, and provides a pertinent model to understand these complexities of care, as well as the communication challenges experienced between caregivers and healthcare professionals. In recent years both caregivers and healthcare professionals have recognized the need for enhancing communication both in clinical and research settings. Knowledge mapping has emerged as a tool to support quality communication between team participants. Here we review how differences in mental models, as well as challenges related to health literacy and knowledge transfer can have an impact on communication. Next, we present different knowledge mapping approaches used in complex situations, with a focus on concept maps and care maps. Finally, we highlight the potential benefits and limitations of mapping to improve communication issues related to caring for individuals with FXS and potentially other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs)."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with 60-74% of males with FXS meeting diagnostic criteria for ASD. Infants with FXS have demonstrated atypical neural responses during face processing that are unique from both typically developing, low-risk infants and infants at high familial risk for ASD (i.e., infants siblings of children with ASD). In the current study, event-related potential (ERP) responses during face processing measured at 12 months of age were examined in relation to ASD symptoms measured at ~48 months of age in participants with FXS, as well as siblings of children with ASD and low-risk control participants. Results revealed that greater amplitude N290 responses in infancy were associated with more severe ASD symptoms in childhood in FXS and in siblings of children with ASD. This pattern of results was not observed for low-risk control participants. Reduced Nc amplitude was associated with more severe ASD symptoms in participants with FXS but was not observed in the other groups. This is the first study to examine ASD symptoms in childhood in relation to infant ERP responses in FXS. Results indicate that infant ERP responses may be predictive of later symptoms of ASD in FXS and the presence of both common and unique pathways to ASD in etiologically-distinct high-risk groups is supported (i.e., syndromic risk vs. familial risk)."

    "abstract": "Although previous research supports the notion that characteristics of both the child and the mother impact maternal well-being and parenting stress in mothers of children with FXS, more work is needed in which self-report measures are supplemented by physiological measures of stress and well-being. The inclusion of physiological measures, such as heart rate variability (HRV), may provide a window into the biological origins and consequences of maternal perceptions of their experiences, including the challenges of raising a child with developmental challenges. The proposed project, therefore, involved the collection of multimodal assessment data from mothers and their school-aged children with FXS. Further, given the importance of understanding how mothers of youth with FXS are faring in their everyday environment, the present study collected all data using telehealth procedures and wearable technology. Participants were 20 biological mothers and their children with FXS between the ages of 6 and 11 years. We measured maternal mental health and parenting stress through self-report as well as through HRV as a more objective measure of psychological well-being. We also examined the associations between these variables and child characteristics such as externalizing and internalizing behaviors as well as autism symptomatology. We found significant support for an elevated rate of depressive symptoms in the sample of mothers (35%) and some potential indicators for heightened rates of anxiety (15%) when compared to normed samples and rates in the general population. We also found that the mothers presented with an atypical HRV profile akin to those experiencing depression or chronic stress, although limitations of the present measure suggest the need for additional confirmatory research. Further, we found that child externalizing behaviors were the primary correlates of maternal well-being. These findings contribute to the growing body of literature regarding the unique challenges faced by these mother-child dyads and supports the importance of increasing the availability of services available to these mothers, not only for meeting the needs of their children's development and behavior, but in supporting their own well-being as well."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome, as well as some manifestations of autism spectrum disorder, results from improper RNA regulation due to a deficiency of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP and its autosomal paralogs, fragile X related proteins 1 & 2 (FXR1P/2P), have been implicated in many aspects of RNA regulation, from protein synthesis to mRNA stability and decay. The literature on the fragile X related proteins' (FXPs) role in mRNA regulation and their potential mRNA targets is vast. Therefore, we developed an approach to investigate the function of FXPs in translational control using three potential mRNA targets. Briefly, we first selected top mRNA candidates found to be associated with the FXPs and whose translation are influenced by one or more of the FXPs. We then narrowed down the FXPs' binding site(s) within the mRNA, analyzed the strength of this binding in vitro, and determined how each FXP affects the translation of a minimal reporter mRNA with the binding site. Overall, all FXPs bound with high affinity to RNAs containing G-quadruplexes, such as Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 and FMRP's own coding region. Interestingly, FMRP inhibited the translation of each mRNA distinctly and in a manner that appears to correlate with its binding to each mRNA. In contrast, FXR1P/2P inhibited all mRNAs tested. Finally, although binding of our RNAs was due to the RGG (arginine-glycine-glycine) motif-containing C-terminal region of the FXPs, this region was not sufficient to cause inhibition of translation."

    "abstract": "The eutherian-specific SNORD116 family of repeated box C/D snoRNA genes is suspected to play a major role in the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), yet its molecular function remains poorly understood. Here, we combined phylogenetic and molecular analyses to identify candidate RNA targets. Based on the analysis of several eutherian orthologs, we found evidence of extensive birth-and-death and conversion events during SNORD116 gene history. However, the consequences for phylogenetic conservation were heterogeneous along the gene sequence. The standard snoRNA elements necessary for RNA stability and association with dedicated core proteins were the most conserved, in agreement with the hypothesis that SNORD116 generate genuine snoRNAs. In addition, one of the two antisense elements typically involved in RNA target recognition was largely dominated by a unique sequence present in at least one subset of gene paralogs in most species, likely the result of a selective effect. In agreement with a functional role, this ASE exhibited a hybridization capacity with putative mRNA targets that was strongly conserved in eutherians. Moreover, transient downregulation experiments in human cells showed that Snord116 controls the expression and splicing levels of these mRNAs. The functions of two of them, diacylglycerol kinase kappa and Neuroligin 3, extend the description of the molecular bases of PWS and reveal unexpected molecular links with the Fragile X syndrome and autism spectrum disorders."

Nonetheless, frequency, severity, and consequences of sleep problems are still unclear. The Fragile X Online Registry with Accessible Research Database (FORWARD-version-3), including Clinician Report and Parent Report forms, was analyzed for frequency, severity, relationship with behavioral problems, and impact of sleep difficulties in a mainly pediatric cohort. A focused evaluation of sleep apnea was also conducted. Six surveyed sleep difficulties were moderately frequent (~23%-46%), relatively mild, affected predominantly younger males, and considered a problem for 7%-20% of families. Snoring was more prevalent in older individuals. All sleep difficulties were associated with irritability/aggression and most also to hyperactivity. Only severe snoring was correlated with sleep apnea (loud snoring: 30%; sleep apnea: 2%-3%). Sleep difficulties are prevalent in children with FXS and, although they tend to be mild, they are associated with behavioral problems and negative impact to families. Because of its cross-sectional nature, clinic-origin, use of ad hoc data collection forms, and lack of treatment data, the present study should be considered foundational for future research aiming at better recognition and management of sleep problems in FXS."

    "abstract": "Ongoing inchworm-like CAG and CGG repeat expansions in brains, arising by aberrant processing of slipped DNAs, may drive Huntington's disease, fragile X syndrome, and autism. FAN1 nuclease modifies hyper-expansion rates by unknown means. We show that FAN1, through iterative cycles, binds, dimerizes, and cleaves slipped DNAs, yielding striking exo-nuclease pauses along slip-outs: 5'-C↓A↓GC↓A↓G-3' and 5'-C↓T↓G↓C↓T↓G-3'. CAG excision is slower than CTG and requires intra-strand A·A and T·T mismatches. Fully paired hairpins arrested excision, whereas disease-delaying CAA interruptions further slowed excision. Endo-nucleolytic cleavage is insensitive to slip-outs. Rare FAN1 variants are found in individuals with autism with CGG/CCG expansions, and CGG/CCG slip-outs show exo-nuclease pauses. The slip-out-specific ligand, naphthyridine-azaquinolone, which induces contractions of expanded repeats in vivo, requires FAN1 for its effect, and protects slip-outs from FAN1 exo-, but not endo-, nucleolytic digestion. FAN1's inchworm pausing of slip-out excision rates is well suited to modify inchworm expansion rates, which modify disease onset and progression."

Our studies provide novel insights into the role of excitatory neurons in abnormal development of PV cells during a postnatal period of inhibitory circuit refinement. To achieve Fragile X mental retardation gene (Fmr1) deletion and re-expression in excitatory neurons during the postnatal day (P)14-P21 period, we generated Cre<sup>CaMKIIa</sup>/Fmr1<sup>Flox/y</sup> (cOFF) and Cre<sup>CaMKIIa</sup>/Fmr1<sup>FloxNeo/y</sup> (cON) mice, respectively. Cortical phenotypes were evaluated in adult mice using biochemical, cellular, clinically relevant electroencephalogram (EEG) and behavioral tests. We found that similar to global Fmr1 KO mice, the density of PV-expressing cells, their activation, and sound-evoked gamma synchronization were impaired in cOFF mice, but the phenotypes were improved in cON mice. cOFF mice also showed enhanced cortical gelatinase activity and baseline EEG gamma power, which were reduced in cON mice. In addition, TrkB phosphorylation and PV levels were lower in cOFF mice, which also showed increased locomotor activity and anxiety-like behaviors. Remarkably, when FMRP levels were restored in only excitatory neurons during the P14-P21 period, TrkB phosphorylation and mouse behaviors were also improved. These results indicate that postnatal deletion or re-expression of FMRP in excitatory neurons is sufficient to elicit or ameliorate structural and functional cortical deficits, and abnormal behaviors in mice, informing future studies about appropriate treatment windows and providing fundamental insights into the cellular mechanisms of cortical circuit dysfunction in FXS."

    "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) and Fragile X syndrome (FXS) are two monogenetic neurodevelopmental disorders with complex clinical presentations. RTT is caused by mutations in the Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene (<i>MECP2</i>) altering the function of its protein product MeCP2. MeCP2 modulates gene expression by binding methylated CpG dinucleotides, and by interacting with transcription factors. FXS is caused by the silencing of the <i>FMR1</i> gene encoding the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), a RNA binding protein involved in multiple steps of RNA metabolism, and modulating the translation of thousands of proteins including a large set of synaptic proteins. Despite differences in genetic etiology, there are overlapping features in RTT and FXS, possibly due to interactions between MeCP2 and FMRP, and to the regulation of pathways resulting in dysregulation of common molecular signaling. Furthermore, basic physiological mechanisms are regulated by these proteins and might concur to the pathophysiology of both syndromes. Considering that RTT and FXS are disorders affecting brain development, and that most of the common targets of MeCP2 and FMRP are involved in brain activity, we discuss the mechanisms of synaptic function and plasticity altered in RTT and FXS, and we consider the similarities and the differences between these two disorders."

FXS is associated with neurophysiological abnormalities, including cortical hyperexcitability. Alterations in electroencephalogram (EEG) resting-state power spectral density (PSD) are well-defined in FXS and were found to be linked to neurodevelopmental delays. Whether non-linear dynamics of the brain signal are also altered remains to be studied. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, resting-state EEG power, including alpha peak frequency (APF) and theta/beta ratio (TBR), as well as signal complexity using multi-scale entropy (MSE) were compared between 26 FXS participants (ages 5-28 years), and 7 neurotypical (NT) controls with a similar age distribution. Subsequently a replication study was carried out, comparing our cohort to 19 FXS participants independently recorded at a different site. <b>Results:</b> PSD results confirmed the increased gamma, decreased alpha power and APF in FXS participants compared to NT controls. No alterations in TBR were found. Importantly, results revealed reduced signal complexity in FXS participants, specifically in higher scales, suggesting that altered signal complexity is sensitive to brain alterations in this population. The replication study mostly confirmed these results and suggested critical points of stagnation in the neurodevelopmental curve of FXS. <b>Conclusion:</b> Signal complexity is a powerful feature that can be added to the electrophysiological biomarkers of brain maturation in FXS."

However, the mechanisms that lead to these symptoms are under explored. In this study, we examined whether there are defects in myelination in the auditory brainstem circuitry. Specifically, we studied myelinated fibers that terminate in the Calyx of Held, which encode temporally precise sound arrival time, and are some of the most heavily myelinated axons in the brain. We measured anatomical myelination characteristics using coherent anti-stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) and electron microscopy (EM) in a FXS mouse model in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) where the Calyx of Held synapses. We measured number of mature oligodendrocytes (OL) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to determine if changes in myelination were due to changes in the number of myelinating or immature glial cells. The two microscopy techniques (EM and CARS) showed a decrease in fiber diameter in FXS mice. Additionally, EM results indicated reductions in myelin thickness and axon diameter, and an increase in g-ratio, a measure of structural and functional myelination. Lastly, we showed an increase in both OL and OPCs in MNTB sections of FXS mice suggesting that the myelination phenotype is not due to an overall decrease in number of myelinating OLs. This is the first study to show that a myelination defects in the auditory brainstem that may underly auditory phenotypes in FXS."

As cilia are diffusion barrier-gated subcellular compartments, their protein components are thought to come from the cell body through intraflagellar transport or diffusion. Here we show that cilia locally synthesize proteins to maintain their structure and functions. Multicilia of mouse ependymal cells are abundant in ribosomal proteins, translation initiation factors, and RNA, including 18 S rRNA and tubulin mRNA. The cilia actively generate nascent peptides, including those of tubulin. mRNA-binding protein Fmrp localizes in ciliary central lumen and appears to function in mRNA delivery into the cilia. Its depletion by RNAi impairs ciliary local translation and induces multicilia degeneration. Expression of exogenous Fmrp, but not an isoform tethered to mitochondria, rescues the degeneration defects. Therefore, local translation defects in cilia might contribute to the pathology of ciliopathies and other diseases such as Fragile X syndrome."

We previously showed that MOV10 functionally associates with FMRP. Here we quantify the effect of reduced MOV10 and FMRP expression on dendritic morphology. Murine neurons with reduced MOV10 and FMRP phenocopied Dicer1 KO neurons which exhibit impaired dendritic maturation Hong J (2013), leading us to hypothesize that MOV10 and FMRP regulate DICER expression. In cells and tissues expressing reduced MOV10 or no FMRP, DICER expression was significantly reduced. Moreover, the Dicer1 mRNA is a Cross-Linking Immunoprecipitation (CLIP) target of FMRP Darnell JC (2011), MOV10 Skariah G (2017) and AGO2 Kenny PJ (2020). MOV10 and FMRP modulate expression of DICER1 mRNA through its 3'untranslated region (UTR) and introduction of a DICER1 transgene restores normal neurite outgrowth in the Mov10 KO neuroblastoma Neuro2A cell line and branching in MOV10 heterozygote neurons. Moreover, we observe a global reduction in AGO2-associated microRNAs isolated from Fmr1 KO brain.

FXTAS can be misdiagnosed with many neurodegenerative disorders manifesting with cerebellar ataxias owing to their overlapping clinical and radiological features. The frequency of the FMR1 premutation allele in Japan has not been fully determined. Herein, we aimed to determine the frequency of FMR1 premutation alleles in Japanese patients with undiagnosed cerebellar ataxia and multiple system atrophy, using repeat-primed PCR in 186 patients with adult onset of undiagnosed cerebellar ataxia and 668 patients with multiple system atrophy, to identify expanded CGG repeats as well as to detect AGG interruptions within the expanded alleles. The size of expansions was estimated using fragment length analysis of PCR products obtained by conventional PCR employing a pair of unique primers flanking the repeat sequence. We identified FMR1 premutation alleles in three male patients. One patient revealed 84 repeat units with one AGG interruption and another patient showed 103 repeat units. Both had presented with sporadic cerebellar ataxia, giving an estimated frequency of 3.7% among Japanese male patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia with age at onset above 50 years. One patient with the clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy harbored 60 repeat units with four AGG interruptions. FMR1 intermediate alleles were observed in two males and one female among the multiple system atrophy patients. We found that genetic tests for FMR1 premutation should be considered in Japanese male patients with cerebellar ataxia with the age at onset above 50 years."

One specific disorder of X-chromosomal deletion, Fragile X syndrome, is the most frequently occurring of intellectual disabilities. Previous metabolomic studies have been limited to mouse models that may not have sufficiently revealed the full biochemical diversity of the disease in humans. The primary objective of this study was to elucidate the human biochemistry in X-chromosomal deletion disorders through metabolomic and lipidomic profiling, using cells from a X-deletion patient as a representative case. Metabolomic and lipidomic analysis was performed by UHPLC-HRMS on neural progenitor (NP) cells isolated from an afflicted female patient versus normal neural progenitor cells. Results showed perturbations in several metabolic pathways, including those of arginine and proline, that significantly impact both neurotransmitter generation and overall brain function. Coincidently, dysregulation was observed for lipids involved in both cellular structure and membrane integrity. The trends of observed metabolomic changes, as well as lipidomic profiling from identified features, are discussed. The lipidomic and metabolomic profiles of NP cell samples exhibited significant differentiation associated with partial deletion of the X chromosome. These findings suggest that rare X-chromosomal deletion disorders are not only a mental disorder limited to alterations in local neuronal functions, but are also metabolic diseases."

Understanding the origins and developmental course of pragmatic language problems in FXS and other developmental conditions associated with language impairment is a critical step for the development of targeted interventions to promote communicative competence across the lifespan. This study examined pragmatic language in the context of parent-child interactions in school-age children with FXS (who did and did not meet ASD criteria on the ADOS; <i>n</i> = 85), idiopathic ASD (<i>n</i> = 32), Down syndrome (DS; <i>n</i> = 38), and typical development (TD; <i>n</i> = 39), and their parents. Parent-child communicative interactions were examined across multiple contexts, across groups, and in relationship to pragmatic language outcomes assessed 2 years later. Results showed both overlapping and divergent patterns across the FXS-ASD and idiopathic ASD child and parent groups, and also highlighted key differences in pragmatic profiles based on situational context, with more pragmatic language difficulties occurring for both ASD groups in less structured interactions. Differences in parental language styles during parent-child interactions were associated with child language outcomes, likely reflecting the complex interplay of discourse style inherent to a parent, with the inevitable influence of child characteristics on parent language as well. Together, findings help delineate the dynamic and multifactorial nature of impaired pragmatic skills among children with FXS and other neurodevelopmental disorders associated with language impairment, with potential implications for the development of targeted interventions for pragmatic communication skills."

We explored the frequency of psychotropic medication use for the following symptom clusters: attention, hyperactivity, anxiety, hypersensitivity, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), mood swings, irritability/agitation, aggression, and self-injury (IAAS). <b><i>Results:</i></b> A majority of participants (617 or 63.3%) were taking a psychotropic medication, including investigational drugs. Medications were often targeting multiple symptoms. Psychotropic medication use was more common in males, adolescents, and those with comorbid ID and ASD. Anxiety was the most frequently targeted symptom, followed by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms and IAAS. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were the most frequently prescribed medication class among all patients (<i>n</i> = 266, 43%), followed by stimulants (<i>n</i> = 235, 38%), each with no gender difference. Antipsychotics were the third most frequently prescribed medication class (<i>n</i> = 205, 33%), and were more frequently prescribed to males and those with ID and ASD. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Anxiety, attention and hyperactivity were the most common symptom targets for psychopharmacologic intervention in FXS. Our results support clinical knowledge that males with comorbid ASD and ID have a more severe presentation requiring more intervention including medications. These results highlight the need for examination of symptom overlap and interaction."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder that is characterized by a range of cognitive and behavioral deficits, including mild-moderate intellectual disability. The disease is characterized by an X-linked mutation of the <i>Fmr1</i> gene, which causes silencing of the gene coding for fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a translational regulator integral for neurodevelopment. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been recently associated with FXS, with reports of increases in oxidative stress markers, reactive oxygen species, and lipid peroxidation being present in the brain tissue. Astrocytes, a prominent glial cell within the central nervous system (CNS), play a large role in regulating oxidative homeostasis within the developing brain and dysregulation of astrocyte redox balance in FXS, which may contribute to oxidative stress. Astrocyte function and mitochondrial bioenergetics are significantly influenced by oxygen availability and circulating sex hormones; yet, these parameters are rarely considered during in vitro experimentation. Given that the brain normally develops in a range of hypoxic conditions and FXS is a sex-linked genetic disorder, we investigated how different oxygen levels (normoxic vs. hypoxic) and biological sex affected mitochondrial bioenergetics of astrocytes in FXS. Our results demonstrate that both mitochondrial respiration capacity and reactive oxygen species emission are altered with <i>Fmr1</i> deletion in astrocytes and these changes were dependent upon both sexual dimorphism and oxygen availability."

To delineate these profiles further, the development of early social cognitive abilities in children with CdLS, FXS and RTS was compared to that observed in typically developing (TD) and autistic (AUT) children. Children with CdLS (N = 22), FXS (N = 19) and RTS (N = 18), completed the Early Social Cognition Scale (ESCogS). Extant data from AUT (N = 19) and TD (N = 86) children were used for comparison. Similar to AUT children, children with CdLS, FXS and RTS showed an overall delay in passing ESCogS tasks. Children with CdLS showed a similar degree of delay to AUT children and greater delay than children with FXS and RTS. The CdLS, FXS and RTS groups did not pass tasks in the same sequence observed in TD and AUT children. Children with CdLS (p = 0.04), FXS (p = 0.02) and RTS (p = 0.04) performed better on tasks requiring understanding simple intentions in others significantly more than tasks requiring joint attention skills. An underlying mechanism other than general cognitive delay may be disrupting early social cognitive development in children with CdLS, FXS and RTS. Factors that may disrupt early social cognitive development within these syndromes are discussed."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent cause of inherited intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders, characterized by cognitive deficits and autistic behaviors. The silencing of the <i>Fmr1</i> gene and consequent lack of FMRP protein, is the major contribution to FXS pathophysiology. FMRP is an RNA binding protein involved in the maturation and plasticity of synapses and its absence culminates in a range of morphological, synaptic and behavioral phenotypes. Currently, there are no approved medications for the treatment of FXS, with the approaches under study being fairly specific and unsatisfying in human trials. Here we propose peptides/peptidomimetics as candidates in the pharmacotherapy of FXS; in the last years this class of molecules has catalyzed the attention of pharmaceutical research, being highly selective and well-tolerated. Thanks to their ability to target protein-protein interactions (PPIs), they are already being tested for a wide range of diseases, including cancer, diabetes, inflammation, Alzheimer's disease, but this approach has never been applied to FXS. As FXS is at the forefront of efforts to develop new drugs and approaches, we discuss opportunities, challenges and potential issues of peptides/peptidomimetics in FXS drug design and development."

Despite recent advance in elucidating disease mechanisms, there is no efficacious medication. Because de novo drug development is a lengthy process, repurposing the existing FDA-approved drugs offers an opportunity to advance clinical intervention for FXS. Our previous study with transcriptome analysis predicts potential therapeutic effects of vorinostat on FXS. We analyzed the vorinostat-induced transcriptome changes and confirmed its similarity to that induced by trifluoperazine, which was previously shown to correct pathological outcomes associated with FXS. To validate the therapeutic efficacy, we examined vorinostat's effect on correcting the key behavioral and cellular symptoms in a mouse model of FXS. We found that vorinostat restores object location memory and passive avoidance memory in the Fmr1 knockout mice. For the non-cognitive behavioral symptoms, vorinostat corrected the autism-associated alterations, including repetitive behavior and social interaction deficits. In the open field test, vorinostat dampened hyperactivity in the center area of the arena. Surprisingly, vorinostat did not correct the abnormally elevated protein synthesis in cultured Fmr1 knockout hippocampal neurons, suggesting that different aspects of pathological outcomes may respond differently to a specific therapeutic intervention. We used the drug-induced transcriptome signature to predict new application of existing drugs. Our data reveal the therapeutic effects of the FDA-approved drug vorinostat in a mouse model of FXS."

We previously demonstrated that FMRP binds mRNAs targeted for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and that FMRP loss results in hyperactivated NMD and inhibition of neuronal differentiation in human stem cells. We show here that NMD is hyperactivated during the development of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum in the Fmr1-knockout (KO) mouse during embryonic and early postnatal periods. Our findings demonstrate that NMD regulates many neuronal mRNAs that are important for mouse brain development. We reveal the abnormal regulation of these mRNAs in the Fmr1-KO mouse, a model of FXS, and highlight the importance of early intervention."

Social prescribing is a formal process of referring patients to a link worker to co-design a plan to improve their health and wellbeing. Intervention involves supporting participation in activities based within the individual's local community. This study aimed to explore the barriers and enablers to accessing social prescribing for people living with LTNCs (plwLTNCs). A total of four focus groups were carried out with 17 participants, including different neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Fragile X Syndrome, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury. Two participants were family carers and supported people living with epilepsy and motor neurone disease. Findings were analysed using thematic analysis. Five themes were identified: (1) Lack of knowledge; (2) Service provision difficulties; (3) Benefits of social prescribing activities; (4) Physical barriers and (5) Psychological barriers. There was a lack of knowledge about social prescribing and what it actually was. Participants anticipated service provision difficulties relating to funding, link workers need for knowledge of LTNC's and for activities to be varied and individualised. The potential benefits of social prescribing activities were recognised across the groups especially its potential to tackle loneliness and to offer plwLTNC's purpose. Participants highlighted a number of physical barriers such as transport and accessibility; and psychological barriers such as anxiety and stigma. Social prescribing aims to address the health inequalities of those living with long-term conditions, however currently it is likely to exclude plwLTNCs. Recommendations for practice and future research are made."

    "abstract": "Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA binding protein (RBP) whose absence is essentially associated to Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). As an RNA Binding Protein (RBP), FMRP is able to bind and recognize different RNA structures and the control of specific mRNAs is important for neuronal synaptic plasticity. Perturbations of this pathway have been associated with the autistic spectrum. One of the FMRP partners is the APP mRNA, the main protagonist of Alzheimer's disease (AD), thereby regulating its protein level and metabolism. Therefore FMRP is associated to two neurodevelopmental and age-related degenerative conditions, respectively FXS and AD. Although these pathologies are characterized by different features, they have been reported to share a number of common molecular and cellular players. The aim of this review is to describe the double-edged sword of FMRP in autism and AD, possibly allowing the elucidation of key shared underlying mechanisms and neuronal circuits. As an RBP, FMRP is able to regulate APP expression promoting the production of amyloid <i>β</i> fragments. Indeed, FXS patients show an increase of amyloid <i>β</i> load, typical of other neurological disorders, such as AD, Down syndrome, Parkinson's Disease, etc. Beyond APP dysmetabolism, the two neurodegenerative conditions share molecular targets, brain circuits and related cognitive deficits. In this review, we will point out the potential common neuropathological pattern which needs to be addressed and we will hopefully contribute to clarifying the complex phenotype of these two neurorological disorders, in order to pave the way for a novel, common disease-modifying therapy."

Despite the considerable differences between areas, individual interneuron subtypes are genetically invariant and are thought to form canonical circuits regardless of which area they are embedded in. Here, we investigate whether this is achieved through selective and systematic variations in their afferent connectivity during development. To this end, we examined the development of their inputs within distinct cortical areas. We find that interneuron afferents show little evidence of being globally stereotyped. Rather, each subtype displays characteristic regional connectivity and distinct developmental dynamics by which this connectivity is achieved. Moreover, afferents dynamically regulated during development are disrupted by early sensory deprivation and in a model of fragile X syndrome. These data provide a comprehensive map of interneuron afferents across cortical areas and reveal the logic by which these circuits are established during development."

    "abstract": "Fragile X (FX) syndrome is one of the leading inherited causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A majority of FX and ASD patients exhibit sensory hypersensitivity, including auditory hypersensitivity or hyperacusis, a condition in which everyday sounds are perceived as much louder than normal. Auditory processing deficits in FX and ASD also afford the opportunity to develop objective and quantifiable outcome measures that are likely to translate between humans and animal models due to the well-conserved nature of the auditory system and well-developed behavioral read-outs of sound perception. Therefore, in this study we characterized auditory hypersensitivity in a Fmr1 knockout (KO) transgenic rat model of FX using an operant conditioning task to assess sound detection thresholds and suprathreshold auditory reaction time-intensity (RT-I) functions, a reliable psychoacoustic measure of loudness growth, at a variety of stimulus frequencies, bandwidths, and durations. Male Fmr1 KO and littermate WT rats both learned the task at the same rate and exhibited normal hearing thresholds. However, Fmr1 KO rats had faster auditory RTs over a broad range of intensities and steeper RT-I slopes than WT controls, perceptual evidence of excessive loudness growth in Fmr1 KO rats. Furthermore, we found that Fmr1 KO animals exhibited abnormal perceptual integration of sound duration and bandwidth, with diminished temporal but enhanced spectral integration of sound intensity. Because temporal and spectral integration of sound stimuli were altered in opposite directions in Fmr1 KO rats, this suggests that abnormal RTs in these animals are evidence of aberrant auditory processing rather than generalized hyperactivity or altered motor responses. Together, these results are indicative of fundamental changes to low-level auditory processing in Fmr1 KO animals. Finally, we demonstrated that antagonism of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) selectively and dose-dependently restored normal loudness growth in Fmr1 KO rats, suggesting a pharmacologic approach for alleviating sensory hypersensitivity associated with FX. This study leverages the tractable nature of the auditory system and the unique behavioral advantages of rats to provide important insights into the nature of a centrally important yet understudied aspect of FX and ASD."

Zoe was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy, labor, and delivery. She had a routine newborn course and was discharged home with her parents 2 days after her birth.At 7 months, Zoe was not able to sit independently, had poor weight gain, and had hypertonia on physical examination. Her parents described her to tense her arms and have hand tremors when she held her bottle during feedings and reported that she had resisted their attempts to introduce pureed or other age-appropriate table foods into her diet. The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Screening Test was administered and found a cognitive composite score of 70, language composite score of 65, and motor composite score of 67. Chromosomal microarray analysis, testing for fragile X syndrome, laboratory studies for metabolic disorders, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and an audiologic examination were normal. Zoe was referred to and received early intervention services including physical therapy, feeding therapy, and infant stimulation services. By 16 months, Zoe was walking independently and was gaining weight well but continued to have sensory aversions to some foods.At 22 months, Zoe was evaluated by a multidisciplinary team because of ongoing developmental concerns and concerning results on standardized screening for autism spectrum disorder completed at her 18-month preventive care visit. Her parents also reported concern about the possibility of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) because they both were diagnosed with ASD as young children. Both parents completed college and were employed full-time. Zoe's mother seemed to be somewhat anxious during the visit and provided fleeting eye contact throughout the evaluation. Zoe's father was assertive, but polite, and was the primary historian regarding parental concerns during the evaluation.Zoe was noted to have occasional hand flapping and squealing vocalizations while she roamed the examination area grabbing various objects and casting them to the floor while watching the trajectory of their movements. She did not use a single-finger point to indicate her wants or needs and did not initiate or follow joint attention. She met criteria for ASD. In discussing the diagnosis with Zoe's parents, they shared that they were not surprised by the diagnosis. They expressed feeling that Zoe was social and playful, although delayed in her language. Hence, they were more concerned about her disinterest in eating. They were not keen on behavioral intervention because they did not want Zoe to be \"trained to be neurotypical.\" Although the mother did not receive applied behavior analysis (ABA), the father had received ABA for 3 years beginning at age 5 years. He believed that ABA negatively changed his personality, and he did not want the same for Zoe.How would you assist Zoe's parents in identification of priorities for her developmental care while ensuring respect for their perspective of neurodiversity?"

Individuals with full mutation and premutation alleles have a high risk of psychophysiological disorder and of having affected offspring. Frequencies of FMR1 alleles in general newborns have been reported in Caucasians but have not been investigated in the large-scale population in the mainland of China. The sizes of FMR1 CGG-repeats were analyzed in 51,661 newborns (28,114 males and 23,547 females) and also in a cohort of 33 children diagnosed with developmental delay using GC-rich polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and triple repeat primed PCR. The frequency of CGG repeats > 100 was 1/9371 in males and 1/5887 in females, and the frequency of CGG repeats > 54 was 1/1561 in males and 1/1624 in females. FMR1 full mutation and premutation were identified in 27.27% of children who had Ages and Stages Questionnaire scores less than two standard deviations from the cutoff value. Our study revealed the prevalence of FXS in China and improved the sample databases of FXS, suggesting that the prevalence of FXS in Chinese is higher than estimated previously and that FXS screening can be advised to high-risk families."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common single-gene cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with FXS present with a wide range of severity in multiple phenotypes including cognitive delay, behavioral challenges, sleep issues, epilepsy, and anxiety. These symptoms are also shared by many individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Since the discovery of the FXS gene, FMR1, FXS has been the focus of intense preclinical investigation and is placed at the forefront of clinical trials in the field of NDDs. So far, most studies have aimed to translate the rescue of specific phenotypes in animal models, for example, learning, or improving general cognitive or behavioral functioning in individuals with FXS. Trial design, selection of outcome measures, and interpretation of results of recent trials have shown limitations in this type of approach. We propose a new paradigm in which all phenotypes involved in individuals with FXS would be considered and, more importantly, the possible interactions between these phenotypes. This approach would be implemented both at the baseline, meaning when entering a trial or when studying a patient population, and also after the intervention when the study subjects have been exposed to the investigational product. This approach would allow us to further understand potential trade-offs underlying the varying effects of the treatment on different individuals in clinical trials, and to connect the results to individual genetic differences. To better understand the interplay between different phenotypes, we emphasize the need for preclinical studies to investigate various interrelated biological and behavioral outcomes when assessing a specific treatment. In this paper, we present how such a conceptual shift in preclinical design could shed new light on clinical trial results. Future clinical studies should take into account the rich neurodiversity of individuals with FXS specifically and NDDs in general, and incorporate the idea of trade-offs in their designs."

Emotional and behavioral effects are particularly pronounced during a pandemic-related disaster, when support networks that typically promote healthy coping, such as friends, teachers, and family members, may be less available. Children and adolescents with fragile X syndrome (FXS), who are at increased risk for developing anxiety and depression, may be particularly vulnerable to behavioral or emotional difficulties during a pandemic. This study examined the mental health outcomes of school-aged girls with FXS during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated stay-at-home orders. Participants included 47 school-aged girls with FXS and 33 age- and developmentally matched comparison girls. Associations between COVID-19 behavioral and emotional outcomes and prior academic, adaptive, behavioral, and emotional functioning as well as prior maternal mental health and characteristics of the mother-child relationship were examined. Qualitative data from the parental report of emotional and behavioral responses to the pandemic were also obtained. Results indicate that school-aged girls with FXS demonstrate a distinct profile of COVID-19 related associations compared to the comparison group, such that pandemic-related worries and emotional impact of pandemic restrictions were predicted by prior mental health factors for the comparison group but by prior social, behavioral, and relational factors for the FXS group.

Like FXS in humans, loss of Fmr1 in rodents also cause sensory, behavioral, and cognitive deficits. However, the neural mechanisms underlying sensory impairment, especially vision impairment, remain unclear. It remains elusive whether the visual processing deficits originate from corrupted inputs, impaired perception in the primary sensory cortex, or altered integration in the higher cortex, and there is no effective treatment. In this study, we used a genetic knockout mouse model (Fmr1<sup>KO</sup>), in vivo imaging, and behavioral measurements to show that the loss of Fmr1 impaired signal processing in the primary visual cortex (V1). Specifically, Fmr1<sup>KO</sup> mice showed enhanced responses to low-intensity stimuli but normal responses to high-intensity stimuli. This abnormality was accompanied by enhancements in local network connectivity in V1 microcircuits and increased dendritic complexity of V1 neurons. These effects were ameliorated by the acute application of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activators, which enhanced the activity of inhibitory neurons, or by reintroducing Fmr1 gene expression in knockout V1 neurons in both juvenile and young-adult mice. Overall, V1 plays an important role in the visual abnormalities of Fmr1<sup>KO</sup> mice and it could be possible to rescue the sensory disturbances in developed FXS and autism patients."

Few studies, however, have examined the extent to which social-environmental factors can influence these behaviors, particularly in home settings. Caregivers of 32 boys with FXS, aged 3 to 10 years, were coached by a board-certified behavior analyst to implement a functional analysis (FA) with their child in their home over 2 days. The functions identified in the FAs were validated by behavioral interventions conducted through telehealth over 12 weeks. Social functions for aggression and self-injury were identified in 29 (90.6%) cases, with the most common functions identified being escape from demands/transitions and/or tangible reinforcement. Subsequent function-based behavioral interventions (i.e., functional communication training) implemented for 22 cases by telehealth resulted in decreased rates of aggression and self-injury by 74% to 100%. These data underscore the significant impact that social-environmental factors can have on the development and maintenance of aggression and self-injury in FXS. Conducting early home-based behavioral interventions designed to increase functional communication skills may therefore be an effective solution for the treatment of aggression and self-injury in FXS in the long term."

FXS astrocytes release elevated levels of immune-related factors interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tenascin C (TNC), and also demonstrate increased purinergic signaling, a pathway linked to signaling factor release. Here, in cortical astrocytes from the Fmr1 knockout (KO) FXS mouse model, purinergic agonism enhanced TNC secretion and STAT3 phosphorylation, two processes linked to elevated IL-6 secretion in FXS, while STAT3 knockdown and TLR4 antagonism normalized Fmr1 KO IL-6 release. We therefore suggest that purinergic signaling and immune regulatory pathways converge to drive FXS cortical pro-inflammatory responses."

    "title": "Trajectories of Heart Activity Across Infancy to Early Childhood Differentially Predict Autism and Anxiety Symptoms in Fragile X Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a monogenic disorder characterized by high rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and anxiety. A longstanding \"hyperarousal hypothesis\" in FXS has argued that ANS dysfunction underpins many symptoms of FXS. However, the developmental onset and trajectory of ANS dysfunction, as well as the consequences of ANS dysfunction on later psychiatric symptoms, remain poorly understood in FXS. Insight into the emergence, trajectory, and consequences of ANS dysfunction across early development in FXS has critical implications for prevention, intervention, and optimal outcomes in both typical and atypical development. This longitudinal study investigated whether and when males with FXS evidence atypical ANS function from infancy through early childhood, and how trajectories of ANS function across infancy and early childhood predict ASD and anxiety symptom severity later in development. <b>Methods:</b> Participants included 73 males with FXS and 79 age-matched typically developing (TD) males. Baseline heart activity was recorded at multiple assessments between 3 and 83 months of age, resulting in 372 observations. General arousal and parasympathetic activity were indexed via interbeat interval (IBI) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), respectively. ASD and anxiety symptoms were assessed at 36 months of age or later in a subgroup of participants (FXS <i>n</i> = 28; TD <i>n</i> = 25). <b>Results:</b> Males with FXS exhibited atypical patterns of developmental change in ANS function across infancy and early childhood. As a result, ANS dysfunction became progressively more discrepant across time, with the FXS group exhibiting significantly shorter IBI and lower RSA by 29 and 24 months of age, respectively. Shorter IBI at 24 months and a flatter IBI slope across development predicted elevated anxiety symptoms, but not ASD symptoms, later in childhood in both FXS and TD males. Reduced RSA at 24 months predicted elevated ASD symptoms, but not anxiety symptoms, in both groups. Developmental change in RSA across early development did not predict later anxiety or ASD symptoms. <b>Conclusion:</b> This is the first longitudinal study to examine the \"hyperarousal hypothesis\" in infants and young children with FXS. Findings suggest that hyperarousal (i.e., shorter IBI, lower RSA) is evident in males with FXS by 24-29 months of age. Interestingly, unique aspects of early ANS function differentially relate to later ASD and anxiety symptoms. General arousal, indexed by shorter IBI that becomes progressively more discrepant from TD controls, predicts later anxiety symptoms. In contrast, parasympathetic-related factors, indexed by lower levels of RSA, predict ASD symptoms. These findings support the \"hyperarousal hypothesis\" in FXS, in that ANS dysfunction evident early in development predicts later-emerging symptoms of ASD and anxiety. This study also have important implications for the development of targeted treatments and interventions that could potentially mitigate the long-term effects of hyperarousal in FXS."

    "title": "Neural Correlates of Auditory Hypersensitivity in Fragile X Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying the common association between autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and sensory processing disorders (SPD) are unclear, and treatment options to reduce atypical sensory processing are limited. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and ASD behaviors. As in most children with ASD, atypical sensory processing is a common symptom in FXS, frequently manifesting as sensory hypersensitivity. Auditory hypersensitivity is a highly debilitating condition in FXS that may lead to language delays, social anxiety and ritualized repetitive behaviors. Animal models of FXS, including <i>Fmr1</i> knock out (KO) mouse, also show auditory hypersensitivity, providing a translation relevant platform to study underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The focus of this review is to summarize recent studies in the <i>Fmr1</i> KO mouse that identified neural correlates of auditory hypersensitivity. We review results of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in the <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice and highlight EEG phenotypes that are remarkably similar to EEG findings in humans with FXS. The EEG phenotypes associated with the loss of FMRP include enhanced resting EEG gamma band power, reduced cross frequency coupling, reduced sound-evoked synchrony of neural responses at gamma band frequencies, increased event-related potential amplitudes, reduced habituation of neural responses and increased non-phase locked power. In addition, we highlight the postnatal period when the EEG phenotypes develop and show a strong association of the phenotypes with enhanced matrix-metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity, abnormal development of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing inhibitory interneurons and reduced formation of specialized extracellular matrix structures called perineuronal nets (PNNs). Finally, we discuss how dysfunctions of inhibitory PV interneurons may contribute to cortical hyperexcitability and EEG abnormalities observed in FXS. Taken together, the studies reviewed here indicate that EEG recordings can be utilized in both pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, while at the same time, used to identify cellular and circuit mechanisms of dysfunction in FXS. New therapeutic approaches that reduce MMP-9 activity and restore functions of PV interneurons may succeed in reducing FXS sensory symptoms. Future studies should examine long-lasting benefits of developmental vs. adult interventions on sensory phenotypes."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common single-gene cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is caused by a >200-trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (<i>FMR1</i>) gene. Individuals with FXS can present with a range of neurobehavioral impairments including, but not limited to: cognitive, language, and adaptive deficits; ASD; anxiety; social withdrawal and avoidance; and aggression. Decreased expression of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor <i>δ</i> subunit and deficient GABAergic tonic inhibition could be associated with symptoms of FXS. Gaboxadol (OV101) is a <i>δ</i>-subunit-selective, extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist that enhances GABAergic tonic inhibition, providing the rationale for assessment of OV101 as a potential targeted treatment of FXS. No drug is approved in the United States for the treatment of FXS. <b>Methods:</b> This 12-weeks, randomized (1:1:1), double-blind, parallel-group, phase 2a study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and optimal daily dose of OV101 5 mg [once (QD), twice (BID), or three-times daily (TID)] when administered for 12 weeks to adolescent and adult men with FXS. Safety was the primary study objective, with key assessments including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment-related adverse events leading to study discontinuation, and serious adverse events (SAEs). The secondary study objective was to evaluate the effect of OV101 on a variety of problem behaviors. <b>Results:</b> A total of 23 participants with FXS (13 adolescents, 10 adults) with moderate-to-severe neurobehavioral phenotypes (Full Scale Intelligence Quotient, 41.5 ± 3.29; ASD, 82.6%) were randomized to OV101 5 mg QD (<i>n</i> = 8), 5 mg BID (<i>n</i> = 8), or 5 mg TID (<i>n</i> = 7) for 12 weeks. OV101 was well tolerated across all 3 treatment regimens. The most common TEAEs were upper respiratory tract infection (<i>n</i> = 4), headache (<i>n</i> = 3), diarrhea (<i>n</i> = 2), and irritability (<i>n</i> = 2). No SAEs were reported. Improvements from baseline to end-of-treatment were observed on several efficacy endpoints, and 60% of participants were identified as treatment responders based on Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement. <b>Conclusions:</b> Overall, OV101 was safe and well tolerated. Efficacy results demonstrate an initial signal for OV101 in individuals with FXS. These results need to be confirmed in a larger, randomized, placebo-controlled study with optimal outcomes and in the most appropriate age group. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT03697161."

We tested the efficacy of a novel GSK3 inhibitor AFC03127, which was developed by Angelini Pharma, in comparison to the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 inhibitor 2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride (MPEP) and the GSK3 inhibitor SB216763 in <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> assays in <i>Fmr1</i> <sup><i>KO</i></sup> mice, a mouse model useful for the study of FXS. The <i>in vivo</i> assay tested susceptibility to audiogenic-induced seizures (AGS) whereas the <i>in vitro</i> assays assessed biomarker expression and dendritic spine length and density in cultured primary neurons as a function of drug dose. MPEP and SB216763 attenuated AGS in <i>Fmr1</i> <sup><i>KO</i></sup> mice, whereas AFC03127 did not. MPEP and AFC03127 significantly reduced dendritic expression of amyloid-beta protein precursor (APP). All drugs rescued spine length and the ratio of mature dendritic spines. Spine density was not statistically different between vehicle and GSK3 inhibitor-treated cells. The drugs were tested over a wide concentration range in the <i>in vitro</i> assays to determine dose responses. A bell-shaped dose response decrease in APP expression was observed in response to AFC03127, which was more effective than SB216763. These findings confirm previous studies demonstrating differential effects of various GSK3 inhibitors on AGS propensity in <i>Fmr1</i> <sup><i>KO</i></sup> mice and confirm APP as a downstream biomarker that is responsive to GSK3 activity."

    "abstract": "The alteration of excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance has been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric diseases, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a single-gene disorder that is the most common known cause of ASD. Understanding the molecular and physiological features of FXS is thought to enhance our knowledge of the pathophysiology of ASD. Accumulated evidence implicates deficits in the inhibitory circuits in FXS that tips E-I balance toward excitation. Deficits in interneurons, the main source of an inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), have been reported in FXS, including a reduced number of cells, reduction in intrinsic cellular excitability, or weaker synaptic connectivity. Manipulating the interneuron activity ameliorated the symptoms in the FXS mouse model, which makes it reasonable to conceptualize FXS as an interneuronopathy. While it is still poorly understood how the developmental profiles of the inhibitory circuit go awry in FXS, recent works have uncovered several developmental alterations in the functional properties of interneurons. Correcting disrupted E-I balance by potentiating the inhibitory circuit by targeting interneurons may have a therapeutic potential in FXS. I will review the recent evidence about the inhibitory alterations and interneuron dysfunction in ASD and FXS and will discuss the future directions of this field."

    "title": "Mechanisms of Genome Instability in the Fragile X-Related Disorders.",
    "abstract": "The Fragile X-related disorders (FXDs), which include the intellectual disability fragile X syndrome (FXS), are disorders caused by expansion of a CGG-repeat tract in the 5' UTR of the X-linked <i>FMR1</i> gene. These disorders are named for FRAXA, the folate-sensitive fragile site that localizes with the CGG-repeat in individuals with FXS. Two pathological <i>FMR1</i> allele size classes are distinguished. Premutation (PM) alleles have 54-200 repeats and confer the risk of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). PM alleles are prone to both somatic and germline expansion, with female PM carriers being at risk of having a child with >200+ repeats. Inheritance of such full mutation (FM) alleles causes FXS. Contractions of PM and FM alleles can also occur. As a result, many carriers are mosaic for different sized alleles, with the clinical presentation depending on the proportions of these alleles in affected tissues. Furthermore, it has become apparent that the chromosomal fragility of FXS individuals reflects an underlying problem that can lead to chromosomal numerical and structural abnormalities. Thus, large numbers of CGG-repeats in the <i>FMR1</i> gene predisposes individuals to multiple forms of genome instability. This review will discuss our current understanding of these processes."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome results from the absence of the FMR1 gene product-Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Fragile X animal research has lacked a reliable method to quantify FMRP. We report the development of an array of FMRP-specific monoclonal antibodies and their application for quantitative assessment of FMRP (qFMRPm) in mouse tissue. To characterize the assay, we determined the normal variability of FMRP expression in four brain structures of six different mouse strains at seven weeks of age. There was a hierarchy of FMRP expression: neocortex > hippocampus > cerebellum > brainstem. The expression of FMRP was highest and least variable in the neocortex, whereas it was most variable in the hippocampus. Male C57Bl/6J and FVB mice were selected to determine FMRP developmental differences in the brain at 3, 7, 10, and 14 weeks of age. We examined the four structures and found a developmental decline in FMRP expression with age, except for the brainstem where it remained stable. qFMRPm assay of blood had highest values in 3 week old animals and dropped by 2.5-fold with age. Sex differences were not significant. The results establish qFMRPm as a valuable tool due to its ease of methodology, cost effectiveness, and accuracy."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability. FXS is an X-linked, neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the Fragile X Mental Retardation gene, <i>FMR1</i>. Greater than 200 CGG repeats results in epigenetic silencing of the gene leading to the deficiency or absence of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). The loss of FMRP is considered the root cause of FXS. The relationship between neurological function and FMRP expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has not been well established. Assays to detect and measure <i>FMR1</i> and FMRP have been described; however, none are sufficiently sensitive, precise, or quantitative to properly characterize the relationships between cognitive ability and CGG repeat number, <i>FMR1</i> mRNA expression, or FMRP expression measured in PBMCs. To address these limitations, two novel immunoassays were developed and optimized, an electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay and a multiparameter flow cytometry assay. Both assays were performed on PMBCs isolated from 27 study participants with <i>FMR1</i> CGG repeats ranging from normal to full mutation. After correcting for methylation, a significant positive correlation between CGG repeat number and <i>FMR1</i> mRNA expression levels and a significant negative correlation between FMRP levels and CGG repeat expansion was observed. Importantly, a high positive correlation was observed between intellectual quotient (IQ) and FMRP expression measured in PBMCs."

    "abstract": "Event-related potentials (ERPs) are an ideal tool for measuring neural responses in a wide range of participants, including children diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, due to perceived barriers regarding participant compliance, much of this work has excluded children with low IQ and/or reduced adaptive functioning, significant anxiety symptoms, and/or sensory processing difficulties, including heterogeneous samples of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and children with fragile X syndrome (FXS). We have developed a behavioral support protocol designed to obtain high-quality ERP data from children in a single session. Using this approach, ERP data were successfully collected from participants with ASD, FXS, and typical development (TD). Higher success rates were observed for children with ASD and TD than children with FXS. Unique clinical-behavioral characteristics were associated with successful data collection across these groups. Higher chronological age, nonverbal mental age, and receptive language skills were associated with a greater number of valid trials completed in children with ASD. In contrast, higher language ability, lower autism severity, increased anxiety, and increased sensory hyperresponsivity were associated with a greater number of valid trials completed in children with FXS. This work indicates that a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach cannot be taken to ERP research on children with NDDs, but that a single-session paradigm is feasible and is intended to promote increased representation of children with NDDs in neuroscience research through development of ERP methods that support inclusion of diverse and representative samples."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent monogenic cause of autism or intellectual disability, and research on its pathogenetic mechanisms has provided important insights on this neurodevelopmental condition. Nevertheless, after 30 years of intense research, efforts to develop treatments have been mostly unsuccessful. The aim of this review is to compile evidence from existing research pointing to clinical, genetic, and therapeutic response heterogeneity in FXS and highlight the need of implementing precision medicine-based treatments. We comment on the high genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity present in FXS, as a contributing factor to the difficulties found during drug development. Given that several clinical trials have showed a non-negligeable fraction of positive responders to drugs targeting core FXS symptoms, we propose that success of clinical trials can be achieved by tackling the underlying heterogeneity in FXS by accurately stratifying patients into drug-responder subpopulations. These precision medicine-based approaches, which can be first applied to well-defined monogenic diseases such as FXS, can also serve to define drug responder profiles based on specific biomarkers or phenotypic features that can associate patients with different genetic backgrounds to a same candidate drug, thus repositioning a same drug for a larger number of patients with NDDs."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by silencing of the human <i>FMR1</i> gene and is the leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism. Abundant preclinical data indicated that negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) might be efficacious in treating FXS in humans. Initial attempts to translate these findings in clinical trials have failed, but these failures provide the opportunity for new discoveries that will improve future trials. The emergence of acquired treatment resistance (\"tolerance\") after chronic administration of mGluR5 NAMs is a potential factor in the lack of success. Here we confirm that FXS model mice display acquired treatment resistance after chronic treatment with the mGluR5 NAM CTEP in three assays commonly examined in the mouse model of FXS: (1) audiogenic seizure susceptibility, (2) sensory cortex hyperexcitability, and (3) hippocampal protein synthesis. Cross-tolerance experiments suggest that the mechanism of treatment resistance likely occurs at signaling nodes downstream of glycogen synthase kinase 3α (GSK3α), but upstream of protein synthesis. The rapid emergence of tolerance to CTEP begs the question of how previous studies showed an improvement in inhibitory avoidance (IA) cognitive performance after chronic treatment. We show here that this observation was likely explained by timely inhibition of mGluR5 during a critical period, as brief CTEP treatment in juvenile mice is sufficient to provide a persistent improvement of IA behavior measured many weeks later. These data will be important to consider when designing future fragile X clinical trials using compounds that target the mGluR5-to-protein synthesis signaling cascade."

More than half of the comorbid conditions studied were associated with women who self-reported having anxiety. Age, smoking, body mass index (BMI), and depression were also significant predictor variables for specific comorbid conditions. <b>Conclusions:</b> Age, smoking, and BMI were significantly associated with a subset of the comorbid conditions analyzed.

    "abstract": "Traditional methods for the analysis of repeat expansions, which underlie genetic disorders, such as fragile X syndrome (FXS), lack single-nucleotide resolution in repeat analysis and the ability to characterize causative variants outside the repeat array. These drawbacks can be overcome by long-read and short-read sequencing, respectively. However, the routine application of next-generation sequencing in the clinic requires target enrichment, and none of the available methods allows parallel analysis of long-DNA fragments using both sequencing technologies. In this study, we investigated the use of indirect sequence capture (Xdrop technology) coupled to Nanopore and Illumina sequencing to characterize <i>FMR1</i>, the gene responsible of FXS. We achieved the efficient enrichment (> 200×) of large target DNA fragments (~60-80 kbp) encompassing the entire <i>FMR1</i> gene. The analysis of Xdrop-enriched samples by Nanopore long-read sequencing allowed the complete characterization of repeat lengths in samples with normal, pre-mutation, and full mutation status (> 1 kbp), and correctly identified repeat interruptions relevant for disease prognosis and transmission. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (indels) could be detected in the same samples by Illumina short-read sequencing, completing the mutational testing through the identification of pathogenic variants within the <i>FMR1</i> gene, when no typical CGG repeat expansion is detected. The study successfully demonstrated the parallel analysis of repeat expansions and SNVs/indels in the <i>FMR1</i> gene at single-nucleotide resolution by combining Xdrop enrichment with two next-generation sequencing approaches. With the appropriate optimization necessary for the clinical settings, the system could facilitate both the study of genotype-phenotype correlation in FXS and enable a more efficient diagnosis and genetic counseling for patients and their relatives."

    "abstract": "Individuals with Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit an array of symptoms, including sociability deficits, increased anxiety, hyperactivity, and sensory hyperexcitability. It is unclear how endocannabinoid (eCB) modulation can be targeted to alleviate neurophysiological abnormalities in FXS as behavioral research reveals benefits to inhibiting cannabinoid (CB) receptor activation and increasing endocannabinoid ligand levels. Here, we hypothesize that enhancement of 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (2-AG) in Fragile X mental retardation 1 gene knock-out (Fmr1 KO) mice may reduce cortical hyperexcitability and behavioral abnormalities observed in FXS. To test whether an increase in 2-AG levels normalized cortical responses in a mouse model of FXS, animals were subjected to electroencephalography (EEG) recording and behavioral assessment following treatment with JZL-184, an irreversible inhibitor of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). Assessment of 2-AG was performed using lipidomic analysis in conjunction with various doses and time points post-administration of JZL-184. Baseline electrocortical activity and evoked responses to sound stimuli were measured using a 30-channel multielectrode array (MEA) in adult male mice before, 4 h, and 1 day post-intraperitoneal injection of JZL-184 or vehicle. Behavior assessment was done using the open field and elevated plus maze 4 h post-treatment. Lipidomic analysis showed that 8 mg/kg JZL-184 significantly increased the levels of 2-AG in the auditory cortex of both Fmr1 KO and WT mice 4 h post-treatment compared to vehicle controls. EEG recordings revealed a reduction in the abnormally enhanced baseline gamma-band power in Fmr1 KO mice and significantly improved evoked synchronization to auditory stimuli in the gamma-band range post-JZL-184 treatment. JZL-184 treatment also ameliorated anxiety-like and hyperactivity phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice. Overall, these results indicate that increasing 2-AG levels may serve as a potential therapeutic approach to normalize cortical responses and improve behavioral outcomes in FXS and possibly other ASDs."

However, current understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is based primarily on studies in the hippocampus and neocortex, where FXS defects have been corrected by inhibiting group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Here, we observe that activation, rather than inhibition, of mGluRs in the basolateral amygdala reverses impairments in a rat model of FXS. FXS rats exhibit deficient recall of auditory conditioned fear, which is accompanied by a range of in vitro and in vivo deficits in synaptic transmission and plasticity. We find presynaptic mGluR5 in the amygdala, activation of which reverses deficient synaptic transmission and plasticity, thereby restoring normal fear learning in FXS rats. This highlights the importance of modifying the prevailing mGluR-based framework for therapeutic strategies to include circuit-specific differences in FXS pathophysiology."

Differentiating these diseases are difficult because of the similarity in their clinical and radiological features. It is unclear that skin biopsy can distinguish NIID from FXTAS. We performed a skin biopsy in an FXTAS case with cognitive dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy without tremor, which was initially suspected to be NIID. The patient underwent neurological assessment and examinations, including laboratory tests, electrophysiologic test, imaging, skin biopsy, and genetic test. A brain MRI showed hyperintensity lesions along the corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in addition to middle cerebellar peduncle sign (MCP sign). We suspected NIID from the clinical picture and the radiological findings, and performed a skin biopsy. The skin biopsy specimen showed ubiquitin- and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions, suggesting NIID. However, a genetic analysis for NIID using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) revealed no expansion detected in the Notch 2 N-terminal like C (NOTCH2NLC) gene. We then performed genetic analysis for FXTAS using RP-PCR, which revealed a repeat CGG/GGC expansion in the FMRP translational regulator 1 (FMR1) gene. The number of repeats was 83. We finally diagnosed the patient with FXTAS rather than NIID. For the differential diagnosis of FXTAS and NIID, a skin biopsy alone is insufficient; instead, genetic analysis, is essential. Further investigations in additional cases based on genetic analysis are needed to elucidate the clinical and pathological differences between FXTAS and NIID."

    "abstract": "The X-linked <i>FMR1</i> gene contains a non-coding trinucleotide repeat in its 5' region that, in normal, healthy individuals contains 20-44 copies. Large expansions of this region (>200 copies) cause fragile X syndrome (FXS), but expansions of 55-199 copies (referred to as premutation alleles) predispose carriers to a neurodegenerative disease called fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). The cytopathological mechanisms underlying FXTAS are poorly understood, but abnormalities in mitochondrial function are believed to play a role. We previously reported that lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs, or lymphoblasts) of premutation carriers have elevated mitochondrial respiratory activities. In the carriers, especially those not clinically affected with FXTAS, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity was shown to be elevated. In the FXTAS patients, however, it was negatively correlated with brain white matter lesions, suggesting a protective role in the molecular mechanisms. Here, we report an enlarged and extended study of mitochondrial function and associated cellular stress-signaling pathways in lymphoblasts isolated from male and female premutation carriers, regardless of their clinical status, and healthy controls. The results confirmed the elevation of AMPK and mitochondrial respiratory activities and reduction in reactive O<sub>2</sub> species (ROS) levels in premutation cells and revealed for the first time that target of rapamycin complex I (TORC1) activities are reduced. Extensive correlation, multiple regression, and principal components analysis revealed the best fitting statistical explanations of these changes in terms of the other variables measured. These suggested which variables might be the most \"proximal\" regulators of the others in the extensive network of known causal interactions amongst the measured parameters of mitochondrial function and cellular stress signaling. In the resulting model, the premutation alleles activate AMPK and inhibit both TORC1 and ROS production, the reduced TORC1 activity contributes to activation of AMPK and of nonmitochondrial metabolism, and the higher AMPK activity results in elevated catabolic metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP steady state levels. In addition, the results suggest a separate CGG repeat number-dependent elevation of TORC1 activity that is insufficient to overcome the inhibition of TORC1 in premutation cells but may presage the previously reported activation of TORC1 in FXS cells."

Data recording was successfully completed for ERG and assessment of CS in most individuals from both cohorts demonstrating the feasibility of these methods for use in the FXS population. Similar to previously reported findings from the Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> genetic mouse model, individuals with FXS were found to exhibit reduced b-wave and flicker amplitude in ERG and an impaired ability to discriminate contrasts compared to healthy controls. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using ERG and CS for assessing visual deficits in FXS and establishes the translational validity of the Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> mice phenotype to individuals with FXS. By including electrophysiological and functional readouts, the results of this study suggest the utility of both ERG and CS (ERG-CS) as complementary translational biomarkers for characterizing sensory abnormalities found in FXS, with potential applications to the clinical development of novel therapeutics that target sensory function abnormalities to treat core symptomatology in FXS.

    "abstract": "Reduced structural and functional interhemispheric connectivity correlates with the severity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) behaviors in humans. Little is known of how ASD-risk genes regulate callosal connectivity. Here, we show that <i>Fmr1</i>, whose loss-of-function leads to Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), cell autonomously promotes maturation of callosal excitatory synapses between somatosensory barrel cortices in mice. Postnatal, cell-autonomous deletion of <i>Fmr1</i> in postsynaptic Layer (L) 2/3 or L5 neurons results in a selective weakening of AMPA receptor- (R), but not NMDA receptor-, mediated callosal synaptic function, indicative of immature synapses. Sensory deprivation by contralateral whisker trimming normalizes callosal input strength, suggesting that experience-driven activity of postsynaptic <i>Fmr1</i> KO L2/3 neurons weakens callosal synapses. In contrast to callosal inputs, synapses originating from local L4 and L2/3 circuits are normal, revealing an input-specific role for postsynaptic <i>Fmr1</i> in regulation of synaptic connectivity within local and callosal neocortical circuits. These results suggest direct cell autonomous and postnatal roles for FMRP in development of specific cortical circuits and suggest a synaptic basis for long-range functional underconnectivity observed in FXS patients."

FXTAS and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are late-onset neurodegenerative diseases that share overlapping cognitive deficits including processing speed, working memory and executive function. The prevalence of coexistent FXTAS-AD pathology remains unknown. The clinical picture in this case was marked with rapid cognitive decline between age 67 and 71 years in addition to remarkable MRI changes. Over the 16 months between the two clinical evaluations, the brain atrophied 4.12% while the lateral ventricles increased 26.4% and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volume increased 15.6%. Other regions atrophied substantially faster than the whole brain included the thalamus (-6.28%), globus pallidus (-10.95%), hippocampus (-6.95%), and amygdala (-7.58%). A detailed postmortem assessment included an MRI with confluent WMH and evidence of cerebral microbleeds (CMB). The histopathological study demonstrated FXTAS inclusions in neurons and astrocytes, a widespread presence of phosphorylated tau protein and, amyloid β plaques in cortical areas and the hippocampus. CMBs were noticed in the precentral gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, visual cortex, and brainstem. There were high amounts of iron deposits in the globus pallidus and the putamen consistent with MRI findings. We hypothesize that coexistent FXTAS-AD neuropathology contributed to the steep decline in cognitive abilities."

    "abstract": "Glycogen-synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a kinase mediating phosphorylation on serine and threonine amino acid residues of several target molecules. The enzyme is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes and aberrant activity of GSK3 has been linked to several disease conditions such as fragile X syndrome (FXS). Recent evidences demonstrating an increased activity of GSK3 in murine models of FXS, suggest that dysregulation/hyperactivation of the GSK3 path should contribute to FXS development. A likely possibility could be that in FXS there is a functional impairment of the upstream inhibitory input over GSK3 thus making overactive the kinase. Since GSK3 signaling is a central regulatory node for critical neurodevelopmental pathways, understanding the contribution of GSK3 dysregulation to FXS, may provide novel targets for therapeutic interventions for this disease. In this study we used AF3581, a potent GSK3 inhibitor that we recently discovered, in an in vivo FXS mouse model to elucidate the crucial role of GSK3 in specific behavioral patterns (locomotor activity, sensorimotor gating and social behavior) associated with this disease. All the behavioral alterations manifested by Fmr1 knockout mice were reverted after a chronic treatment with our GSK3 inhibitor, confirming the importance of this pathway as a therapeutic target."

    "abstract": "Few individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) successfully meet adult normative expectations in education, employment, peer relations, and habitation, although there is within-syndrome variability in this regard. The primary goal of this study was to determine whether expressive language skills contribute to the capacity for independent functioning in adulthood even after controlling for nonverbal cognitive ability. Participants were 18- to 23-year-olds with FXS. Expressive language was assessed using the psychometrically validated Expressive Language Sampling (ELS) conversation and narration procedures. The language produced was transcribed and analyzed to yield measures of expressive vocabulary, syntax, and intelligibility. Parents concurrently completed questionnaires on the independent functioning of the participants with FXS. All three ELS measures were significantly corelated with multiple measures of independence. The magnitudes of the correlations were reduced when nonverbal IQ was controlled through partial correlation. Nonetheless, many of the partial correlations were medium to large and several were statistically significant. Expressive language skills appear to contribute uniquely to the capacity for independence, although longitudinal data are needed to evaluate the possibility of a bidirectional relationship between these domains. Thus, language intervention may be a prerequisite for preparing youth with FXS for an independent adult life."

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a multifaceted condition associated with difficulties in social interaction and communication. It also shares several comorbidities with other neurodevelopmental conditions. Intensive research examining the molecular basis and characteristics of ASD has revealed an association with a large number and variety of low-penetrance genes. Many of the variants associated with ASD are in genes underlying pathways involved in long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD). These mechanisms then control the tuning of neuronal connections in response to experience by modifying and trafficking ionotropic glutamate receptors at the post-synaptic areas. Despite the high genetic heterogeneity in ASD, surface trafficking of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-Methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor is a vulnerable pathway in ASD. In this review, we discuss autism-related alterations in the trafficking of AMPA receptors, whose surface density and composition at the post-synapse determine the strength of the excitatory connection between neurons. We highlight genes associated with neurodevelopmental conditions that share the autism comorbidity, including Fragile X syndrome, Rett Syndrome, and Tuberous Sclerosis, as well as the autism-risk genes NLGNs, IQSEC2, DOCK4, and STXBP5, all of which are involved in regulating AMPAR trafficking to the post-synaptic surface."

Recent advances in clinical genetics have improved our understanding of genetic syndromes associated with ASD, which has helped clarify distinct etiologies of ASD and document syndrome-specific profiles of neurocognitive strengths and weaknesses. Pediatric neuropsychologists have the potential to be impactful members of the care team for children with genetic syndromes and their families. We provide a critical review of the current literature related to the neuropsychological profiles of children with four genetic syndromes associated with ASD, including Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), fragile X syndrome (FXS), 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and Angelman syndrome. Recommendations for assessment, intervention, and future directions are provided. There is vast heterogeneity in terms of the cognitive, language, and developmental abilities of these populations. The within- and across-syndrome variability characteristic of genetic syndromes should be carefully considered during clinical evaluations, including possible measurement limitations, presence of intellectual disability, and important qualitative differences in the ASD-phenotypes across groups. Individuals with genetic disorders pose challenging diagnostic and assessment questions. Pediatric neuropsychologists with expertise in neurodevelopmental processes are well suited to address these questions and identify profiles of neurocognitive strengths and weaknesses, tailor individualized recommendations, and provide diagnostic clarification."

    "abstract": "What are the chances of obtaining a healthy transferable cleavage-stage embryo according to the number of mature oocytes in fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1)-mutated or premutated females undergoing preimplantation genetic testing (PGT)? In our population, a cycle with seven or more mature oocytes has an 83% chance of obtaining one or more healthy embryos. PGT may be an option to achieve a pregnancy with a healthy baby for FMR1 mutation carriers. In addition, FMR1 premutation is associated with a higher risk of diminished ovarian reserve and premature ovarian failure. The number of metaphase II (MII) oocytes needed to allow the transfer of a healthy embryo following PGT has never been investigated. The study is a monocentric retrospective observational study carried out from January 2006 to January 2020 that is associated with a case-control study and that analyzes 38 FMR1 mutation female carriers who are candidates for PGT; 16 carried the FMR1 premutation and 22 had the full FMR1 mutation. A total of 95 controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) cycles for PGT for fragile X syndrome were analyzed, 49 in premutated patients and 46 in fully mutated women. Only patients aged ≤38 years with anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) >1 ng/ml and antral follicle count (AFC) >10 follicles were eligible for the PGT procedure. Each COS cycle of the FMR1-PGT group was matched with the COS cycles of partners of males carrying any type of translocation (ratio 1:3). Conditional logistic regression was performed to compare the COS outcomes. We then estimated the number of mature oocytes needed to obtain at least one healthy embryo after PGT using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Overall, in the FMR1-PGT group, the median number of retrieved and mature oocytes per cycle was 11 (interquartile range 7-15) and 9 (6-12), respectively. The COS outcomes of FMR1 premutation or full mutation female carriers were not altered compared with the matched COS cycles in partners of males carrying a balanced translocation in their karyotype. Among the 6 (4-10) Day 3 embryos obtained in the FMR1-PGT group, a median number of 3 (1-6) embryos were morphologically eligible for biopsy, leading to 1 (1-3) healthy embryo. A cutoff value of seven MII oocytes yielded a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 61% of having at least one healthy embryo, whereas a cutoff value of 10 MII oocytes led to a specificity of 85% and improved positive predictive value. This study is retrospective, analyzing a limited number of cycles. Moreover, the patients who were included in a fresh PGT cycle were selected on ovarian reserve parameters and show high values in ovarian reserve tests. This information could influence our conclusion. The results relate only to the target population of this study, with a correct ovarian reserve of AMH >1 and AFC >10. However, the information provided herein extends knowledge about the current state of COS for FMR1 mutation carriers in order to provide patients with proper counseling regarding the optimal number of oocytes needed to have a chance of transferring an unaffected embryo following PGT.

    "title": "Common Threads: Aphidicolin-Inducible and Folate-Sensitive Fragile Sites in the Human Genome.",
    "abstract": "The human genome has many chromosomal regions that are fragile, demonstrating chromatin breaks, gaps, or constrictions on exposure to replication stress. Common fragile sites (CFSs) are found widely distributed in the population, with the largest subset of these sites being induced by aphidicolin (APH). Other fragile sites are only found in a subset of the population. One group of these so-called rare fragile sites (RFSs) is induced by folate stress. APH-inducible CFSs are generally located in large transcriptionally active genes that are A + T rich and often enriched for tracts of AT-dinucleotide repeats. In contrast, all the folate-sensitive sites mapped to date consist of transcriptionally silenced CGG microsatellites. Thus, all the folate-sensitive fragile sites may have a very similar molecular basis that differs in key ways from that of the APH CFSs. The folate-sensitive FSs include FRAXA that is associated with Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common heritable form of intellectual disability. Both CFSs and RFSs can cause chromosomal abnormalities. Recent work suggests that both APH-inducible fragile sites and FRAXA undergo Mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS) when exposed to APH or folate stress, respectively. Interestingly, blocking MiDAS in both cases prevents chromosome fragility but increases the risk of chromosome mis-segregation. MiDAS of both APH-inducible and FRAXA involves conservative DNA replication and POLD3, an accessory subunit of the replicative polymerase Pol δ that is essential for break-induced replication (BIR). Thus, MiDAS is thought to proceed <i>via</i> some form of BIR-like process. This review will discuss the recent work that highlights the similarities and differences between these two groups of fragile sites and the growing evidence for the presence of many more novel fragile sites in the human genome."

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome is a neuro-developmental disorder caused by the silencing of the FMR1 gene, resulting in the loss of its protein product, FMRP. FMRP binds mRNA and represses general translation in the brain. Transcriptome analysis of the Fmr1-deficient mouse hippocampus reveals widespread dysregulation of alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs. Many of these aberrant splicing changes coincide with those found in post-mortem brain tissue from individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) as well as in mouse models of intellectual disability such as PTEN hamartoma syndrome (PHTS) and Rett Syndrome (RTT). These splicing changes could result from chromatin modifications (e.g., in FXS, RTT) and/or splicing factor alterations (e.g., PTEN, autism). Based on the identities of the RNAs that are mis-spliced in these disorders, it may be that they are at least partly responsible for some shared pathophysiological conditions. The convergence of splicing aberrations among these autism spectrum disorders might be crucial to understanding their underlying cognitive impairments."

In this study, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to reveal a specific pattern of brain activation and habituation in response to face stimuli in young girls with FXS, an important but understudied clinical population. Participants were 32 girls with FXS (age: 11.8 ± 2.9 years) and a control group of 28 girls without FXS (age: 10.5 ± 2.3 years) matched for age, general cognitive function, and autism symptoms. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to assess brain activation during a face habituation task including repeated upright/inverted faces and greeble (nonface) objects. Compared with the control group, girls with FXS showed significant hyperactivation in the frontopolar and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortices in response to all face stimuli (upright + inverted). Lack of neural habituation (and significant sensitization) was also observed in the FXS group in the frontopolar cortex in response to upright face stimuli. Finally, aberrant frontopolar sensitization in response to upright faces in girls with FXS was significantly correlated with notable cognitive-behavioral and social-emotional outcomes relevant to this condition, including executive function, autism symptoms, depression, and anxiety. These findings strongly support a hypothesis of neural hyperactivation and accentuated sensitization during face processing in FXS, a phenomenon that could be developed as a biomarker end point for improving treatment trial evaluation in girls with this condition."

However, due to a milder phenotype relative to males, females with fragile X syndrome are underrepresented in research studies. In the current study, we investigate neuroanatomical differences in young females (age range: 6.03-16.32 years) with fragile X syndrome (N = 46) as compared to age-, sex-, and verbal abilities-matched participants (comparison group; N = 35). Between-group analyses of whole-brain and regional brain volumes were assessed using voxel-based morphometry. Results demonstrate significantly larger total gray and white matter volumes in girls with fragile X syndrome compared to a matched comparison group (Ps < 0.001). In addition, the fragile X group showed significantly larger gray matter volume in a bilateral parieto-occipital cluster and a right parieto-occipital cluster (Ps < 0.001). Conversely, the fragile X group showed significantly smaller gray matter volume in the bilateral gyrus rectus (P < 0.03). Associations between these regional brain volumes and key socio-emotional variables provide insight into gene-brain-behavior relationships underlying the fragile X syndrome phenotype in females. These findings represent the first characterization of a neuroanatomical phenotype in a large sample of girls with fragile X syndrome and expand our knowledge about potential neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying cognitive-behavioral outcomes in this condition."

We describe a maternally transmitted PM (77 CGG) that was passed to a son (103 CGG), and to a daughter (220-1822 CGG), who were affected with FXTAS and FXS, respectively. The male with the PM showed low-level mosaicism for normal size of 30 and 37 CGG. This male had two offspring: one female mosaic for PM and FM (56, 157, >200 CGG) and another with only a 37 CGG allele detected in multiple tissues, neither with a clinical phenotype. The female with the 37 CGG allele showed normal levels of FMR1 methylation and mRNA and passed this 37 CGG allele to one of her daughters, who was also unaffected. These findings show that post-zygotic paternal retraction can lead to low-level mosaicism for normal size alleles, with these normal alleles being functional when passed over two generations."

CGG repeat RNAs sequester RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) into nuclear foci and undergo repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation into toxic peptides. To identify proteins involved in these processes, we employed a CGG repeat RNA-tagging system to capture repeat-associated RBPs by mass spectrometry in mammalian cells. We identified several SR (serine/arginine-rich) proteins that interact selectively with CGG repeats basally and under cellular stress. These proteins modify toxicity in a Drosophila model of FXTAS. Pharmacologic inhibition of serine/arginine protein kinases (SRPKs), which alter SRSF protein phosphorylation, localization, and activity, directly inhibits RAN translation of CGG and GGGGCC repeats (associated with C9orf72 ALS/FTD) and triggers repeat RNA retention in the nucleus. Lowering SRPK expression suppressed toxicity in both FXTAS and C9orf72 ALS/FTD model flies, and SRPK inhibitors suppressed CGG repeat toxicity in rodent neurons. Together, these findings demonstrate roles for CGG repeat RNA binding proteins in RAN translation and repeat toxicity and support further evaluation of SRPK inhibitors in modulating RAN translation associated with repeat expansion disorders."

The interaction between eIF4E and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) is crucial for the assembly of the translational machinery, the initial step of mRNA translation. A well-characterized group of proteins, named 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), inhibits the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction by competing for the same binding site on the eIF4E surface. 4E-BPs and eIF4G share a single canonical motif for the interaction with a conserved hydrophobic patch of eIF4E. However, a second non-canonical and not conserved binding motif was recently detected for eIF4G and several 4E-BPs. Here, we review the structural features of the interaction between eIF4E and its molecular partners eIF4G and 4E-BPs, focusing on the implications of the recent structural and biochemical evidence for the development of new therapeutic strategies.

Individuals with ID exhibit deficits in intelligence, impaired adaptive behavior and often visual impairments. Cytoplasmic fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1)-interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2) is an interacting partner of the FMR protein, whose loss results in fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited cause of ID. Recently, CYFIP2 variants have been found in patients with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, developmental delay and ID. Such individuals often exhibit visual impairments; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of Cyfip2 in retinal and visual functions by generating and analyzing Cyfip2 conditional knockout (CKO) mice. While we found no major differences in the layer structures and cell compositions between the control and Cyfip2 CKO retinas, a subset of genes associated with the transporter and channel activities was differentially expressed in Cyfip2 CKO retinas than in the controls. Multi-electrode array recordings showed more sustained and stronger responses to positive flashes of the ON ganglion cells in the Cyfip2 CKO retina than in the controls, although electroretinogram analysis revealed that Cyfip2 deficiency unaffected the photoreceptor and ON bipolar cell functions. Furthermore, analysis of initial and late phase optokinetic responses demonstrated that Cyfip2 deficiency impaired the visual function at the organismal level. Together, our results shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying the visual impairments observed in individuals with CYFIP2 variants and, more generally, in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, including ID."

As both the presence of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and atrophied gray matter on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are linked to age-dependent decline in cognition, here we tested whether MRI outcomes (WMH volume (WMHV) and brain volume) were correlated with mitochondrial bioenergetics from peripheral blood monocytic cells in 87 carriers with and without FXTAS. As a parameter assessing cumulative damage, WMHV was correlated to both FXTAS stages and age, and brain volume discriminated between carriers and non-carriers. Similarly, mitochondrial mass and ATP production showed an age-dependent decline across all participants, but in contrast to WMHV, only FADH<sub>2</sub>-linked ATP production was significantly reduced in carriers vs. non-carriers. In carriers, WMHV negatively correlated with ATP production sustained by glucose-glutamine and FADH<sub>2</sub>-linked substrates, whereas brain volume was positively associated with the latter and mitochondrial mass. The observed correlations between peripheral mitochondrial bioenergetics and MRI findings-and the lack of correlations with FXTAS diagnosis/stages-may stem from early brain bioenergetic deficits even before overt FXTAS symptoms and/or imaging findings."

Expansion can result in neurodegeneration, ovarian dysfunction, or intellectual disability depending on the number of repeats in the expanded allele. A growing body of evidence suggests that the mutational mechanisms responsible for many REDs share several common features. It is also increasingly apparent that in some of these diseases the pathologic consequences of expansion may arise in similar ways. It has long been known that many of the disease-associated repeats form unusual DNA and RNA structures.

Absence of <i>FMR1</i> protein (FMRP), important for synaptic development and maintenance, gives rise to the neurodevelopmental disorder. There is, at present, no therapeutic approach that directly reverses the loss of FMRP; however, there is an increasing number of potential treatments that target the pathways dysregulated in FXS, including those that address the enhanced activity of the mGluR5 pathway and deficits in GABA pathways. Based on studies of targeted therapeutics to date, the prospects are good for one or more effective therapies for FXS in the near future."

    "title": "Prevalence of Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome in Patients with Cerebellar Ataxia in Japan.",
    "abstract": "The presence of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) premutation has been linked to patients with a certain type of cerebellar ataxia, the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). However, its prevalence in Japan has yet to be clarified. The aim of the present study is to determine the prevalence of FXTAS in Japanese patients with cerebellar ataxia and to describe their clinical characteristics. DNA samples were collected from 1328 Japanese patients with cerebellar ataxia, referred for genetic diagnosis. Among them, 995 patients with negative results for the most common spinocerebellar ataxia subtypes were screened for FMR1 premutation. Comprehensive clinical and radiological analyses were performed for the patients harbouring FMR1 premutation. We herein identified FMR1 premutation from one female and two male patients, who satisfied both clinical and radiological criteria of FXTAS (0.3%; 3/995) as well. Both male patients presented with high signal intensity of corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, a finding comparable to that of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease. The female patient mimicked multiple system atrophy in the early stages of her disease and developed aseptic meningitis with a suspected immune-mediated mechanism after the onset of FXTAS, which made her unique. Despite the lower prevalence rate in Japan than the previous reports in other countries, the present study emphasises the necessity to consider FXTAS with undiagnosed ataxia, regardless of men or women, particularly for those cases presenting with similar clinical and radiological findings with multiple system atrophy or neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease."

    "abstract": "Does a genetic condition underlie the diagnosis of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) in a 21-year-old woman with primary amenorrhoea? A karyotype and genetic testing for Fragile X syndrome was undertaken. A next-generation sequencing panel of 24 genes associated with syndromal and non-syndromal POI was conducted. A nonsense variant c.1336G>T, p.(Glu446Ter) and whole gene deletion in STAG3 were identified. Biallelic loss of function variants in STAG3 are associated with primary ovarian failure type 8 and are a rare cause of POI."

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a neurodevelopmental disorder with no known cure, is caused by a lack of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). As a single-gene disorder, FXS is an excellent candidate for viral-vector-based gene therapy, although that is complicated by the existence of multiple isoforms of FMRP, whose individual cellular functions are unknown. We studied the effects of rat and mouse orthologs of human isoform 17, a major expressed isoform of FMRP. Injection of neonatal <i>Fmr1</i> knockout rats and mice with adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV9 serotype) under the control of an MeCP2 mini-promoter resulted in widespread distribution of the FMRP transgenes throughout the telencephalon and diencephalon. Transgene expression occurred mainly in non-GABAergic neurons, with little expression in glia. Early postnatal treatment resulted in partial rescue of the <i>Fmr1</i> KO rat phenotype, including improved social dominance in treated <i>Fmr1</i> KO females and partial rescue of locomotor activity in males. Electro-encephalogram (EEG) recordings showed correction of abnormal slow-wave activity during the sleep-like state in male <i>Fmr1</i> KO rats. These findings support the use of AAV-based gene therapy as a treatment for FXS and specifically demonstrate the potential therapeutic benefit of human FMRP isoform 17 orthologs."

    "title": "Metabolomic Biomarkers Are Associated With Area of the Pons in Fragile X Premutation Carriers at Risk for Developing FXTAS.",
    "abstract": "Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and cognition in male and female carriers of a premutation allele (55-200 CGG repeats; PM) in the fragile X mental retardation (<i>FMR1</i>) gene. It is currently unknown how the observed brain changes are associated with metabolic signatures in individuals who develop the disorder over time. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between longitudinal changes in the brain (area of the pons, midbrain, and MCP width) and the changes in the expression level of metabolic biomarkers of early diagnosis and progression of FXTAS in PM who, as part of an ongoing longitudinal study, emerged into two distinct categories. These included those who developed symptoms of FXTAS (converters, CON) at subsequent visits and those who did not meet the criteria of diagnosis (non-converters, NCON) and were compared to age-matched healthy controls (HC). We assessed CGG repeat allele size by Southern Blot and PCR analysis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs) acquisition was obtained on a 3T Siemens Trio scanner and metabolomic profile was obtained by ultra-performance liquid chromatography, accurate mass spectrometer, and an Orbitrap mass analyzer. Our findings indicate that differential metabolite levels are linked with the area of the pons between healthy control and premutation groups. More specifically, we observed a significant association of ceramides and mannonate metabolites with a decreased area of the pons, both at visit 1 (V1) and visit 2 (V2) only in the CON as compared to the NCON group suggesting their potential role in the development of the disorder. In addition, we found a significant correlation of these metabolic signatures with the FXTAS stage at V2 indicating their contribution to the progression and pathogenesis of FXTAS. Interestingly, these metabolites, as part of lipid and sphingolipid lipids pathways, provide evidence of the role that their dysregulation plays in the development of FXTAS and inform us as potential targets for personalized therapeutic development."

    "title": "Genetic and Environmental Contributions to Autism Spectrum Disorder Through Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin.",
    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects an individual's reciprocal social interaction and communication ability. Numerous genetic and environmental conditions are associated with ASD, including tuberous sclerosis complex, phosphatase and tensin homolog hamartoma tumor syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and neurofibromatosis 1. The pathogenic molecular mechanisms of these diseases are integrated into the hyperactivation of mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1). Rodent models of these diseases have shown high mTORC1 activity in the brain and ASD-related behavioral deficits, which were reversed by the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. Environmental stress can also affect this signaling pathway. In utero exposure to valproate caused ASD in offspring and enhanced mTORC1 activity in the brain, which was sensitive to mTORC1 inhibition. mTORC1 is a signaling hub for diverse cellular functions, including protein synthesis, through the phosphorylation of its targets, such as ribosomal protein S6 kinases. Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5-mediated synaptic function is also affected by the dysregulation of mTORC1 activity, such as in fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis complex. Reversing these downstream changes that are associated with mTORC1 activation normalizes behavioral defects in rodents. Despite abundant preclinical evidence, few clinical studies have investigated the treatment of ASD and cognitive deficits. Therapeutics other than mTORC1 inhibitors failed to show efficacy in fragile X syndrome and neurofibromatosis 1. mTORC1 inhibitors have been tested mainly in tuberous sclerosis complex, and their effects on ASD and neuropsychological deficits are promising. mTORC1 is a promising target for the pharmacological treatment of ASD associated with mTORC1 activation."

    "title": "The Spectrum of the Prader-Willi-like Pheno- and Genotype: A Review of the Literature.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic syndrome, caused by the loss of expression of the paternal chromosome 15q11-q13 region. Over the past years, many cases of patients with characteristics similar to PWS, but without a typical genetic aberration of the 15q11-q13 region, have been described. These patients are often labelled as Prader-Willi-like (PWL). PWL is an as-yet poorly defined syndrome, potentially affecting a significant number of children and adults. In the current clinical practice, patients labelled as PWL are mostly left without treatment options. Considering the similarities with PWS, children with PWL might benefit from the same care and treatment as children with PWS. This review gives more insight into the pheno- and genotype of PWL and includes 86 papers, containing 368 cases of patients with a PWL phenotype. We describe mutations and aberrations for consideration when suspicion of PWS remains after negative testing. The most common genetic diagnoses were Temple syndrome (formerly known as maternal uniparental disomy 14), Schaaf-Yang syndrome (truncating mutation in the MAGEL2 gene), 1p36 deletion, 2p deletion, 6q deletion, 6q duplication, 15q deletion, 15q duplication, 19p deletion, fragile X syndrome, and Xq duplication. We found that the most prevalent symptoms in the entire group were developmental delay/intellectual disability (76%), speech problems (64%), overweight/obesity (57%), hypotonia (56%), and psychobehavioral problems (53%). In addition, we propose a diagnostic approach to patients with a PWL phenotype for (pediatric) endocrinologists. PWL comprises a complex and diverse group of patients, which calls for multidisciplinary care with an individualized approach."

    "abstract": "Profilins are small actin binding proteins, which are structurally conserved throughout evolution. They are probably best known to promote and direct actin polymerization. However, they also participate in numerous cell biological processes beyond the roles typically ascribed to the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, most complex organisms express several profilin isoforms. Their cellular functions are far from being understood, whereas a growing number of publications indicate that profilin isoforms are involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases. In this review, we will provide an overview of the profilin family and \"typical\" profilin properties including the control of actin dynamics. We will then discuss the profilin isoforms of higher animals in detail. In terms of cellular functions, we will focus on the role of Profilin 1 (PFN1) and Profilin 2a (PFN2a), which are co-expressed in the central nervous system. Finally, we will discuss recent findings that link PFN1 and PFN2a to neurological diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Huntington's disease and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)."

    "title": "Is <i>FMR1</i> CGG Repeat Number Polymorphism Associated With Phenotypic Variation in the General Population? Report From a Cohort of 5,499 Adults.",
    "abstract": "<i>FMR1</i> CGG repeat length was assayed in 5499 research participants (2637 men and 2862 women) in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS), a population-based cohort. Most past research has focused on clinically-ascertained individuals with expansions in CGG repeats, either those with fragile X syndrome (> 200 CGG repeats), the <i>FMR1</i> premutation (55-200 repeats), or in the gray zone (variously defined as 45-54 or 41-54 repeats). In contrast, the WLS is a unique source of data that was obtained from an unselected cohort of individuals from the general population for whom <i>FMR1</i> CGG repeat length was assayed. The WLS is a random sample of one-third of all high school seniors in the state of Wisconsin in 1957. The most recent round of data collection was in 2011; thus, the study spanned over 50 years. Saliva samples were obtained from 69% of surviving members of the cohort in 2008 and 2011, from which CGG repeats were assayed. With one exception, the CGG repeat length of all members of this cohort was below 100 (ranging from 7 to 84). The present study evaluated the genotype-phenotype associations of CGG repeat number and IQ, college graduation, age at menopause, number of biological children, having a child with intellectual or developmental disabilities, and the likelihood of experiencing an episode of depression during adulthood. Linear and curvilinear effects were probed. Although effect sizes were small, significant associations were found between CGG repeat length and high school IQ score, college graduation, number of biological children, age at menopause, and the likelihood of having an episode of depression. However, there was no significant association between repeat length and having a child diagnosed with an IDD condition. This study demonstrates a continuum of phenotype effects with <i>FMR1</i> repeat lengths and illustrates how research inspired by a rare genetic condition (such as fragile X syndrome) can be used to probe genotype-phenotype associations in the general population."

    "abstract": "Abnormal trinucleotide expansions cause rare disorders that compromise quality of life and, in some cases, lifespan. In particular, the expansions of the CGG-repeats stretch at the 5'-UTR of the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (<i>FMR1</i>) gene have pleiotropic effects that lead to a variety of Fragile X-associated syndromes: the neurodevelopmental Fragile X syndrome (FXS) in children, the late-onset neurodegenerative disorder Fragile X-associated tremor-ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) that mainly affects adult men, the Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) in adult women, and a variety of psychiatric and affective disorders that are under the term of Fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (FXAND). In this review, we will describe the pathological mechanisms of the adult \"gain-of-function\" syndromes that are mainly caused by the toxic actions of CGG RNA and FMRpolyG peptide. There have been intensive attempts to identify reliable peripheral biomarkers to assess disease progression and onset of specific pathological traits. Mitochondrial dysfunction, altered miRNA expression, endocrine system failure, and impairment of the GABAergic transmission are some of the affectations that are susceptible to be tracked using peripheral blood for monitoring of the motor, cognitive, psychiatric and reproductive impairment of the CGG-expansion carriers. We provided some illustrative examples from our own cohort. Understanding the association between molecular pathogenesis and biomarkers dynamics will improve effective prognosis and clinical management of CGG-expansion carriers."

Retrospective survey data from the <i>Fragile X Syndrome Nutrition Study</i>, which included data on infant feeding and caregiver-reported developmental milestones for 190 children with fragile X syndrome enrolled in the Fragile X Online Registry with Accessible Database (FORWARD), were analyzed. Exploratory, sex-specific associations were found linking the use of soy-based infant formula with worse autistic behaviors related to language in females and self-injurious behavior in males. These findings prompt prospective evaluation of the effects of soy-based infant formula on disease comorbidities in fragile X syndrome, a rare disorder for which newborn screening could be implemented if there was an intervention. Gastrointestinal problems were the most common reason cited for switching to soy-based infant formula. Thus, these findings also support the study of early gastrointestinal problems in fragile X syndrome, which may underly the development and severity of disease comorbidities. In conjunction with comorbidity data from the previous analyses of the <i>Fragile X Syndrome Nutrition Study</i>, the findings indicate that premutation fragile X mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed."

    "title": "<i>FMR1</i> and Autism, an Intriguing Connection Revisited.",
    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) represents a distinct phenotype of behavioral dysfunction that includes deficiencies in communication and stereotypic behaviors. ASD affects about 2% of the US population. It is a highly heritable spectrum of conditions with substantial genetic heterogeneity. To date, mutations in over 100 genes have been reported in association with ASD phenotypes. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common single-gene disorder associated with ASD. The gene associated with FXS, <i>FMR1</i> is located on chromosome X. Accordingly, the condition has more severe manifestations in males. FXS results from the loss of function of <i>FMR1</i> due to the expansion of an unstable CGG repeat located in the 5'' untranslated region of the gene. About 50% of the FXS males and 20% of the FXS females meet the Diagnostic Statistical Manual 5 (DSM-5) criteria for ASD. Among the individuals with ASD, about 3% test positive for FXS. FMRP, the protein product of <i>FMR1</i>, is a major gene regulator in the central nervous system. Multiple pathways regulated by FMRP are found to be dysfunctional in ASD patients who do not have FXS. Thus, FXS presents the opportunity to study cellular phenomena that may have wider applications in the management of ASD and to develop new strategies for ASD therapy."

This study is part of a larger investigation conducted at the Hospital Parc Tauli in Sabadell. The sample consists of a total of 40 girls (26 with FXS and 14 control) aged 7-16 years, who were administered different neuropsychological tests (WISC-V, NEPSY-II, WCST, TOL) and questionnaires answered by teachers (ABAS-II, BRIEF 2, ADHD Rating Scale). The results show that there is a greater interaction between some areas of executive function (cognitive flexibility, auditory attention, and visual abstraction capacity) and certain areas of adaptive behavior (conceptual, practical, social, and total domains) in the FXS group than in the control group. These results suggest that an alteration in the executive functions was affecting the daily functioning of the girls with FXS to a greater extent."
