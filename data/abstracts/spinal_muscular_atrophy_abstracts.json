    "title": "Identifying Clinical Measures Related to Falls in Ambulatory Patients with Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy.",
    "abstract": "Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset, X-linked, progressive neuromuscular disease caused by abnormal CAG trinucleotide expansion in the androgen receptor gene. Patients with SBMA report difficulty with falls on self-reported activities of daily living scales. To our knowledge, no study has examined the relationship between falls and common clinical measures of strength, balance, mobility, and disease biomarkers. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of an SBMA cohort. The objectives of this study are as follows: (1) compare demographics, clinical measures, and biomarkers between patients who did and did not fall; (2) determine which measures best discriminate fallers from non-fallers; and (3) identify cutoff scores to detect patients with a higher fall risk. Cross-sectional analysis was used. Disease biomarkers included blood serum creatinine, and clinical measures included the Timed Up and Go (TUG), the Adult Myopathy Assessment Tool (AMAT), and posturography, including the Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance and the Motor Control Test. The Maximal Voluntary Isometric Contractions (MVICs) of four lower extremity muscles were captured via fixed-frame dynamometry. We identified three clinical measures that help detect fall risk in people with SBMA. A post hoc receiver operating characteristic curve analysis helped identify cut scores for each test. Impairments of mobility (TUG > 8 s), muscle endurance (AMAT endurance subscale < 14), and muscle strength (ankle plantar flexion MVIC < 45% of predicted) were different between fallers and non-fallers, via independent <i>t</i>-tests. These three clinical tests can help detect fall risk that may help clinicians implement gait aid use or other fall prevention strategies before catastrophic falls occur."

    "title": "Evaluation of Sensory and Motor Function in Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy Using Quiet Stance and Reactive Postural Control.",
    "abstract": "Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness, along with muscle cramps, tremors, and sensory neuropathy. Previous research has shown that patients with SBMA have difficulty with dynamic balance and sensory postural control during quiet stance. There have been no reports on automatic postural reactions in SBMA. In this study, we aimed (1) to augment previous findings of sensory postural control, (2) to investigate automatic postural reactions in SBMA, and (3) to explore the relationship between strength and balance. A cross-sectional design was used for the analysis. The participants were fifty male individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SBMA. Balance testing included the NeuroCom modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (mCTSIB), which measures sway velocity during quiet stance, and the NeuroCom Motor Control Test (MCT), which measures the latency and strength of postural reactions following sudden perturbations. Strength testing included maximal voluntary isometric contractions measured via fixed-frame dynamometry. Forty-seven out of fifty participants were able to complete the mCTSIB test, but only thirty-eight completed the MCT test. Patients who were unable to complete the MCT were significantly weaker in all lower extremity muscles compared to those who were able to complete testing. Compared to normative data, participants showed significantly higher sway velocity during quiet stance across all conditions of the mCTSIB, except when standing on foam with eyes open. They also exhibited significantly slower postural reactions in response to sudden shifts of the force plate on the MCT. Plantarflexor weakness was significantly correlated with poor postural control on the mCTSIB and MCT. This study confirms previously reported abnormalities of sensory postural control in SBMA and highlights patients' heavy reliance on visual inputs for postural control. Additionally, this study shows that automatic postural corrections are slower than normal in SBMA and provides a unique approach for measuring the combined sensory and motor components of the disease. Both the sensory and automatic balance abnormalities were found to be associated with plantarflexor weakness and may contribute to a higher risk of falls under challenging situations. Therefore, addressing this weakness may be an important step toward fall prevention in this population."

    "title": "Wearable-Derived Patterns of Performance Fatigability During Gait in Spinal Muscular Atrophy.",
    "abstract": "Despite disease-modifying therapies, fatigability persists in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Performance fatigability (PF) during the six-minute walk test (6MWT) is mostly unchanged in treated SMA. This cross-sectional study characterized PF using instrumented insoles. Ambulatory individuals with SMA (n = 14) and controls (HC) (n = 10) were included. Spatiotemporal and kinetic parameters were collected with custom-engineered instrumented insoles during the 6MWT. Linear mixed models analyzed parameter trends, with trend slope representing PF. Changes in mean velocity (Vavg) and stride-by-stride parameters were compared between minute 1 and 6 and between groups. Decreases in Vavg were greatest for severe SMA (p < 0.001). Changes were found in stride length (SL) (p = 0.048) and stride velocity (SV) (p = 0.030) for severe SMA, and in stance phase (%St) (p = 0.012) and percent terminal double support (%DS) (p = 0.02) for mild SMA. SMA subgroups showed downward trends from minute 1 to 6 in SL, SV, and anterior-posterior center of pressure (AP-COP) (p < 0.001), and increases in Absolute COP-Cyclogram Asymmetry Index (|ASI|) (p < 0.05). Trends differed between severe SMA and other groups for SL, SV, %St, and %DS (p < 0.001), and for AP-COP and |ASI| (p < 0.05). Trends for SL (p < 0.001), SV and AP-COP (p < 0.01) differed between HC and mild SMA. PF in SMA manifests as changes in gait parameters. Instrumented insoles revealed fatigue-related changes not captured with the conventional method of comparing the first and last minutes of the 6MWT. Spatiotemporal and kinetic parameters contribute to understanding of impairments and inform therapeutic development. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04193085."

This exploratory study investigated the potential of quantitative SC magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a biomarker for monitoring treatment-related changes in pediatric and adult SMA patients treated with nusinersen at different disease stages. Five pediatric and three adult SMA patients underwent clinical assessments, including the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) and Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), along with SC MRI at multiple time points (TPs) during nusinersen treatment. At each TP, total cross-sectional area (TCA), grey matter area (GM<sub>area</sub>), and magnetization transfer saturation (MT<sub>sat</sub>) were measured at multiple cervical SC levels. All pediatric patients showed a progressive increase in SC TCA and GM<sub>area</sub> over time, paralleled by improvements in HFMSE and RULM scores. In contrast, adult patients exhibited stable SC MRI measures with modest functional gains. MT<sub>sat</sub> values remained largely stable across time points, with a mild decrease observed at TP5. TCA and GM<sub>area</sub> showed positive association trends with clinical scales. Nusinersen showed beneficial effects in both adult and pediatric SMA patients, with more marked improvements in children. Quantitative SC MRI metrics, especially TCA and GM<sub>area</sub>, reflected clinical trends and may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for monitoring treatment effects, pending validation in larger cohorts."

    "abstract": "In advanced stages of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), established motor scores are unable to distinguish between the different degrees of remaining motor function. Bulbar muscles are affected at a later stage. The aim of the present study was to test whether oral function tests are able to better discriminate motor function than established scores and to replicate known associations between disease-related altered craniofacial anatomy and oral dysfunction in SMA. A total of 43 adult individuals with SMA (mean age 39.7 ± 12; 25 men, 18 women) were included in this prospective, cross-sectional study. Oral function was measured using a piezoelectric sensor system and an Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI) device. Data from oral function tests and established motor scores were analyzed with regard to a possible floor or ceiling effect. It was tested to what extent SMA patients with different malocclusions presented with variable scores. Patients differed in ambulatory and treatment status (15 ambulatory vs. 28 nonambulatory; 35 treated vs. 8 nontreated) and orthodontic findings (22 with a class II molar relationship and increased overjet, 35 with posterior crossbite). In contrast to the oral function tests, some of the established motor scores showed a clear floor effect. Statistically significant associations were identified between reduced oral function values and an enlarged overjet, a class II molar relationship, and a posterior crossbite. This should be taken into account in neuromuscular evaluations. In severely affected patients, oral function tests appear to be superior to established motor scores and fill a diagnostic gap in research and clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. To elucidate the cell type-specific temporal gene expression in SBMA, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on the spinal cords of an SBMA mouse model (AR-97Q). Among all cell types, oligodendrocytes had the highest number of differentially expressed genes before disease onset. Analysis of oligodendrocyte clusters suggested that pathways associated with cation channels and synaptic function were activated before disease onset, with increased output from oligodendrocytes to neurons in AR-97Q mice compared with wild-type mice. These changes in the early stages were abrogated at the advanced stages. An oligodendrocyte model of SBMA showed phenotypes similar to those of AR-97Q mice at early stages, such as increased transcriptional changes in synapse organization, and Ca2+ imaging of oligodendrocytes in AR-97Q mice revealed the increased Ca2+ responses. A coculture system of primary rat oligodendrocytes and neurons revealed that the mutant AR in oligodendrocytes affected the activity and synchronization of neurons. These findings suggest that dysregulated cell-to-cell communication plays a critical role in early SBMA pathology and that synaptic or ion channel-related proteins, such as contactin associated protein 2 (Cntnap2) and NALCN channel auxiliary factor 1 (Fam155a), are potential therapeutic targets for SBMA."

    "title": "Mortality Associated With Viral Bronchiolitis in a Pediatric Department: A Retrospective Analysis.",
    "abstract": "In Morocco, acute viral bronchiolitis remains a major public health problem, and its incidence continues to rise. Acute viral bronchiolitis can be severe and even fatal, especially in vulnerable populations. The objectives of this study were to analyze the causes of death due to viral bronchiolitis and to highlight the importance of prophylaxis in high-risk groups. This was a retrospective, descriptive study spanning 11 years and 11 months, from January 1, 2013, to December 10, 2024. We included all cases of acute bronchiolitis complicated by infant death. The study focused on infants aged one to 24 months who presented with acute bronchitis. During the study period, 32 cases of viral bronchiolitis resulted in death during hospitalization. The average age of patients was five months and 15 days, with a male predominance. The average duration between the onset of symptoms and death was seven days, ranging from 24 hours to 30 days. The risk factors included male sex (n=20, 62.5%), passive smoking (n=17, 53.1%), young age (n=16, 50%), and preterm infancy (n=4, 12.5%). Comorbidities were found in 25 (78%) cases, including 19 (59.4%) of congenital heart disease, one (3.12%) of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, one (3.12%) of spinal muscular atrophy, one (3.12%) of hypopituitarism, one (3.12%) of ichthyosis, and one (3.12%) of polymalformative syndrome. The primary causes of death were congenital heart diseases, including ventricular septal defect (n=5, 15.62%), dilated cardiomyopathy (n=3, 9.37%), complex congenital heart disease (n=1, 3.12%), double outlet right ventricle (n=1, 3.12%), and tetralogy of Fallot (n=1, 3.12%). The average duration of hospitalization was five days, ranging from one hour to 15 days. All patients required intensive care, but they could not be transferred due to the lack of available beds, leading to mortality. Conclusion: Infants born prematurely with chronic lung disease or with decompensated congenital heart disease are at increased risk of severe acute bronchiolitis, particularly due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This risk underscores the importance of prophylaxis with anti-RSV monoclonal antibodies."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a leading genetic cause of infant mortality worldwide, is caused by reduced levels of the ubiquitous survival motor neuron (SMN) protein in SMA patients. Despite significant advancement in recent research and clinical treatments, the cellular pathologies that underlie SMA disease manifestations are not well characterized beyond those of spinal motor neurons (MNs). We previously reported cerebellar abnormalities in an SMA mouse model at the late stage of the disease, including volumetric deficits and lobule-selective structural changes with Purkinje cell degeneration, with colocalized astrocytic reactivity. However, when these cerebellar defects arise and whether they are a consequence of MN degeneration remain unknown. We used magnetic resonance imaging, immunohistochemistry, and electrophysiology to characterize cerebellar pathology in early-stage symptomatic SMNΔ7 mice and late-stage SMA mice with transgenic rescue of SMN in MNs. We found disproportionate structural and lobule-specific surface area deficits, as well as abnormal functional properties in the cerebella of early symptomatic SMA mice, suggesting that cerebellar pathologies may be a primary contributor to murine SMA phenotypes. Moreover, cerebellar pathologies were not ameliorated in SMA mice with MN rescue, suggesting that cerebellar neurons are independently vulnerable to reduced SMN expression. Overall, our study shows that cerebellar defects are a primary pathology in SMA mouse models and that therapies targeting cerebellar neurons in SMA patients may be needed for optimal treatment outcomes."

    "abstract": "With multiple disease-modifying therapies now available, treatment switching has become an important clinical consideration in the management of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). While some switches are prompted by suboptimal clinical response, more commonly they are driven by treatment burden, convenience, or adverse events. This systematic literature review aimed to synthesize existing evidence on therapy switching in SMA, focusing on clinical effectiveness and practical implications to support evidence-informed decision-making in a rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape. The review followed PRISMA guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024600221). A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Global Health and Embase was conducted between 11 and 14 October 2024. Eligible studies included clinical trials and real-world evidence (RWE) reports describing patients with genetically confirmed SMA who received nusinersen or risdiplam and subsequently switched to nusinersen, risdiplam or onasemnogene abeparvovec. Four studies met the inclusion criteria-three RWE studies and one clinical trial. The variability in measures of central tendency and variability among studies precluded the calculation of pooled summary values. Nonetheless, switching treatments was generally associated with stable motor function, with some improvements reported in selected outcome measures; ventilatory and nutritional support requirements remained largely unchanged. However, long-term outcomes and standardized data were limited. Future research should prioritize robust RWE and post-marketing surveillance to evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness, incorporate standardized switching protocols, and account for SMA genotype-phenotype variation."

A case series study, including children (aged 10 months to 5 years) with severe motor disabilities, was conducted. Each child received a customized adaptation of an electric toy car, modified to meet their specific postural and motor needs. The \"Assessment of Learning Powered Mobility\" 2.0 (ALP 2.0) tool was employed to track learning progress during weekly training sessions conducted in the children's natural environments with family involvement. Nine children successfully completed the study protocol. By week 8, all participants had reached at least level 6 on the ALP 2.0 tool, demonstrating significant improvement in driving ability. Adaptations were refined for two children during the study due to improvements in handling skills. Personalized adaptations and training in familiar environments enhance independent mobility and participation in children with SMA with two copies of SMN2. The findings suggest that neither initial motor skills nor the type of adaptation required limits progress. This study underscores the importance of early powered mobility interventions and highlights the need for further research to optimize training and adaptation strategies for young children with motor impairments."

    "abstract": "RNA therapeutics present a disruptive technology that has changed the drug discovery and manufacturing landscape, which established itself more prominently upon the recent COVID-19 pandemic. RNA therapeutics encompass diverse molecules like antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), RNA aptamers, and messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which can function through different mechanisms. RNA therapeutics are witnessing expanding applications across a range of diseases, notably in the treatment of neurological disorders. For instance, ASO therapies like nusinersen for spinal muscular atrophy and eteplirsen for Duchenne muscular dystrophy exemplify successful RNA therapeutic strategies. Emerging ASO treatments for Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are also promising, with ongoing clinical trials demonstrating significant reductions in disease-associated proteins. Still, delivery of these molecules remains a pivotal challenge in RNA therapeutics, especially for ASOs in penetrating the blood-brain barrier to target neurological disorders effectively. Nanoparticlebased formulations have emerged as leading strategies to enhance RNA stability, reduce immunogenicity, and improve cellular uptake. Despite these advances, significant hurdles remain, including optimizing pharmacokinetics, minimizing off-target effects, and ensuring sustained therapeutic efficacy. Regulatory frameworks are evolving to accommodate the unique challenges of RNAbased therapies, including ASOs with efforts underway to establish comprehensive guidelines for RNA therapeutics, yet there are also sustainable manufacturing issues that need to be considered for long-term feasibility. By addressing these challenges, RNA therapeutics hold immense potential to revolutionize treatment paradigms for neurological disorders. Looking forward, the future of RNA therapeutics in neurology appears promising but requires continued interdisciplinary collaboration and technological innovation."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe genetic neuromuscular disorder caused by deletions or mutations in the SMN1 gene, leading to reduced levels of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Gene therapy using adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) has emerged as a promising treatment strategy for SMA by enabling systemic delivery of a functional SMN1 gene. This preclinical study evaluates the long-term safety and efficacy of an AAV9 vector expressing a codon-optimized human SMN1 gene (AAV9-hcoSMN) in neonatal mice. A single intravenous dose of 5 × 10<sup>11</sup> vector genomes per mouse was administered, with animals monitored over a 24-week period for therapeutic outcomes and safety profiles. Safety assessments, including clinical observations, haematological and biochemical analyses (such as CBC, liver function tests and coagulation tests), necropsy and histopathological examinations via H&E, revealed no significant adverse effects. Treated mice demonstrated 100% survival rates and exhibited no abnormalities in organ structure or function compared to controls. Efficacy assessments using quantitative PCR confirmed robust SMN1 transgene expression in key tissues, including the central nervous system, heart, liver and skeletal muscles. These findings demonstrate that AAV9-hcoSMN therapy achieves sustained and widespread transgene expression with no observable toxicity in a neonatal mouse model, reinforcing the therapeutic potential of AAV9-based gene delivery for SMA. By providing robust preclinical evidence of both safety and efficacy, this study contributes to the growing body of data supporting gene therapy as a viable, long-term treatment strategy for SMA. These results also help inform vector design, dosing strategies and safety monitoring for future clinical translation. Further studies in larger animal models are warranted to assess long-term durability and immunogenicity prior to human application. SUMMARY: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a serious genetic disorder that weakens muscles and can be life-threatening. Our study tested a potential gene therapy using a harmless virus (AAV9) to deliver a healthy version of the faulty gene that causes SMA. We treated newborn mice and observed them for 6 months to check for any side effects and see if the therapy worked. The results were promising-treated mice had no health problems, and the new gene was active in important organs like the brain, muscles, and heart. This research brings us closer to a safe and effective treatment for SMA."

Neurologic features typically include intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, hypotonia, and absent speech, though there is considerable variability even among individuals with the same molecular cause. This prospective study aimed to explore the utility of genome sequencing to identify additional molecular diagnoses that may contribute to variability in a cohort of patients with PMS. Twenty probands diagnosed with PMS (60% with a 22q13 deletion, 40% with a SHANK3 variant) underwent trio or duo genome sequencing and chromosomal microarray. This analysis identified a second molecular finding associated with a neurological condition in 3/20 participants. Molecular diagnoses related to neurological phenotypes included: (1) spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity-predominant, 2A, autosomal dominant (SMALED2A), (2) spastic paraplegia 7, and (3) 16p11.2 deletion syndrome. Five additional new molecular diagnoses were associated with a clinically actionable secondary or incidental finding. This exploratory study provides early evidence for the potential utility of expanded sequencing among individuals with PMS, even for those without phenotypic features outside of the expected range."

    "abstract": "[Purpose] This study aimed to clarify the eating difficulties experienced by patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 2 in Japan. [Participants and Methods] This cross-sectional study was part of a larger survey of Japanese patients with spinal muscular atrophy that included the use of a questionnaire. The feeding questionnaire was developed by a medical professional and validated before survey administration. Of 221 patients who completed and returned the questionnaire, 62 had spinal muscular atrophy type 2. The average age of the study patients was 17.6 years (± 11.7 years). To identify feeding problems experienced by patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 2 by age, the participants were divided into the following three groups: 0-11 years, 12-19 years, and 20 years or older. [Results] The frequency of choking episodes during meals in Japanese patients with type 2 spinal muscular atrophy was 66.1% and increased with age. [Conclusion] Ongoing swallowing evaluation and feeding instructions are necessary for patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 2."

    "abstract": "Aims were to reveal types of onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (OA)-induced liver injury, their treatment patterns, utilization of healthcare, and treatment costs. This study employed secondary research to analyze OA-induced liver injury using data from the EudraVigilance database, published case reports, cohort studies, and clinical trials. The extracted data were analyzed to define real-life clinical entities that could be clearly outlined as syndromes resulting from the OA-induced liver injury, and further used in guiding the development of healthcare utilization matrices. Serbian healthcare costs were calculated by multiplying utilization figures by local unit prices, converted to Euros using exchange rates and adjusted by price level indices. A spreadsheet model with uniform distributions simulated costs for 1000 virtual patients, providing mean values and standard deviations for Serbia and the EU. From 1566 adverse event reports in the EudraVigilance database following OA therapy, 231 were hepatobiliary disorders, predominantly hypertransaminasaemia (30.7%; 71/231). Liver injury largely manifested as mild-to-moderate biochemical abnormalities, rarely progressing to severe complications, and was effectively managed with corticosteroid therapy. Economic analysis highlights the manageable burden of OA-induced liver injury. In the EU, mild-to-moderate cases cost €823.7, while severe cases average €1638.6. Medication costs range from €26.8 for prednisone to €695.4 for severe cases requiring additional immunosuppressive agents like tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. To conclude, OA-induced liver injury, though notable, is clinically manageable with immunosuppressive therapy and rarely causes severe complications like encephalopathy or liver failure. Its modest costs do not undermine OA's cost-effectiveness, supporting its transformative role in spinal muscular atrophy treatment."

    "abstract": "Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) are an important component of the immune system, which plays a dual role in modern medicine. On the one hand, they significantly limit the effectiveness of gene therapy based on viral vectors, reducing the effectiveness of treatment of diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy, which is especially evident with repeated administration of therapeutic vectors. On the other hand, nAbs is a promising tool for combating viral infections. This review systematizes current data on the mechanisms of nAbs formation against AAV vectors, analyzes the factors influencing their production, and discusses strategies to overcome this limitation, including modification of vectors and the development of methods to suppress the immune response. Special attention is paid to the prospects of using nAbs as therapeutic agents against viral infections. The key problems and possible directions of research development in this area are considered, which is important for improving approaches to the treatment of both rare genetic and infectious diseases."

    "abstract": "To describe bulbar function trajectories in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 treated with nusinersen in the UK and Italy. In two previously reported, retrospective, observational cohort studies, we observed the 2-year change in the Children's Eating and Drinking Ability Scale (CEDAS) (the revised and optimized version of the Paediatric Functional Oral Intake Scale [p-FOIS]) and Oral and Swallowing Ability Tool (OrSAT) in 44 patients treated on average at 11.2 months (interquartile range = 4.1-24.7 months), with data collected every 6 months from treatment initiation. The Italian cohort had more participants in the 1b group (symptom onset >2 weeks and <3 months), while the UK had more participants in the 1c group (symptom onset <6 months). Over 2 years, the p-FOIS/CEDAS captured lack of bulbar improvement in the 1b group, with 40% displaying stability and 45% showing decline; in the 1c group, stability was captured (71%). OrSAT captured improvement in 47% of the 1b group and 43% of the 1c group at 2 years; this was predominantly because of age-related speech acquisition and feeding viscosities, where the item was not age-appropriate at baseline. The p-FOIS/CEDAS and OrSAT measures capture complementary information on the effect of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) on bulbar function. Further studies are required to understand bulbar function trajectories in symptomatic and presymptomatic cohorts with SMA receiving different DMTs."

In this study, clinical data and CSF samples were collected. We used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to analyze CSF metabolites from 42 patients with type II and type III SMA. Although clinical indicators, such as age at treatment initiation and disease duration, did not predict the clinical efficacy of nusinersen, we identified 47 differentially expressed metabolites between effective- and ineffective-treatment patients with type II disease and 109 metabolites in patients with type III disease. Additionally, KEGG-enriched pathway analysis revealed differences in several pathways between the effective- and ineffective-treatment groups for both types II and III. N-myristoyl arginine and 1,1,1,2,2,2-Pentafluoro-7-phenylheptan-3-one were negatively associated with Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded changes in patients with type III and type III SMA. Furthermore, multivariate receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that differential metabolites have some accuracy in predicting SMA treatment efficacy. This study identified CSF metabolites that are predictive of nusinersen efficacy. The results of this study may guide the development of adjunctive therapies for improving the efficacy of nusinersen."

    "abstract": "Expanding on earlier findings of auditory involvement from two small-scale studies, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of hearing levels in a larger cohort of SBMA patients. Thirty-six SBMA patients and 36 age-matched male controls without risk factors for hearing loss underwent a comprehensive audiological assessment, including pure-tone audiometry at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 Hz frequencies, using both air and bone conduction. The pure-tone average (PTA) was calculated as the mean threshold at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. A correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between patients' audiological features and clinical characteristics, including motor disability, as measured by the SBMA functional rating scale (SBMAFRS) and the 6-min walk test (6MWT). PTA values were significantly higher in SBMA patients compared to healthy controls (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.0005, and p = 0.0001 for the right and left side, respectively), even when analysis was restricted to the 19 SBMA patients without risk factors for hearing loss (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.0148 and p = 0.0243 for the right and left ear, respectively). In the latter group, the hearing thresholds of each individual frequency were significantly higher than in controls, except for the intermediate frequencies (2000 Hz on both sides and 1000 on the left one). Negative significant correlations were found between PTA values and both the CAG repeat number and 6MWT distances. Conversely, SBMAFRS scores were overall unrelated to PTA values. Our findings suggest a disease-specific hearing impairment in SBMA patients."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a progressive disorder caused by SMN1 mutations. While therapies have changed its course, current motor scales often miss aspects. This study aimed to validate the Italian SMA Independence Scale (SMAIS-ULM) for reliability, applicability, and expansion across diverse SMA phenotypes. Patients with genetically confirmed 5qSMA were recruited from 12 Italian centers. Analyses included Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) for test-retest reliability, the Kruskal-Wallis for group comparisons, and the Spearman correlations with functional measures. Ceiling/floor effects were defined as ≥ 85% of a group reaching the maximum or minimum score. The study analyzed 472 completed questionnaires: 263 from caregivers (mean age 26.4 ± 17.6; 29 SMA I, 123 SMA II, 104 SMA III, 7 presymptomatic) and 209 from patients (mean age 33.1 ± 16.4; 3 SMA I, 101 SMA II, 104 SMA III; 1 SMA IV), including 195 matched caregiver-patient pairs. ICC was conducted in 29 caregivers and 31 patients; values ranged from 0.97 to 1.00. SMAIS-ULM scores differed by SMA type, with SMA III/presymptomatic subjects scoring higher than SMA I/II (p < 0.001) and walkers scoring higher than sitters/non-sitters (p < 0.001). Floor effects were found in 18.9% of non-sitters and 50% of walkers, with comparable patterns in patient responses. Strong correlations with functional measures were found, with no significant differences between caregiver and patient reports. Conclusion: The findings confirm the reliability and validity of the SMAIS-ULM as an effective tool for measuring functional independence in individuals with SMA, both from the caregiver and patient perspectives."

    "abstract": "CHCHD10, a member of the coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix (CHCH) domain-containing protein family, plays a critical role in mitochondrial function. The link between pathological mutations and CHCHD10 is important and increasingly recognized, especially due to mitochondrial dysfunction and its association with neurodegenerative diseases. Several mutations in CHCHD10 have been directly linked to human diseases, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), mitochondrial myopathies, and Spinal Muscular Atrophy-Jokela type (SMAJ). In this study, we investigate the structural properties of wild-type and mutant CHCHD10 proteins using AlphaFold3 linked to the generation of conformational ensembles. Structural changes may modulate interactions, flexibility, and aggregation tendencies, potentially influencing neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, disease-associated mutations like R15S, P23L, and S59L alter secondary structure formations such as 3<sub>10</sub>-helices and β-sheets. Despite, we find that the compactness of CHCHD10 is not significantly altered by genetic mutations since radius of gyration values range between 32.69 Å and 35.94 Å. All in all, we find that the compactness is not but the secondary and tertiary structure properties are affected by pathological mutations. We propose that evolution may have optimized CHCHD10 to maintain a suitable radius of gyration that provides sufficient flexibility through its intrinsically disordered region while ensuring efficient interaction with diverse molecules. Thus, alterations in secondary and tertiary structures through mutations might be a mechanism for fine-tuning the protein's functionality while preserving its optimal state. These characteristics might be related to the pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases linked to mitochondrial dysfunction."

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 2 is a genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and spinal deformities, often requiring the use of spinal braces for postural support. Traditional braces are typically rigid, uncomfortable, and time-consuming to manufacture, limiting their adaptability to patient-specific needs. This study aims to develop a novel, patient-centred framework for designing and fabricating custom spinal braces using digital tools and additive manufacturing (AM). the proposed framework combines spine data acquisition, computational modeling for structural optimization, and AM through fused filament fabrication (FFF). The brace design integrates advanced lattice geometries-including triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) and auxetic kirigami patterns-to enhance ventilation, reduce weight, and increase flexibility without compromising mechanical stability. A prototype brace was fabricated using polypropylene (PP) for rigid structural elements and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) for flexible inserts to ensure both support and comfort. the resulting prototype demonstrated significant improvements in terms of production efficiency, customization, and user comfort. The use of AM enabled a reduction in manufacturing time and facilitated the integration of complex geometries tailored to the patient's anatomy. The brace offered enhanced breathability and flexibility, contributing to improved wearability and patient compliance compared to conventional designs. this approach represents a step forward in orthopaedic treatment, offering a more adaptive, cost-effective, and patient-centred solution for managing SMA-related spinal deformities."

However, long-term efficacy and safety data in adult SMA patients are limited. Eighteen treatment-naive adult patients with SMA types 2, 3, or 4 received Risdiplam for 24 months. Strength and motor function were assessed through manual muscle testing, hand grip strength, key and tip pinch strength, Motor Function Measure-32 (MFM-32), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), Functional Oral Intake Scale, and Neuromuscular Disease Swallowing Status Scale. Patient Reported Outcome Measures included SF-36 quality of life scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, Sydney Swallow Questionnaire, and SMA Independence Scale. Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) were assessed over 24 months and analysed retrospectively. Motor function significantly improved, with MFM-32 scores increasing by 2.3 % and 2.6 % at 12 and 24 months (p < 0.01). RULM scores improved significantly only after 12 months (1 point; p = 0.02). FVC remained stable in Risdiplam-treated adult patients, deviating from the anticipated decline calculated from their retrospective data. PEF showed significant improvement after 24 months (6.9 %; p = 0.03). Improvements in quality of life were observed, along with a reduction in fatigue and dysphagia.

Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is a useful tool to reflect muscle microstructural characteristics. We investigate whether qMRI can provide useful biomarkers for monitoring treatment efficacy in SMA and explore other factors that may predict the treatment response. Pelvic and thigh qMRI (Dixon, T2 mapping, and diffusion-tensor imaging) and Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) scores were evaluated at baseline and at six months after nusinersen treatment in 28 patients. X-ray examinations to obtain Cobb angle were performed at baseline. Minimally clinically important difference (MCID) was defined by a gain in HFMSE score of at least 3 points from the baseline. The HFMSE score correlated significantly with all of the qMRI parameters and the Cobb angle at baseline. After six months of treatment, the mean thigh fat fraction (FF) and fractional anisotropy decreased and the HFMSE increased, whereas T2 and the apparent diffusion coefficient remained stable. The HFMSE changes over six months were correlated negatively with baseline age, and MCID at six months after treatment was more likely in patients younger than 4.6 years. Moreover, changes in FF were significantly greater in patients with type 2 than in type 3 SMA. qMRI has the potential to be used to evaluate the effect of nusinersen over time in patients with SMA. Younger age at the start of treatment may predict better improvements in motor function."

    "abstract": "Nesprin-2 is a subunit of LINC complexes, which span the nuclear envelope and have key roles in mechanotransduction and nuclear positioning during brain and muscle development. Nesprin-2 interacts with the plus-end directed motor kinesin-1 and the dynein adapter Bicaudal D2 (BicD2), which in turn recruits the minus-end directed motor cytoplasmic dynein to position the nucleus during neuronal migration of postmitotic neurons, but the molecular details of these interactions are elusive. Here we present a structural model of a minimal Nesprin-2/BicD2 complex. A structure prediction with a PAE score in the high confidence range was obtained from AlphaFold and experimentally validated by mutagenesis, binding assays and biophysical studies. The core of the binding site is formed by spectrin repeats of Nesprin-2, which form an alpha-helical bundle with the cargo-binding domain of BicD2. The minimal Nesprin-2 fragment also interacts robustly with full-length BicD2. The BicD2-binding site is separated by a ∼65 residue intrinsically disordered linker from the LEWD sequence motif, that acts as kinesin-1 recruitment site, and we propose that both kinesin-1 and BicD2/dynein interact with Nesprin-2 simultaneously. We propose that structurally distinct interactions between BicD2 and its cargo adapters Nesprin-2, Nup358 and Rab6, as well as distinctions in the adjacent kinesin-1 recruiting sites could finetune overall motility for these transport pathways that have important roles in brain and muscle development. Mutations of Nesprin-2 and BicD2 cause devastating brain and muscle developmental diseases, including Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy, and results may help devise therapies for these diseases."

To improve the quality of in vitro cell-based assays for the evaluation of potential drug candidates for SBMA, we developed a morphology-based phenotypic analysis for a muscle cell model of SBMA that involves multiparametric morphological profiling to quantitatively assess the therapeutic effects of drugs on muscle cell phenotype. The analysis was validated using dihydrotestosterone and pioglitazone, which have been shown to exacerbate and ameliorate the pathophysiology of SBMA, respectively. Gene expression analysis revealed activation of the JNK pathway in the SBMA cells compared to the control cells. Phenotypic analysis revealed the effect of naratriptan, a JNK inhibitor, on the phenotypic changes of SBMA cells, and the results were confirmed by LDH assays. We then trained a predictive machine learning model to classify the drug responses, and it successfully discriminated between pioglitazone-type and naratriptan-type morphological profiles based on their morphological characteristics. Our morphology-based phenotypic analysis provides a noninvasive and efficient screening method to accelerate the development of therapeutics for SBMA."

Current approaches focus on gene replacement therapy, either in vivo or ex vivo, mostly utilizing viral vectors to deliver therapeutic genes into target cells. However, refining these techniques is essential to overcome challenges and complications associated with gene therapy to ensure long-term safety and efficacy. Slovenia has witnessed significant advancements in this field since 2018, marked by successful gene therapy trials and treatments for various rare diseases. Significant strides have been made in the field of gene therapy in Slovenia, treating patients with spinal muscular atrophy and rare metabolic disorders, including the pioneering work on CTNNB1 syndrome. Additionally, immune gene therapy, exemplified by IL-12 adjuvant therapy for cancer, has been a focus of research in Slovenia. Through patient-centred initiatives and international collaborations, researchers in Slovenia are advancing preclinical research and clinical trials, paving the way for accessible gene therapies. Establishing clinical infrastructure and genomic diagnostics for rare diseases is crucial for gene therapy implementation. Efforts in this regard in Slovenia, including the establishment of a Centre for Rare Diseases, Centre for the Technologies of Gene and Cell Therapy, and rapid genomic diagnostics, demonstrate a commitment to comprehensive patient care.

This study aimed to assess the psychometric properties (reliability and discriminant validity) of a set of new patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) called PROfuture, after analysing the performance of individual items of the questionnaires. Patients included in the Spanish SMA Patient-Reported Registry (RegistrAME) were invited to answer 10 questionnaires: Fatigability; Pain; Scoliosis and Contractures (S&C); Feeding (F); Breathing and Voice (B&V); Sleep and Rest (S&R); Vulnerability; Infections and Hospitalisations (I&H); Time spent in care (T); and Mobility and Independence (M&I). The diagnosis date, type of SMA, functional classification, and comorbidities were also collected. A total of 160 patients of the 330 included in RegistrAME participated in the study: mean age (SD) 18 (16.6) years, 27.5% non-sitter, 46.88% sitter, and 25.63% walker, 20.0% type 1 SMA, 51.88% type 2, and 28.12% type 3. The frequency of symptoms varied from 43.5% of patients reporting some degree of Pain to 96.3% reporting some degree of Fatigability. The reliability assessed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient was > 0.75 for all the PROs and > 0.9 for S&C, F, B&V, T, and M&I. Regarding content validity, scores were higher (worse health status) in type 1 SMA patients than in types 2 and 3, and were also higher for non-sitter patients than for sitter and walker patients. The ten questionnaires included in the PROfuture set were developed based on what people living with spinal muscular atrophy and their caregivers consider relevant. This preliminary study provides an initial basis to consider their potential usefulness in assessing aspects that matter to this population. The early findings are promising, however, further extensive psychometric evaluation is needed. PROfuture is a new set of patient-reported outcome measures, specifically designed by and for individuals living with spinal muscular atrophy and their caregivers. Future studies will help strengthen the evidence regarding its reliability and validity."

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) is responsible for the transport of most cellular cargo towards the minus end of microtubules. Dynein activation requires the multi-subunit dynactin complex and an activating cargo adaptor. The adaptors serve to link dynein with cargo and to fully activate the motor. Mutations in one of these activating adaptors, Bicaudal-D2 (BICD2), are associated with a neurodegenerative disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Lower Extremity Predominance (SMALED2). The molecular defect that underlies SMALED2 is largely unknown. In addition to interacting with dynein, BICD2 has also been shown to associate with KIF5B, a plus-end directed microtubule motor. We hypothesized that interactome changes associated with mutant versions of BICD2, and the resulting differences in cargo transport, might underlie the etiology of SMALED2. To test our hypothesis, we first defined the interactome of wild-type BICD2. This led to the identification of known BICD2 interacting proteins in addition to potentially novel cargo such as components of the HOPS complex, a six-subunit complex involved in endo-lysosomal trafficking. We next determined the interactome of three SMALED2 linked mutants in BICD2, two of which reside in the cargo binding domain. Interestingly, all three mutations resulted in BICD2-mediated dynein hyper-activation. Furthermore, all three mutants were associated with interactome changes. One of these mutants, BICD2_R747C, was deficient in binding to HOPS complex components and the nucleoporin RANBP2. In addition, this mutant also resulted in a gain of function interaction with GRAMD1A, a protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. This gain of function interaction resulted in mis-localization of GRAMD1A in BICD2_R747C expressing cells. Collectively, our results suggest that dynein hyperactivity, interactome changes, and the resulting cargo transport defects likely contribute to the symptoms associated with SMALED2."

We examine the role of physiologically derived androgens and androgenic supplements in neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity and delve into the involvement of androgen pathways in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. This review highlights the increasing recognition of testosterone and androgen signaling in various neurological conditions, with evidence of both protective and harmful effects depending on dosage and context. Although limited to experimental use, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) may serve potential benefits in the management of multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, headache, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson disease. On the other hand, androgen-blocking treatments may help alter disease progression in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. Testosterone supplementation can have potential adverse events when used at a supratherapeutic level, and prenatal testosterone exposure is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disease. Additionally, androgen-blocking agents could increase the risk of neurodegenerative conditions, such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease. Despite the above findings, there is no established indication of TRT or androgen-blocking medication in neurological disorders. The body of evidence highlighting the involvement of androgens and androgen receptors (ARs) in pathogenesis of neurological diseases is growing. This includes ongoing research exploring the potential therapeutic targets involving the androgen signaling pathway for management of neurological disorders. Future placebo-controlled clinical trials are essential to determine the efficacy and safety of TRT or androgen-blocking therapies in managing neurological disease."

EXG001-307 is an AAV9-based gene therapy vector containing a human SMN cDNA expression cassette driven by a neuron-specific promoter (human synapsin promoter) with cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer. In preclinical studies using an SMA mouse model, EXG001-307 demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy, as evidenced by improved survival rates, enhanced weight gain, and restoration of motor functions. Additionally, EXG001-307 showed reduced transgene expression in the heart, leading to a significantly improved safety profile compared to currently available therapy, without treatment-related deaths even at a very high dose (6 × 10<sup>14</sup> vg/kg). Cardiac and hepatic toxicities observed in the benchmark-treated animals were significantly minimized in EXG001-307-treated groups.

Fourteen patients were 3.5-16 years old and showed a median gain of 1 point in the HFMS/E. Four patients required non-invasive ventilation and/or nutritional support at treatment start, and three started support during observation period.

After one year, 84 %, and after 4 years of treatment, 54 % of patients felt their condition had improved in the last 6 months. Our data confirm sustained gains of motor function in early-treated patients and disease stabilisation in patients in the chronic phase under nusinersen treatment."

    "title": "Differentiating upper- and lower motor neuron diseases using automated acoustic analysis.",
    "abstract": "Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) result in a spectrum of motor impairments, including considerable effects on speech function, which manifest as dysarthria-a motor speech disorder. Speech metrics are increasingly recognized as critical biomarkers with potential utility in disease diagnosis and phenotyping. This study aimed to (1) characterize acoustics of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) dysarthria presentations in MNDs, and (2) identify relationships between bulbar disease severity scores and acoustic features, as these could collectively enable personalized approaches to management of these diseases. Data from 16 individuals with primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) representing UMN disease, 14 individuals with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) representing LMN disease, and 25 neurologically healthy individuals were analyzed. Clinical measures were also collected from PLS and SBMA groups. All participants were remotely recorded performing passage reading, rapid syllable repetition, and vowel phonation. Fifty-two acoustic features were extracted representing articulation, phonation, prosody, resonance, and overall speech timing. Features were compared using Kruskal-Wallis tests for between-group comparisons and Spearman correlations between acoustic features and clinical scores. Articulatory and prosodic features best differentiated PLS, SBMA and controls. Correlations were observed in the PLS group between the clinical score and various articulatory features, most notably those indexing tongue and jaw movements. Our study demonstrated that acoustic assessment could capture fingerprints of dysarthrias associated with PLS and SBMA. These findings also demonstrate the potential for remote speech assessment to characterize diverse dysarthria profiles and pave the way for creating ways for personalized disease management approaches in clinical care and trials."

    "title": "Accurate Quantification of Mutant and Wild-Type polyQ Proteins Using Simple Western Capillary Immunoassays.",
    "abstract": "Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are monogenic fatal neurodegenerative disorders caused by a CAG repeat expansion that is translated into a toxic polyQ tract. There are nine polyQ diseases: Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 17 (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). Although no disease-modifying therapies are available, lowering levels of the causative mutant polyQ protein is a promising potential treatment. Preclinically, the efficacy of polyQ protein-lowering compounds is often assessed using time-consuming Western blots (WB), which can produce variable results. Therefore, to improve throughput and accuracy of polyQ protein level quantification, Simple Western (SW) capillary immunoassays were developed. A panel of antibodies was screened for reactivity to the polyQ proteins on SW. The most promising antibodies were selected for further assay development. This resulted in optimised SW immunoassays for huntingtin (HTT), ataxin 1, 2 and 3 (ATXN1, 2, 3), atrophin 1 (ATN1) and androgen receptor (AR). Additionally, size-separation of the wild-type and polyQ-expanded mutant protein isoforms on SW was shown for ATXN1, ATXN3 and ATN1, allowing for their separate quantification. To facilitate size-separation of the larger HTT protein (≥ 348 kDa), a novel caspase 3-based assay was developed to generate N-terminal wild-type and mutant HTT fragments that could be separately quantified on SW in contrast to full-length HTT. In conclusion, SW capillary immunoassays were developed for polyQ proteins to improve preclinical research and aid the development of polyQ-lowering therapies for polyQ diseases."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate whether sarcopenia affects residual back pain (RBP) after percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF). We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 231 patients with single-segment OVCF treated with PKP between January 2023 and December 2023. Postoperative RBP was assessed at 1 month using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Patients with a VAS score ≥ 4 were classified as the RBP group, while those with a score < 4 served as controls. Sarcopenia was diagnosed using the skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), calculated by dividing the cross-sectional muscle area at the T12 vertebral level (measured via chest CT) by height squared. Univariate analysis compared clinical and imaging data between groups, and binary logistic regression identified risk factors. No significant differences were observed between groups in gender, BMI, surgical segment, hypertension, diabetes, or coronary heart disease (P > 0.05). However, age, BMD, SMI, bone cement usage, and sarcopenia prevalence differed significantly (P < 0.05). Binary logistic regression identified BMD and sarcopenia as independent risk factors for RBP after PKP. OVCF patients with sarcopenia have a higher likelihood of postoperative RBP, with an incidence approximately twice that of non-sarcopenic patients. Preoperative sarcopenia screening should be prioritized, and postoperative anti-muscular atrophy therapy actively implemented."

    "abstract": "Fusionless surgical techniques are increasingly used to treat patients with early-onset and juvenile neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS) to correct and stabilize the scoliotic curves while preserving natural growth. This study aimed to evaluate clinical and radiological outcomes two years after minimally invasive surgery using a commercially available CE-certified (Conformité Européenne) one-way self-expanding rod (OWSER) system in a large international cohort of patients with NMS. Patients who underwent surgical treatment with the OWSER system for NMS correction, with a two-year follow-up were retrospectively included and analyzed for two-year follow-up. The surgery consisted of a bilateral OWSER system from the upper cervico-thoracic spine to the pelvis using a minimally invasive approach. Radiological parameters, including Cobb angle, pelvic obliquity, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis and spinal length (T1-S1), were assessed preoperatively and at follow-up. Clinical performance was based on complications and unplanned reoperations. Seventy-six patients from ten international centers were included. The mean age at surgery was 9.6 ± 2.5 years. Diagnoses included cerebral palsy (n = 23), spinal muscular atrophy (n = 14), and other neuromuscular syndromes (n = 39). Mean Cobb angle improved from 80 ± 25° preoperative to 39.7 ± 20.9° at 2-years follow-up, mean pelvic obliquity improved from 19 ± 12° to 6.4 ± 6.2° and mean preoperative kyphosis decreased from 44 ± 24° to 32.9 ± 14°. Segment T1-S1 increased 5.9 cm peri-operatively and patients showed a mean growth after instrumentation from 34 ± 5.cm to 35 ± 5.2 cm in two years due to the OWSER system. Procedure related complications occurred in 22 patients (29%): twelve surgical site infections, and 20 mechanical and alignment-related complication, resulting in 27 revision surgeries in 20 patients (26%). The OWSER system provides stable correction of Cobb angle at two-year follow-up while allowing continued spinal growth in juvenile or early-onset NMS. Despite a notable complication rate, this technique offers a reliable treatment for NMS patients. We continue to follow-up these patients as long-term outcomes are necessary to confirm these encouraging results."

    "title": "Dissection and Whole-Mount Immunofluorescent Staining of Mouse Hind Paw Muscles for Neuromuscular Junction Analysis.",
    "abstract": "The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a peripheral synaptic connection between a lower motor neuron and skeletal muscle fibre that enables muscle contraction in response to neuronal stimulation. NMJ dysfunction and morphological abnormalities are commonly observed in neurological conditions, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and spinal muscular atrophy. Employing precise and reproducible techniques to visualise NMJs in mouse models of neuromuscular disorders is crucial for uncovering aspects of neuropathology, revealing disease mechanisms, and evaluating therapeutic approaches. Here, we present a method for dissecting the deep lumbrical and flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscles of the mouse hind paw and describe the process of whole-mount immunofluorescent staining for morphological analysis of NMJs. Similar whole-mount techniques have been applied to other muscles, such as the diaphragm; however, dense connective tissue in adult samples often impedes antibody penetration. Moreover, large hind limb muscles, including the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior, are commonly used to examine NMJs but require embedding and cryosectioning. These additional steps increase the complexity and duration of the protocol and can introduce sectioning artefacts, including transection of NMJs and disruption of morphology. Using small hind paw muscles enables whole-mounting, which completely eliminates the requirement for embedding and cryosectioning. As a result, the entire neuromuscular innervation pattern can be visualised, allowing a more accurate assessment of NMJ development, denervation, and regeneration in mouse models of neurological disease and nerve injury, which can be applied across all postnatal ages. Key features • Small muscles of the mouse hind paw, i.e., lumbrical and FDB muscles, can be rapidly dissected for whole-mount immunofluorescent analysis without the need for cryosectioning. • This protocol allows visualisation of the entire neuromuscular innervation pattern using axonal (anti-tubulin βIII), pre-synaptic (anti-synaptophysin), and post-synaptic (α-bungarotoxin) markers. • Whole-mount immunofluorescence of hind paw muscles enables assessment of developmental, degenerative, and regenerative phenotypes in young and adult mice across disease and injury models. • High-throughput analysis can be performed using NMJ-Analyser or NMJ-morph to evaluate diverse morphological features of the NMJ."

    "abstract": "Combined preimplantation genetic testing of aneuploidy (PGT-A) and monogenic disease (PGT-M) can be achieved through PCR-based whole genome amplification (WGA) and next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, pathogenic variant detection is usually achieved indirectly through single nucleotide polymorphism haplotyping, as direct detection of pathogenic variants is not always possible. We evaluated whether isothermal WGA was suitable for combined PGT-A and PGT-M that also permitted direct detection of repeat expansions and large deletions, in addition to indirect linkage analysis using microsatellite markers. Five-cell replicates from selected cell lines were subjected to isothermal or PCR-based WGA, followed by NGS-based PGT-A and direct and indirect PGT-M of Huntington's disease and spinal muscular atrophy. Both WGA methods accurately detected aneuploidy and large (10 Mb) segmental imbalances. However, isothermal WGA produced higher genotyping accuracy compared with PCR-based WGA for all analysed microsatellite markers (93.5% vs. 75.6%), as well as at the <i>HTT</i> CAG repeat locus (100% vs. 7.7%) and the <i>SMN1/2</i> locus (100% vs. 71.8%). These results demonstrate that isothermal WGA is potentially ideal for combined PGT-A and PGT-M that permits both direct and indirect detection of pathogenic variants including repeat expansions and gene deletions."

    "abstract": "Pontocerebellar hypoplasia is a rare neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by severe hypoplasia or atrophy of pons and cerebellum that may be associated with other brain malformations, microcephaly, optic nerve atrophy, dystonia, ataxia and neuromuscular disorders. At this time, there are 17 variants of PCH distinguished by clinical presentation and distinctive radiological and biochemical features in addition to pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia. PCH1 is defined as PCH variant associated with anterior horn degeneration in the spinal cord with muscle weakness and hypotonia, and is associated with recessive variants in genes VRK1, EXOSC3, EXOSC8, EXOSC9 and SLC25A46. Neuromuscular manifestations may clinically present as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), motor neuropathy (HMN) or neuronopathy (non-5q spinal muscular atrophy; SMA) or sensorimotor polyneuropathy (HMSN). Physiologic functions of PCH1-associated genes include regulation of RNA metabolism, mitochondrial fission and neuronal migration. Overall, complex phenotypes associated with PCH1 gene variants ranging from PCH and related neurodevelopmental disorders combined with neuromuscular disorders to isolated neuromuscular disorders have variable outcomes with isolated neuromuscular disorders typically having later onset with better outcomes. Improved understanding of pathogenesis of pontocerebellar hypoplasia and its association with motor neuronopathies and peripheral neuropathies may provide us with valuable insights and lead to potential new therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disorders."

    "abstract": "Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), or Kennedy disease (KD), is a rare X-linked trinucleotide repeat disorder caused by cytosine, adenine, and guanine (CAG) expansions in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. KD affects lower motor neurons, leading to progressive muscle weakness, bulbar dysfunction, and endocrine symptoms such as gynecomastia. Diagnosis is challenging due to phenotypic overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases. This report aimed to describe two new Mexican cases of KD and to summarize all published cases of KD in Latin America through a systematic review (SR). The SR search was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method in the Scielo, Lilacs, and Scopus databases, including cohort studies, case series, and case reports with molecular confirmation of SBMA. Clinical and molecular data were analyzed. The review identified 23 Latin American SBMA cases. The median age of onset was 43 years (range: 21-66). The most common manifestations were weakness (95.7%; n = 22), tremor (65.2%; n = 15), and bulbar symptoms such as dysarthria (95.6%; n = 22) and dysphagia (91.3%; n = 21). Endocrine manifestations such as gynecomastia (73.9%; n = 17) and sexual dysfunction (56.5%; n = 13) were common. Electrophysiological findings confirmed lower motor neuron involvement, and molecular analysis revealed a median of 46.5 CAG repeats. Despite its low frequency, SBMA remains underdiagnosed in Latin America, which may be due to limited awareness and clinical overlap with other pathologies. Molecular testing is crucial for diagnostic certainty. The review also highlights the need to evaluate multisystem involvement. Improved diagnostic protocols, genetic counseling, and increased awareness are needed for the timely detection and management of SBMA in Latin America."

    "abstract": "Pathogenic variants of fused in sarcoma (FUS) cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FUS-ALS), with evidence of gain of function. Jacifusen is an antisense oligonucleotide targeting FUS pre-mRNA, previously shown to delay neurodegeneration in a mouse model and potentially slow functional decline in a first-in-human study. Here, we sought to further evaluate use of jacifusen as a treatment for FUS-ALS. This expanded access programme was conducted through a series of single-patient investigational new drug applications at five sites (four hospitals in the USA and one in Switzerland). Participants carried a FUS variant and had clinical evidence of motor neuron disease onset or electrophysiological abnormalities, if not a diagnosis of ALS. Participants were ineligible if chronically ventilated with tracheostomy. Enrolled sequentially, participants received serial intrathecal injections of jacifusen over 2·8-33·9 months. Based on multiple ascending doses of jacifusen (from 20 mg to 120 mg), successive protocols were modified as safety and other data were acquired, with the last participants enrolled receiving 120 mg doses monthly from the start of their treatment. Safety was assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 and standard cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metrics. Concentration of neurofilament light chain (NfL) in CSF was used as a biomarker of axonal injury and neurodegeneration, and the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score was used as an overall measure of motor function. Biochemical analysis and immunohistochemical staining were done on post-mortem CNS tissues to quantify FUS protein expression and assess the burden of FUS pathology. Between June 11, 2019, and June 2, 2023, we recruited 12 participants (median age 26 years [range 16-45]; seven [58%] were female and five [42%] were male) into the expanded access programme. Transient elevations in cell counts or total protein concentration in CSF (six [50%] participants) were unrelated to treatment duration. The most common adverse events were back pain (six [50%]), headache (four [33%]), nausea (three [25%]), and post-lumbar puncture headache (three [25%]). Two participant deaths were recorded during the programme, both thought to be unrelated to the investigational drug. The concentration of NfL in CSF was reduced by up to 82·8% after 6 months of treatment. Although most participants had continued functional decline (as measured by ALSFRS-R) after starting treatment with jacifusen, one showed unprecedented, objective functional recovery after 10 months, and another remained asymptomatic, with documented improvement in electromyographic abnormalities. Biochemical and immunohistochemical analysis of CNS tissue samples from four participants showed reduced FUS protein levels and an apparent decrease in the burden of FUS pathology. The findings suggest the safety and possible efficacy of jacifusen for treating FUS-ALS. The efficacy of jacifusen is being further evaluated in an ongoing clinical trial.

However, data on SMN1 variant carrier rates in the Foshan area of Guangdong Province are limited. This retrospective study aimed to determine SMN1 carrier rate among pregnant women in Foshan, evaluate screening uptake, and analyse regional variations to optimize genetic counselling strategies and public health interventions. Multiplex real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the SMN1 variant in pregnant women from February 2023 to March 2025 in the Foshan area. If pregnant women screened positive, carrier testing was recommended for their husbands. Prenatal diagnoses were performed for high-risk couples. Among the 7709 pregnant women who underwent SMN1 variant carrier screening, 104 SMN1 variant carriers were identified, yielding a carrier rate of 1.35 %. Spousal testing (82.7 % compliance) revealed one high-risk couple, with prenatal diagnosis confirming a heterozygous deletion in the foetus. The carrier rate of Foshan was lower than that in Shenzhen and Maoming but higher than that in Hispanic populations. Our study revealed a 1.35 % SMN1 carrier rate among Foshan pregnant women, supporting genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis implementation.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate its efficacy and safety in patients with SMA. Four biomedical databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library) and three conference abstract repositories were systematically searched on 1 February 2025 for related clinical studies. Primary outcomes were the motor function, respiratory function, and the peripheral survival motor neuron (SMN) transcript levels of SMA patients pre- and post-salbutamol. Secondary outcomes included musculoskeletal function metrics, patient-reported symptoms, and adverse events. A total of eight studies involving 154 subjects were included in the final analysis. Qualitative analysis revealed that a significant number of patients reported subjective improvements. Additionally, salbutamol has been shown to improve respiratory function and contribute to weight gain in certain younger individuals. Meta-analysis demonstrated that, in two selected studies, patients under 6 years old showed a substantial improvement in the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) scores (mean difference (MD) = 3.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-7.43, P = 0.03) with no significant heterogeneity. Salbutamol also elevated the levels of peripheral SMN2 full-length transcripts, with statistical significance observed at 6 months (MD = 25.13, 95% CI 16.12-34.13, P < 0.00001) and sustained through to 12 months. Salbutamol represents a safe therapeutic option that holds considerable promise in the management of SMA, particularly among clinical responders and younger subgroups. Double-blind, randomized, controlled trials are required to confirm these findings. • Clinical trials in neuromuscular junction disorders report motor function gains associated with β2-agonists therapy, attributed to both muscle trophic effects and NMJ synaptic modulation. • Salbutamol, a β2-adrenergic receptor agonist, has been shown to increase full-length SMN2 mRNA and functional SMN protein levels in SMA patient-derived fibroblasts. • Salbutamol possesses the potential to improve motor function in patients with SMA and represents a safe therapeutic option that holds considerable promise in the management of SMA. • The potential mechanism of salbutamol in treating SMA patients may involve enhancing SMN2 transcript expression via cAMP regulation and increasing SMN protein levels by inhibiting ubiquitin-mediated SMN degradation through the β2 adrenergic receptor-PKA pathway. • Salbutamol emerges as a cost-effective and viable option for SMA patients in underdeveloped regions who lack access to or cannot afford disease-modifying treatments."

The parents of a newborn baby are vulnerable in the days after birth, and the optimal way to deliver the shocking and distressing news of a potential serious diagnosis is yet to be defined. More data are needed to determine whether access to a genetic counsellor (GC) improves families' experiences with genetic conditions identified by NBS. This study aimed to explore the similarities and differences for parents who received a positive NBS result for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and received access to a GC (GC cohort), to a cohort of parents who received a diagnosis for inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) and did not have access to a GC (non-GC cohort). Semi-structured interviews explored the retrospective experiences of receiving the NBS result, including diagnosis implications and subsequent adaptation to respective genetic diagnoses. Inductive thematic analysis was used from group comparison. 7 SMA families and 5 IEM families were included in the study. Four themes were identified: 1. minimal pre-test counselling; 2. perceived lack of local healthcare team knowledge; 3. enabling factors for adaptation; 4. implications for both individuals and their families. Both the GC and non-GC cohorts reported insufficient counselling in the pre-test period and described feeling traumatised at the time of the diagnosis delivery. Families without subsequent GC input described limited understanding of the disease due to the use of medicalized terms, as well as a decreased understanding of reproductive options, familial communication and subsequent cascade screening.

A 12-year-old Swiss Warmblood gelding. Case report. The gelding was presented with neck pain and ataxia after a fall. A fracture of the right cranial AP of C6 was identified on radiographs. The fracture was repaired by internal fixation with two 4.5 mm cortex screws of 58 and 48 mm length placed in lag fashion using computer-assisted surgery. During general anesthesia, it was suspected that the gelding developed brain edema that prolonged the recovery process. Postoperatively, the horse showed transient ataxia and myopathy of the left triceps muscle. Except for focal muscular atrophy of the right supraspinatus muscle, all complications resolved. Radiographs confirmed healing of the fracture with minimal callus formation. One year after surgery, the gelding had returned to ridden exercise and was performing well. Computer-assisted surgery facilitates lag screw fixation of AP fractures and makes this a potential alternative to intervertebral body fusion, which is recommended for this type of fracture to avoid excessive callus formation and subsequent spinal cord or cervical spinal nerve compression."

Data including fat-free mass (FFM), muscle mass (MM) and their indexes, and Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) scores at baseline and at 6, 10, and 14 months were analyzed. Forty-six patients with SMA type 2 and 3, median age at initial treatment 7.1(4.6-10.4) years, were included, with 25 males and 21 females. Compared with the baseline, FFM, MM, and indexes of both significantly increased during 14 months (p < 0.05) while body fat mass index showed no significant change (p = 0.18). Significant increases were noted in HFMSE scores (p < 0.001), which were moderately correlated with FFM index and MM index. The associations between HFMSE and muscle-related variables were strong in children who achieved walking at baseline. Body composition changes in muscle-related variables were found in children with SMA types 2 and 3 who received nusinersen treatment. Higher muscle mass was associated with better motor function."

    "title": "Spinal muscular atrophy in the era of newborn screening: how the classification could change.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease caused by deletions or mutations in the <i>Survival Motor Neuron 1</i> gene, associated with high morbidity and mortality related to muscle weakness. In recent years, the availability of new disease-modifying therapies and the extension of newborn screening has brought radical changes in the natural history of SMA at all ages. Historically, the classification of SMA has been based on age of onset and achievement of maximum motor milestone. In this new era, the historical classification of SMA by typology is no longer adequate to define the prognosis and type of SMA, nor to guide clinical management and treatment choice. The aim of this work is to discuss the current status of SMA neonatal screening and access to therapies across Europe and propose a new updated nomenclature, more suitable to guide clinicians in the management of SMA patients in the era of newborn screening. In this perspective, we evaluate and analyze the genetic basis of the disease, the current therapeutic landscape, the possible genotypic/phenotypic scenarios and the related clinical management."

From 146 identified papers, 22 were screened for full-text, and 5 were included. Studies were evaluated for quality of reporting and transparency using the CHEERs and QHES checklists. Data was extracted to inform the review.ResultsFour economic evaluations on NBS for SMA with high reporting quality were identified. Each study employed a cost-utility analysis with similar model structures, using a decision tree for screening and a Markov model for treatment outcomes. They each compared NBS with treatment vs clinical diagnosis (no screening) with treatment. Although treatment protocols of each study varied due to differences in the strategies considered and availability of treatment. All studies included a societal perspective in their analysis and considered a lifetime horizon ranging from 30 months to 100 years. Early NBS with treatment was found to be more cost-effective than late treatment in all studies with ICER values ranging from £-117,541 to $714,000 per QALY. The wide range of ICER values are due to assumptions of long-term outcomes which are still largely unknown.ConclusionNBS with treatment was found to be cost-effective by all studies when compared to no NBS and late treatment. Although there is uncertainty around long term outcomes. Future research should focus on collecting long-term efficacy and safety data and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of pre-symptomatic treatment."

    "abstract": "Dominant defects in CHCHD10, a mitochondrial intermembrane space protein, lead to a range of neurological and muscle disease phenotypes including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Many patients present with spinal muscular atrophy Jokela type (SMAJ), which is caused by heterozygous p.G66V variant. While most disease variants lead to aggregation of CHCHD10 and activation of proteotoxic stress responses, the pathogenic mechanisms of the p.G66V variant are less clear. Here we report the first homozygous CHCHD10 patient, and show that the variant dosage dictates the severity of the motor neuron disease in SMAJ. We demonstrate that the amount of the mutant CHCHD10 is reduced, but the disease mechanism of p.G66V is not full haploinsufficiency as residual mutant CHCHD10 protein is present even in a homozygous state. Novel knock-in mouse model recapitulates the dose-dependent reduction of mutant CHCHD10 protein and the slow disease progression of SMAJ. With metabolome analysis of patients' primary fibroblasts and patient-specific motor neurons, we show that CHCHD10 p.G66V dysregulates energy metabolism, leading to altered redox balance and energy buffering by creatine metabolism."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disease associated with a significant burden of illness to both patients and caregivers; however, there is little evidence available regarding how patients and caregivers evaluate potential treatment benefit-risk profiles. As access to SMA disease-modifying therapies increases, it is imperative to understand which treatment attributes drive treatment choices. To identify which treatment attributes drive treatment choices in adults with SMA and caregivers of children with SMA across nine countries in Latin America. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey was developed for market research using data collected via qualitative interviews and consultations with medical experts. Adults with Type 2/3 SMA and caregivers of children with Types 1-3 SMA were recruited by patient advisory groups and physician referrals. Respondents completed a 30-min, online survey that collected patient demographics, disease-specific information, and quality of life data (via the EQ-5D-5L), and included the DCE, in which respondents were asked to choose between 14 sets of hypothetical treatment profiles. Data were pooled for analysis, as the country-level sample sizes were small. Raw data were aggregated in Microsoft Excel. Statistical testing was performed using data tables and SPSS (as appropriate). Demographic data were summarized descriptively. A total of 143 respondents (45 adults with SMA and 98 caregivers) completed the online survey. Most respondents were from Argentina (35.0%) or Brazil (19.6%). Breathing function outcome was the most important treatment attribute for caregivers, while adults with SMA placed greater importance on motor function outcome. Both adults with SMA and caregivers placed the greatest importance on improvements in function compared with worse or stable outcomes. Understanding treatment attribute preferences at a regional level will improve shared medical decision-making for individuals with SMA."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Pain in SMA may be the consequence of the underlying neuromuscular disease but has hardly been investigated so far. To assess pain in SMA and its interaction with patient's wellbeing. In a prospective, cross-sectional study design, 70 adult and adolescent SMA patients (median age 30 years, IQR 21-49 years, types I-IV) were assessed at the Department of Neurology, Ulm University hospital. Pain was evaluated with a self-adapted Pain Scale, depressiveness with the ALS-Depression-Inventory-12-Items (ADI-12) and global Quality of Life (gQoL) with the Anamnestic Comparative Self-Assessment (ACSA). We found an intermittent frequency of pain in 80% in SMA patients with more than half of the patients experience pain at least once a week. The mean pain intensity score estimated by pain frequency and strength was 24 on a scale of 0 to 240, indicating a frequently appearing mild to moderate pain. Pain was mostly located in the lumbar spine, hip, and thoracic spine. The pain intensity score was independent from demographics (age, gender) or clinical parameters (SMA type, physical state), but, instead, it was associated to depressiveness. Depressiveness was more prevalent in older SMA patients. gQoL was rather independent from pain intensity or physical state. The study provides evidence for a prevalence of mild to moderate pain in 80% of adult and adolescent SMA patients. Pain was not simply caused by physical deficits and did not severely interfere with patients' quality of life, but, instead, was closely interrelated with patients' affective state."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in children is a hereditary neuromuscular disorder characterized by motor neuron degeneration, which leads to progressive muscle weakness and impaired movement. Ultrasound imaging, owing to its non-invasive, radiation-free, and cost-effective nature, provides an invaluable tool for visualizing muscle morphology. This technique offers a significant advantage in the clinical evaluation of SMA. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess muscle abnormalities in children with SMA using both conventional ultrasound and shear wave elastography (SWE), and to explore the potential of these imaging modalities in the assessment of the disease. A total of 20 patients with type II or III SMA, who had not received any prior disease-modifying treatment (DMT), were included in the SMA group. These patients were enrolled between May 2022 and January 2024. The control group comprised 20 healthy children matched for age and gender. Muscle thickness (MT) and shear wave velocity (SWV) of the biceps brachii (BB) and quadriceps femoris (QF) were measured using B-mode ultrasound and SWE. Ultrasound parameters were compared between children with SMA and healthy controls. Additionally, motor function in the SMA group was assessed using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE), and the correlation between ultrasound parameters and HFMSE scores was analyzed. The BB-MT, BB-SWV, QF-MT and QF-SWV in the SMA group, were significantly lower than those in the control group (p = 0.030, 0.000, 0.004, and 0.001, respectively). Correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between QF-MT and QF-SWV in the SMA group and the HFMSE score (r = 0.802, p = 0.000; r = 0.56, p = 0.000, respectively). Ultrasound imaging is an effective modality for detecting and quantifying muscle atrophy and structural changes in children with SMA. Moreover, it demonstrates a significant correlation with motor function, providing valuable insights into the clinical assessment of SMA."

    "abstract": "The surgical treatment of scoliosis in type 2 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA2) is challenging and little described in the literature due to its rarity and fragility of the patients. The aim of this study was to review the surgical strategies and outcomes in patients with SMA2 who underwent surgery for scoliosis at a French reference neuromuscular center. All consecutive patients with genetically confirmed SMA2 who underwent spinal surgery between 2009 and 2022 at our French reference center were retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into 2 groups, according to their primary surgery: either magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGR) or posterior spinal fusion (PSF). Demographic, respiratory, and radiologic parameters were collected preoperatively and at the latest follow-up. All complications were reported. Patients and/or caregiver-reported outcome questionnaires were also used to assess the improvement of sitting posture. Seventeen patients underwent MCGR, and 9 patients underwent PSF during the inclusion period. Mean follow-up was 5.3±1.8 years in the MGCR group, and 8.0±4.5 years in the PSF group. The average age at surgery was 9.7±1.6 years in the MCGR group and 12.6±1.7 years in the PSF group. Pelvic fixation was performed using a Tconstruct (2 sacral and 2 iliac screws). PSF was performed with all levelled pedicle screws. In the MGCR group, upper thoracic fixation was lateral ribs (n=4), vertebral on three levels (n=9), or hybrid costo-vertebral (n=4). No blood transfusion was required. No differences were found between preoperative and postoperative lung function tests for the 2 surgical procedures. The major curve correction rate was 44% in the MCGR group and 55% in the PSF group. The pelvic obliquity at last follow-up was <5 degrees in all patients. Three unplanned surgeries occurred: 1 MGCR change after lengthening and 2 PSF-one for proximal hook migration and one for infection. All patients improved their ability to sit. In this series, PSF and MGCR allowed stable radiographic and respiratory results, with a reduced rate of global complications. Pelvic fixation with T-construct was a reliable and effective technique to correct pelvic obliquity in this population of patients."

    "abstract": "Perioperative nursing care for patients with neuromuscular disorders, especially spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), remains a challenge. There is an obvious lack of guidelines. We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of patients with type II or III SMA who underwent spinal surgery from 2018 to 2022. Nursing assessments included muscle strength, pulmonary function, the Barthel Index, the Braden Scale, Nutrition Risk Screening 2002, and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. Preoperative and postoperative anxiety levels were compared using a paired-samples t-test. All 24 included patients had severe scoliosis, kyphosis, or kyphoscoliosis, with a mean Cobb angle of 102 degrees. Upon admission, all patients (24/24) presented with muscle weakness, were classified as having total or severe dependency, and were at risk of developing pressure sores; 58.3% (14/24) of the patients had severe pulmonary function impairment, and 50.0% (12/24) were at nutritional risk, with the score unable to be assessed in 8.3% (2/24) of the patients. All patients underwent posterior spinal fusion surgery with bone grafting. Only one patient experienced a major postoperative complication, pneumonia, which was effectively managed. Anxiety level decreased significantly (P < 0.01) at discharge compared to that on admission. Complementing regular nursing care, an SMA-specific perioperative nursing care protocol was implemented: (1) Respiratory care protocol: A. Confirmation of SMA type; B. Comprehensive evaluation of symptoms, signs, and pulmonary function test results; C. Development and implementation of a personalized plan including: Plan 1. Training on respiratory function including diaphragmatic breathing exercise, coughing exercise, inhaling exercise, and exhaling exercise; Plan 2. Use of cough assist device, and/or Plan 3. Use of non-invasive ventilator. (2) Postoperative three-step all-involved training protocol of postural adaptation from nurse-led to caregiver-led and inducing patient self-advocacy: A. Preparation for the training; B. Postural adaptation training; C. Postural switch from lying to sitting. We implemented an SMA-specific perioperative nursing care protocol, including a respiratory care protocol and a postoperative three-step all-involved training protocol of postural adaptation, complementing standard nursing care. Our approach yielded positive patient outcomes, while we acknowledge the limitation that our protocol is pending comparative evaluations due to the rarity of the disease. The protocol was initially designed for patients with SMA but may also be suitable for other patients with profound muscle weakness."

Although disease severity partially correlates with <i>SMN2</i> copy number, significant variability in disease severity and treatment response remains unexplained, prompting a search for additional biomarkers. Using native, long-read nanopore and targeted short-read bisulfite sequencing, we analyzed methylation patterns across the 30 kb <i>SMN2</i> gene. Our long-read analysis of 29 SMA patients identified tissue-specific variation in <i>SMN2</i> intronic regions and the 3'UTR. Further analysis of blood-derived DNA of 365 SMA patients identified no association between <i>SMN2</i> methylation and disease severity or treatment response, excluding blood-derived DNA methylation as a predictive biomarker. However, we discovered significant age-associated variation in <i>SMN2</i> methylation in intron 1 and the 3'UTR, suggesting a possible role in modifying SMN expression during development and aging. This study provides a framework for detailed methylation analysis in complex genetic regions."

    "abstract": "Polyamines, including putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, are organic cations essential for cell growth, proliferation, and tissue regeneration. Their levels are tightly regulated by a set of enzymes controlling their biosynthesis, catabolism, and interconversion. Dysregulation of polyamine metabolism is associated with a group of rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorders collectively known as \"polyaminopathies\", including Snyder-Robinson Syndrome (SRS). SRS is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SMS gene, which encodes the spermine synthase enzyme. The lack of spermine synthase leads to aberrant polyamine levels and neurological impairments, as observed in patients and animal models. Currently, there are no available treatment options for SRS. Due to its monogenic nature, SRS is an excellent candidate for gene replacement therapy. The recent success of Zolgensma in treating children with Spinal Muscular Atrophy and the establishment of Platform Vector Gene Therapy (Pave-GT) initiative at the National Institute of Health (NIH) offer a framework to adapt-and-apply the same gene delivery system for multiple rare disease gene therapies. This chapter outlines strategies for delivering a functional copy of the SMS gene using an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector, as well as methods to evaluate the molecular efficacy of this approach in an SRS mouse model. Our ultimate goal is to establish a versatile platform for genetic interventions targeting SRS and other polyaminopathies."

    "abstract": "The inherent technical difficulties, ethical/regulatory issues and costs of experimental studies in animal models is prompting investigators to replace as much as possible living organisms with in vitro physiological models named organoids and assembloids. Generated from induced pluripotent stem cells, these three-dimensional structures approximate the complexity of tissues and their interactions, enabling personalized disease modelling and drug testing. The integration of multiple components in assembloids further enhances their predictive value for multi-system interactions and toxicities. This review describes how neuromuscular organoids, incorporating functional neuromuscular junctions and contractile muscle tissue, have been used to replicate, in vitro, complex neuromuscular morpho-functional structures, offering very valuable platforms to study molecular mechanisms and drug effects in models of incurable diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the cardiological field, cardiac organoids and assembloids are proving reliable models for testing drug effects at molecular, morphological, electrophysiological and mechanical level. Recently, the integration of neuronal components into cardiac organoids has provided a potential approach to investigate autonomic function, a fundamental aspect of many neurological, neuromuscular and cardiac diseases. Challenges and limitations still remain, including the non-uniform differentiation protocols across studies, the incomplete maturation of cell phenotypes, and the lack of integrated pharmacokinetic modelling. We discussed some future developments aimed at overcoming such hurdles. Despite their current limitations, organoids and assembloids clearly hold great promises and will help advancing many fields of biomedicine."

    "abstract": "Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is caused by a polyglutamine expansion (pQe) in the N-terminal transactivation domain of the human androgen receptor (AR-NTD), resulting in a combination of toxic gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms. The structural basis of these processes has not been resolved due to the disordered nature of the NTD, which hinders experimental analyses of its detailed conformations. Here, using extensive computational modeling, we show that AR-NTD forms dynamic compact regions, which upon pQe re-organize dynamically, mediated partly by direct pQ interaction with the Androgen N-Terminal Signature (ANTS) motif. The altered dynamics of the NTD result in a perturbation of interdomain interactions, with potential implications for the binding of the receptor protein to its response element. Oligomeric aggregation of the dynamic misfolded NTD exposes pQe, but blocks tau-5 and the FQNLF motif, which could lead to aberrant receptor transcriptional activity. These observations suggest a structural mechanism for AR dysfunction in SBMA."

Our study includes both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of myostatin levels in treated SMA patients. The longitudinal cohort included 46 treatment-naive patients assessed at baseline and 12 months post-treatment. Myostatin levels were measured using ELISA. Age-matched controls (n = 89) were included for comparison. The cross-sectional study included 128 patients with variable durations of treatment (from 0.4 to 7.2 years). In both cohorts, myostatin levels were correlated with SMA type, functional status, and clinical outcomes. Baseline myostatin levels were significantly lower than controls (p < 0.001), except during the neonatal period in presymptomatic patients. After 12 months of treatment, there were no significant changes compared to baseline levels (p = 0.1652). The only substantial changes were observed in presymptomatic neonates, who showed a reduction of myostatin despite treatment intervention. There was a significant correlation between myostatin levels, functional status, and SMA type both in the cross-sectional and longitudinal groups. This study demonstrates lower myostatin levels in SMA patients compared to controls. The association between myostatin levels, functional status, and SMA type suggests its possible role as a disease severity biomarker. The utility of myostatin as a biomarker for DMT response remains controversial; while we observed no significant increase in myostatin levels following treatment, we also did not observe the progressive reduction previously reported in untreated patients."

    "abstract": "Neurological disorders with onset before or at birth are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children. Prenatal treatment has the potential to reduce or prevent irreversible neuronal loss and facilitate normal neurodevelopment. We hypothesized that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) delivered to the amniotic fluid by intra-amniotic (IA) injection could safely distribute to the fetal central nervous system (CNS) and provide therapeutic benefit in the motor neuron disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), caused by mutations of the survival of motor neuron 1 gene (<i>SMN1</i>), leading to deficiency of SMN protein. Although the splice-switching ASO nusinersen ameliorates SMA when delivered postnatally, substantial deficits can remain in severely affected infants. Here, IA injection of ASOs into two mouse models of severe SMA increased SMN expression in the CNS. In SMAΔ7 mice, which manifest pathology in utero, prenatal treatment improved motor neuron numbers, motor axon development, motor behavioral tests, and survival when compared with those in mice treated postnatally (between P1 and P3). To assess the feasibility of prenatal treatment in a large-animal model, ASOs were delivered midgestation to fetal sheep by IA or intracranial injection. ASOs delivered by IA injection distributed to the spinal cord at therapeutic concentrations and to multiple peripheral tissues without evidence of substantial toxicity to the fetus or mother. These data demonstrated that IA delivery of ASOs holds potential as a minimally invasive approach for prenatal treatment of SMA and possibly other severe, early-onset neurological disorders."

    "abstract": "X-linked Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy (SBMA) is a rare, late-onset neuromuscular disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. SBMA is characterized by progressive muscle atrophy of both neurogenic and myopathic etiologies. Previous work has established that mutant AR expression in skeletal muscle could be a significant contributor to neuromuscular decline, yet the mechanisms involved remain ill-defined. As AR is a nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor, we sought to define early changes in gene expression in skeletal muscle of pre-symptomatic SBMA mice, with a focus on transcriptional changes at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). We describe loss of key NMJ-specific genes in synaptic muscle regions of pre-symptomatic SBMA mice, while extrasynaptic muscle features a coordinated loss of sarcomere genes that coincides with ectopic re-expression of certain NMJ genes. Furthermore, SBMA muscle prominently features dysregulated calcium flux, likely stemming from a compensatory response to early atrophy that greatly exacerbates over time. The SERCA activator CDN1163 conferred a mild rescue in function and muscle size in SBMA mice, while genetic deletion of the gene encoding Myf6/MRF4, a negative regulator of sarcomere gene expression and predicted AR interactor, did not ameliorate muscle atrophy. These studies suggest that modulation of calcium flux could be a promising pharmacological target in SBMA."

Onasemnogene abeparvovec is a gene replacement therapy used to treat patients with SMA. Cardiac toxicity was observed in animal studies on this therapy, and elevated cardiac troponin I levels were observed in clinical trials; however, the clinical importance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to reveal the cardiac toxicity of onasemnogene abeparvovec through careful investigation of cardiac function using cardiac strain analysis, which can detect early subtle abnormalities. This study included patients with SMA treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec between June 2020 and November 2020. Echocardiography, including peak global longitudinal strain (GLS), and other laboratory test results were evaluated. Case 1 showed a relative GLS decrease of 14.5% compared with that at the baseline (GLS reduction from -22.1% to -18.9%), elevation of N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide levels from 227 pg/mL to 494 pg/mL, and elevated liver enzyme concentrations after gene replacement therapy without reduction of the left ventricular ejection fraction. Subclinical myocardial dysfunction after infusion of onasemnogene abeparvovec was suggested by careful investigation of cardiac function. Cardiac toxicity may correlate with liver impairment following gene replacement therapy. Long-term studies that allow for a higher number of patients and more extended observation periods should be conducted to confirm the cardiac toxicity of onasemnogene abeparvovec."

    "abstract": "Motor neuron diseases are sporadic or inherited fatal neurodegenerative conditions. They selectively affect the upper and/or lower motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord and feature a slow onset and a subacute course contingent upon the site of damage. The main types include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, primary lateral sclerosis, and progressive bulbar palsy, the pathological processes of which are largely identical, with the main disparity lying in the location of the lesions. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the representative condition in this group of diseases, while other types are its variants. Hence, this article mainly focuses on the advancements and challenges in drug research for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis but also briefly addresses several other important degenerative motor neuron diseases. Although the precise pathogenesis remains elusive, recent advancements have shed light on various theories, including gene mutation, excitatory amino acid toxicity, autoimmunology, and neurotrophic factors. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved four drugs for use in delaying the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: riluzole, edaravone, AMX0035, and tofersen, with the latter being the most recent to receive approval. However, following several phase III trials that failed to yield favorable outcomes, AMX0035 has been voluntarily withdrawn from both the US and Canadian markets. This article presents a comprehensive summary of drug trials primarily completed between January 1, 2023, and June 30, 2024, based on data sourced from clinicaltrials.gov. Among these trials, five are currently in phase I, seventeen are in phase II, and eleven are undergoing phase III evaluation. Notably, 24 clinical trials are now investigating potential disease-modifying therapy drugs, accounting for the majority of the drugs included in this review. Some promising drugs being investigated in preclinical studies, such as ATH-1105, are included in our analysis, and another review in frontiers in gene therapy and immunotherapy has demonstrated their therapeutic potential for motor neuron diseases. This article was written to be an overview of research trends and treatment prospects related to motor neuron disease drugs, with the aim of highlighting the latest potentialities for clinical therapy."

This study aims to assess the post-marketing safety profile of these therapies through the spontaneous adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports available in EudraVigilance (EV). <b>Methods</b>: Data from EV were retrieved via adrreports.eu for the suspected ADRs associated with nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec, and risdiplam from their approval in the European Economic Area (EEA) to 31 December 2024. The ADR reports were exported and analysed using descriptive statistics in Microsoft Excel. Reporting odds ratios (RORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for suspected ADRs, focusing on reactions with a lower limit of the 95% CI exceeding 1. <b>Results</b>: A total of 3196, 806, and 956 individual case safety reports (ICSRs) were identified for nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec, and risdiplam, respectively. The most frequently reported ADRs with significantly increased RORs included post-lumbar puncture syndrome (nusinersen: 11%), pyrexia (onasemnogene abeparvovec: 23%), and pneumonia (risdiplam: 9%). While some ADRs were therapy-specific, others were consistent with SMA disease progression and complications. Onasemnogene abeparvovec showed a notable prevalence of hepatotoxicity, while risdiplam was associated with gastrointestinal and respiratory events. <b>Conclusions</b>: To conclude, the analysis reinforces the known safety profiles of these SMA treatments while highlighting potential areas for further investigation. ADRs related to SMA complications require careful differentiation from true drug-related effects. Future pharmacovigilance efforts should focus on long-term safety assessments and real-world evidence to optimize treatment strategies."

    "title": "Respiratory and Bulbar Support in Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type I Treated with Nusinersen.",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to assess the evolution of respiratory and feeding support in children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 after 24 months of nusinersen treatment. Data on SMA type 1 children treated with nusinersen between 2017 and 2023 from the Canadian Neuromuscular Disease Registry were extracted. The cohort was divided into two groups based on age at treatment initiation: ≤2 years and >2 years. The primary outcome was the (i) time to death or needing full-time (≥16 hours/day) ventilation and (ii) time to needing feeding tube support. The secondary outcomes were differences in respiratory and feeding support requirements between the two groups at 24-month follow-up. Thirty-two children were included, and the median age (range) for treatment initiation was 3.2 months (0.8- 13.1) in children who initiated treatment at ≤2 years and 51.2 (28.7-183.8) in those who initiated at >2 years of age. The median age of death or full-time ventilation was 8.6 months (6-22.4) and 10.5 months (4-24) for the two groups, respectively. The median age for initiation of feeding support was 5.1 (1.7-26.4) and 14.5 months (3.9-130.6), respectively. At 24 months (<i>n</i> = 23), there were no significant differences between the need for respiratory or feeding tube support between the two treatment groups. Most children with SMA type 1 treated with nusinersen across Canada have continued need for respiratory and feeding support over time when initiated after symptom onset."

    "title": "Thinking outside the box: A re-evaluation of Canadian recommended outcome measures in adult spinal muscular atrophy - report of a national consensus workshop.",
    "abstract": "BackgroundDisease-modifying therapies for persons with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has led to greater need and demand for relevant outcomes assessments. Such tools help monitor disease progression, assess treatment response, and inform clinical management. Canadian SMA clinicians participated in a Delphi process to achieve a 2021 national consensus on recommended outcomes, recognizing future reassessment would be essential given the evolving field and gaps in patient-reported and bulbar measures.ObjectiveDerive updated Canadian consensus of recommended outcome measures for adults with SMA.MethodsA national consensus workshop was held with SMA clinicians, patient/family representatives, research leaders, national registry and advocacy organizations. Clinics and registry experience and data were presented and discussed, utility of current and additional outcomes reviewed. Long and short lists of measures were generated, with voting to derive consensus.ResultsPractical implementation, value of data, and relevance to persons with SMA were key considerations. Consensus was achieved to 'think outside the box', recognizing a spectrum of function and need to choose the right outcome measure for the right patient at the right time. Measures with greater acceptance for adults were selected, and bulbar measures introduced. Eight outcome measures are recommended; 4 motor, 2 respiratory and 2 patient reported domains, with use based on the individuals level of function. The Revised Upper Limb Module was deemed to have broadest applicability except in the strongest and weakest adults. Additional measures are included as optional and exploratory.ConclusionsEmploying measures meaningful for clinicians, researchers, and persons living with SMA is essential to ensuring quality data collection and an engaged patient-centred clinical team. Clinicians should select measures based on the person's functional ability and goals. Building a national community of practice to support clinical and research practice, including standardized outcome measure training, will be a key next step in dissemination and advocacy."

    "abstract": "Risdiplam is a new therapeutic agent developed to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene. Unlike previous invasive therapies, risdiplam offers the advantage of oral administration, significantly improving patient comfort and accessibility. The review provides information on an SMA historical overview, breakthrough therapies of the development, and design of the methods used to treat SMA. We then focus on its structure and physicochemical properties. The analysis of risdiplam concentrates on developing improved analytical methods for the precise quantification of risdiplam and its metabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry in biological samples using octadecyl stationary phases. For sample preparation, only the protein precipitation method was used. Challenges associated with the risdiplam analytics include developing a highly sensitive and selective method in biological matrices and dealing with potential interferences from the biological matrix. Future research should focus on improving analytical methods, investigating metabolite activity, and expanding our knowledge of its long-term effects."

    "abstract": "To assess the carrier frequency of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in women of childbearing age in Chongqing and to evaluate prenatal diagnostic outcomes in high-risk couples. A total of 17 926 women of childbearing age attending Chongqing Health Center for Women and Children between May 2021 and November 2023 were enrolled, including 3 398 pre-pregnant women and 14 528 pregnant women, all of whom had no clinical phenotype or family history of SMA or related neuromuscular disorders. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the copy number variations in exons 7 and 8 (E7, E8) of the SMN1 gene. High-risk carriers were identified based on the genetic screening results. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was employed for prenatal diagnosis of fetuses from high-risk couples. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Chongqing Health Center for Women and Children (Ethics No.2021-RGI-02). Among the 17 926 women of childbearing age, 298 (1.66%) were identified as heterozygous carriers, including 278 (1.55%) with concurrent deletions of E7 and E8, and 20 (0.11%) with isolated deletions of E7. Seven high-risk couples were identified, six of whom were prenatal couples. Of the two fetuses from these high-risk pregnancies, both exhibited heterozygous deletions of E7 and E8 in the SMN1 gene, while four fetuses showed no abnormalities. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the carrier frequency of SMA among women of childbearing age in Chongqing, offering valuable data for the primary and secondary prevention of SMA-related birth defects in the region."

    "title": "Families' Perceptions of Powered Mobility for Participation in Children With Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1: A Photovoice Study.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA1) is a neuromuscular disorder that severely limits movement and autonomy in young children. Early powered mobility has proved to be a valuable intervention to promote participation, social engagement and emotional well-being. To understand the potential impact of powered mobility, it is critical to explore children and families' experiences with participatory methodologies, such as the photovoice method. To explore families' perceptions of powered mobility for participation in children with SMA Type 1, with a focus on emotional well-being, social engagement and accessibility. A qualitative descriptive study using the photovoice methodology was implemented, in which families documented their perceptions and experiences through photographs and reflective narratives over a period of 4 weeks. Children were encouraged to use a power mobility device in different activities in natural environments, after a training intervention of 12 weeks with power mobility. Families were asked to capture their experiences through photos and participate in different interviews to report their perceptions. Data was collected through photos documentation and during interviews. This study was conducted in natural environments, home and community, in Spain. The participants were six children with SMA1 (aged 13-28 months) and their families. Three major themes emerged: (1) Emotional and Social Engagement: Families reported that powered mobility enhanced children's confidence, emotional expression and ability to interact with family members and peers. (2) Barriers to Accessibility: Families encountered challenges such as limited home space, restricted public accessibility and the need for individualised adaptations. (3) Collaboration as a Key Factor: Parents emphasised the importance of collaboration with professionals in facilitating meaningful use of powered mobility. The findings align with previous research demonstrating the benefits of powered mobility in promoting independence, social interaction and participation. However, this study also highlights persistent environmental barriers that continue to limit full social inclusion. Addressing these challenges is crucial to maximising mobility-related gains. This study highlights the importance of addressing accessibility barriers and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration to maximise the benefits of powered mobility for children with SMA1. Incorporating participatory methodologies such as photovoice provides a powerful means for families to voice their experiences and advocate for inclusive mobility solutions. Families were actively involved in multiple stages of the study, including its design, data collection and interpretation and dissemination of the results. Using the photovoice method, parents documented their children's experiences with powered mobility through photographs and comments, highlighting both benefits and challenges. Their input was crucial in identifying real-life barriers and needs, ensuring that the study reflected the authentic experiences of families navigating powered mobility. Additionally, they provided valuable insights during interviews, contributing to a deeper understanding of the emotional, social and practical impacts of the intervention. Their perspectives helped to shape the analysis and reinforce the importance of personalised mobility solutions."

    "abstract": "As a rare disease with the largest number of cases in China, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) causes severe motor deficits as well as multi-system organ damage. Some potent drugs for SMA, such as Nusinersen (NU) and Risdiplam (RI) represented by targeted survival motor neuron gene therapy, have become a new trend in the treatment of SMA. RI has gradually attracted attention due to its ease of administration, safety, and efficacy. The study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of RI and NU for the treatment of SMA in China from the perspective of the healthcare system. We constructed a five-state Markov model based on the different stages of SMA. The willingness-to-pay threshold was chosen to be 1-3 times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. The base-case analysis was used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The ICER value was ¥132,402.10/QALY, which was in the range of 1-3 times GDP per capita. Sensitivity analysis results showed the cost of RI and NU had a significant effect on ICER as well as proving the stability of results. RI is a cost-effective option compared to NU in SMA treatment."

This study focused on analysis of the postmarketing adverse events(AEs) of onasemnogene abeparvovec (OA) reported in the US Food and Drug Administration public data open project (openFDA) database to assess the safety of OA in the real world and to provide a reference for the rational use of this drug in the clinic. In total, 1,959 AEs were reported with \"onasemnogene abeparvovec\" as the primary suspected drug. The top 5 most frequent AEs were pyrexia (461 cases), vomiting (434 cases), aspartate aminotransferase increase (284 cases), alanine aminotransferase increase (260 cases), and hepatic enzyme increase (237 cases). A total of 77 alert signals were generated, 60 of which were not included in the drug label. The top 5 signals included troponin I increase ( ROR of 895.21, 95% CI: 734.43-1091.18), troponin T increase ( ROR of 313.30, 95% CI:220.85-444.44), rhinovirus infection ( ROR of 175.80, 95% CI:130.86-236.17), troponin increase ( ROR of 143.49, 95% CI:114.96-179.10), and increased bronchial secretion ( ROR of 142.71, 95% CI:96.63-210.77). Further analysis of AEs associated with gender and age differences identified 14 high-risk signals related to gender and 10 high-risk signals related to age. Female patients should be vigilant for vomiting, thrombotic microangiopathy, increased troponin T, proteinuria, haematuria, haemolytic anaemia, urinary tract infection, generalised oedema, and atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Male patients should be alert to increased hepatic enzyme, increased bronchial secretion, respiratory tract infection, pallor, and increased blood creatine phosphokinase MB. Patients under 2 years of age should be vigilant for lethargy, increased monocyte count, decreased blood creatinine, and decreased neutrophil count. Patients over 2 years of age should be alert to hypertension, haematuria, rhinovirus infection, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, headache, and malaise. Mining of OA alert signals using the openFDA database provides supplementary information on AEs not included in the drug label. Clinical attention should be focused on common, strong-signal, and label-unmentioned AEs to optimise medication regimens and control risks in clinical use."

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a disability that causes severe traumatic damage to the central nervous system, with increasing prevalence worldwide. Paclitaxel (PTX) is a naturally occurring plant metabolite that has been shown to exhibit various neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system, however, the specific mechanisms underlying its protective effects in SCI remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore the therapeutic effects of PTX in SCI, as well as elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with its neuroprotective potential. Murine models of spinal cord compression were performed followed by intrathecal administration of corresponding agents for 21 days. Mice were randomly divided into the following four groups: Sham, SCI + Saline, SCI + PTX, and SCI + PTX + XAV939. Recovery of lower limb function and strength, as well as muscular atrophy were examined via multiple scored tests. Degree of neuronal and axonal damage, as well as fibrosis were examined via immunohistochemical staining. PTX administration significantly improved the recovery of lower limb function and strength, prevented muscular atrophy, as well as decreased the extent of neuronal and axonal death following SCI surgery. PTX also robustly activated the Wnt/β-catenin protein signaling pathway that played a key role in its therapeutic effects. Co-administration with a Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor - XAV939, significantly abolished the beneficial effects of PTX after SCI. This study provides important new mechanistic insight on the beneficial effects of PTX in protecting against spinal cord injury, as well as the experimental basis for its potential therapeutic use."

    "abstract": "Respiratory involvement has been identified as a cardinal feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) since its earliest descriptions in the 19th century. Since these initial reports, considerable research has been undertaken to clarify the pathophysiology and progression rates associated with respiratory compromise and effective management strategies have been developed. Clinical trials routinely incorporate respiratory measures as study end points, non-invasive ventilation is now widely used in the home setting, cough-assist techniques are commonly used, advanced neurophysiology techniques and wearable technologies have been integrated into respiratory monitoring protocols, and palliative guidelines have been developed to effectively manage respiratory distress. Despite the widespread implementation of these interventions, epidemiology studies are inconsistent and some studies suggest that survival in ALS has not improved significantly with the introduction of these measures. The outcomes of diaphragmatic pacing trials have been disappointing, advanced neurophysiology techniques are not routinely utilised, spinal and brainstem imaging are not commonly undertaken and significant geographical differences exist in proceeding to tracheostomy. The worldwide COVID pandemic has given impetus for remote monitoring, connected devices, video-consultations, and timely vaccinations in ALS; lessons that are invaluable long after the pandemic. Respiratory monitoring and management in ALS is a swiftly evolving facet of ALS care with considerable quality of life benefits."

    "abstract": "The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a highly conserved ribonucleoprotein (RNP) that translocates a subset of secreted and integral membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum for proper localization. The most conserved SRP protein component, SRP54, has been implicated in the molecular etiology of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). A key feature of SMA is the selective loss of motor neurons; however, the mechanism underlying this selectivity is unknown. SMA arises from deficient levels of the ubiquitously expressed Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) protein. SMN is proposed to assemble the SRP, and SMN deficiency in SMA may attenuate SRP function and contribute to motor neuron death in patients. Using zebrafish embryos homozygous for a srp54 nonsense mutation (srp54<sup>-/-</sup>), we investigated the requirement of Srp54 protein in motor axon development. The first grossly distinguishable phenotype observed in srp54<sup>-/-</sup> embryos was reduced motility at 30 h postfertilization (hpf). Additionally, we detected reduced length and branching of caudal primary motor axons in srp54<sup>-/-</sup> embryos compared to srp54<sup>+/+</sup> and srp54<sup>+/-</sup> siblings at 30 hpf, suggesting that defective motor neurons may contribute to the observed immotility. We also examined additional neural, secretory, and migratory cell types at 30 hpf to assess whether motor neurons are especially vulnerable to Srp54 deficiency. Of the cell types evaluated, only the hatching gland had distinct expression pattern alterations in srp54<sup>-/-</sup> embryos at this developmental stage. Our findings suggest that Srp54 deficiency results in motor neuron developmental defects and support the hypothesis that SRP54 may influence motor neuron selectivity in SMA."

    "abstract": "Muscle atrophy in the dorsal muscle group (DMG) is associated with physical activity (PA) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, no studies have separately evaluated the erector spinae muscle (ESM) and the multifidus muscle (MM) within the DMG, leaving the distinct impact of each muscle on PA unclear. This study evaluated the differences in muscle characteristics between ESM and MM in stable patients with COPD. In Study 1, we evaluated the relationship between the cross-sectional area of ESM (ESM<sub>CSA</sub>) and MM (MM<sub>CSA</sub>) on chest computed tomography and PA parameters. In Study 2, as a pilot study, we analyzed the muscle fatigue characteristics of ESM and MM using a trunk holding test and electromyographic (EMG) power spectrum analysis to evaluate the median frequency (MF) slope. We then evaluated the differences in the MF slopes of both muscles in patients with COPD compared with healthy subjects. Of 77 patients with COPD, the MM<sub>CSA</sub> was positively associated with the duration of PA at ≥3.0 metabolic equivalents (METs) (r=0.279, p=0.014), whereas the ESM<sub>CSA</sub> was negatively associated with the duration of behavior at 1.0-1.5 METs (r=-0.429, p<0.001). The MF slopes of the MM were significantly lower in COPD patients (n=7) than in healthy subjects (n=28) (p<0.01), indicating greater fatigue, with no significant differences in MF slopes for ESM or trunk extension holding time. These results indicate that the functional characteristics of the ESM and MM differ in COPD patients. MM was mainly associated with moderate-to-vigorous PA and involved greater fatigue in COPD patients compared to healthy subjects, while the ESM was mainly associated with sedentary behavior."

To evaluate the effectiveness of a 2-year pilot SCID NBS program in the Czech Republic, emphasising the utility of combined TREC/KREC screening. Between January 2022 and December 2023, a dual TREC/KREC NBS pilot was conducted across the Czech Republic, alongside spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) screening. Approximately 200,000 newborns were screened using quantitative real-time PCR on dried blood spots collected 48-72 h after birth. The pilot referred 58 newborns, identifying 21 cases of IEI, including two SCID cases, with an overall incidence of TREC/KREC screenable IEI of 10.5/100,000 newborns. SCID incidence was 1/100,000. KREC screening proved invaluable, detecting 10 cases of congenital agammaglobulinemia including novel non-XLA forms, which increased the estimated incidence of agammaglobulinemia in the Czech Republic sixfold. Over one-third of low KREC results were linked to maternal immunosuppression. The Czech pilot demonstrated the effectiveness of integrated TREC/KREC NBS in detecting both T- and B-cell immunodeficiencies. As of 2024, SCID and SMA screening are included in the nationwide NBS, with KREC screening significantly improving early detection of B-cell disorders."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disease caused by the degeneration of spinal motor neurons due to a deficiency in survival motor neuron protein (SMN) protein, leading to progressive muscle atrophy and weakness. nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide that increases SMN protein expression, has shown effectiveness in both pediatric and adult patients with SMA. While it is administrated every 4 months during the maintenance period in most countries, the dosing interval is 6 months in Japan. The impact of this dosing difference on long-term outcomes is not fully understood. This study evaluates the long-term efficacy of the 6-month dosing protocol of nusinersen in adult SMA patients. We assessed 14 adult patients treated with nusinersen every 6 months over a period of up to 39 months using the Hammersmith Function Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) and Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM). The results were compared with those from a recent cohort study of adult SMA patients in Europe. For ambulatory patients, the mean changes in HFMSE scores at 15, 27, and 39 months were 6.7, 8.3, and 8.0 points, respectively. These results were similar to those observed in the European cohort. In contrast, for nonambulatory patients, the mean changes in HFSME scores were -0.3, -1.4, and -1.3 points, and the mean changes in RULM scores were 2.0, 0.5, and 1.0 points at the same time points. These results were generally less favorable compared to the European cohort but did not reach clinically meaningful deterioration. The findings of this study suggest that the 6-month nusinersen dosing protocol provides sustained long-term benefits for ambulatory adult SMA patients. For nonambulatory patients, the 6-month protocol appears less effective than the 4-month protocol. We believe that future nusinersen treatment strategies for adult SMA patients should be flexible, with adjustments based on disease severity. In particular, increasing the dosing frequency and/or dosage in nonambulatory patients may lead to greater improvements."

This study seeks to characterize unmet needs that adults with SMA hope future therapies will address and explores associations between reported needs and health status and demographic characteristics. Close-ended questions from 2021 to 2023 Cure SMA Community Update Survey data were used to assess the importance of needs related to muscle and motor function, lung function and bulbar function, and general functioning. Data was stratified by SMA type and mobility status, and Fisher's exact tests were used to assess for statistically significant differences based on these characteristics. Variations in reported needs were further explored with regressions controlling for sex, education, maximum mobility, and drug treatment status. The sample included 410 adults who answered questions on unmet needs. Most had type 2 or type 3 SMA (48% and 45%, respectively). Gaining muscle strength was the most frequently reported unmet need, and followed by improving daily functioning, achieving new motor function, and stabilizing motor function. Stratifications and regressions identified statistically significant differences in treatment needs based on health status and demographic characteristics (p < 0.05). Most notably, people with more severe types of SMA and lower mobility were more likely to report items related to lung function and bulbar function as important. This research highlights treatment priorities for adults with SMA."

Tau proteins and neurofilaments are well known markers of neuro-axonal damages. The neurofilament light protein (NfL) has been proposed as a possible biomarker in SMA. This study aimed to investigate the role of total-tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau at 181 sites (p-tau 181), NfL, and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNfH) proteins as potential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of disease severity and/or nusinersen treatment response in 14 SMA type 1 patients with a wide age range (2-156 months). Motor functions were assessed using the \"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders\" (CHOP-INTEND) scale at baseline, six months and ten months after treatment. Eight out of 14 patients showed motor improvement. At baseline CSF t-tau and p-tau181 concentration showed a significant negative correlation with age (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0054 respectively) and a positive correlation with the CHOP-INTEND score (p = 0.0075 and p = 0.0342, respectively). After treatment the tau biomarkers did not show any change, whereas NfL and pNfH concentration significantly decreased (p = 0.0001). The NfL concentration decline correlated to age at baseline (p < 0.05) and to the improvement of the CHOP-INTEND motor score, in the subgroup of patients with a functional improvement above 3 points (p < 0.05). CSF neurofilaments and particularly NfL may bepromising biomarkers for monitoring treatment response to nusinersen, both in younger and older patients with severe SMA."

In this prospective observational study, 28 adult SMA patients were followed for 18 months. Data on motor function and daily activities were collected using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), 6-Minute Walking Test (6WMT), and Barthel Index (BI). Serum levels of creatinine (Cr), creatine kinase (CK), and CCR were measured. Spearman correlation and linear mixed models analyzed the relationships between functional scores and laboratory indicators. HFMSE scores showed significant improvement at Visit 5 (V5) [+ 1.04 points, p = 0.016), V6 (+ 1.61, p = 0.012), V7 (+ 1.93, p < 0.001), and V8 (+ 1.89, p < 0.001)], while RULM scores improved significantly at V5 (+ 2.00 points, p = 0.024), V7 (+ 2.00, p = 0.032), and V8 (+ 2.00, p < 0.001). The BI also exhibited significant improvement at V7 (+ 5.00, p < 0.001) and V8 (+ 2.50, p < 0.001). The 6MWT did not show significant improvement (p > 0.05). Serum CCR levels were significantly higher than baseline at V5 (+ 4.35 points, p < 0.001), V7 (+ 5.12, p < 0.001), and V8 (+ 6.59, p < 0.001). Cr levels were significantly higher than baseline at V5 (+ 2.39 points, p < 0.001) and V7 (+ 0.90, p < 0.001), while log10 CK levels remained unchanged (p > 0.05). Spearman correlation analysis revealed CCR showed the strongest correlation with functional scores, followed by Cr and log10 CK. Further linear mixed-effect model indicated that after adjusting for covariates, only CCR showed a dynamic positive correlation with HFMSE scores (β = 0.280; 95% CI 0.023-0.537, p = 0.033), while other serum indicators had no correlation with functional scores. Long-term use of nusinersen effectively improves motor function and quality of life in adult SMA patients, and CCR may be a better indicator to reflect changes in motor function during treatment compared to other blood biomarkers."

We report a severe late-onset aseptic brain stem meningoencephalitis in a 42-year-old man with type III SMA, occurring 38 months after starting nusinersen. The patient showed clinical and radiological signs of brain stem meningoencephalitis with significant CSF neutrophilic pleocytosis, despite negative infectious disease tests. After high-dose steroids and tapering, symptoms and imaging findings resolved. This case suggests a potential link between nusinersen and aseptic meningoencephalitis in adult SMA, extending previous reports of rare drug-induced aseptic meningitis. Physicians should consider this as a possible adverse event in patients undergoing intrathecal nusinersen therapy."

    "title": "Serial casting for contractures in SMA: consensus derived guidelines for treatment.",
    "abstract": "Individuals with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) often present with muscle contractures. Serial casting has been used in a variety of other peripheral nerve, muscle, and central nervous system disorders to improve knee and ankle range of motion limitations and functional performance in both ambulatory and non-ambulatory individuals. The goal of this study was to reach a consensus about the parameters, considerations and general guidelines that should inform practice when serial casting to improve flexibility in individuals with SMA. This international effort was conducted between August 2020 and May 2023. An expert panel of physical therapists was assembled with multiple panel meetings and a 2-round Delphi survey performed covering topics relevant to serial casting which included three domains: clinical appropriateness, program-based considerations and program adherence/feasibility. Consensus was reached for all items in the three topic areas using a validity index of >75%. Following completion of the Delphi survey, community insights from patients and caregivers were collected via semi-structured interview. This study included the synthesis of meetings from the initial expert panel which produced a comprehensive survey for the different considerations when performing serial casting for an individual with SMA. The study also included the completion of a Delphi survey by 18 therapists in round 1 and 15 therapists in round 2 for a consensus on 296 items. Strong consensus was obtained in all three domains with 96.6% agreement for clinical appropriateness, 95.0% agreement for program-based considerations, and 96.9% for program adherence/feasibility. A guideline document was developed enumerating the specific items detailed in the survey. Community perspectives were utilized to support the results of the Delphi survey and to add insight into real-world experience. The serial casting guidelines developed upon collaborative discussions from the expert panel and from the Delphi survey consensus and semi-structured interviews, should be utilized when applying serial casts to patients with spinal muscular atrophy. Future endeavors should look to apply the guideline recommendations to determine casting efficacy for improving joint contracture and impact on function for those with SMA."

    "title": "The safety of COVID-19 vaccines in a large French series of patients with neuromuscular conditions and the impacts of vaccination on their daily lives.",
    "abstract": "This prospective observational study assessed how well patients with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) tolerated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination, and the safety thereof. Patients treated in 55 expert centres of the French NMD (FILNEMUS) network were asked to complete online questionnaires that explored COVID-19 vaccine injection status, adverse effects (AEs), and the impacts thereof on the activities of daily living (ADLs). All patients were followed-up for 12 months. We enrolled 1,020 patients with various NMDs; 38% with myopathy, 33% peripheral neuropathy, 20% myasthenia and 5% spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Of all patients, 18% were on immune system-modifying therapies. A total of 1,865 vaccine injections were given. Of all patients, 70.4% lacked AEs impacting ADLs (they experienced no AEs or minor AEs), 20.4% reported AEs compromising ADLs, 9% AEs preventing ADLs and 0.2% AEs that required hospitalisation. We found no association between AEs impacting ADLs and the NMD type, physiopathology, or treatment. However, correlations were found between the development of AEs that impacted ADLs and both the modified Rankin score at baseline and vaccination with mRNA-1273 (Moderna). The AE types and frequencies were similar to those of the general population. Our study is reassuring; COVID-19 vaccination is safe for patients with NMDs including those with immune system-mediated diseases and those who are receiving immune system-modifying therapies. Patients with severe disabilities were at an increased risk of AEs that impacted ADLs but this must be weighed against the fact that they are also at increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Our mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine findings require confirmation; few patients received this vaccine compared to those injected with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech)."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe neuromuscular disorder caused by the loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Our team has initiated clinical trials using adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vectors carrying a codon-optimized human SMN1 (coSMN1) gene, delivered via intrathecal (IT) injection. Here, we present the preclinical research that laid the groundwork for these trials, offering comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety of AAV9-coSMN1 in both murine models and non-human primates. We developed a codon-optimized hSMN1 expression cassette and analyzed SMN protein levels using Western blot and immunofluorescence. Taiwanese SMA-like mouse model was employed to assess tail length preservation, as well as to examine motor neuron and skeletal muscle pathological phenotypes through immunofluorescence and histopathological staining. Serum biomarkers in both mice and cynomolgus monkeys were measured using a blood chemistry analyzer. The in-vivo biodistribution of AAV9-coSMN1 and toxicological profile were investigated through quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction(qPCR) and histopathological staining. Codon optimization of hSMN1 led to enhanced gene expression and increased SMN protein levels in vitro. AAV9-coSMN1 demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy in a Type 3 SMA mouse model, effectively rescuing motor neurons, preserving tail integrity, and improving skeletal muscle histopathology. In vivo studies, both mice and cynomolgus monkeys revealed widespread CNS distribution following a single intracerebroventricular or intrathecal injection, with no observed toxic inflammatory responses in the dorsal root ganglia. Peripheral organs also showed detectable levels of the vector gene, indicating effective systemic distribution. The preclinical evaluation confirms that AAV9-coSMN1 is a safe and effective therapeutic candidate for SMA, with potential applicability across various phenotypes. The study provides critical data supporting its advancement to clinical trials, underscoring its promise for broader neurological applications."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Multiple sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) characterized by progressive neuronal degeneration. Recent studies provide compelling information regarding the contribution of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), a potent neuropeptide, in regulating neuroinflammation, vasodilation, and neuronal survival in these disorders. This review systematically delves into the multidimensional aspects of CGRP as both a neuroprotective agent and a neurotoxic factor in NDDs. The neuroprotective effects of CGRP include suppression of inflammation, regulation of intracellular signaling pathways, and promotion of neuronal growth and survival. However, under pathological conditions, its overexpression or dysregulation is associated with oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and neuronal death. The therapeutic use of CGRP and its receptor antagonists in migraine provides substantial evidence for CGRP's therapeutic potential, which can be further explored for the management of NDDs. However, since the bidirectional nature of CGRP effects is evident, it is crucial to gain an accurate insight into its mechanisms to target only the neuropeptide's beneficial effects while completely avoiding the undesired consequences. Further studies should focus on understanding the context-dependent activity of CGRP in the hope of designing targeted therapy for NDDs, which could gradually transform the current pharmacological management of NDDs."

This study aimed to elucidate distributions and characteristics of fasciculations in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) and to compare the results of those in ALS. In 24 SBMA and 16 ALS patients, muscle ultrasonography was systematically performed in the tongue, upper limb muscles (biceps brachii, triceps brachii, first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor pollicis brevis and abductor digiti minimi), trunk muscles (Th10 paraspinals and rectus abdominis) and lower limb muscles (vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius). We assessed the presence of fasciculations and the fasciculation intensity (scored from 0 to 3) for each muscle. All SBMA and ALS patients showed fasciculations at least in two muscles. In SBMA patients, fasciculations were most frequently found in the tongue (100%), FDI (93%) and tibialis anterior (80%), whereas less frequently present in the proximal limb and trunk muscles, irrespective of age, disease duration and CAG repeat numbers. By contrast, in ALS patients, fasciculations were more diffusely distributed including the proximal limb and trunk muscles. When fasciculations were present, the intensity was higher in ALS patients, except for the tongue. Whereas both diseases exhibit extensive fasciculations, the distribution and intensity are different. SBMA is characterised by prominent involvement in the tongue and distal limb muscles, suggesting different pathophysiology of motor neuronal death in SBMA and ALS."

    "abstract": "Rehabilitation therapy is an important approach for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) management. Currently, rare articles introduce that the combination of nusinersen and rehabilitation yields better results in SMA patients compared to using nusinersen alone. The present study examined whether rehabilitation therapy can improve the effectiveness of nusinersen and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNF-H) and muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can serve as potential biomarkers for evaluating the therapeutic effects in type-2 SMA patients. This observational study enrolled 22 pediatric patients with type-2 SMA. Enrolled patients were divided into two groups based on the rehabilitation treatment. Motor function and swallowing function were analyzed at baseline, 6, 10, and 14 months. The level of pNF-H and MRI of the thigh skeletal muscles were analyzed at baseline and 14 months. Greater improvement in motor function was observed in the rehabilitation group compared with the non-rehabilitation group. The levels of pNF-H in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid significantly decreased at 14 months. One patient from the rehabilitation treatment group showed mild improvement in the degree of fatty infiltration in the quadriceps muscles after 14 months. This study suggests that rehabilitation therapy improves the effectiveness of nusinersen on type-2 SMA patients, and the levels of pNF-H and skeletal muscle MRI can serve as potential biomarkers for evaluating the effectiveness of SMA treatment."

    "abstract": "This analysis evaluated the cost-effectiveness of newborn screening (NBS) for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) from the perspective of Australian state hospital payers. A cost-utility analysis consisting of a decision tree and Markov cohort designed to calculate the difference in costs and health outcomes between two scenarios: (1) disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for SMA after diagnosis through NBS, and (2) DMT for SMA after diagnosis as symptoms appear. A population of 295,906 newborns was modeled, based on the total number of live births in Australia in 2023. Inputs included screening parameters, epidemiology inputs, SMA natural history data and DMT parameters (nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec), costs, and health-related quality of life parameters. Assumed participation in NBS was 100%. A one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to examine the impact of parameter uncertainty. There were 30 patients identified with SMA, of whom 25 patients would be eligible for presymptomatic treatment. NBS for SMA was dominant compared with no NBS for SMA. On a population level, NBS demonstrated a lifetime gain of 267 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and incremental costs of -AUD$3,983,263 (i.e., cost savings). Every dollar invested in NBS would save hospitals $3.69. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the base-case results. NBS for SMA was dominant compared with no NBS for SMA in Australia from a state and territory payer perspective. Universal implementation of NBS for SMA would support access equity, as well as early diagnosis and treatment in infants with SMA, potentially leading to improved outcomes."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease that leads to loss of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord with consequent muscle atrophy. SMA results from the functional deletions of the SMN1 gene, resulting in insufficient production of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. It is not known why lower motor neurons are particularly sensitive to the loss of SMN function, but it is increasingly apparent that extraneuronal tissues, such as cardiac and skeletal muscle, are also affected by SMN deficiency. We have previously shown that SMN deficiency in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMNΔ7) impairs cardiomyocyte contraction and Ca2+ handling. In this study, we performed a comparative total mRNA sequencing analysis of whole hearts isolated at an early (P5) or late (P10) stage of the disease process to investigate the mechanisms contributing to cardiac pathology in SMA. The results demonstrate transcriptional signatures consistent with heart failure, dysregulation of Ca2+ signaling, and hypoxia induced changes occurring as early as P5 and persisting through P10. Similar transcriptomic changes in skeletal muscle tissue indicate that there are likely common, cell autonomous molecular mechanisms resulting in both cardiac and skeletal muscle due to SMN deficiency. The identification of these common themes suggests a link underlying the mechanism of neuronal and non-neuronal deficits in SMA."

    "abstract": "Puncture training with simulation models has emerged as a critical method for transmitting puncture skills, improving success rates, and minimizing injuries. Yet, obstacles such as proper material for ultrasound guidance, restricted options of 3D printing resources, and available substances to simulate human skin and muscle still hinder the production of simulation models that closely replicate clinical practice. This study aimed to develop a selective laser melting (SLM), 3D-printed simulation model that replicated the spine and skin contours of patients with spinal scoliosis. The 3D models of the scoliotic spines were developed from 3D reconstructions of high-resolution, computed tomography images from patients with spinal scoliosis, while the models of the skin to the bone structure were constructed based on the 3D reconstructions of the skin contours. SLM technology was used to print 3D models of the patients' spines. Gelatin casting was implemented to simulate the patients' skin and muscle tissues and to meet ultrasound anatomical requirements. Practical puncture training, which closely resembles clinical puncture practice, was then carried out to validate the effectiveness of the model. Improvements in proficiency and confidence in performing ultrasound-guided punctures after the simulation-model training were evaluated using the paired sample t test. This research utilized 3D digital modeling, SLM 3D printing technology, and gelatin casting to establish simulation models of patients' spines and skin contours impacted by spinal scoliosis. The use of medical grade stainless steel material for modeling the spine and gelatin for skin and muscle tissues ensured the model had superior ultrasound anatomical properties. After the simulation training session, participants' proficiency and confidence in both ultrasound-assisted positioning and real-time guided puncture showed significant improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of the simulation training model. The simulation model closely mimicked real clinical situations and was an effective training tool for medical professionals. Furthermore, these findings demonstrated the potential of 3D printing technology in developing simulation models that closely replicate real-world clinical scenarios and may have significant implications for medical education and training."

As of March 2025, four ASO-based therapies have received approval for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR). These approvals underscore the therapeutic potential of ASOs as effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases by addressing specific genetic abnormalities. This is best demonstrated by clinical studies in more than a dozen ASOs, which could pave the way for the development of new therapeutics soon. Moreover, the ongoing extended clinical studies, which target presymptomatic carriers, have significant potential to cure familial ALS based on the SOD1 gene mutation.

    "title": "Development and Assessment of a Soft Wearable for sEMG-Based Hand Grip Detection and Control of a Virtual Environment.",
    "abstract": "As the number of individuals diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) rises, there is a growing need to enhance both the quantity and quality of approaches used to treat these debilitating conditions. The progression of NDs can cause muscle weakness in the lower or upper limbs. We particularly focus on the area of the upper limb, specifically grip rehabilitation, by developing a system (VRGrip) that can reliably record electromyography (EMG) events of the hand flexor muscles to control an adaptive and engaging game using grip exertion. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of using the VRGrip system. We prototyped a three-component wearable system consisting of an e-textile forearm band (E-band), data acquisition module (DAM), and a computer game. This allows participants to play a game by squeezing their dominant hand. A feasibility study was completed with 9 individuals who self-reported an ND (including Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and essential tremor (ET)) and 12 individuals who self-reported to be relatively healthy (RH). Each participant completed 15 min of gameplay (three trials of five minutes), where they would squeeze a resistive ball to trigger in-game actions. The user experience was then evaluated via a User Satisfaction Evaluation Questionnaire (USEQ; scored 0-30, with 30 being best). Analysis of the grip detection reliability during the feasibility study resulted in an F1 score of 0.8343 ± 0.1208 for the healthy participant group and 0.8401 ± 0.1034 for the ND participant group. The USEQ (Avg. score: 4.65 ± 0.51) indicated that participants found the system comfortable, engaging, and enjoyable. Additionally, we potentially identified age-related changes in muscle fatigue. The results of this study demonstrate that our VRGrip system could be used for hand grip detection in a virtual environment. In the future, we aim to conduct longitudinal studies to determine if repeated use of the system has merit for grip rehabilitation."

Patients experience progressive and predominantly proximal muscular weakness and atrophy. Oculomotor disorders are currently not regarded as a typical feature of SMA. The aim of this study was to determine whether oculomotor abnormalities are present in subjects with SMA and to assess a potential relationship between the oculomotor parameters and disease duration. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: An analysis of 15 patients with SMA type 2 and type 3 and 15 age-matched healthy controls was conducted. The oculomotor performance, including the analysis of smooth pursuit velocity gain and saccades parameters (latency, velocity, accuracy) in the horizontal and vertical directions, was compared between both groups. <i>Results</i>: The analysis of smooth pursuit gain in the participants revealed a marginally significant reduction between the SMA patients and the healthy controls in the horizontal direction at a frequency of 0.2 Hz (<i>p</i> = 0.051), but no significant differences were observed at any other frequency or direction. The vertical velocity of the saccade eye movements of the SMA patients was increased compared with the healthy subjects, which was statistically significant for the amplitude of ±10° (<i>p</i> = 0.030), but not for the amplitude of ±16.5° (<i>p</i> = 0.107). The horizontal saccade latency, saccade velocity and saccade accuracy did not differ significantly between the SMA patients and the controls. None of the oculomotor parameters were associated with disease duration. <i>Conclusions</i>: While certain oculomotor abnormalities, such as increased vertical saccade velocity, were observed in the SMA patients, these findings do not indicate a defining role of oculomotor impairment in SMA pathology or its clinical characteristics."

    "abstract": "Recent findings indicate that infants with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) treated early through newborn screening (NBS) have better outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the long-term outcomes of a 5-year SMA NBS program in Taiwan. From September 2017 to August 2022, two NBS centers screened patients for SMN1 homozygous deletion using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or the Sequenom MassARRAY platform and subsequently confirmed the findings using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Implementation of SMA NBS using RT-PCR or MassARRAY platform efficiently led to the detection of neonates with homozygous survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) deletions at a median age of 9 (range 4-14) days. Among the 446,966 newborns screened, 22 were detected to have a homozygous deletion of SMN1, followed by MLPA confirmation. One patient initially showed negative screening results but was later confirmed to have a compound heterozygous mutation. Among the 23 confirmed cases, 8 patients had two SMN2 copies (all classified as SMA type 1), 11 patients had three SMN2 copies (including 4 with SMA type 1, 2 with SMA type 2, 3 with SMA type 3, and 2 asymptomatic cases), and 4 patients had four SMN2 copies (all asymptomatic). The mean (median) follow-up duration for 19 survivors was 4.2 (5.0) years. All patients with two SMN2 copies developed symptoms within 62 days; those with three SMN2 copies experienced disease onset within 1 year. After diagnosis, most patients were on a watch and wait to receive disease-modifying therapy (DMT) due to initial lack of insurance coverage and limitations on indications after coverage was granted. Of the 19 children who received DMT, the outcomes included 12 walkers, 1 walker requiring support, 3 sitters, 1 non-sitter, and 2 patients with SMA type 1b with two SMN2 copies who succumbed to acute respiratory failure. This 5-year SMA NBS study using RT-PCR or the MassARRAY platform, along with an extended follow-up, demonstrates that early diagnosis and prompt treatment can enhance SMA clinical outcomes and change its natural progression in the therapeutic era. Infants with NBS who received presymptomatic DMT had better clinical outcomes than those who received symptomatic DMT."

Current treatment guidelines describe the role of conservative treatments including cervical collars and neurotropic medications, as well as spinal surgery in select patients. Upper extremity surgery has not yet been incorporated into the treatment algorithm of HD. The objective of this study is twofold: to present a case series of HD patients treated with the incorporation of nerve and tendon transfers and joint fusions into the existing treatment algorithm and to perform a literature review of interventions. Three cases (4 limbs) of HD treated surgically with nerve and tendon transfers and fusion are retrospectively reviewed. The subjective and objective results from surgery are reported. A literature review is performed on PubMed using \"Hirayama disease\" and \"peripheral nerve surgery,\" \"nerve transfer,\" \"tendon transfer,\" \"hand surgery,\" or \"upper extremity surgery\" as search terms to identify studies describing surgical treatment of HD outside of spinal surgery. Three HD patients (4 limbs) were identified. The average age was 23 years old (range, 16-33 years). Patients presented with intrinsic muscle atrophy, hypothenar, and thenar atrophy. The disease had been present for an average of 6.5 years (range, 1.5-15 years) prior to referral. Two patients had unilateral involvement, whereas one had bilateral involvement. Two patients (3 limbs) were treated with an anterior interosseous (AIN) to ulnar motor nerve transfer, whereas a patient with delayed presentation underwent thumb metacarpophalangeal joint fusion and a Zancolli lasso to the fingers. All patients had subjective and objective improvements postoperation.The literature reveals three independent case reports of HD patients treated with upper extremity surgery. Two papers describe using a tendon transfer, whereas one paper describes an AIN to ulnar motor nerve transfer. All patients demonstrated functional improvements in follow-up. HD can be successfully treated with a combination of upper extremity surgery and nerve transfers. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first literature review and the largest case series presenting such interventions in HD."

    "abstract": "Nusinersen therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) provides significant functional improvement when initiated pre-symptomatically or early in life. However, challenges remain in diverse populations with longer disease duration. In Japan, innovative cybernic therapy with the Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) is gaining traction in treating neuromuscular diseases. This observational study investigated whether combining HAL therapy with nusinersen and conventional physiotherapy yields functional improvements in SMA, irrespective of disease duration or age. Functional improvement indicators included the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE) and Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) scores, and the 2-minute walk test (2MWT), measured 15 months post-nusinersen initiation. A cohort analysis of a selected case series was conducted. Twelve patients with SMA type 2 or 3 who met the criteria of being able to walk with a hoist and began nusinersen treatment > 40 months post-disease onset were selected for longitudinal clinical assessment. Cohort 1 (n = 5, mean age 36.0 years) underwent HAL therapy, while Cohort 2 (n = 7, 24.6 years) did not. Baseline characteristics, except mean age, were similar across cohorts. In Cohort 1, the period from baseline (nusinersen initiation) to HAL therapy ranged from 0 to 8.8 months. HFMSE scores improved in both cohorts at 15 months; the least squares mean (LSM) change from baseline (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 4.7 points (2.2, 7.3) in Cohort 1 and 2.9 points (0.7, 5.1) in Cohort 2. Clinically meaningful improvement of 3.0 points in HFSME was exceeded by four of five patients in Cohort 1 and three of seven in Cohort 2. The LSM change from baseline in RULM was 2.2 points (95% CI 1.0, 3.3) in Cohort 1, exceeding the minimal clinically important difference of 0.5-1.0 points, but remained unchanged in Cohort 2 due to ceiling effects (- 0.2; -1.5, 1.2; p = 0.016). The LSM change from baseline in the 2MWT had improved in Cohort 1 (34.57 m; 95% CI 4.57, 64.57), but not in Cohort 2 (- 3.86; -37.75, 30.03). In patients with SMA type 2 and 3, clinically meaningful improvements in multiple indicators were observed when HAL was combined with nusinersen, even when treatment commenced many years after disease onset. jRCT1090220400 ( https://jrct.niph.go.jp/en-latest-detail/jRCT1090220400 )."

Post-treatment, Three of five showed gradual improvement in motor scores, but none achieved new motor milestones. Survival rate was not improved, with all experiencing fatalities. Conversely, Type 2 patients exhibited motor score improvement without serious adverse events. OA did not significantly improve clinical outcomes or survival rates in advanced Type 1 SMA. These findings highlight need for additional caution when administering OA to severe SMA Type 1 and more specific guidelines in selecting subgroups for treatment."

    "title": "Newborn screening for spinal muscular atrophy: The potential of digital polymerase chain reaction technique.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a degenerative neuromuscular disorder caused by a homozygous SMN1 loss-of-function variant. Early detection of SMA at the pre-symptomatic stage is essential for effective therapy. Consequently, Japan initiated newborn screening (NBS) for SMA in 2021 in the Kumamoto Prefecture, following global recommendations and implementations. The current NBS protocol involves a two-step process: first, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for SMN1, followed by SMN1 and SMN2 copy number analysis using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). However, this approach is time-intensive, and qPCR alone cannot distinguish a single copy of SMN1 exon 7. The current NBS protocol is designed to detect approximately 96 % of SMA cases, specifically those with homozygous SMN1 exon 7 deletions. This study developed a digital PCR system for simultaneous analysis of SMN1 and SMN2 copy numbers to reduce the diagnostic time and improve diagnostic accuracy. Digital PCR was tested on dried blood spot (DBS) samples from 6 SMA patients (P-1 - P-6) and 386 healthy newborns. Additionally, the SMN1 and SMN2 copy numbers of the 6 patients were evaluated using MLPA. The results demonstrate that digital PCR enables simultaneous analysis of SMN1 and SMN2 copy numbers, with the outcomes for all six patients matching those obtained through MLPA. Moreover, digital PCR was more cost-effective than qPCR. Thus, digital PCR offers a practical and efficient alternative for SMA screening in NBS, enabling simultaneous analysis of SMN1 and SMN2 copy numbers while also improving the diagnostic speed and accuracy."

    "abstract": "5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron <i>(SMN)</i> gene located on chromosome 5, leading to insufficient SMN protein levels. Risdiplam is an RNA splicing modifier that modifies pre-mRNA splicing of the <i>SMN2</i> gene, thereby promoting the production of functional survival motor neuron protein (SMN-fl). This article reviews the drug trials of Risdiplam, summarizes the actual clinical data, and systematically evaluates the effectiveness and safety of this drug. By discussing the mechanism of action and economic cost of this drug and comparing it to other SMA drugs, this paper provides a reference for the clinical use of the drug and an idea for future clinical research."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare inherited neuromuscular disease classified into four main subtypes and characterized by severe muscle weakness and loss of motor function. Its high mortality rates, high treatment costs, and lengthy care requirements place a heavy burden on patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system. This study aims to explore the economic burden of SMA subtypes by analyzing costs, healthcare resource use, and loss of productivity for patients and their caregivers. We conducted a systematic literature review, searching for studies published since 2010 via Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, and gray literature databases. We extracted data concerning costs, healthcare resources, and productivity losses among SMA subtypes. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Quality of Health Economic Studies tools. We retrieved 55 studies from 32 countries with economic data variation due to the study design, location, and SMA subtype. The weighted average annual cost for an SMA patient was US$109,906 with the highest costs observed in type 1 patients, who incurred direct medical costs without disease-modifying treatments of US$187,88. The non-medical costs accounted for US$109,379 per patient, along with frequent hospitalizations and high caregiver productivity losses, requiring 2,947 hours of caregiving annually. The direct and indirect costs of SMA are substantial. The necessity for standardized approaches to evaluate and analyze the economic impact across various SMA subtypes is highlighted by the heterogeneity of the data. In order to control the financial burden of SMA, governments and healthcare systems can benefit from these insights to develop policies aimed at improving financial sustainability and patient support."

A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 10 pediatric SMA patients treated with nusinersen combined with risdiplam at the Children's Medical Center of Xiangya Hospital, Central South University. Among the 10 SMA patients, there were 4 with type I, 4 with type II, and 2 with type III. Nine patients initially received nusinersen monotherapy, while 1 patient received nusinersen combined with risdiplam. The median duration of combination therapy with nusinersen and risdiplam for the 10 patients was 10.5 months (range: 0.5-20.0 months), with 6 patients undergoing combination therapy for more than 6 months, showing improvements in motor and/or respiratory function. The remaining 4 patients had combination treatment durations of 0.5, 1.0, 1.3, and 4.0 months, respectively, with no significant overall improvement. After combined treatment, 5 patients experienced skin hyperpigmentation, 2 had lumbar puncture site pain, 1 experienced vomiting, 1 had increased sputum production, and 1 had reduced total sleep time. All adverse reactions were mild and did not require medical intervention. Nusinersen combined with risdiplam demonstrates efficacy in the treatment of SMA, and no significant adverse reactions have been observed."

    "abstract": "Using the Australian Census survey 2021 as base population, a microsimulation model, PreconMOD was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of population-based expanded reproductive carrier screening (RCS) for 569 recessive conditions from the health service and societal perspectives. The model simulated the effect of expanded RCS including the downstream interventions for at-risk couples on cost and outcomes. The comparators were (i) no population screening (ii) limited screening for cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and fragile X syndrome and (iii) a 300 conditions screening panel. Averted affected births and health service cost with expanded RCS were projected to year 2061. At a 50% uptake, our model predicts that expanded RCS is cost saving (i.e., higher quality-adjusted life-years and lower costs) compared with other screening strategies in the model from the health service and societal perspectives. The number of affected births averted in a single cohort would increase from 84 [95% confidence interval (CI) 60-116] with limited screening to 2067 (95%CI 1808-2376) with expanded RCS. Expanded RCS was cost-saving compared to the 300-conditions screening panel. Indirect cost accounted for about one-third of the total costs associated with recessive disorders. Our model predicts that the direct treatment cost associated with current limited 3 genes screening would increase by 20% each year to A$73.4 billion to the health system by 2061. Our findings contribute insights on the cost burden of genetic diseases and the economic benefits of expanded RCS to better informed resource allocation decisions."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by ubiquitous deficiency in the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. The identification of effectors and modifiers of pathogenic events downstream of SMN deficiency is key to understanding disease mechanisms and broadening the range of targets for developing SMA therapies that can complement SMN upregulation. Here, we report a cell-based phenotypic screen for chemical modifiers of SMN biology that identified inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) as suppressors of proliferation defects induced by SMN deficiency in mouse fibroblasts. We further show that SMN deficiency induces p38 MAPK activation and that pharmacological inhibition of this pathway improves motor function in SMA mice through SMN-independent neuroprotective effects. Using a highly optimized p38 MAPK inhibitor (MW150) and a specific paradigm of combinatorial treatment in SMA mice, we observed synergistic enhancement of the phenotypic benefit induced by either MW150 or an SMN-inducing drug alone. By promoting survival of motor neurons, pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK synergizes with SMN induction and enables enhanced synaptic rewiring of motor neurons within sensory-motor spinal circuits, resulting in increased motor function, weight gain, and survival of SMA mice. Together, our studies identify the p38 MAPK pathway as a therapeutic target and MW150 as a candidate pharmacological approach for SMN-independent neuroprotection with clinical relevance for combination therapy in SMA."

    "abstract": "Growing interest in the role of the immune response in Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) has led to widespread use of fluid inflammatory markers in research studies. To standardize the use and interpretation of inflammatory markers in AD research, we build upon prior guidelines to develop consensus statements and recommendations to advance application and interpretation of these markers. In this roadmap paper, we propose a glossary of terms related to the immune response in the context of biomarker discovery/validation, discuss current conceptualizations of inflammatory markers in research, and recommend best practices to address key knowledge gaps. We also provide consensus principles to summarize primary conceptual, methodological, and interpretative issues facing the field: (1) a single inflammatory marker is likely insufficient to describe an entire biological cascade, and multiple markers with similar or distinct functions should be simultaneously measured in a panel; (2) association studies in humans are insufficient to infer causal relationships or mechanisms; (3) neuroinflammation displays time-dependent and disease context-dependent patterns; (4) neuroinflammatory mechanisms should not be inferred based solely on blood inflammatory marker changes; and (5) standardized reporting of CSF inflammatory marker assay validation and performance will improve incorporation of inflammatory markers into the biological AD criteria."

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, resulting in progressive limb muscle weakness, atrophy, and severe scoliosis. Clinically, it is divided into four types according to age at onset and severity. There are few cases reported in the literature presently, especially type II cases, and no expert consensus or guideline for the anesthetic management of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with scoliosis. This article discusses anesthesia management and intraoperative considerations for this patient, as well as how to help the patient reduce perioperative complications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of continuous thoracolumbar dorsal ramus nerve block for pain relief after scoliosis surgery in a patient with spinal muscular atrophy type II. We described a 17-year-old patient with spinal muscular atrophy scoliosis (SMA type II) who underwent posterior scoliosis osteotomy and orthopedic laminectomy and fusion under general anesthesia without muscle relaxants, A series of optimized anesthesia management measures were successfully implemented, aiming to reduce perioperative related complications. After the operation, continuous thoracolumbar dorsal ramus nerve block was carried out and achieved a good analgesic effect. The patient was discharged 33 days after hospitalization. It is indicated that anesthesia management for patients with SMA is a real challenge for all anesthesia providers. For patients with SMA undergoing scoliosis surgery, total intravenous anesthesia without muscle relaxants and continuous thoracolumbar dorsal ramus nerve block after surgery have been proven to be both efficient and safe. It is also crucial to implement preoperative multidisciplinary consultation, lung-protective ventilation strategy, appropriate anesthetic drugs, reasonable blood transfusion scheme, as well as strengthened postoperative monitoring and multimodal analgesia."

In this study, we aimed to report surgical outcomes and complications for SMA patients with severe scoliosis and pelvic obliquity. A retrospective review of data on operatively treated SMA patients with severe scoliosis and pelvic obliquity (minimum major coronal curve Cobb angle > 100° and pelvic obliquity > 20°) was performed. Radiography findings, pulmonary function, motor status, the sitting function score, and perioperative and postoperative complications were the main clinical outcomes examined. Muscular dystrophy spine questionnaire (MDSQ) responses and caregiver responses to four anchor questions (quality of life/comfort/ease of care/overall health) using Likert scales were recorded. Of 28 consecutive patients, 22 (79%) completed the minimum 2-year follow-up (mean age at surgery = 16.1, 68% female). The mean follow-up duration was 40.3-mo. All patients underwent one-stage posterior spinal fusion (PSF) with pelvic fixation. Radiographic measurements (main coronal curve, kyphosis, pelvic obliquity) were significantly corrected (all p < 0.001) and were maintained at the last follow-up. The mean forced vital capacity (FVC) remained stable during follow-up, with 50% of patients showing improvement. The percentage of patients who could sit independently increased significantly from 22.7% preoperatively to 77.3% postoperatively (p < 0.001). The total sitting-related MDSQ score significantly increased from 8.5 to 12.5 at 6 months postoperatively, and to 15.0 at the last follow-up (p < 0.001). Six instances of complications (two instances each of pneumonia, epiglottic edema, and delayed wound healing) occurred perioperatively in six patients (27.3%), but no surgical intervention was required. Operative treatment significantly improved radiographic parameters and sitting function and maintained pulmonary function without serious complications in SMA patients with severe scoliosis and pelvic obliquity."

Recent genetic-based therapies, such as nusinersen, have transformed disease outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of nusinersen on motor, bulbar, and respiratory functions in both symptomatic and presymptomatic SMA Type 1 patients over a period of up to 4 years. This prospective, non-interventional study included 310 patients with genetically confirmed spinal muscular atrophy at 24 pediatric neurology centers in Turkey. Patients treated with nusinersen were divided into five age-based cohorts at treatment initiation: Cohort A (0-3 months), Cohort B (4-6 months), Cohort C (7-12 months), Cohort D (13-24 months), and Cohort E (>24 months). Efficacy was assessed using the CHOP-INTEND and WHO Motor Milestone Scale. This study also analyzed the respiratory support needs, gastrostomy requirements, and mortality rates across cohorts. Patients treated before 12 months of age showed the most significant improvements in motor milestones, with 58.7% of Cohort A achieving independent sitting. CHOP-INTEND scores increased notably in all cohorts, with the largest improvement observed in Cohort A (93.5%). Ventilator and gastrostomy requirements decreased in the early treated cohorts. Adverse events were rare, with one discontinuation due to hydrocephalus. The overall mortality rate was 21.3%, with most of the deaths occurring within the first year. Nusinersen treatment initiated before 12 months of age, especially before 3 months of age, yielded the most favorable motor outcomes in patients with SMA type 1. Early initiation is associated with improved motor milestones and reduced need for ventilatory support. However, no significant improvements were observed in the bulbar function or in patients requiring extensive respiratory support."

Questionnaires were sent to 658 dental medicine institutions nationwide. Between October 25 and December 31, 2021, we targeted dental hospitals, dental and oral surgery departments from university hospitals, and dental treatment facilities registered with the Japanese Society of Disability Dentistry that had pediatric dentistry, disability dentistry, or eating function therapy departments. A questionnaire survey was conducted on the following topics: whether or not the dental clinic had experience in treating patients with neuromuscular disorders, breakdown of diseases and annual number of patients, oral symptoms, treatment content, frequency of hospital visits, problems faced by patients and their families in terms of dental treatment, and points that dental healthcare professionals pay particular attention to when treating patients. Responses were received from 215 facilities. Muscular dystrophy was the most common disease affecting patients who were treated in the course of a year, accounting for approximately 40% of the total. The most common oral symptom was periodontitis, and the treatment for it consisted of oral care (including removal of tartar and plaque), performed in approximately half of the patients, followed by general dental treatment and swallowing training. Oral care was carried out regularly. The main problems faced by the patients were difficulties with self-care on the part of the patients and their families, and difficulties with attending hospital appointments due to a lack of social support. Lack of acceptance at local dental clinics was also mentioned. Treatment considerations that required particular attention from the medical staff were the most frequent, with the most common being adequate positioning to prevent aspiration and ensure appropriate suction. In addition, a third party was requested to accompany the patient when attending hospital appointments, and vital signs were checked during treatment. Many patients with neuromuscular syndromes have oral diseases such as periodontitis and dental caries, as well as dysphagia, and require the intervention of dentists. However, dental professionals may not always be prepared to accept these patients. It is urgent for dentists to deepen their knowledge about the appropriate treatment for these patients and build a system capable of accepting them, while maintaining close cooperation with the medical profession."

This is a retrospective, multicenter, observational study including individuals with SMA type 2, aged between 30 months and 20 years at the time of their first RULM assessment, with available follow-up data. We enrolled 149 untreated individuals as part of the natural history cohort, with a mean age of 9.5 years at the first assessment and a mean follow-up duration of 3.98 years (SD 1.97, range 0.3-7.7). An increase in RULM scores was observed in early childhood within this cohort. However, after 4.4 years of age, a gradual decline in RULM scores was noted with increasing age. In contrast, RULM scores were significantly higher in individuals receiving treatment with nusinersen or risdiplam compared to natural history data. Our findings provide a natural history of upper extremity motor function in children and adolescents with SMA type 2. The RULM scores typically improve during the early years of life, peaking around 4.4 years of age, after which they progressively decline with age. The data presented here will facilitate the assessment of treatment response in individuals with SMA type 2, especially in those with already severely limited motor function."

In children with SMA, where due to the degenerative nature a deterioration in swallowing function in the first months of life is possible despite disease-modifying therapy, regular monitoring is required. The DySMA (Dysphagia in Spinal Muscular Atrophy) is a tool available to assess both physiological feeding development and specific abnormalities in children with SMA. We aimed to generate normative data for the DySMA in a sample of healthy infants to facilitate comparisons with children with SMA. Healthy infants and toddlers aged zero to 24 months were recruited and divided into seven age groups. Two speech-language pathologists assessed the children according to the DySMA study protocol. The data were evaluated descriptively and the inter-rater reliability was calculated. A total of 92 healthy children were included. The DySMA total score ranged from 21 to 35 and showed excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC = .936; 95 % CI .752 to .984). The maximum score of 35 was first reached from 16 months onwards. Categories representing physiological development showed the most significant age-dependent changes, while no age-related development was observed in categories expressing pathology. The DySMA effectively captures physiological feeding development. A higher total score reflects more comprehensive skills in children, while a lower score indicates a reduced range of abilities. By analyzing the normative sample, this tool makes it possible to represent a deviation from the norm for children with SMA."

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerdosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are motor neuron diseases associated with distinct metabolic alterations. ALS patients feature an increased resting energy expenditure (REE) causing weight loss and cachexia. In SMA, a disturbed utilization of free fatty acids has been described. These metabolic alterations negatively affect prognosis in both diseases. The objective of this study was to further characterize these changes to identify potential therapeutic targets. Between 11/2020 and 08/2022, 112 ALS patients, 77 SMA patients, and 50 controls were recruited in the Department of Neurology of Ulm University. Standardized blood and urinary samples were collected to analyze fat and ketone metabolism. Ketone body levels were higher in ALS and SMA compared to controls. In both diseases, patients with higher BMI featured higher ketone bodies and free fatty acids compared to those with lower BMI, while in controls we found the opposite phenomenon. In SMA, more severe disease types were associated with higher ketone body levels. Compared to ALS, SMA patients featured higher ketone body and free fatty acid levels. Our data suggest that already during early disease stages, ALS patients produce ketone bodies to compensate for the energy deficit. In SMA, on the other hand, the persistence of ketogenesis may indicate an upregulation of all available metabolic pathways for energy production due to the disturbance of fatty acid utilization. Therefore, the application of additional sources of energy, such as ketone bodies, might constitute a promising therapeutic option in both diseases."

    "abstract": "The degenerative loss of muscle associated with aging leading to muscular atrophy is called sarcopenia. Currently, practicing regular physical exercise is the only efficient way to delay sarcopenia onset. Identification of therapeutic targets to alleviate the symptoms of aging requires <i>in vivo</i> model organisms of accelerated muscle degeneration and atrophy. The zebrafish undergoes aging, with hallmarks including mitochondrial dysfunction, telomere shortening, and accumulation of senescent cells. However, zebrafish age slowly, and no specific zebrafish models of accelerated muscle atrophy associated with molecular events of aging are currently available. We have developed a new genetic tool to efficiently accelerate muscle-fiber degeneration and muscle-tissue atrophy in zebrafish larvae and adults. We used a gain-of-function strategy with a molecule that has been shown to be necessary and sufficient to induce muscle atrophy and a sarcopenia phenotype in mammals: Atrogin-1 (also named Fbxo32). We report the generation, validation, and characterization of a zebrafish genetic model of accelerated neuromuscular atrophy, the atrofish. We demonstrated that Atrogin-1 expression specifically in skeletal muscle tissue induces a muscle atrophic phenotype associated with locomotion dysfunction in both larvae and adult fish. We identified degradation of the myosin light chain as an event occurring prior to muscle-fiber degeneration. Biological processes associated with muscle aging such as proteolysis, inflammation, stress response, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and apoptosis are upregulated in the atrofish. Surprisingly, we observed a strong correlation between muscle-fiber degeneration and reduced numbers of neuromuscular junctions in the peripheral nervous system, as well as neuronal cell bodies in the spinal cord, suggesting that muscle atrophy could underly a neurodegenerative phenotype in the central nervous system. Finally, while atrofish larvae can recover locomotive functions, adult atrofish have impaired regenerative capacities, as is observed in mammals during muscle aging. In the future, the atrofish could serve as a platform for testing molecules aimed at treating or alleviating the symptoms of muscle aging, thereby opening new therapeutic avenues in the fight against sarcopenia."

It is more common in males, especially at the onset of the disease in the interval from 37 months to 18 years. Since SMA is usually associated with rapid onset early in life, it is sometimes challenging to diagnose adolescents and adults as SMA symptoms are non-specific. Type IV SMA is uncommon. The onset of the disease can occur at the age of 15-50 years. The disease develops rather slowly, essentially with no effect on life duration. With this type of SMA, overall muscle strength gradually decreases, eventually causing the loss of the ability to move independently. We present our case of 5q SMA with the onset in adulthood."

    "abstract": "5q-Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has been a trailblazer in the development of advanced therapies for inherited diseases. SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting mainly motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and brainstem motor nuclei, but currently considered a systemic disease. Advances in understanding of the genetics of SMA led to the development of disease modifying therapies, either transferring a healthy version of SMN1, the causative gene absent or altered in SMA, or modulating SMN2, a highly homologous but less functional version of SMN1, present in all patients. After successful clinical trials, these approaches have resulted in three marketed therapies. Severe SMA, \"type I\", is the most common type and is considered both a developmental arrest and neurodegenerative disorder. As pathology starts during fetal life in type I patients, a cure is unlikely even when treatment is started shortly after birth in the pre- or mildly symptomatic state. In utero fetal therapy offers the opportunity to mitigate further or possibly prevent manifestations of the disease. This review discusses clinical and developmental aspects of SMA, the advanced therapies approved (gene therapy, antisense oligonucleotide and small molecule compounds), and the rationale, options and challenges, including ethical and safety issues, to initiate in utero therapy. Looking beyond sporadic case reports of prenatal intervention, clinical trials of in utero SMA therapy can be envisaged and should be carefully designed and evaluated to move closer to clinical translation."

Most adult subpopulations were classed as type 2 (49.4%) or type 3 (44.8%). Regarding functional status, 19% walked (39.4% used wheelchairs), 46.6% sat without support (84% needed help to sit), and 34.5% were non-sitters. Furthermore, 24.7% reported having no useful function in their hands or not being able to reach their mouths with their hands. Our study indicates that the adult SMA population is progressively accessing disease-modifier treatments. However, 21.8% of the population is still untreated. These results provide evidence of a progressive impairment and increased sensitivity to treatment discontinuations in the SMA adult population, along with delayed or reduced access to commercialised SMA drugs and clinical trials. A more rigorous evaluation of the disease's impact and treatment benefits in the adult SMA population is necessary."

    "title": "Spinal Accessory Nerve Mononeuropathy Following Trapezius Lipoma Resection: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "The spinal accessory nerve (SAN) is crucial for the motor function of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles, playing a significant role in scapular stability and upper limb mobility. While SAN injuries are commonly associated with iatrogenic causes such as lymph node biopsies, neck dissections, and posterior cervical trauma, injury following trapezius lipoma resection has not been well-documented. Given the SAN's superficial location and proximity to surgical fields in the posterior cervical triangle, it is vulnerable to inadvertent injury during tumor excision. To the best of our knowledge, this case report presents the first documented instance of isolated SAN mononeuropathy following trapezius lipoma resection and underscores the importance of early recognition, diagnosis, and management. A 54-year-old male developed SAN mononeuropathy following an elective surgical removal of a deep right-sided trapezius lipoma. One week following resection, the patient exhibited new-onset paresthesias in the right upper extremity, scapular dyskinesis, shoulder weakness, and lateral scapular winging. Prior electrodiagnostic (EDX) studies for different complaints showed no signs of peripheral nerve injury. Given the new presentation, repeat EDX were performed six months postoperatively, revealing severe focal SAN neuropathy with ongoing active denervation. The findings suggest direct or traction-related SAN injury rather than an isolated muscular pathology. Given the course of symptoms, a referral to a peripheral nerve surgeon was warranted for recommendations regarding further management. SAN mononeuropathy following lipoma resection is an important and uncommon complication. Most SAN injuries result from iatrogenic causes, such as neck dissections and lymph node biopsies or lateral neck trauma. The SAN's close proximity to the surgical site makes it susceptible to iatrogenic injury in posterior cervical triangle procedures. This case highlights the importance of identifying lipoma location and recognizing subtle nerve injuries often overlooked without thorough postoperative assessment. Clinical signs include lateral scapular winging during active external rotation, vague shoulder pain, limitations in range of motion, and potential muscle atrophy. In this case, resection of a deeply situated trapezius lipoma led to SAN dysfunction within one week of surgery. Clinical suspicion, combined with examination and confirmation through EDX, highlights the SAN's vulnerability in this region. SAN injury outcomes vary widely, with treatment options ranging from conservative management to surgical interventions such as nerve grafting, nerve repair, or Eden-Lange muscle transfer. Successful recovery is more likely when repairs are performed early, ideally within seven months, with poorer results after 20 months. This case emphasizes the potential for SAN injury during deep trapezius lipoma resection. Early recognition through physical exam and EDX is essential for distinguishing SAN mononeuropathy from other shoulder dysfunctions, as prompt diagnosis improves functional outcomes. Additionally, preoperative nerve mapping is crucial when operating near critical neural structures, stressing the importance of intraoperative nerve monitoring to reduce the risk of injury. Further research is needed to better understand SAN injury incidence in posterior cervical and scapular surgeries and to develop standardized management guidelines."

    "title": "Exploring sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and quality of life in adults with spinal muscular atrophy.",
    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a genetic neuromuscular disorder caused by the mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Sleep disturbances and their impact on mental health and quality of life in patients with SMA are being understudied, and most of the evidence comes from pediatric SMA patients. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adult patients with SMA. The participants underwent questionnaires exploring sleep quality with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and quality of life with the Short-Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36). Fifty patients with SMA were enrolled in the study: 66 % were females with a median age of 41 years. Of them, 60 % had poor sleep quality, and 72 % had depressive symptoms. SMA 2 patients showed higher PSQI and PHQ-9 scores than SMA 3 patients (8 ± 3 vs 6 ± 1, p < 0.001 and 13±5 vs 7 ± 5, p < 0.001). PSQI total score correlated with the PHQ-9 (r = 0.32, p = 0.02), which was higher in patients with respiratory symptoms. Poor sleep is associated with depressive symptoms and respiratory dysfunction in adult SMA patients. Clinicians should consider sleep quality in SMA patients for optimal care; future studies are needed to understand this aspect better."

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a progressive neuromuscular disorder caused by SMN1 gene mutations, leading to inevitable motoneuronal degeneration. The introduction of disease modifying therapies has dramatically altered its natural history, shifting management from palliative to proactive approach. The new phenotypes and differences in treatment response and efficacy, are all contributing to reshape our understanding of the disease itself. This paper aims to analyze the lessons derived from the recent therapeutic advances, focusing on key aspects such as therapeutic windows, impact of early treatment and both disease progression and treatment efficacy modifiers. Ultimately, we also aim to give insights on new models of data analysis being explored to optimize patient trajectories and individualize treatment strategies. Our experience and the overall review of clinical trials and real-world data confirm that early treatment maximizes motor outcomes, especially when started in the pre-clinical phase of the disease. The significant clinical improvements in symptomatic type I infants treated at different ages has provided evidence of an expanded 'therapeutic window', previously reported as limited to the first few months after birth on the basis of neurophysiological findings. The available data also provide evidence that function at baseline, SMN2 copy number, and age at treatment all appear to represent critical determinants of response. The availability of long-term data is increasingly used to pilot new predictive models to support clinical decision-making and to adapt therapeutic goals based on patient-specific variables."

    "abstract": "Hirayama disease is a rare neurological disorder primarily affecting young males. This condition poses diagnostic challenges due to its subtle onset and progressive nature. Recognising the importance of early diagnosis is crucial to implementing timely interventions and improving patient outcomes. While Hirayama disease is considered rare, its exact prevalence remains unclear due to under-diagnosis and variability in presentation. Reported cases are more common in certain regions, notably East Asia, but occurrences have been documented worldwide. Despite its rarity, the impact of Hirayama disease on affected individuals can be significant, warranting increased awareness among healthcare professionals.The key message of this case report is to highlight the utility of electrodiagnostic studies, particularly electromyography and F wave analysis, in aiding the diagnosis of Hirayama disease. By emphasising the significance of recognising specific electromyographic patterns, this report aims to facilitate early identification and intervention, thereby improving patient management and quality of life."

    "abstract": "Nusinersen treatment not only prevents neurological deterioration in presymptomatic or early symptomatic children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) but promotes functional improvement in the later plateau phase in adults with SMA, though the mechanisms for such functional improvement are not fully understood. We evaluated the motor behaviors and electrophysiological performance of 10 consecutive adult patients with SMA before and 2, 6, 10 months after nusinersen treatment. Adult SMA mice (Smn<sup>-/-</sup>SMN2<sup>+/+</sup>) were treated with nusinersen intracerebroventricularly for 2 months with analysis of the SMN transcripts and proteins expression, motor function, electrophysiology, and pathology of spinal cord and muscles. SMA patients showed motor function improvement in 10 months after nusinersen treatment with an increase in compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude and motor unit number estimation (MUNE). Nusinersen augmented the expression of full-length SMN transcripts and proteins in SMA mice. SMA mice receiving nusinersen treatment showed a motor behavioral improvement with an increase in MUNE. Although nusinersen treatment partially prevented spinal motor neuron death, there was no obvious elevation in motor neuron density despite an increase in MUNE, indicating the reactivation of quiescent motor neurons. Nusinersen treatment not only eliminated progressive denervation at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), but also promoted NMJ innervation, implying the existence of reinnervation. The functional improvements observed with nusinersen treatment in adults with SMA during the later plateau phase primarily result from two mechanisms: the revival of live but functionless motor neurons and the reinnervation of NMJs through axonal sprouting and the formation of new motor units."

    "title": "Prenatal genetic counseling challenges with indeterminate SMA results.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular condition with complex genetic etiology. About 95% of individuals affected with this condition have a homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene. One scenario that complicates risk is when a parent is identified as a possible silent carrier, meaning they have a [2 + 0] chromosome configuration. This configuration occurs when an individual has two copies of the SMN1 gene on one chromosome and no copies on the other chromosome. It is thought that 3.8-4.0% of the general population is a [2 + 0] carrier with a higher prevalence in African American and Hispanic populations. The [2 + 0] configuration makes it more difficult to calculate residual risk because testing cannot determine the difference between [2 + 0] carriers and [1 + 1] non-carriers, leading to indeterminate SMA carrier screening results. SMA was added to general population carrier screening in 2017, leading to an increase in the number of patients identified to have indeterminate results. Previous research has not examined how this addition has affected counseling practices involving indeterminate results. The purpose of this research was to gain a better understanding of the practices and challenges in this area, specifically within non-Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) populations. This study utilized a quantitative survey with open-response questions. Responses from 49 prenatal genetic counselors from the United States and Canada were analyzed and it was found that genetic counselors face similar challenges when counseling indeterminate SMA results across all regions. These include negative patient emotions and both patient and referring provider misunderstanding, as highlighted in the qualitative data. Three major categories emerged including (1) challenges with patients, (2) challenges with referring providers, and (3) the effects of the 2017 addition to general population carrier screening. This study highlights the need for provider education surrounding indeterminate SMA results, the development of a visual aid, and future research from the patient and referring provider perspective."

    "abstract": "The assembly of most spliceosomal snRNP cores involves seven Sm proteins (D1/D2/F/E/G/D3/B) forming a ring around snRNA, typically requiring essential assembly chaperones like the SMN complex, associated with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Strikingly, in budding yeast, snRNP core assembly only involves Brr1, a nonessential homolog of Gemin2. Here, we reveal two distinct pathways in budding yeast: an inefficient chaperone-mediated pathway involving Brr1 and a novel factor, Lot5, and a direct pathway. Lot5 binds D1/D2/F/E/G to form a heterohexameric ring (6S). Brr1 binds D1/D2/F/E/G and 6S but cannot displace Lot5 to facilitate assembly. Disruption of BRR1 and LOT5 genes caused mild growth retardation, but LOT5 overexpression substantially impeded growth. The direct pathway uniquely involves F/E/G as a trimer and a stable D1/D2/F/E/G intermediate complex, explaining the non-essentiality of chaperones. These findings unveil a unique snRNP core assembly mechanism, illuminate the evolution of assembly chaperones, and suggest avenues for studying SMA pathophysiology."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) frequently causes scoliosis (up to 90% of cases), due to weakened axial muscles impacting motor and respiratory function. While new SMA treatments improve motor function, their effect on scoliosis progression is unclear. This scoping review (2016-October 2024) analyzed literature from Pubmed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus, focusing on studies of SMA, scoliosis, and treatment approaches. The aim of this work was to describe the clinical features and the possible therapeutic approaches of scoliosis in the \"new population\" of pharmacologically treated SMA patients. We included all types of SMA as well as all the approved disease modifying therapies (DMTs). The review found significant variability in scoliosis presentation and surgical intervention among different types of treated SMA patients. Early pharmacological treatment may slow scoliosis progression, particularly in Type II SMA. Interestingly, Type I SMA patients, who typically don't develop scoliosis due to severe hypotonia, showed an increased scoliosis onset. Larger studies are needed to fully evaluate the impact of different treatments on scoliosis progression in SMA, especially in Type I SMA patients, to establish updated standards of care."

Here, the activity of several different SSOs was investigated as potential treatments for B lymphocyte disorders with a focus on X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), caused by defects in the gene encoding Bruton's tyrosine kinase (<i>BTK</i>). In this study, the activity of locked nucleic acid (LNA), tricyclo-DNA (tcDNA), phosphoryl guanidine oligonucleotides (PGO) and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) were compared, targeting the pseudoexon region of <i>BTK</i> pre-mRNA. We further investigated the effect of conjugating cell-penetrating peptides, including Pip6a, to the SSOs. The effect was measured as splice-switching <i>in vitro</i> as well as in a further developed, bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mouse model of XLA. Therapy in the form of intravenous infusions 2 times a week during 3 weeks of PMO oligomers conjugated to Pip6a was sufficient to partly restore the <i>in vivo</i> B lineage phenotype. SSOs treatment also provides a unique opportunity to get insights into a restoration process, when B lymphocytes of different maturation stages are simultaneously splice-corrected."

    "abstract": "The present study examines the safety profile of intravenous onasemnogene abeparvovec gene therapy in a real-world setting, both alone or in combination with intrathecal antisense oligonucleotide nusinersen therapy in two cohorts of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The first cohort included eight presymptomatic infants treated solely with onasemnogene abeparvovec, while the second cohort comprised six symptomatic infants receiving onasemnogene abeparvovec and nusinersen co-therapy. All patients received the corticosteroid prednisolone coincident with gene therapy. Circulating alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels were measured to determine potential hepatoxicity, the primary focus of this study. Elevated ALT and AST levels were observed in one pre-symptomatic and three symptomatic patients post-treatment. However, all values returned to normal levels within 3 months of onasemnogene abeparvovec injection. Nusinersen treatment received previously or coincident with gene therapy did not impact the transient elevation of liver transaminases. This study highlights the importance of early intervention with molecular treatments for SMA and indicates that prior or coincident treatment with nusinersen is unlikely to impact safety of onasemnogene apoparvovec and could theoretically improve clinical outcomes in symptomatic infants or in those with gene therapy delayed beyond the immediate neonatal period."

    "abstract": "Early-onset scoliosis, which develops before 2 years of age and progresses rapidly, has been reported as an inevitable complication in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients with 2 copies of the survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene that receive post-onset disease-modifying therapy (DMT) within 6 months after birth. We describe a case of SMA type 0 in a patient with 2 copies of SMN2 that was treated with nusinersen, in which the patient's motor function improved and no progression of spinal deformity was observed. The patient was born after an unremarkable gestation, but presented with severe muscle weakness immediately after birth. A genetic analysis conducted at 9 weeks of age revealed homozygous deletion of SMN1 and 2 copies of SMN2. He was diagnosed with SMA type 0 and treated with nusinersen from the age of 10 weeks. However, he required a tracheostomy and ventilatory management due to pharyngomalacia at 4 months. Slight spinal deformity was observed after sitting training was initiated at 1 year and 3 months. Physical therapy with careful postural management using a seating system and a supine stander was conducted twice a week to promote motor development. He was restricted to sitting without support for 30 min a day. At age 6, he can stand with support for several minutes, and scoliosis has been prevented. Our case suggests that early proactive, non-surgical management with targeted rehabilitation can prevent scoliosis progression in SMA patients with 2 copies of SMN2 that receive post-onset DMT within 6 months of birth."

Our objective was to explore and describe how rehabilitation therapists are approaching this changing landscape, including the challenges and opportunities. We conducted a qualitative study using a demographic survey and three focus groups with 10 occupational and physical therapists from across Canada. Participants shared their experiences navigating the changing landscape of SMA rehabilitation. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyze the transcripts and generate four main themes: (1) Managing Expectations; (2) New Possibilities; (3) Centering the Child; (4) Navigating a Changing Landscape. This study highlighted challenges and benefits in providing rehabilitation amidst the changing SMA landscape. Updated practice guidelines and effective knowledge dissemination are needed to guide therapists, alongside prioritization of psychosocial support for families and children coping with high expectations. What we learned about therapists' experiences may help inform others on how to adapt rehabilitation when disease modifying treatment options become available for other conditions."

This cross-sectional study aimed to quantitatively investigate the gray matter (GM) alterations in patients with SMA types 2 and 3. This is a cross-sectional study. T1 and T2 maps that were extracted from synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (SyMRI) were compared between patients with SMA and healthy controls (HC). Between-group comparisons were made between SMA type 2 and type 3. The association between brain regions with significantly altered T1 and T2 values and clinical measurements were evaluated with Pearson correlation analysis. Compared with HC, patients with SMA showed widespread altered T1 and T2 values in GM, mainly referring to the cerebellum, default mode network, attention and execution control network, and salience network. Negative correlations were found between Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) scores and T2 values of the left orbital part of superior frontal gyrus (P=0.013) and the right olfactory cortex (P=0.008) in the patient group. Altered T1 and T2 values involving multiple GM regions of the brain demonstrate widespread microscopic alterations in patients with SMA, which might provide an idea for quantitative measurement of SMA nerve damage."

It is therefore essential to establish universal SMA screening and diagnostic programs using scalable, cost-effective, and accessible platforms to accurately identify all variation types. This task is complicated by high sequence homology between the SMN1 and SMN2 genes. Toward this goal, a dual-mode PCR-based target-enrichment method was developed, optimized, and evaluated in an external laboratory as a proof-of-concept for scalable and deployable any-length nanopore sequencing. The assay generates 2.7- to 11.2-kb amplicons spanning exons 3 to 8 of the SMN1 and SMN2 genes, which are then analyzed using a variant calling model that reports sequence and copy number variants specific to each gene from paralog-specific sequences and read-depth data. Overall, the assay detected single-nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions, and copy number variants with >98% genotype agreement across >750 samples, including cell lines, residual presumed-normal whole-blood donors, and patients with known SMN1 and SMN2 genotypes. The assay also demonstrated a dynamic sample throughput, 9-hour turnaround time, and 4-hour hands-on time. Together with the modest capital investment and consumable costs per sample, this assay can help to increase access to SMA testing in low- and middle-income settings. As a result, this PCR/Nanopore sequencing assay and analysis pipeline has the potential for universal implementation in SMA carrier screening and diagnostic programs."

    "abstract": "In recent years, three disease-modifying therapies have been approved and fully reimbursed in Poland since September 2023. Those therapies have significantly improved the disease outcome but led to new uncertainties. Doubts mainly concern older patients who have already developed complications occurring because of a lack of previous access to therapy. Joint contractures or trunk deformation are the most noticeable changes that should be examined. This work examines functional and structural changes in SMA sitter patients between the ages of 5 and 20 years during the 12-month follow-up. Twenty-one SMA patients were divided depending on the drug program in which they participated. The study protocol included functional and structural assessments. Most of the subjects experienced an improvement in cervical rotation parameter and increased contracture of the hip and knee joints. There are differences between the patients' body sides. Neither the contractures nor their gradual decrease or increase occur symmetrically. We conclude that all patients under study improved their motor function after 12 months. In both groups, more significant improvement occurred in the assessment of the RULM scale than in the HFMSE scale. Improvement in function was not dependent on improvement in structural parameters."

Charts from patients on risdiplam were retrospectively reviewed. Results were then compared between patients accessing the drug during an initial restricted compassionate use program (cohort 1) and those after commercial approval, with no restrictions (cohort 2). Side effects and adherence were recorded for both cohorts as well as data on shifters. 283 patients (median age: 22 years) were included. Only a minority were walkers.

We aimed to establish the nationwide incidence and prevalence of SMA in Aotearoa-New Zealand, and to estimate the patients' disability and the impact of this on health resource utilisation. We used multiple sources to identify patients with SMA and verified the diagnosis, disabilities and resources utilisation by review of the individual patient notes and genetic results. The four year incidence period was from 1st July 2015 to 30th June 2019. Prevalence date was 1st March 2019. Of note, this time period pre-dated access to disease modifying therapy in New Zealand. Census data for 2018 was used for denominators. Descriptive statistics and capture-recapture were used to analyse the data. For context, we reviewed international SMA epidemiology. The incidence per 100,000 live births was 8.0 (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.8-12.5). The standardised prevalence rate of SMA on 1st March 2019 was 1.78 per 100,000 (95% CI: 1.24, 2.33). Prevalence was significantly lower amongst Māori at 0.34 (95% CI: 0.08, 1.13; p = 0.006). Substantial decline from best motor milestone performance was seen; seven patients with SMA1 died without access to disease modifying therapy. 74% of the total cohort used wheelchairs. 23% required respiratory support. 62% had scoliosis, of whom 61% had had surgery. Surviving SMA1 patients had very high health service utilisation. Incidence and prevalence figures match closely with international studies. This is the first record of low SMA rates in Māori. While the largest burden of disease falls on patients with SMA1 and 2 there is still substantial use of health resources among SMA3 and SMA4 patients."

However, its effects on the skeletal muscles remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the intramuscular fat fraction in patients with SMA types II and III using muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to explore the relationship between muscle tissue, lipid metabolism, and motor function during nusinersen treatment. <b>Methods</b>: This study included seven pediatric patients with SMA types II and III who received nusinersen treatment. Muscle MRIs were performed at three time points. Images of the central thigh were used to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) and muscle fat area, and the intramuscular fat fraction (IMFF) was calculated. The thigh muscles were categorized into three groups: quadriceps, adductor, and hamstrings. <b>Results</b>: The median (range) of total IMFF for SMA type II and III at T-0, T-2, and T-4 were 18.5 (12.6-48.4), 24.4 (10.1-61.4), and 39.0 (30.0-68.6) % and increased over time. In five patients whose motor function was evaluated, a moderate negative correlation was observed between the changes in the Hammersmith Functional Motor Score Expanded (HSFME) and IMFF (r = -0.51). No significant changes in serum triglyceride or total cholesterol levels were observed during treatment. <b>Conclusions</b>: An increase in IMFF was associated with a decline in motor function. The baseline IMFF score was related to improvements in motor function scores, suggesting that the IMFF of the thigh muscle may serve as a novel, objective, and quantitative skeletal muscle-related biomarker for predicting the effects of nusinersen on muscle tissue."

    "title": "Sensory Dysfunction in ALS and Other Motor Neuron Diseases: Clinical Relevance, Histopathology, Neurophysiology, and Insights from Neuroimaging.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: The clinical profiles of MNDs are dominated by inexorable motor decline, but subclinical proprioceptive, nociceptive and somatosensory deficits may also exacerbate mobility, dexterity, and bulbar function. While extra-motor pathology and frontotemporal involvement are widely recognised in motor neuron diseases (MNDs), reports of sensory involvement are conflicting. The potential contribution of sensory deficits to clinical disability is not firmly established and the spectrum of sensory manifestations is poorly characterised. <b>Methods</b>: A systematic review was conducted to examine the clinical, neuroimaging, electrophysiology and neuropathology evidence for sensory dysfunction in MND phenotypes. <b>Results</b>: In ALS, paraesthesia, pain, proprioceptive deficits and taste alterations are sporadically reported and there is also compelling electrophysiological, histological and imaging evidence of sensory network alterations. Gait impairment, impaired dexterity, and poor balance in ALS are likely to be multifactorial, with extrapyramidal, cerebellar, proprioceptive and vestibular deficits at play. Human imaging studies and animal models also confirm dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway involvement as part of the disease process. Sensory symptoms are relatively common in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) and Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), but are inconsistently reported in primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) and in post-poliomyelitis syndrome (PPS). <b>Conclusions</b>: Establishing the prevalence and nature of sensory dysfunction across the spectrum of MNDs has a dual clinical and academic relevance. From a clinical perspective, subtle sensory deficits are likely to impact the disability profile and care needs of patients with MND. From an academic standpoint, sensory networks may be ideally suited to evaluate propagation patterns and the involvement of subcortical grey matter structures. Our review suggests that sensory dysfunction is an important albeit under-recognised facet of MND."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic, progressive neuromuscular disease caused by pathogenic variants in the survival of motor neuron survival of motor neuron (SMN) 1 gene leading to a deficiency in SMN protein. Three disease-modifying therapies are available for the treatment of SMA, affording many with the opportunity for family planning. Fertility outcomes in patients with SMA treated with risdiplam have not been previously reported. This study was a multicenter, non-interventional retrospective case review that included three adult male patients with SMA from three sites in Austria and the USA. The primary objective was to characterize the reproductive history and fertility journey of men with SMA who were exposed to risdiplam and whose partner had conceived. Three male patients aged 21-34 years with late-onset SMA were taking risdiplam during the window of conception. Of the three resultant pregnancies, two were full term and resulted in healthy babies and one was voluntarily terminated. The babies were healthy and developing normally. This series presents three cases of successful conception while a male patient was receiving risdiplam, a US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for SMA. Although there were reproductive concerns due to impairment in spermatogenesis that arose during nonclinical studies, this case series demonstrates that there was sufficient sperm production while on risdiplam to result in pregnancy. More research is needed to provide a complete understanding of the effects of risdiplam on male fertility in humans. Graphical abstract available for this article."

    "abstract": "Nusinersen was the first approved disease modifying therapy (DMT) for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Intrathecal administration of nusinersen enables drug delivery directly to the central nervous system, where the motor neurons are located. Per the package insert, individuals with SMA receive 4 loading doses of nusinersen followed by maintenance doses every 4 months thereafter. The aim of this analysis was to investigate the administration practices of and adherence to nusinersen in Chinese children with SMA. Data were analyzed from a longitudinal, multicenter registry enrolling children with 5q-SMA in China. Information on nusinersen administration, including administration date, care setting, use of sedation and general anesthesia, method of administration, and use of imaging guidance before administration, was collected both retrospectively and prospectively. Adherence rate was calculated at dose and participant level. A dose was considered adherent if the inter-dose interval (for dose-level) and interval from the first dose (for participant-level) followed the standard dosing regimen, with a grace period of ± 7 days for Dose 2 to 4 and ± 28 days thereafter. A total of 385 participants receiving nusinersen with a total of 2,415 doses were included in the study. The median (interquartile range) number of doses administered per participant was 6 (5-7). Over 99% of intrathecal injections were given in an inpatient setting. Only a few (n = 3, 0.1%) required general anesthesia, while 9% (n = 217) of doses were administered under the use of sedation. Interlaminar lumbar puncture (n = 2,407, 99.7%) was the most common method of administration, followed by cervical puncture (n = 5, 0.2%) and transforaminal lumbar puncture (n = 3, 0.1%). Over 90% of injections did not utilize any imaging guidance prior to administration, with ultrasound (n = 142, 5.9%) being the most commonly used imaging guidance. The adherence rate was 95.7% (1,943/2,030) at dose level and 81.0% (312/385) at participant level. The median inter-dose intervals aligned well with the dosing schedule, with 14 days for Doses 2 and 3, 35 days for Dose 4, and 114-124 days for maintenance doses thereafter. Findings from the analysis demonstrated high real-world adherence to nusinersen in Chinese children with SMA."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by homozygous deletions or mutations in the <i>SMN1</i> gene, leading to progressive motor neuron degeneration. While SMA has been classically viewed as a motor neuron-autonomous disease, increasing evidence indicates a significant role of glial cells-astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells-in the disease pathophysiology. Astrocytic dysfunction contributes to motor neuron vulnerability through impaired calcium homeostasis, disrupted synaptic integrity, and neurotrophic factor deficits. Microglia, through reactive gliosis and complement-mediated synaptic stripping, exacerbate neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Oligodendrocytes exhibit impaired differentiation and metabolic support, while Schwann cells display abnormalities in myelination, extracellular matrix composition, and neuromuscular junction maintenance, further compromising motor function. Dysregulation of pathways such as NF-κB, Notch, and JAK/STAT, alongside the upregulation of complement proteins and microRNAs, reinforces the non-cell-autonomous nature of SMA. Despite the advances in SMN-restorative therapies, they do not fully mitigate glial dysfunction. Targeting glial pathology, including modulation of reactive astrogliosis, microglial polarization, and myelination deficits, represents a critical avenue for therapeutic intervention. This review comprehensively examines the multifaceted roles of glial cells in SMA and highlights emerging glia-targeted strategies to enhance treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes."

While gene therapies have enhanced life expectancy, functional management remains crucial. Despite the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health for Children and Youth (ICF-CY) being a valuable framework for patient-centered care, its integration in setting multidisciplinary rehabilitation goals for SMA patients is underexplored. This study aimed to assess the use of the ICF-CY framework in developing multidisciplinary intervention goals for SMA patients. A cross-sectional study involving 6 SMA patients was conducted at a pediatric neurorehabilitation hospital. Data were collected using a standardized ICF-CY-based case record form and analysed to identify patterns of impairment, activity limitations, and environmental factors. Results demonstrated the multifaceted nature of SMA, with significant impairments in motor function, respiratory function, and swallowing, as well as limitations in activities of daily living and social participation. Environmental factors, particularly social support and accessibility, emerged as crucial determinants of overall well-being. The study underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and the use of ICF-CY framework for developing comprehensive and patient-centered care plans for SMA patients."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder caused by deficiency of survival of motor neuron (SMN). While significant progress has been made in SMA therapy by rescuing SMN expression, limited knowledge about SMN downstream genes has hindered the development of alternative therapies. Here, we conducted whole-transcriptome sequencing of spinal cord, heart, and liver tissues of a severe SMA mouse model at early postnatal ages to explore critical coding and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). A large number of differentially expressed RNAs (DE-RNAs) were obtained, including 2,771 mRNAs, 382 microRNAs (miRNAs), 1,633 long ncRNAs, and 1,519 circular RNAs. Through in-depth data mining, we unveiled deregulation of miR-34a in all tissues. Analysis of competitive endogenous RNA networks of DE-RNAs identified multiple novel targets of miR-34a including <i>Spag5</i> mRNA, lncRNA00138536, and circRNA007386. Further <i>in vitro</i> studies using mouse myoblast and human cardiomyocyte cell lines showed that knockdown of SMN upregulated miR-34a-5p and overexpression of miR-34a-5p alone disrupted cell-cycle progression through regulating its targets, recapitulating gene expression patterns observed in cardiac tissue of SMA mice. Our results identified a critical miRNA involved in SMA pathology, which sheds insights into the molecular basis of widespread tissue abnormalities observed in severe forms of SMA."

However, nusinersen is administered by interlaminar intrathecal injection which is challenging in patients with severe scoliosis, a common comorbidity of advanced SMA. This study evaluated the technical benefits of fluoroscopic guidance of intrathecal nusinersen administration in complex SMA patients with or without a fixation device. The cohort included 12 patients aged 10-20 years (total 124 injections). The total success rate was 99 %, with failure to complete only one out of 124 procedures. Demographic characteristics were diverse. Mean age at first injection was 14.2 years. Mean duration of radiation exposure was 77 s; mean dose area product was 2.32 Gycm<sup>2</sup>; and mean cumulative air kerma was 20.91mGy. Adverse events included post-dural-puncture headache (4.8 % of procedures), mostly mild and self-limited, and one allergic reaction. Treatment was discontinued in 2 patients because of difficult intrathecal access, and in 2 for reasons unrelated to the injection technique. Fluoroscopy-guided nusinersen administration is a feasible option for patients with SMA and complex access. Success depends on proper patient positioning and expertise of the interventional radiologist. Radiation exposure is lower than with other techniques. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings."

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy is a genetic disorder causing muscle atrophy and progressive weakness. People living with the condition can have a significant heterogenous phenotype ranging from arrest of motor development to mild impairment. Assessing disease severity has been done using a range of outcome measures that can be classified by body structure or function, by activities or by participation. Functional outocome measures can be generic measures, used to compare individuals or populations against general norms, or disease-specific measures designed to fit disease characteristics. Outcome measures assessing participation are primarily used to capture patients' perceptions of health-related quality of life, daily activity abilities, caregiver burden, and the impact of physical symptoms like fatigue or pain. When assessing disease progression, often the focus on functional abilities has served as an overall indicator of change. With the appearance of disease modifying therapies and the need to evaluate the impact that they had in the course of the disease, new requirements for the existing assessments measure had appeared. The current available toolkit is able to capture a significant spectrum of both, natural history and effect of new treatments but the increased survival, changes in fatigue, bulbar function and others will benefit from further assessment."

    "abstract": "The complex 2 Mb survival motor neuron (SMN) locus on chromosome 5q13, including the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)-causing gene SMN1 and modifier SMN2, remains incompletely resolved due to numerous segmental duplications. Variation in SMN2 copy number, presumably influenced by SMN1 to SMN2 gene conversion, affects disease severity, though SMN2 copy number alone has insufficient prognostic value due to limited genotype-phenotype correlations. With advancements in newborn screening and SMN-targeted therapies, identifying genetic markers to predict disease progression and treatment response is crucial. Progress has thus far been limited by methodological constraints. To address this, we developed HapSMA, a method to perform polyploid phasing of the SMN locus to enable copy-specific analysis of SMN and its surrounding genes. We used HapSMA on publicly available Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing data of 29 healthy controls and performed long-read, targeted ONT sequencing of the SMN locus of 31 patients with SMA. In healthy controls, we identified single nucleotide variants (SNVs) specific to SMN1 and SMN2 haplotypes that could serve as gene conversion markers. Broad phasing including the NAIP gene allowed for a more complete view of SMN locus variation. Genetic variation in SMN2 haplotypes was larger in SMA patients. Forty-two percent of SMN2 haplotypes of SMA patients showed varying SMN1 to SMN2 gene conversion breakpoints, serving as direct evidence of gene conversion as a common genetic characteristic in SMA and highlighting the importance of inclusion of SMA patients when investigating the SMN locus. Our findings illustrate that both methodological advances and the analysis of patient samples are required to advance our understanding of complex genetic loci and address critical clinical challenges."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disease. Although drugs are now available to treat patients with SMA, newborn screening (NBS) is essential for the early identification and treatment of affected babies. However, the attitudes towards NBS for SMA, particularly the adult-onset type, vary among different stakeholders. While supporters advocate for NBS due to early diagnosis and intervention, skeptics argue that the uncertainty about the severity and disease onset age can cause unnecessary parental and patient anxieties. This study aimed to explore the knowledge, attitudes, and perspectives of the general public and healthcare professionals regarding NBS for SMA in Hong Kong. A prospective online quantitative questionnaire survey was conducted on the general public, healthcare professionals, and the SMA community aged 18 years or above between December 2022 and February 2023. Participants were asked 28 questions about their knowledge of SMA, views on implementing NBS, concerns about the possibility of detecting adult-onset SMA, and the time of treatment. Descriptive analysis by Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA: Microsoft Corp.) was employed to determine the absolute frequencies and percentages of interviewees' responses to each question of the questionnaire. We received a total of 223 responses, of which 165 (74%) were from the general public and 58 (26%) from healthcare professionals. The majority, 94.6%, were in favor of NBS for SMA, primarily due to the potential for immediate treatment for affected infants (90.5%, n=191). When considering the possibility that NBS results could indicate adult-onset SMA, 87.9% (n=196) expressed a desire to know their child's results and 80.7% (n=180) were comfortable with their parents being informed of their NBS findings. Both the general public and healthcare professionals expressed support for the implementation of NBS for SMA in Hong Kong, believing that early diagnosis and intervention can improve the quality of life of SMA patients. Proper public health education is crucial to help individuals make informed decisions about NBS for SMA."

We analyzed somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) and motor evoked potential (MEP) records of 27 consecutive patients with spinal muscular atrophy and 59 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) who underwent spinal deformity surgery in our scoliosis center from July 2019 through August 2022. SSEP were elicitable in all SMA and AIS patients. The values of latencies prolonged and the amplitudes were significantly lower in SMA patients. MEP monitoring is similar in abductor pollicis brevis muscles in upper extremities of both SMA and AIS patients and combined recording from the adductor (ADD), quadriceps (QUA), tibialis anterior (TA), and abductor hallucis (AH) muscles in lower extremities was necessary and effective, although the elicitation rate and amplitudes in SMA patients was lower than those in AIS patients. Routine multimodality intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring of spinal cord sensory and motor function was feasible and safe during surgical correction of scoliosis in patients with SMA, particularly when MEPs were recorded from the AH muscle combined with ADD, QUA, and TA muscles."

The most common problems, occurring more than 80% of the time, were prolonged meal times, difficulty with mouth opening, and swallowing pills. In addition, 10% of the respondents reported a worsening feeding function over the course of their lives. Across the diverse array of bulbar functions, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of responses identified three coherent dimensions of bulbar dysfunction: Swallowing; Mealtimes and Communication; and Breath Sounds, Speech, Voice, and Secretion Management. Higher scores of overall bulbar dysfunction, (p < .001) and each factor (p < .001), were reported by respondents with any degree of feeding restrictions. Sex, age, or use of SMA disease-modifying treatment did not correlate with bulbar scores. <b>Conclusions:</b> This patient-reported scale of bulbar function in adults with a wide range of SMA severity captures and quantifies the variable manifestations of experienced bulbar impairment. With preliminary evidence of validity, the scale supports efforts to standardize accurate identification of bulbar dysfunction, incorporate the perspectives of people with SMA on key areas of their daily functioning, provide metrics essential for meaningful endpoints in clinical trials, inform practice guidelines, and promote advancement of the regulatory science needed for the evaluation and development of therapeutic interventions.

DPP6 interacts with potassium channel Kv4.2 (KCND2), enhancing its membrane expression and channel kinetics. Potassium ion channels are critical in progressing action potential formation and synaptic plasticity. Therefore, dysfunction of DPP6 can lead to significant health consequences. Abnormal DPP6 expression has been identified in several diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Recent research has indicated a connection between DPP6 and Alzheimer's disease as well. The most common symptoms resulting from DPP6 dysregulation are mental deficiency and muscle wastage. Notably, these symptoms do not always occur at the same time. Besides genetic factors, environmental factors also undoubtedly play a role in diseases related to DPP6 dysregulation. However, it remains unclear how the expression of DPP6 gets regulated. This review aims to summarize the associations between DPP6 and neurological diseases, offering insights as well as proposing hypotheses to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of DPP6 dysregulation."

A prospective observational study of children with type 2 and 3 beginning NUS in Queensland, Australia between June 2018-December 2020 was undertaken. Investigations conducted included age-appropriate lung function and polysomnography. Lung function data for two-years preceding NUS initiation was retrospectively collected. Change in lung function/polysomnography was assessed using mixed effects linear regression. 24 of 30 children with type 2 and 3 SMA (14 males; 2.6-15.8) were included (type 2 n = 12; type 3 n = 12). No child had respiratory-related admissions during the period of study. For type 2, annual decline in FVC z-score pre-treatment was -0.75 (95 % CI: 1.14, -0.39, p < 0.001), and for the first 3 years on NUS was -0.20 ([95 % CI: 0.33, -0.06, p = 0.01] difference p = 0.008). For type 3 minimal change was seen: pre-NUS and post FVC z-scores -0.20 (95 % CI: 1.00, 0.61 p = 0.05) and -0.46 (95 % CI: 0.88, -0.04 p = 0.40) respectively (difference p = 0.46).

In this context, Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) have gained popularity, offering the possibility to quantitatively and objectively analyze motor function of patients to support clinicians' assessments. We analyzed upper limb kinematics of two groups of children with neuromuscular diseases, seventeen DMD patients and fifteen SMA patients, while performing the corresponding clinical assessment.

Additionally, statistically significant differences were found not only between healthy children and those with neuromuscular disease, but also across severity levels within the patient group. These results represent a first step toward validating IMU-based systems to helping clinicians to accurately quantify the motor status of children with neuromuscular diseases. Furthermore, data collected with inertial sensors can provide clinicians with additional information not available through subjective observation."

    "abstract": "SMN2 copy number fails to answer variability in the SMA phenotype completely. We aimed to evaluate the copy number variation in NAIP and SMN2: c.859G>C and A-44G variants as disease modifiers and their correlation with the SMA phenotype. Based on the motor milestones achieved, patients with homozygous deletion of SMN1 exon 7 were classified into SMA Types I-IV. The copy numbers of SMN1 exon 8, SMN2, and NAIP were determined using the MLPA assay. Sanger sequencing was performed for the SMN2 variants. The cohort of 142 patients included nearly equal numbers of patients of SMA Types I, II, and III. The disease severity correlated with the SMN2 and NAIP copy number, with a lower copy number predicting a worse outcome. In addition, we evaluated the SMA genotype (SMN1 exon 8, SMN2 copy number, and NAIP copy number) as a predictor of SMA severity and found that most of the SMA Type I patients had a genotype of 0-2-0, SMA Type II patients had a genotype of 0-3-1, Type III patients had a genotype of 0-3-2 and 0-3-1, and Type IV patients had a genotype of 0-4-2. None of the patients from the cohort had the two modifier variants. The combined genotype of SMN1 exon 8 copy number-SMN2 copy number-NAIP copy number could accurately predict the SMA phenotype. The absence of SMN2: c.859G>C and A-44G variants in any of our patients points to the rarity of these variants in the Indian population."

    "title": "A de novo deletion underlying spinal muscular atrophy: implications for carrier testing and genetic counseling.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disease most commonly caused by homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene. Parents of affected children are typically carriers, with a recurrence risk of 25% for future pregnancies. Their close relatives have up to 50% chance of being carriers. Carriers typically possess a single copy of the SMN1 gene; however, some parents carry two copies of SMN1. Current standard diagnostic carrier tests are unable to distinguish between silent carriers with two copies on one chromosome (2 + 0 genotype) and non-carriers (1 + 1 genotype), where a de novo deletion occurred. This distinction is crucial for recurrence risk assessment, which highlights the unsolved challenge to carrier testing and genetic counseling. We combined microsatellite marker analysis, SMN copy number analysis, Sanger sequencing, long-read sequencing and de novo assembly to investigate the cause of the absence of SMN1 in a pedigree with an SMA patient identified through newborn screening, whose parents each carried two SMN1 copies. Our analysis revealed that the father is a silent carrier, while de novo assembly of the SMN locus showed a 1.4 megabase (Mb) de novo deletion between mother and child. This deletion encompasses SMN1 and SMN2 and represents the first reported nucleotide-level resolved SMA-causing deletion to date. Our findings allowed informed counseling of at-risk relatives and illustrate the complexity of SMA carrier testing and counseling. This case underscores the feasibility of and need for advanced genetic testing for SMA carriership in select cases, to improve genetic counseling practices, risk assessment, and family planning."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease with loss of musculature, which is replaced by fat. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have focused on imaging muscles either in lower or upper extremities, but whole-body MRI can provide additional information on the involvement pattern. This study examined whole-body muscle fat replacement and the relationship between muscle structure, function, and bulbar symptoms. We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study. We assessed the fat replacement in skeletal muscles using whole-body MRI, the muscle function using the Motor Function Measurement 32, and bulbar muscle strength using the Bulbar Rating Scale. The presence of bulbar symptoms and function was assessed using the Voice Handicap Index, Eating Assessment Tool questionnaires, and a swallowing test. We recruited 20 adult patients with type II and III SMA. The most affected muscles were the psoas major, soleus and rectus femoris, while the least affected muscles were the biceps brachii, deltoideus, and pterygoideus medialis. The tongue was involved in nearly half of the patients. Most patients reported issues with swallowing (75%) and voice (95%) but had relatively preserved strength of bulbar muscles. Certain muscles are more prone to fat replacement than others in SMA, with a predominant proximal-distal and extensor-flexor involvement. Nearly half of the patients had increased fat content in the tongue, which is associated with dysphagia. In addition, most patients retained muscle strength in the bulbar muscles, despite advanced muscle weakness in the rest of the body."

Here, we report a simplified funnel-down filtration strategy aimed at enhancing the identification of small and large deleterious variants as well as abnormal episignature disease profiles from whole-genome LRS data. This approach detected all pathogenic single nucleotide, structural, and methylation variants in a positive control set (N = 76) including an independent sample set with known methylation profiles (N = 57). When applied to patients who previously had negative short-read testing (N = 51), additional diagnoses were uncovered in 10% of cases, including a methylation profile at the spinal muscular atrophy locus utilized for diagnosing this life-threatening, yet treatable, condition. Our study illustrates the utility of LRS in clinical genetic testing and the discovery of novel disease variation."

Intrathecal therapy with the antisense oligonucleotide nusinersen modifies the disease course. However, biomarkers for understanding underlying molecular pathomechanisms and monitoring therapy are not yet known. A total of 130 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 24 adult patients with SMA type 2 or 3 were collected over 3.5 years, and CSF proteome was analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS). By applying two complementary MS protein quantification methods, label-free quantification (LFQ) and tandem mass tag (TMT) isotopic labeling, specific protein patterns reflecting changes in the CSF in response to nusinersen therapy were identified. These results were combined with cellular and metabolic profiles. Nusinersen therapy led to a median motor function improvement of 2.2 Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded points after 10 months and 2.6 points after 34 months. CSF macrophages increased in number and showed an altered morphology. Albumin quotient (qAlb), glucose, and lactate concentrations were inversely correlated with clinical improvement. MS analysis of CSF identified 1,674 (TMT) and 441 (LFQ) proteins. Protein profiles reflected reduced inhibition of \"nervous system development\" and \"axogenesis\" pathways under therapy. In addition, clinical improvement was associated with upregulation of the interacting proteins α-dystroglycan and beta-1,4-glucuronyltransferase 1, reduction of complement factors, negative correlation in immunoglobulin- and B cell-related pathways, and reduction of cellular mediators such as lymphocytes. The present multi-proteomic analysis contributes to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying nusinersen's therapeutic effects and offers potential biomarkers for monitoring treatment response in SMA."

This retrospective observational study included patients and gamete donors attending a Human Fertility Institute in Colombia between January 2017 and June 2023. Sociodemographic data and results of Next Generation Sequencing laboratory panels for screening of recessive disease-causing mutations were collected and analyzed. Data from 746 samples were analyzed; 599 (80.3%) were Colombian origin individuals and 147 (19.7%) were foreigners. At least one mutation was detected in 526 (70.5%) individuals. Of note, 893 pathogenic genetic variants were identified.The genetic variants most frequently observed in all the individuals studied were associated with the following diseases (carrier frequency): alpha thalassemia (10.5%), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (10%), congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (9.4%), cystic fibrosis (7.3%), spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (5.6%) and Stargardt disease type 1 (5.0%). The most frequent genetic variant observed in the subgroup of Colombian origin individuals was associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (11.3%). Information on the frequency of recessive diseases in Colombia is limited. This pioneering carrier genetic screening identified a high percentage of carriers for at least one recessive autosomal or X-linked in the population evaluated. Screening for recessive mutations could lead to an evolution in family planning programs and a decrease in the number of patients affected by recessive disorders. Furthermore, it could become a routine test not only in cases of assisted reproduction but also in cases of natural gestation."

    "abstract": "Since 2016, splice-switching therapy, in which splicing is controlled by antisense oligonucleotides, has been applied in clinical practice for spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In the former disease, this therapy induces exon inclusion, while, in the latter, it induces exon skipping, leading expression of functional proteins. Basic and clinical studies of splice-switching therapy for many monogenic diseases have now been conducted. The molecular mechanisms of splice-switching therapy include not only the induction of exon inclusion and skipping, but also the induction of pseudoexon skipping and suppression of splicing sites generated by mutations. In addition, therapies that alter protein function by regulating splicing are being investigated not only for monogenic diseases but also for non-monogenic ones such as cancer and immune-related disorders. It is expected that many of these basic studies will be translated into clinical applications. This review describes the current status of basic research and clinical applications of splice-switching therapy to promote the development of treatments for noncurable diseases."

In 5q SMA, cases of silent carriers have been reported, including <i>SMN1</i> duplications, intragenic subtle variants, de novo variants, and mosaicism. This study included DNA samples from 3412 unexamined unrelated individuals with no known family history of 5q SMA. In addition, we studied 15 families in which the children had a confirmed diagnosis of 5q SMA caused by a homozygous deletion of exon 7 of <i>SMN1</i>. Each family included one parent who was a carrier of a heterozygous deletion of <i>SMN1</i>, while the other parent had two copies of <i>SMN1</i>. The copy number of <i>SMN1</i> and <i>SMN2</i> was detected by MLPA. Two previously reported genetic markers of <i>SMN1</i> duplication, c.*3+80T>G and c.*211_*212del, were tested in 143 Russian residents with three copies of <i>SMN1</i> and 15 parents with two copies of <i>SMN1</i>. The frequency of a heterozygous carrier of exon 7 deletion of <i>SMN1</i> is 1 in 36 individuals (95% CI 33 to 39). The frequency of exon 7 duplication of <i>SMN1</i> is 1 in 25 individuals (95% CI 20 to 30). Only three individuals of the studied <i>SMN1</i> duplication carriers were detected to have genetic markers of <i>SMN1</i> duplication.

    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe neuromuscular disorder characterized by the degeneration of alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to progressive proximal muscle weakness and paralysis. SMA is clinically categorized into four phenotypes based on age of onset and motor function achieved. Patients with SMA type 3 (juvenile, Kugelberg-Welander disease) initially have the ability to walk unaided, but experience a gradual decline in motor abilities over time. However, their lifespan is not affected by the presence of the disease. Leptin, a cytokine-like hormone secreted by adipocytes, has receptors widely distributed in musculoskeletal tissues. Several studies suggest that adiponectin deficiency contributes to the development of insulin resistance, with lower adiponectin levels closely associated with greater insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. However, the role of adiponectin in different types of sarcopenia and its connection to insulin sensitivity remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to measure leptin and adiponectin levels in patients with SMA type 3 and explore their association with markers of insulin sensitivity. <b>Methods</b>: This cross-sectional study included 23 adult patients with SMA type 3 (SMA group) and 18 community-based healthy volunteers (control group), conducted from July 2020 to September 2024. Anthropometric parameters, body composition, body fat percentage, surrogate markers of insulin sensitivity (Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index-HOMA-IR and ISI Matsuda), and circulating levels of leptin and adiponectin were measured in all participants. <b>Results</b>: Insulin resistance was present in 91.3% of patients with SMA type 3, as determined by HOMA-IR and ISI Matsuda insulin sensitivity markers. In the control group, 64.7% had insulin resistance (IR) according to HOMA-IR, while 44.4% met the ISI Matsuda criterion for IR, showing a significant difference in peripheral insulin sensitivity between groups. A significant difference in serum adiponectin levels was observed between patients with SMA type 3 and the control group, whereas there was no significant difference in serum leptin concentrations. High adiponectin levels were observed in 50% of patients with SMA type 3. In the healthy control group, adiponectin levels positively correlated with ISI Matsuda and negatively correlated with HOMA-IR, confirming the insulin-sensitizing role of adiponectin. However, this correlation was not observed in patients with SMA type 3. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our results suggest that in this specific type of hereditary neuromuscular disease, the interplay between sarcopenia and insulin leads to adiponectin resistance, challenging the canonical narrative between insulin sensitivity and adiponectin, and indicating a need for further research."

This study aimed to identify factors associated with postprocedural pain following repeated CT-guided transforaminal nusinersen injection in non-ambulatory patients with SMA. This single-center retrospective study evaluated 34 patients who underwent a total of 290 procedures. Postprocedural pain occurred in 49.3% of cases. Factors influencing postprocedural pain included needle angle with vertical and horizontal lines, prophylactic pain control, and number of CT scans (p < 0.05). In patients experiencing postprocedural pain, the needle angle with vertical and horizontal lines emerged as significant variables, with a beta coefficient (standard error) of 0.034 (0.011) (p < 0.05). Needle angle was an important predictor of postprocedural pain."

This qualitative study was embedded within a single-blinded randomized waiting list controlled clinical trial, which involved 16 children with SMA type I. This study specifically explores the experiences of the 9 parents whose children participated in the intervention group and completed the training. The training lasted 12 weeks, 3 weekly sessions of half an hour each in a motorized mobility car. Subsequently, there were 4 weeks of free use, based on the child and family's interest. The therapist evaluated the learning of powered mobility using the ALP assessment. Parent Interviews were conducted using an interview guide. The results revealed that parents' learning was supported by powered mobility coaching, leading to acquired knowledge, skills, and competence. Several themes emerged for consideration in early age power mobility applications: motivation, playing, the importance of a family-centered program to enhance adherence to training and family satisfaction and to share decision making. The study concludes that early powered mobility for children with SMA type I should educate, empower, and monitor families to increase the interaction and goal achievement and considering barriers in the child's context is essential for accessible mobility."

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been applied for carrier screening, effectively reducing the incidence of severe diseases. However, some severe, high-prevalent and complex diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), α-/β-thalassemia, 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), and fragile-X syndrome (FXS), cannot be fully addressed by NGS, resulting in a high residual risk ratio. This study aims to evaluate the clinical utility of a long-read sequencing (LRS) panel for carrier screening of these five complex diseases. A total of 2926 participants were retrospectively enrolled from International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital from Jan 2019 to Dec 2022. All the participants were previously screened for 149 genes correlated to 147 diseases by NGS. The samples were collected and analyzed with the LRS panel targeting the five complex diseases. LRS identified 236 carrier variants, including 54 for SMA, 113 for α-thalassemia, 19 for β-thalassemia, 47 for 21-OHD, and three for FXS. NGS identified only 56.4% (133/236) of the variants detected by LRS. NGS failed to detect three SMA carriers with SMN1 intragenic variants, while reported 10 false-positive carriers for α-thalassemia (HKαα miscalled as -α3.7). Both 21-OHD and FXS were beyond its detection scope. NGS identified only three of the seven at-risk couples determined by LRS. The total estimated at-risk couple rate for 151 genes in NGS and LRS panels was 1.0996%. SMA, α-/β-thalassemia, 21-OHD, and FXS were among the top 30 high-prevalent diseases and had a combined at-risk couple rate of 0.2433%, accounting for 22.1% of the total ratio. NGS could only identify 22.7% of the at-risk couples for the five diseases in the LRS panel. Comprehensive carrier screening for high-prevalent diseases had higher clinical utility than expanding the list of low-prevalent diseases. Incorporating LRS into the NGS carrier screening strategy would facilitate more effective carrier screening."

We prospectively collected validated SMA outcome measures: Revised Hammersmith score (RHS), Revised Upper Limb Module, and 6-minute walk test (6MWT) as motor function outcomes and the Individualized Neuromuscular Quality of Life questionnaire. Baseline outcomes were compared with the outcomes after three years of treatment. All patients reported subjective improvement, and 9/11 reported an increased quality of life. Overall, 10/11 patients experienced clinically significant improvement in at least one measured outcome, while the remaining 1 patient reported the absence of disease progression. The mean increase in RHS was 2.7 points (P=0.062), and the mean increase in 6MWT was 39.7 m (P=0.239). Younger age and shorter disease duration correlated with better treatment outcomes (r=-0.543 and r=-0.666, respectively).

Nonlinear mixed-effects modelling (NONMEM 7.4) was used to develop a population PK model, explore covariates for paracetamol and its metabolites and perform simulations. With body weight as allometric scaling in the model, SMA disease resulted in a 58% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20%-130%) increase in the volume of distribution for paracetamol and its metabolites compared to healthy controls. Decreased plasma myoglobin and plasma bilirubin concentrations, seen in SMA patients, resulted in a higher paracetamol leftover clearance (SMA, median: 13.30 L/h/70 kg, 95% CI: 9.14-18.29%; HC, median: 4.05 L/h/70 kg, 95% CI: 3.38-8.83%) and a shift from slower sulfate formation clearance (SMA, median: 8.78 L/h/70 kg, 95% CI: 7.22-9.61%; HC, median: 9.30 L/h/70 kg, 95% CI: 8.42-10.15%) and faster oxidative metabolites elimination clearance (SMA, median: 3.74 L/h/70 kg, 95% CI: 3.31-4.72%; HC, median: 3.25 L/h/70 kg, 95% CI: 2.87-3.92%). Simulations revealed that in SMA patients, higher bodyweight was associated with increased exposure to paracetamol and its metabolites. The differences in PK between SMA patients and healthy controls could be explained by body weight and the disease itself. SMA patients should be dosed cautiously, ensuring doses do not exceed the recommended body weight adjusted limit."

Among 469 patients, 505 fractures were recorded, with 5.5% of patients experiencing a fracture within the past year. In the 10 years preceding study inclusion, 31.1% of all patients sustained at least one fracture. The fracture rate was 47.3/1000 patient-years. Fracture incidence was highest in the second decade of life and the first five years after symptom onset. Fracture recurrence occurred in 25.6% over the next two years. Fractures were most prevalent in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy type 1/2, and spinal muscular atrophy. Patients with Vignos scale 5-6 had the highest fracture risk. Major osteoporotic fractures accounted for 28.6%, and 71.3% were caused by low-energy trauma. Long-term complications of a fracture were present in 44.2%, with 9.0% losing ambulation.

Microglia-mediated inflammatory cytokine/chemokine release, motor neuron loss (MNL) and MW is observed after BI but connection of the central changes to synaptic-denervation and MW is unelucidated. Stimulation of microglia α7acetylcholine receptors (α7AChRs), a Chrna7gene-product, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties (decreased cytokine/chemokines). Hypothesis tested was that exploitation of the microglia α7AChR anti-inflammatory properties mitigates cytokine inflammatory responses, MNL, synaptic-denervation and MW of BI. Wild-type or α7AChR knockout (A7KO) mice received 30% body BI or Sham BI (SB) under anaesthesia with and without selective α7AChR agonist, GTS-21. Lumbar spinal cord tissue and hindlimb muscles were harvested. Immunohistochemistry, TUNEL assay for apoptosis and/or Nissl staining were used to examine microglia (Iba1 staining), MNL (NeuN staining) and synapse morphology (synaptophysin for nerve and α-bungarotoxin for muscle α7AChR). Spinal cytokine/chemokine transcripts, inflammatory transducer-protein expression and tibialis, soleus and gastrocnemius muscle weights were measured. BI to Wild-type mice caused significant microgliosis (5.8-fold increase, p < 0.001) and upregulated TNF-α, IL-1β, CXCL2, MCP-1 transcripts, and inflammatory transducer-protein (STAT3 and NF-κB, p < 0.01) expression together with increased transcripts of iNOS (p < 0.01) and CD86 (p < 0.01) at day 14 reflective of inflammatory M1 microglia phenotype. Significant apoptosis, MNL (32.2% reduction, p < 0.05), increased spinal caspase-3 expression (> 1100-fold, p < 0.05) and synaptic denervation were observed with BI. The tibialis muscle endplates (synapse) of SB had a smooth pretzel shaped appearance with good apposition of presynaptic nerve to postsynaptic muscle. In BI mice, the normal pretzel-like appearance was lost, and the endplates were fragmented with less nerve to muscle apposition. Tibialis, soleus, and gastrocnemius mass were decreased 31.7% (p < 0.01), 23.4% (p < 0.01) and 27.5% (p < 0.01) relative to SB. The A7KO mice with SB showed significant MNL loss (61.5% reduction, p < 0.05), which was aggravated with BI, accompanied by significantly higher expression of STAT3 and Nf-kB (p < 0.05). GTS-21 ameliorated the spinal expression of above enumerated cytokines/chemokines, inflammatory transducer-proteins (p < 0.05) together with mitigated MNL (p < 0.05), synaptic denervation (p < 0.05) and decreased MW of tibialis (25%), gastrocnemius (15%) and soleus (20%) relative to untreated wild type BI mice (p < 0.01). GTS-21 beneficial effects were absent in the A7KO mice. Microglia-mediated inflammatory responses play pivotal role in MNL as decrease of inflammatory responses improved MNL; α7AChR stimulation also mitigated synaptic denervation and MW changes of BI. α7AChRs have a role in spinal homeostasis even in uninjured state."

In this historical perspective we look back to the development paths of these two ASOs focusing on the differences between the approaches, the target tissues and the diseases. Based on this we propose learnings for future development of ASOs for progressive neuromuscular diseases."

    "title": "Prevalence and incidence rates of 17 neuromuscular disorders: An updated review of the literature.",
    "abstract": "Epidemiological frequency measures serve as reference point for patients, clinicians, researchers, and policymakers. Previously, we published a comprehensive review of the literature with prevalence and incidence rates for thirty neuromuscular disorders frequently encountered in the neuromuscular clinic. No meta-analyses were available at the time. We included various new studies and meta-analyses that have been published since 2014, we aim to update our previous review. Pubmed was searched for 'incidence' and 'prevalence' in combination with seventeen acquired and inherited neuromuscular disorders to identify peer-reviewed literature from 1990 to 2023. If multiple prevalence and incidence rates were found, these were summarized by providing the mean, the number of the estimates on which the mean was based and the range of these estimates. Additionally, we searched for meta-analyses to compare the found mean prevalence rates based on the summary of individual studies with the pooled prevalence rates based on the meta-analyses. The mean prevalence estimates for 17 disorders ranged from 0.3/100,000 population for Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, glycogenosis type V and nemaline myopathy to 20/100,000 for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type I. We found annual incidence rates for eight disorders, ranging from 0.3/100,000 population for progressive (spinal) muscular atrophy and facioscapulohumeral muscular atrophy to 1/100,000 for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 and myotonic dystrophy type 1. Plotting the mean prevalence estimates from the current study against the pooled prevalence estimates from eight meta-analyses showed reasonable agreement. Epidemiological frequencies about neuromuscular diseases- and in particular data on incidence are scarce. The mean prevalence estimates based on recently published studies on individual cohorts correspond well with the findings from the sparingly performed meta-analyses."

    "abstract": "Wheelchair users with neuromuscular disorders have symptoms related to the disease and complications to the sedentary lifestyle, such as constipation and lower back pain. Physical training might be beneficial. This systematic review investigates the potential benefits and harms of physical training for wheelchair users with neuromuscular disorders. We systematically searched PubMed including studies published until July 2024. Inclusion criteria: 1) participants with a neuromuscular disorder, 2) at least 60% of participants in a study were wheelchair users, 3) physical training and its effects were investigated, 4) studies were prospective, and 5) English language was used. Non-peer-reviewed articles were excluded. Search results were screened by title, abstract, and full text. Two independent authors assessed the quality with the Downs and Black Quality Index. We included 14 studies of 140 patients from 5 types of neuromuscular disorders (Duchenne muscular atrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, limb-girdle muscular atrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). The mean quality was low (16/32) due to flaws in study design, selection bias, and power. Even though many were of low quality and lacked descriptions of adverse events, they all showed positive effects. Most studies investigated physical training of mastication or respiration with improvements in both. Other findings were improvements in endurance, extremity strength, and range of motion. Physical training of wheelchair users with neuromuscular disorders is not well investigated. Physical training seems safe and beneficial, but training of respiratory and masticatory muscles is the only well-documented exercise modality that can be advised in patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy/Spinal Muscular Atrophy, respectively. Larger, high-quality trials, including other neuromuscular disorders, are needed to assess the effects and adverse events of physical training."

    "abstract": "Since 2016/17, three disease modifying therapies for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) have been translated into clinical practice. This has driven the implementation of newborn screening to transform health outcomes and clinical practice. SMA registries have provided important sources of data on the evolution of novel phenotypes within the therapeutic era, treatment patterns, epidemiology, genotype-phenotype correlations, care and lived experiences of people living with SMA, to enrich knowledge and learnings of the condition in this changed landscape. In this state-of-the-art review, we consider the utility and outcomes of SMA registries and evaluate their role and importance. In 2024 there are more than 35 national registries cataloguing over 8000 individuals with SMA. Additional registries are operated by advocacy groups and pharmaceutical companies, compiling data for more than 10,000 individuals with this condition. This review highlights the essential role of registries in supporting clinical trial recruitment, defining the changing incidence and prevalence of SMA in an age of reproductive carrier and newborn screening, establishing natural history data, contributing to post market drug surveillance, assessing real world clinical and cost effectiveness and capturing patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) and experience measures (PREMS). Whilst their utility is broad, barriers to effective data curation and management are evaluated including challenges of data curation and fragmentation, quality and sharing, alongside resource constraints and sustainability. Strategies to enhance the value of registries include the imperative to collaborate across clinical research networks and the value of interoperability, enabled by standardization of data collection and entry, sharing procedures and public and patient involvement. As new phenotypes and unmet needs emerge in the post therapeutic era, registries remain central tools in generating new insights now and into the future and are poised to respond meaningfully to the priorities of individuals living with SMA."

    "title": "Sensory Nerve Action Potential Analysis in a Cohort of Patients With Spinal Muscular Atrophy Aged 12 Years and Older.",
    "abstract": "Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1)-related spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is characterized by α-motor neuron degeneration, with sensory function assumed to be clinically preserved. However, recent studies in severely affected patients and animal models have challenged this view. Therefore, we assessed the maximum sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude of the median nerve in patients with SMA and examined its changes during treatment with SMN-splicing modifying therapies. We longitudinally assessed median nerve maximum SNAPs in 103 genetically confirmed patients with SMA (types 1c-4, aged ≥ 12 years) before and approximately 1 year after treatment with nusinersen or risdiplam. For comparison, we included 53 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, using identical settings. We also compared data with reference values from a previously published cohort. Maximum SNAPs were abnormal in 6 patients with SMA (6%), which was comparable to controls (8%), even when corrected for age. In patients younger than 50 years, abnormal maximum SNAPs were more prevalent in patients with SMA types 1 and 2. Maximum SNAPs were higher in SMA compared with controls. Maximum SNAPs showed an age-related decline in most cohorts, but the decline was steeper in patients with SMA type 1c. There was no difference in SNAPs after 1 year of treatment. Our findings suggest the preserved sensory integrity of the median nerve in the majority of patients with SMA (94%), even in longstanding disease. The resilience of sensory neurons of the median nerve, and whether this extends to other peripheral nerves, warrants further investigation. The study was approved by the local medical ethics committee (no. 20-143) and registered in the Dutch registry for clinical studies and trials (www.toetsingonline.nl-NL72562.041.20, March 26, 2020)."

With the expansion of newborn screening, more infants are now diagnosed presymptomatically. Currently, there are no established treatment guidelines for preterm infants with spinal muscular atrophy, with only anecdotal reports available. Additionally, there is limited knowledge regarding the safety and efficacy of the different treatments in preterm infants. In Israel, although a newborn screening program for spinal muscular atrophy is not yet implemented, a significant portion of the population participates in genetic carrier screening. Here, we present a case of presymptomatic preterm twins, born at gestational age of 32 + 2 weeks, birth weights of 1855 and 1740 g, respectively. They were treated with risdiplam followed by onasemnogene abeparvovec at a gestational age of 35 and 43 weeks, respectively. This case adds to the limited data on treatment options for preterm infants."

    "abstract": "With the availability of novel disease-modifying therapies (DMT), survival in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has significantly increased, but mortality is not rare in severely affected cases. To improve care further, we aimed to characterise causes of mortality in children with SMA over the last five years since the introduction of DMT. This was a retrospective review of all patients with SMA registered on SMA REACH UK database, who died between 2019 and 2023. In the last 5 years, 533 patients were registered with SMA REACH (6 pre-symptomatic; 1-SMA0; 247-SMA1; 188-SMA2; 91-SMA3). Twenty-five paediatric patients with SMA died in this period: 1 SMA0(4 %;1 copy-SMN2), 20 SMA1(80%;17 patients-2 copies of SMN2 and 1 with 3 copies of SMN2) and 4 SMA2(16%). In SMA 1 cohort, 7/20(35%) patients were treatment naïve (5 ineligible; 1 died prior to commencement; 1 declined). Twelve patients received nusinersen; median age at treatment initiation of 6 months (range:1 month-12.3 years old) and median treatment duration of 6 months (range:1 month-6.5 years). One patient switched from nusinersen to risdiplam at age 4 years (died 19 months later) and 1 received onasemnogene abeparvovec at 2 years old (died 10 months later). The median age of death was 10.5 months(range:8 weeks-13 years), and 80%(16/20) died from respiratory-related causes. In SMA 2 cohort, 2/4 patients were not eligible for DMT and one received risdiplam at age 13 years for duration of 2.7 years and died as result of traumatic brain injury. The median age of death was 18 years 4 months (range:16-21 years). Two deaths were respiratory-related and one of sudden cardiac arrest. In conclusion, over the last 5 years, 5% of SMA patients registered with SMA REACH died. The majority had symptomatic SMA1 with 2 SMN2 copies at the severe end of the spectrum and were either treatment naïve or had initiation of DMT after significant disease progression. Respiratory-related deaths occurred in 72% of known causes of death. Standard of care for respiratory management and ceiling of care discussions should continue to be a key part of the overall management particularly in those with severe disease at onset. These outcomes will be considerably improved once newborn screening will be available also in the UK."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe genetic neuromuscular disease caused by insufficient functional survival motor neuron protein (SMN). The SMN expression level in the spinal cord is highest during the 2nd trimester of the foetal period. We previously reported the SMN spot analysis in peripheral blood using imaging flow cytometry (IFC) as a biomarker of functional SMN protein expression. In this study, we analysed neonatal cord blood, postnatal peripheral blood, and maternal peripheral blood in presymptomatic five infants whose sibling has type 1 SMA to estimate prenatal and postnatal SMN dynamics before the onset of severe SMA. Data from 37 untreated patients with SMA showed that SMN-spot<sup>+</sup> cells were significantly correlated with SMA clinical classification and the copy numbers of the SMN2 gene. The range of values for cord blood, converted from each SMN2 copy number statistics, was - 0.7 to + 2.0 standard deviation (SD) (0.1-24.0%) for SMN-spot<sup>+</sup> cells in patients with SMA. Subsequent analyses of the peripheral blood of neonates ranged from - 0.8 to + 0.8 SD (0.4-15.2%). The analysis of each maternal blood, converted from carrier statistics, ranged from - 0.2 to + 2.4 SD (1.4-25.2%). A correlation was observed between the cord blood and maternal peripheral blood. This study suggests that the status of the motor neuron pool in the spinal cord can be presumed by cord blood SMN-spot<sup>+</sup> cells and that SMN protein depletion determines the timing of disease onset. As the SMN spot analysis values tended to decrease with time after birth, they may eventually lead to the development of SMA. Furthermore, a correlation was found between the SMN spot analysis values of neonatal cord blood and maternal blood, which predicts disease severity after birth. In other words, the SMN protein supplied from the mother to the foetus may suppress the development of SMA in the infant at birth, and depletion of the SMN protein may occur after birth, causing the infant to develop SMA. Our findings demonstrated the effectiveness of newborn screening and the potential of maternally mediated treatment strategies by providing a rationale for prompt treatment initiation in SMA."

    "title": "Elucidating the Pathogenic Mechanism of Spinal Muscular Atrophy Through the Investigation of <i>UTS2</i>.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (<i>SMN1</i>) gene, resulting in progressive motor neuron loss and muscle atrophy. The urotensin 2 (<i>UTS2</i>) gene, located on chromosome 9q34.2, plays a significant role in cellular activities such as proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. Notably, elevated expression levels of <i>UTS2</i> have been observed in SMA patients. However, its precise contribution to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of <i>UTS2</i>, which is overexpressed in SMA patients, in SMA cell models using a UTS2 inhibitor. We conducted genomic sequencing and bioinformatics analysis on clinical samples to identify proteins highly expressed in association with SMA. Using RNA interference technology, we suppressed <i>SMN1</i> gene expression in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to establish an <i>in vitro</i> cellular model of SMA. To assess the biological consequences of <i>SMN1</i> gene knockdown, we employed molecular biological techniques such as immunofluorescence, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and western blotting. Furthermore, we treated the SMA cellular model with the urantide UTS2 receptor inhibitor and examined its effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the expression of relevant proteins. UTS2 was successfully identified as a highly expressed protein associated with SMA. A stable MSC model with <i>SMN1</i> gene knockdown was established. RNA interference (RNAi) technology effectively suppressed <i>SMN1</i> gene expression, leading to changes in cellular morphology and neuron-specific marker expression. Urantide intervention significantly affected both proliferation and apoptosis in the SMA cell model in a dose-dependent manner. Techniques such as the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, TUNEL fluorescence staining, and flow cytometry analysis revealed that uride decreased cell viability while increasing the proportion of apoptotic cells. Following urantide intervention, there was a notable increase in caspase-3 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels, as well as an increase in caspase-3 protein expression, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence analysis. We elucidated the role of the <i>UTS2</i> gene in an SMA cell model, emphasizing its dysregulation and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Urantide, a UTS2 inhibitor, had significant biological effects on the SMA cell model, indicating that it is a promising therapeutic strategy for SMA. These findings provide valuable insights for advancing drug development and clinical treatment of SMA."

This retrospective cohort study evaluated age-related AAV9-Ab IgG seroprevalence for patients with SMA (part 1) and AAV9-Ab IgG kinetics and time to 1:50 titer threshold in newborns with elevated AAV9-Ab IgG titers (≥1:100) (part 2). A semi-quantitative ELISA assay was used in part 1 (<i>N</i> = 1,323 patients). For patients aged <12 months, 3.9% (<i>n</i>/<i>N</i> = 31/795) had elevated AAV9-Ab IgG titers (≥1:100); prevalence declined with age. In part 2, a new quantitative ELISA (linear mixed effects model) described continuous AAV9-Ab IgG concentrations for patients with initial titers ≥1:100. AAV9-Ab IgG concentrations waned according to first-order kinetics (58 samples; <i>N</i> = 18 patients). The model-based estimation of the AAV9-Ab IgG average half-life was 41 (95% CI, 38-44) days. Based on visualization, 200 ELISA units/mL was a reasonable approximate for the 1:50 titer threshold. In conclusion, initially elevated titers ≥1:100 in newborn patients declined with age. The new quantitative ELISA may allow for quantification of time to threshold for AAV9-Ab IgG retesting for onasemnogene abeparvovec treatment, leading to treatment as early as possible for patients with SMA."

Patients present in early childhood with muscle weakness due to anterior horn degeneration and/or progressive drug-resistant myoclonic epilepsy. Death usually results from respiratory complications or status epilepticus during adolescence. We identified 9 patients with SMA-PME from 5 different families followed in neurology, rehabilitation, and genetics departments of university hospitals in France and the United States. During disease progression, motor functional scores were assessed for seven of them and C26-ceramide quantification on dried blood spots (DBSs) was performed for 4 of them. An <i>in cell</i> assay, measuring the degradation rate of ceramides in living skin fibroblasts, was also performed in 2 patients. Finally, a literature review was conducted. Twelve years after the molecular characterization of SMA-PME, here we present the detailed history of 9 patients from 5 different families with 4 new <i>ASAH1</i> variants. The prospective follow-up for 4 of them allows us to evaluate the relevance of functional scales and of C26-ceramide assay on DBS, as a biomarker. In addition, an <i>in cell</i> assay could provide a more reliable level of the residual ceramidase activity. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we provide a detailed description of the natural history of the 44 patients with SMA-PME diagnosed to date and show a genotype-phenotype correlation for the 2 main variants and the disease onset. This study presents the detailed natural history of SMA-PME. Given the rarity of this disease and the current lack of a reliable biomarker for patient follow-up, this work may serve as a retrospective control group for future therapeutic trials."

Since 2014, more than 30 neurologic medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for neurologic conditions. This study aims to characterize recent trends in annual costs and aggregate spending from 2012 to 2021 for new-to-market (NTM) medications for 9 neurologic conditions. We used the Merative MarketScan commercial and Medicare supplemental databases to observe patients seen by a neurologist with neurologic diseases with newly FDA-approved medications from 2014 to 2021: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Huntington disease (HD), myasthenia gravis (MG), migraine, orthostatic hypotension (OH), tardive dyskinesia (TD), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Patients were included if they had ≥1 disease-related prescription medication fill from 2012 to 2021. NTM (medications approved from 2014 to 2021) and older evidence-based guideline-supported medications were observed annually. Outcomes examined were annual and aggregate out-of-pocket (OOP) and total medication costs. We identified 2,687 unique individuals with ALS, 38 with ATTR, 69 with DMD, 884 with HD, 9,984 with MG, 441,099 with migraine, 4,723 with OH, 1,266 with TD, and 17 with SMA. The youngest population was DMD (mean = 25 years [SD = 7]), and the oldest was TD (mean = 66 years [SD = 14]). For DMD, the population was 99% male and for migraine, the population was 84% female, and the other conditions had more relatively even sex divides. Collectively, migraine medications had the largest increase in aggregate costs (1993%) and had a substantial increase in OOP costs on average by 234% ($86-$288). Eculizumab for MG was an extreme outlier, with OOP costs increasing by 4,099% ($413-$17,359) and aggregate OOP costs by 7,005% ($5,375-$381,894). OOP costs of edaravone ($304-$5,707) and deutetrabenazine ($670-$7,170) sharply increased by 1,775% and 971%, respectively. NTM medications for neurologic conditions have substantial and increasing individual and societal costs, which was not observed for older generic medications. These data suggest a need for policies to limit the financial burden of NTM medications on patients with neurologic conditions."

    "abstract": "The evolving landscape of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) treatment in the United Kingdom allows patients to switch, with health authority approval, from one treatment to another. This retrospective analysis explores the characteristics of pediatric patients across the United Kingdom who switched between available therapies that included nusinersen, risdiplam, and onasemnogene abeparvovec (OA). Demographic data were collected, along with indicators of disease severity and motor function scores for all pediatric patients registered with the SMA REACH UK database who received nusinersen or risdiplam as initial treatments. Data were available for 375 patients across 19 sites. In total, 289 patients received nusinersen (of whom 21% switched to risdiplam and 16% to OA), and 86 patients received risdiplam (of whom 5% switched to OA). The top reported reasons for treatment changes were as follows: nusinersen to risdiplam: related to spine complexity (28/52), other difficulties related to administration (23/52); nusinersen to OA: parent preference (19/36), bridging to OA (14/36); risdiplam to OA: parent preference (2/2). After switching, no patients requested to go back to the initial treatment. No patients demonstrated deterioration beyond the expected disease trajectory prior to switching. The availability of treatments in the United Kingdom has fundamentally influenced treatment choices, but deterioration in a treatment was not identified as a factor in switching treatments. Further work will be needed to investigate the long-term trajectory of these patients."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare neurodegenerative disease that significantly affects multiple systems in children. Nusinersen, the first approved treatment for SMA, enhances SMN protein production by targeting the RNA splicing site of the SMN2 gene, thus improving motor function. However, the high cost of nusinersen treatment raises concerns about its economic feasibility. This study retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 42 pediatric SMA patients treated with nusinersen from January 2022 to October 2024 at our hospital. We assessed the efficacy, safety, and economic impact of nusinersen in different SMA types. Motor function was evaluated using the CHOP-INTEND, HINE-2, HFMSE, and RULM scales. Safety was assessed based on adverse reactions and events, and economic evaluation considered total treatment costs and average cost per injection. Nusinersen significantly improved motor function in SMA patients, especially in type I patients, who showed notable increases in CHOP-INTEND and HINE-2 scores. The RULM score had the highest increase among type II patients, while improvements were relatively lower in type III patients. Regarding safety, the incidence of adverse events was 40.48%, with fever being the most common adverse reaction, occurring in 36.36% of cases. Economic analysis indicated that the total treatment cost was highest for type III patients, though the cost differences among types were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Nusinersen demonstrated significant clinical efficacy and favorable safety in pediatric SMA patients, with improved economic feasibility after insurance coverage. Our findings support early SMA screening and presymptomatic nusinersen administration to maximize therapeutic benefits. Further multicenter, large-sample, long-term follow-up studies are warranted to validate and expand upon these findings."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by reduced expression of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. In addition to motor neuron survival, SMN deficiency affects the integrity and function of afferent synapses that provide glutamatergic excitatory drive essential for motor neuron firing and muscle contraction. However, it is unknown whether deficits in the metabolism of excitatory amino acids and their precursors contribute to neuronal dysfunction in SMA. To address this issue, we measured the levels of the main neuroactive D- and L-amino acids acting on glutamatergic receptors in the central nervous system of SMN∆7 mice as well as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SMA patients of varying severity before and after treatment with the SMN-inducing drug Nusinersen. Our findings reveal that SMN deficiency is associated with disruption of glutamate and serine metabolism in the CSF of severe SMA patients, including decreased concentration of L-glutamate, which is partially corrected by Nusinersen therapy. Moreover, we identify dysregulated l-glutamine/L-glutamate ratio as a shared neurochemical signature of altered glutamatergic synapse metabolism that implicates neuron-astrocyte dysfunction in both severe SMA patients and mouse models. Lastly, consistent with hypo-glutamatergic neurotransmission in SMA, we show that daily supplementation with the NMDA receptor co-agonist d-serine improves neurological deficits in SMN∆7 mice. Altogether, these findings provide direct evidence for central dysregulation of D- and L-amino acid metabolism linked to glutamatergic neurotransmission in severe SMA and have potential implications for treating this neurological disorder."

We present a retrospective, single-center case series detailing our center's experience with six patients diagnosed with type 1 spinal muscular atrophy who switched from risdiplam to OA. Risdiplam was discontinued the day before the OA infusion, and we evaluate the safety aspects of this switch. All patients continued risdiplam until the day before administration of OA, with a wash out period of between 24 and 33 hours prior. All patients have had follow-up for at least 12 weeks, while 3 patients who lived locally received ongoing follow-up ranging from 14 to 27 months after OA infusion. All patients remained stable or improved in their motor scores and need for ventilatory support and feeding support requirement. Adverse events reported after OA switch included tachycardia, fever, nausea, vomiting, raised transaminases, and mild neutropenia. All adverse events in these children were either known adverse events of OA or were not considered secondary to OA or risdiplam treatment. No unexpected adverse event was demonstrated post-OA in patients stopping risdiplam a day before OA infusion. Data presented here suggest that stopping risdiplam a day before OA treatment did not seem to be associated with increased risk."

    "abstract": "The nuclear-encoded enzyme polymerase gamma (Pol-γ) is crucial in the replication of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), which in turn is vital for mitochondria and hence numerous metabolic processes and energy production in eukaryotic cells. Variants in the <i>POLG</i> gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of Pol-γ, can significantly impair Pol-γ enzyme function. Pol-γ-associated disorders are referred to as POLG-spectrum disorders (POLG-SDs) and are mainly autosomal-recessively inherited. Clinical manifestations include muscle weakness and fatigue, and severe forms of the disease can lead to premature death in infancy, childhood, and early adulthood, often associated with seizures, liver failure, or intractable epilepsy. Here, we analyzed fibroblasts from a compound heterozygous patient with the established pathogenic variant c.2419C>T; p.(Arg807Cys) and a previously undescribed variant c.678G>C; p.(Gln226His) with a clinical manifestation compatible with POLG-SDs, sensory ataxic neuropathy, and infantile muscular atrophy. We conducted a battery of functional studies for Pol-γ and mitochondrial dysfunction on the patient's fibroblasts, to test whether the novel variant c.678G>C; p.(Gln226His) may be causative in human disease. We analyzed skin-derived fibroblasts in comparison to a first-degree relative (the mother of the patient), an asymptomatic carrier harboring only the established c.2419C>T; p.(Arg807Cys) mutation. Assessments of mitochondrial function included measurements of mtDNA content, mRNA levels of mitochondrial genes, mitochondrial mass, and mitochondrial morphology. A 13-year-old male presented with symptoms starting at three years of age, including muscle weakness and atrophy in the lower extremities and facial muscles, which later extended to the upper limbs, voice, and back muscles, without further progression. The patient also reported fatigue and muscle pain after physical activity, with no sensory deficits. Extensive diagnostic tests such as electromyography, nerve conduction studies, muscle biopsy, and MRI were unremarkable. Exome sequencing revealed that he carried the compound heterozygous variants in <i>POLG</i> c.678G>C; p.(Gln226His) and c.2419C>T; p.(Arg807Cys), but no other potential genetic pathogenic causes. In comparison to a first-degree relative (his mother) who only carried the c.2419C>T; p.(Arg807Cys) pathogenic mutation, in vitro analyses revealed a significant reduction in mtDNA content (~50%) and mRNA levels of mtDNA-encoded proteins. Mitochondrial mass was reduced by approximately 20%, and mitochondrial interconnectivity within cells was impaired, as determined by fluorescence microscopy and mitochondrial staining. Our findings suggest that the c.678G>C; p.(Gln226His) variant, in conjunction with the c.2419C>T; p.(Arg807Cys) mutation, may compromise mtDNA replication and mitochondrial function and could result in clinically significant mitochondriopathy. As this study is based on one patient compared to a first-degree relative (but with an identical mitochondrial genome), the pathogenicity of c.678G>C; p.(Gln226His) of <i>POLG</i> should be confirmed in future studies, in particular, in conjunction with other <i>POLG</i>-variants."

    "abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> The objective of this study is to quantify healthcare resource utilization, economic burden, and the multi-level medical security system for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) patients in Shaanxi Province, China, from a societal perspective using a survey. <b>Methods</b>: This observational study employed an online survey with a retrospective cross-sectional design in Shaanxi Province, China. The survey examined various aspects of SMA, including resource utilization, direct and indirect economic burdens, and co-payment mechanisms within a multi-level medical security system. <b>Results:</b> Following the inclusion of nusinersen in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) in 2022, the treatment rate for SMA patients increased significantly. After risdiplam was added to the NRDL in 2023, its use also saw a marked increase. Treatment costs varied by SMA type: Type 1 incurred the highest costs (RMB 300,000 or USD 41,000), followed by Type 2 (RMB 270,000 or USD 37,000), Type 3 (RMB 200,000 or USD 27,000), and Type 4 (RMB 80,000 or USD 11,000). The primary sources of costs were productivity losses due to primary caregivers (32.94%), nusinersen usage (29.29%), and risdiplam usage (17.33%). Out-of-pocket costs for SMA patients accounted for 29.29% of the total costs. In 2023, basic medical insurance covered 49% of direct costs and 32% of total costs. Patients still had to pay 25.73% of the total cost for the direct costs. <b>Conclusions:</b> Basic medical insurance is a critical foundation for patient security and plays a pivotal role in reimbursement. In contrast, commercial insurance has a relatively limited impact on covering the costs for SMA patients. These findings highlight the substantial healthcare burden faced by SMA patients under the current healthcare system in China."

We evaluated and summed up all costs for health services (diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, and rehabilitation), educational and social services, and formal and informal care in the community, as well as indirect costs due to the loss of productivity and work capacity of the SMA patients' caregivers. <b>Results</b>: Nine parents of SMA patients provided consent and completed the study's questionnaire. Two children had SMA type III, and seven had SMA type II. The median annual socio-economic burden per SMA patient was EUR 254,968.80. The high direct costs, primarily driven by drug expenses, and the substantial indirect costs resulting from the loss of productivity among informal caregivers were the primary causes. We found no utilization of social care and educational services. <b>Conclusions</b>: We emphasize the need for careful consideration of long-term outcomes, real-world data collection, and performance-based reimbursement. An ideal scenario could achieve these objectives in synergy. A second layer of policy actions and measures must address the unmet needs of SMA patients and their families using a holistic approach. The indirect costs associated with SMA, particularly the productivity loss of informal caregivers, underscore the need for comprehensive support programs."

    "abstract": "Although spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), hereditary hearing loss (HL), and thalassemia are common monogenic genetic diseases, the carrier frequencies and variant spectrums of these diseases show regional differences, even within China. Their carrier frequencies and variant spectrums in Southern Zhejiang, China are unclear. Saliva was collected for carrier screening and amniotic fluid, villi, and peripheral blood were collected for prenatal diagnosis. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) were used to detect the copy number of SMN1 exon 7. PCR coupled with flow-through hybridization, MLPA, and Sanger sequencing were used to detect common genes for HL and thalassemia. Common variants were detected in 15.14% (2109/13926) of the 13,926 women of reproductive age from South Zhejiang who participated in this study. The carrier frequencies of SMA, HL, and thalassemia were 2.11% (294/13926), 4.87% (678/13926), and 8.82% (1228/13926), respectively. In total, 56.47% (1117/1978) of husbands were successfully recalled. The total number of at-risk couples was 111 (111/13926, 0.80%). Further, 47 families underwent prenatal diagnosis. A total of 13 (13/13926; 0.93‰) affected pregnancies were identified. Our findings confirm that SMA, HL, and thalassemia are highly prevalent in Southern Zhejiang, with some regional specificity, as compared with recent large population-based surveys in China. Further, a rapid saliva sample-based non-invasive screening method was established, and its feasibility was demonstrated."

Non-Hispanic White (NHW, n = 113), Black/African American (B/AA, n = 66), and Chinese American (ChA, n = 38) participants recruited from two universities were included. We examined if plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> correlated with CSF and clinical factors, differed between racial groups, and associated with novel CSF proteins. CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub> strongly correlated with CSF p-Tau<sub>217</sub> (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.912) which moderately correlated with plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.694). Plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> levels were higher with greater cognitive impairment but lower in B/AA than NHW participants even after adjusting for CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>. This resulted in greater positive predictive value for NHW than B/AA participants, and could be mediated by complement or lysosomal pathways. Severity of cognitive impairment and race both influence plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> levels beyond race-associated differences in CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>. Cognitive impairment associates with plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> independent of CSF biomarkers. Black/African Americans had lower plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> than non-Hispanic White Americans. CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub> could not explain lower plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> in Black/African Americans. Plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> difference results in more false positive cases according to race.

Additionally, we evaluated feasibility and effectiveness of respiratory oscillometric measurements in the same patients. Twenty patients were retrospectively evaluated. NIV requirement was considered as peak nocturnal transcutaneous PCO<sub>2</sub> > 49 mmHg, according to the cut-off used by Ward et al. MIP and SNIP were feasible in all patients. SNIP had significantly higher values (p < 0.001) and poorly agreed with MIP. ROC analysis revealed MIP as a weak predictor for NIV initiation (AUC = 0.57), while FVC (AUC 0.78, best cut-off 20% of predicted) and SNIP (AUC 0.84, best cut-off 61 cmH<sub>2</sub>O) were more effective. Oscillometry was performed in 11 patients. Reactance was abnormal in six of them and was significantly correlated with FVC (ρ = 0.70, p = 0.01) and SNIP (ρ = 0.72, p = 0.007), but not with MIP. In adult SMA patients, both MIP and SNIP are feasible, but SNIP is a better predictor of NIV needs, similar to FVC. Optimal predictive thresholds differed from those previously observed in neuromuscular disease. Oscillometric measurements may help to estimate FVC and SNIP in poorly collaborating patients."

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA, MIM#253300) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by defects in the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) gene. The SMN1 gene, recognized as the primary pathogenic gene for SMA, exhibits a high degree of sequence homology with SMN2 gene. Individuals with the SMN1 2 + 0 genotype represent a unique type of SMA carrier, characterized by two SMN1 copies on one chromosome and zero copies on the other. Accurate identification of this type of carrier is crucial for genetic counseling in families. This study included 28 samples from five SMA families, each with an affected patient carrying a homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene and a parent suspected to be a SMN1 2 + 0 carrier. Comprehensive Analysis of SMA (CASMA), based on third-generation sequencing technology, was used to detect the SMN1 and SMN2 copy numbers in the samples, and SMN1 2 + 0 carriers were identified through SMN1 haplotypes in parent-child trios (CASMA-trio). The results were compared with those obtained using Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) combined with Short Tandem Repeat (STR) linkage analysis. The SMN1 and SMN2 copy numbers detected by MLPA and CASMA were concordant across 25 peripheral blood samples, whereas CASMA failed to accurately determine the copy numbers in the remaining 3 amniotic fluid samples. CASMA-trio identified 5 members from 4 families as SMN1 2 + 0 carriers, which were consistent with the results from STR linkage analysis. However, the two methods yielded inconsistent results for the proband's father in one family. These findings suggest that CASMA has the potential to detect SMN1 and SMN2 copy numbers. Compared to STR linkage analysis, CASMA-trio only requires a parent-child trio to analyze SMN1 2 + 0 carriers, demonstrating a broader application prospect. Implementing CASMA-trio can facilitate comprehensive screening for SMA carriers."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a varying degree of severity that correlates with the reduction of SMN protein levels. Motor neuron degeneration and skeletal muscle atrophy are hallmarks of SMA, but it is unknown whether other mechanisms contribute to the spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Here, through a combination of physiological and morphological studies in mouse models and SMA patients, we identify dysfunction and loss of proprioceptive sensory synapses as key signatures of SMA pathology. We demonstrate that Type 3 SMA patients exhibit impaired proprioception, and their proprioceptive synapses are dysfunctional as measured by the neurophysiological test of the Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex). We further show moderate loss of spinal motor neurons along with reduced excitatory afferent synapses and altered potassium channel expression in motor neurons from Type 1 SMA patients. These are conserved pathogenic events found in both severely affected patients and mouse models. Lastly, we report that improved motor function and fatigability in ambulatory Type 3 SMA patients and mouse models treated with SMN-inducing drugs correlate with increased function of sensory-motor circuits that can be accurately captured by the H-reflex assay. Thus, sensory synaptic dysfunction is a clinically relevant event in SMA, and the H-reflex is a suitable assay to monitor disease progression and treatment efficacy of motor circuit pathology."

While treatments like nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec improve prognosis for patients with SMA, costs for these medications can contribute to economic burden. Direct costs were compared for onasemnogene abeparvovec, a one-time gene replacement therapy, versus nusinersen, a lifelong therapy, for patients with SMA type 1 and/or three or more survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene copies in the Netherlands. A cost comparison analysis model of 1-year incident patient population from the Netherlands was used to compare costs of onasemnogene abeparvovec versus nusinersen for patients eligible for onasemnogene abeparvovec immediately after diagnosis. Multiple analyses were conducted for economic outcomes (e.g., base-case, break-even, deterministic sensitivity, probabilistic sensitivity, scenario analyses). Cost differences of -€2.9 million (undiscounted) and -€1.5 million (discounted) per patient with SMA type 1 treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec versus nusinersen over a 20-year time horizon were identified (base-case). Reduced costs with onasemnogene abeparvovec versus nusinersen were evident after 8.25 years. Onasemnogene abeparvovec was less costly than nusinersen after 8.25 years of treatment of patients with SMA type 1 in the Netherlands."

In January 2021, we initiated the first pilot study in Spain to evaluate the efficacy of a very early detection technique for SMA and SCID. RT-PCR was performed on prospectively collected dried blood spots (DBSs) from newborns in Western Andalusia (Spain). Internal and external controls (SCID, XLA and SMA) were included. The determination of SMA was relative (positive/negative) and that of TRECs and KRECs was quantitative (copies/punch). A total of 14.035 prospective samples were analysed. All controls were correctly identified while no cases of SMA or SCID/XLA were prospectively identified. DBS analysis of infants with suspected SMA or STBCL that presented to our centre showed pathological values in two cases each for SMA and SCID and one for XLA, all of them being subsequently confirmed genetically. In this prospective pilot study, no infants with SMA or STBCL were detected; however, the technique applied here was shown to be reliable and fast, further supporting the benefits and need to include SMA and SCID in national newborn screening (NBS) programs, as it will allow early supportive and curative therapy."

In phase I, a high birth incidence of sickle cell disease was found (1:928 NBs), resulting from the identification of 24 HbSS and 2 HbSC patients. This birth incidence decreased but remained significant when the pilot study for sickle cell disease newborn screening was expanded to a national level, with the identification of 67 sickle cell disease patients (59 HbSS and 8 HbSC), revealing a birth incidence of 1:2449 NBs. These data suggest that this condition is becoming increasingly relevant in Portugal, thus reflecting a general European trend, where sickle cell disease is already recognized as a public health problem. Therefore, it highlights the importance of its integration into the Portuguese National Newborn Screening Program panel in January 2024, thus allowing the early identification and clinical follow-up of these patients."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (<i>SMN1</i>) gene. While traditionally viewed as a motor neuron disorder, there is involvement of various peripheral organs in SMA. Notably, fatty liver has been observed in SMA mouse models and SMA patients. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether intrinsic depletion of SMN protein in the liver contributes to pathology in the peripheral or central nervous systems. To address this, we developed a mouse model with a liver-specific depletion of SMN by utilizing an <i>Alb-Cre</i> transgene together with one <i>Smn<sup>2B</sup></i> allele and one <i>Smn1</i> exon 7 allele flanked by loxP sites. Initially, we evaluated phenotypic changes in these mice at postnatal day 19 (P19), when the severe model of SMA, the <i>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></i> mice, exhibit many symptoms of the disease. The liver-specific SMN depletion does not induce motor neuron death, neuromuscular pathology or muscle atrophy, characteristics typically observed in the <i>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></i> mouse at P19. However, mild liver steatosis was observed, although no changes in liver function were detected. Notably, pancreatic alterations resembled that of <i>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></i>mice, with a decrease in insulin-producing β-cells and an increase in glucagon-producingα-cells, accompanied by a reduction in blood glucose and an increase in plasma glucagon and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1). These changes were transient, as mice at P60 exhibited recovery of liver and pancreatic function. While the mosaic pattern of the Cre-mediated excision precludes definitive conclusions regarding the contribution of liver-specific SMN depletion to overall tissue pathology, our findings highlight an intricate connection between liver function and pancreatic abnormalities in SMA."

Further, healthcare professionals' experiences of the care of children with SMA during the pandemic were explored. Thirty-nine parents and three grandmothers of 28 children with SMA answered a web-based survey at two time-points. Telephone follow-ups were conducted with seven of the parents. Parallel focus group interviews were conducted with three interdisciplinary teams of healthcare professionals. Results showed that 21 family members, 12 children, and nine parents in the study tested positive for COVID-19 during the pandemic. None of the children became seriously ill. All respondents, however, indicated that the pandemic had a significant impact on their everyday life. It made socializing difficult for the children and reduced their access to physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, and personal care attendants. The pandemic also influenced the location of some nusinersen treatments. The professionals reported that, although much of their work continued as usual, they experienced increased stress from their role in nusinersen assessments. These results suggest that it may be valuable to find ways for healthcare professionals to support each other and to support their efforts to help severely ill children and their families now that healthcare systems have opened up again."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the progress in implementing newborn screening for spinal muscular atrophy and therapy accessibility worldwide, after the first paper published in 2021. We conducted a survey, contacted experts from 143 countries worldwide, gathered responses from 86 experts from 80 countries. By 2023, 31 countries reported established programs, 33 in the beginning of the year 2024; identifying approximately 1176 cases of spinal muscular atrophy. Additionally, the availability of disease-modifying therapies has expanded. At least one therapy is now accessible in 62 countries. Challenges, such as lack of governmental support, resource constraints, and varying healthcare priorities continue to impede implementation in some countries. The data shows a significant increase in the implementation of newborn screening programs since 2021. The experts are still expressing a strong need for equitable access to standard of care for all the patients globally.

    "abstract": "Fatigue and fatigability are commonly reported in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Physical fatigability, proposed to be the most relevant to SMA pathophysiology, encompasses performance-based and perceived physical fatigability (PPF) assessments. While performance-based measures have highlighted physical fatigability as an SMA hallmark, PPF is not well characterized due to the lack of disease- and construct-specific scales. Our aim was to create a patient-reported outcome measure tailored for SMA, named the SMA EFFORT, to improve PPF assessment. Here, we describe the scale development process, assess scale properties, and discuss future research and application. SMA and scale development experts organized a comprehensive physical activity item bank, relevant across the SMA phenotypic spectrum. Activities were systematically categorized by varying intensities and durations. The SMA EFFORT was completed by an international cohort of individuals with all types of SMA. To compare PPF across demographic and clinical variables, SMA EFFORT PPF percent (PPF%) composite scoring was established. One hundred eighteen participants completed the SMA EFFORT. Total PPF% scores were broadly distributed within functional groups, with differences between non-sitters (35.1 ± 21.0) and sitters (24.9 ± 15.1) (<i>p </i>= 0.006), and those with (34.4 ± 18.1) and without respiratory support (26.4 ± 17.8) (<i>p </i>= 0.02). Participants treated with disease modifying therapy (DMT) showed similar scores to those without treatment (<i>p </i>= 0.70). Further, no differences in scores were observed in participants with scoliosis surgery and those without (<i>p </i>= 0.71). Subscale analyses revealed differences in mean PPF% subscale scores by functional group. The novel SMA EFFORT standardizes PPF ratings by anchoring activity to intensity and duration. Item and scale data insights will inform the next iteration, which will undergo additional investigation. The SMA EFFORT aims to improve upon current measures to better assess treatment impact on physical well-being across the SMA spectrum."

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a progressive neuromuscular disorder that in its most severe form, causes profound swallowing deficits. There remains a paucity of research systematically elucidating the biomechanical and functional correlates. This void limits the ability to evaluate the effects of disease-modifying treatments on swallowing. Elucidate characteristics of swallowing biomechanics and function among untreated patients with SMA. Infants with SMA who had not received disease modifying therapy when they underwent a videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) were retrospectively identified from 13 international children's hospitals. Infants were eligible if they exhibited symptoms by six months old, or in cases where they detected prior to symptom onset, if they had two copies of SMN2. Eligible infants underwent medical record review to gather oral intake status and need for suctioning for secretion management. Digital files of VFSS' were extracted and analyzed using BabyVFSSImP™. Non-parametric t-tests were used to compare swallowing biomechanics based on viscosity and the presence of dysphagia symptoms. 62 infants were included in this investigation with average age at initial VFSS 4.4 ± 3.11 months. A high proportion of infants exhibited profound deficits in swallowing biomechanics that impeded extraction of the bolus from the nipple, clearance of the bolus from the pharynx, and prevention of the bolus from entering the airway. Deficits were significantly more prevalent in infants referred for VFSS due to dysphagia symptoms than asymptomatic infants referred as part of high-risk referral (t ≤ 2.5, p ≤ 0.03). A high proportion of infants relied on suctioning for secretion management (34%; N = 21) and alternative nutrition (39%; N = 24), with those relying on these supports exhibiting significantly worse swallowing biomechanics than those who did not (t ≤ 2.8, p ≤ 0.01). Profound deficits in swallowing biomechanics and function are common in infants with SMA. Though clinical symptoms may aid in identifying infants with the most profound swallowing deficits, their absence in cases of more mild deficits inhibits the ability to use these clinical markers as a valid metric of swallowing integrity."

    "title": "Newborn screening and rapid genomic diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases.",
    "abstract": "BackgroundIn recent years, treatments have been approved for certain neuromuscular diseases. In some cases, early pre-symptomatic treatment is necessary for optimal response, and thus newborn screening is critical.ObjectiveTo review the current status of newborn screening programs for neuromuscular diseases and early diagnosis through genetic testing.MethodsFollowing the PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was performed on PubMed for screening of neuromuscular diseases; the search was conducted on literature available as of 1 May 2024.ResultsIncluded were 77 articles on newborn screening for seven diseases: spinal muscular atrophy (19 studies), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (15), Pompe disease (20), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (14), Krabbe disease (6), metachromatic leukodystrophy (2), and myotonic dystrophy 1 (1). Ten articles on rapid genomic diagnosis were identified.ConclusionSince 2021, newborn screening programs for neuromuscular diseases have been established, notably in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, Pompe disease, and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Even in diseases where treatment is currently not life-changing, such as Krabbe disease, new newborn screening programs continue to be implemented, especially in the USA. The use of genetic diagnostic tests does not yet appear to be widespread or at least not widely reported. As new treatments become available, genomic newborn screening programs will need to be rapidly and broadly implemented."

    "abstract": "BackgroundSpinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) leads to motor neuron loss, with progressive muscle weakness and wasting. Nationwide registries for neuromuscular diseases are pivotal for assessing epidemiology, preparing for clinical trials, and for adopting standardized management guidelines.ObjectivesThis paper aims to present data gathered during the establishment of Pakistan's inaugural registry for genetically confirmed SMA cases.MethodsIn this retrospective study, 215 participants with genetically confirmed SMA were recruited. Telephonic interviews were conducted to collect data for the Muscular Disease Registry of Pakistan that was analyzed using STATA version 17.0.ResultsSMA type 1 was the most common type (71.2%, n = 153). Amongst patients who were tested for survival motor neuron (<i>SMN2</i>) copies, the majority (84.4%, n = 168) had two <i>SMN2</i> copies. SMA types were significantly associated with the ability to sit (p < 0.001) and walk (p < 0.001), and usage of a wheelchair (p = 0.0054). <i>SMN2</i> copy numbers were significantly associated with the ability to sit (p = 0.020) and walk (p = 0.031).ConclusionsThis study highlights the high prevalence of SMA genotypes and phenotypes associated with severe disease in our population. Our findings reiterate the challenging prognosis for Pakistani children with SMA and underscore the necessity of the development of nationwide newborn screening programs and making treatments available."

    "abstract": "Improvement and maintenance of bulbar function are important goals of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), but standardized and validated measures for assessing bulbar function do not exist, nor does a widely accepted definition of bulbar function in SMA. As such, the impact of DMTs on bulbar function has not yet been comprehensively evaluated. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify evidence about the impact of DMTs for SMA on bulbar function. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines to conduct this review. Embase<sup>®</sup> and MEDLINE<sup>®</sup> databases were searched through August 10, 2023. Eligible studies included patients with SMA who were treated with any DMT and reported bulbar function outcomes. Non-English studies were excluded. We identified 51 studies (across 83 publications) that evaluated SMA DMTs and bulbar function for more than 1600 patients. The ability to feed orally, the ability to tolerate liquids, and the need for nutrition support were commonly reported. Most infants treated with any DMT before SMA symptom onset preserved bulbar function. Infants, children, and adults treated after SMA symptom onset experienced variable results in terms of bulbar function outcomes. The definition and assessment of bulbar function are not standardized. Therefore, the tools, scales, methods, and timing used for bulbar function assessments varied among studies. Larger prospective studies using standardized and age-based assessments with longer follow-up periods are needed to assess the clinical stability of bulbar function for patients with SMA who receive DMTs."

    "abstract": "Patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) are at higher risk of diminished bone health due to decreased ambulation and mobility. With the advent of new FDA-approved therapies, we aimed to analyze the effects of SMA therapy on bone mineral density (BMD) using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan data of 27 patients diagnosed with SMA Type 1, 2, or 3. Patients were divided into those with DXA scans both before and after treatment (older cohort), and patients with first DXA post-treatment (cohort treated in infancy). In patients with DXA both before and after treatment, SMA drug therapy did not normalize (Z-score > -2) bone density in anyone with pre-established low bone mineral density. Patients with first DXA post-treatment initiation had a higher rate of normal bone mineral density compared to older cohort. Fractures were also tracked; frequency of fractures after therapy decreased from 52 % of patients to 14 % (p = 0.0584)."

    "title": "The Effect of Disease-Modifying Therapies on Lung Function and Respiratory Muscle Strength in Spinal Muscular Atrophy: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is often complicated by respiratory problems. The disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) (nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec, and risdiplam) have improved survival, motor function, and functional muscle strength in patients with SMA, but their effects on lung function and respiratory muscle strength need further clarification. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of studies that documented the effects of DMTs on lung function and respiratory muscle strength in patients with SMA types I, II, III, and IV. <b>Methods:</b> We searched the electronic databases PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science up to December 2023. We included pre-post studies that determined the effect of DMTs for SMA on lung function or respiratory muscle strength in patients with SMA. Where possible, we performed a meta-analysis using a random-effects model with generic inverse variance weighing. <b>Results:</b> We included 19 studies of 376 identified records (16 longitudinal cohort studies and 3 case series) with 384 participants. Seventeen studies investigated the effect of nusinersen, and two studies investigated the effect of risdiplam. Seventeen studies had a moderate and two had a high risk of bias. Most of these studies did not report statistically significant improvement in lung function or respiratory muscle strength after treatment with nusinersen or risdiplam. A meta-analysis of 13 studies showed no statistically significant improvement in FVC after 2, 6, 10, and > 12 months of treatment with nusinersen. <b>Conclusions:</b> The findings of this review indicate that there is moderate evidence that nusinersen does not improve FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, peak expiratory flow, or maximum inspiratory pressure in subjects with SMA types I, II, III, or IV. There was no statistically significant decline in lung function and respiratory muscle strength after treatment. This may suggest that nusinersen may have stabilized lung function and respiratory muscle strength."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to screen for SMN1 (OMIM#600354) deletion carriers in 6035 pregnant women in the eastern part of Fujian Province, to provide a theoretical basis for genetic counseling and further prenatal diagnosis of the disease, and to explore the carrier frequency and clinical significance of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in the eastern part of Fujian Province. Pregnant women treated at the prenatal diagnosis institution of Ningde Municipal Hospital of Ningde Normal University from February 2022 to October 2023 were selected as research subjects. The exons 7 and 8 (E7 and E8) of the survival of motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1) from 6035 pregnant women were detected using real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR). Spouses of pregnant women with positive results were recalled for gene detection, and prenatal diagnosis was performed for both partners as carriers. A total of 100 SMA carriers were detected in 6035 pregnant women, including 98 with heterozygous deletions of E7 and E8 of the SMN1 gene and two with heterozygous deletions of E7 only. The carrier frequency was 1.66%. One couple was both identified as SMA carriers, and their fetus with a homozygous deletion of E7 and E8 of the SMN1 gene was finally detected by prenatal diagnosis and gene analysis. The frequency of SMA mutation in the Ningde area of Fujian province has been identified, which can provide the basis for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. Interventional prenatal genetic diagnosis for high-risk fetuses can effectively prevent the birth of children with SMA and is crucial for preventing and controlling birth defects."

    "abstract": "Three medications have been approved for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) treatment. No head-to-head clinical trials have directly compared the efficacy of nusinersen and risdiplam. We compare the efficacy of them in Type 2 and 3 SMA patients, with 6 months of follow-up. A multicenter cohort study was conducted. Demographic, genetic and clinical findings containing Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) and revised upper limb module (RULM) scales were gathered. An increase of at least 3 points in HFMSE and RULM scores was considered a positive response. 73 (58.4%) children received risdiplam, and 52 (41.6%) received nusinersen non-randomly, based on clinical decision. The difference in HFMSE and RULM scores compared to the baseline was significant in both groups (P-value <0.001). However, there was no significant difference between mean difference changes in HFMSE and RULM scores between the two groups. 80.4% of patients in the risdiplam group and 72% in the nusinersen group achieved the 3-point cutoff after 6 months, and there is no significant difference between the two groups (P-Value:0.33). This study showed that both medications significantly changed the HFSME and RULM after 3 and 6 months of follow-up. However, there was no significant difference between the two drugs according to the HFSME."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common fatal autosomal recessive genetic disorder in childhood, primarily caused by homozygous deletion of the <i>SMN1</i> gene. Its main characteristics include the degenerative changes in the anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord, leading to symmetrical progressive muscle weakness and atrophy of the proximal limbs. However, SMA patients with the same genetic background often exhibit different degrees of disease severity. In addition to the well-established modifier gene <i>SMN2</i>, the effect of other modifier genes on clinical phenotypes should not be overlooked. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the pathogenic and modifier genes of SMA, aiming to provide a deeper understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and phenotypic differences in SMA, as well as to offer new strategies and targets for treating this condition."

    "title": "Keratocan Improves Muscle Wasting in Sarcopenia by Promoting Skeletal Muscle Development and Fast-Twitch Fibre Synthesis.",
    "abstract": "Osteosarcopenia refers to the co-occurrence of osteoporosis and sarcopenia, which are characterized by progressive bone density and muscle mass loss, respectively. Muscle and bone are regulated by many common genes and pathways, enabling potential co-treatment. Because keratocan protects against osteoporosis, we hypothesized it may also protect against sarcopenia, implying a new co-intervention target. This study aimed to elucidate the role and molecular mechanisms of keratocan in skeletal muscle. We analysed keratocan expression in the muscles of aged mice and patients with osteosarcopenia and during the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. The regulatory role of keratocan was assessed by knocking down or overexpressing keratocan in C2C12 cells and examining any effects on myogenic proliferation and differentiation. RNA sequencing analysis was also performed on these cells. The relationship between keratocan and enriched signalling pathways was verified using pathway inhibitors or agonists. Finally, adeno-associated virus-9 containing a muscle-specific promoter was injected into SAMP8 senile mice to observe the effects of keratocan overexpression. Keratocan expression was significantly lower in the skeletal muscles of aging mice (-2.02-fold, p < 0.01) and patients with osteosarcopenia (-1.78-fold, p < 0.001) compared with that in controls. Keratocan overexpression resulted in a significant increase in the proliferation indices CCND1 (+1.43-fold, p < 0.001), Ki67 (+2.30-fold, p < 0.001) and PCNA (+1.975-fold, p < 0.01) and the differentiation indices MyoD1 (+2.156-fold, p < 0.001), MyoG (+1.52-fold, p < 0.05) and myosin heavy chain (MyHC; +2.849-fold, p < 0.01); conversely, the muscle atrophy indices MuRF-1 (-30%, p < 0.01), atrogin-1 (-87%, p < 0.01) and myostatin (-24%, p < 0.01) were significantly decreased. PI3K/AKT/mTOR was identified as a potential pathway for keratocan regulation in C2C12 cells. PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reversed the promotion of myogenesis by keratocan overexpression, while PI3K activator 740Y-P reversed the inhibitory effect of keratocan knockdown on myogenesis, promoting myofibre development and ameliorating muscle atrophy in SAMP8 aging mice. This was evidenced by increased mean muscle cross-sectional area (+38%, p < 0.0001) and muscle mass (+7%, p < 0.01) and decreased fibrosis (-40%, p < 0.01). Furthermore, keratocan facilitated the conversion of slow-to-fast muscle fibres through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, characterized by significantly increased grip strength (+42%, p < 0.01) and maximum running speed (+19%, p < 0.001), and decreased fatigue time (+13%, p < 0.05). Keratocan ameliorates muscle atrophy by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, promoting muscle satellite cell proliferation and myogenic differentiation, and facilitating the conversion of slow-to-fast muscle fibres. Our findings demonstrate the potential of keratocan as a novel therapeutic target for osteosarcopenia."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to report on therapeutic scoliosis-specific exercises (PSSE) for a child with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) who had spinal fusion. PSSE were recommended after scoliosis was diagnosed and exercises focused on posture and improving strength preoperatively and restoring function postoperatively. Gross motor function remained stable before spinal fusion, briefly decreased after the procedure, and then stabilized post-surgery. Distance walked on the 6-minute walk test decreased post-surgery but improved after the addition of PSSE to the Standard of Care. Including PSSE as an adjunct to traditional interventions may be beneficial for children with SMA. Evidence supports incorporating PSSE to improve posture preoperatively in idiopathic scoliosis. Its use postoperatively and in children with SMA is not well studied. Controlled studies are needed to understand the impact of pre- and post-op PSSE in children with SMA."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to systematically appraise and synthesize real-world data of motor function and safety in Asian patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) treated with nusinersen or risdiplam. This study systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, CNKI, and Wanfang databases for real-world studies (RWS) published from January 2017 to January 2024. Based on the prespecified study selection and eligibility criteria, RWS evaluating motor function and/or safety outcomes in patients with types 2-4 SMA treated with nusinersen or risdiplam were included, while studies without Asian populations were excluded. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the risk of bias, and a meta-analysis was conducted for each motor function endpoint based on the extracted data. A total of 26 RWS were included in this review, of which 17 reporting main motor function outcomes were included in the meta-analyses. Intervention in all 17 studies was nusinersen; none included risdiplam. Statistically significant improvement was observed in Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) [Mean difference (MD) = 2.27 (0.84, 3.71)], Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) [MD = 2.62 (1.79, 3.45)] and six-minute walk test (6MWT) [MD = 18.29 (9.12, 27.45)] when treated with nusinersen ≤ 6 months and > 6 months (HFMSE [MD = 4.34 (3.54, 5.14)]; 6MWT [MD = 45.59 (12.92, 78.27)]). Clinically meaningful responses of motor milestones were also observed when treating nusinersen over 6 months: 54.4% (0.305, 0.772) for RULM, 53.0% (0.273, 0.779) for HFMSE and 97.1% (0.819, 1.000) for 6MWT. A total of 19 studies addressed safety outcomes. Reported adverse events were consistent with the expected safety profile for nusinersen. Our study suggests that nusinersen is associated with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful motor function improvement in Asian patients with types 2-4 SMA in the real-world setting. No unexpected safety concern was observed for nusinersen. Motor function and safety outcomes after risdiplam could not be evaluated in this patient population under real-world settings due to limited studies."

    "abstract": "Little clinical data is available for advanced cases of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1, particularly those requiring ventilation support. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of nusinersen treatment on motor and respiratory function in advanced cases of SMA type 1. This observational cohort study included seven patients with advanced SMA type 1, requiring permanent ventilator support and tracheostomy, at Hyogo Medical University School of Medicine Hospital between July 2017 and July 2019. The primary outcome was change in motor function, assessed using the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) score. Subjective changes, which could not be measured with CHOP-INTEND, were also evaluated. The secondary outcomes included changes in respiratory function, measured by tidal volume (TV) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO<sub>2</sub>) levels. Two patients showed a meaningful improvement in CHOP-INTEND scores (an increase of 4 points) after 2-3 years of nusinersen treatment. The remaining five showed changes ranging from 0 to 2 points. Subjective changes were observed in all patients. Patient respiratory function outcomes varied; TV increased in two patients and decreased in five, and TcCO<sub>2</sub> levels decreased in three patients and increased in four. Nusinersen may provide meaningful improvement in motor function in some patients with advanced SMA type 1; however, treatment response may take a while and varies between individuals. Further research is needed to substantiate these findings and identify potential prognostic factors for nusinersen treatment."

Onasemnogene abeparvovec is a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (rAAV9)-based gene therapy that has demonstrated improvements in survival and motor function for SMA patients. Here, we present a case of a patient diagnosed with a grade 1 pilocytic astrocytoma at the age of 2 years, approximately 8 months after onasemnogene abeparvovec treatment. Although vector genomes delivered by rAAVs persist primarily as episomes, rare integration events have been linked to tumor formation in neonate murine models. Therefore, we investigated the presence and possible integration of onasemnogene abeparvovec in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) and frozen tumor samples. In situ hybridization demonstrated variable transduction levels in individual tumor cells, while droplet digital PCR measured an average vector copy number ranging from 0.7 to 4.9 vector genomes/diploid genome. Integration site analysis identified a low number of integration sites that were not conserved between technical replicates, nor between FFPE and frozen samples, indicating that cells hosting integrating vector genomes represented a minority in the overall cell population. Thus, molecular analysis of the tumor tissue suggests that tumorigenesis was causally independent of the administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec."

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a genetic neuromuscular disorder caused by homozygous mutation or deletion of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, leading to a low quantity of SMN protein in cells. This depletion of SMN protein preferentially leads to death of motor neurons and, consequently, muscle atrophy, in addition to defects in many other peripheral tissues. SMN protein is naturally loaded into extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are sub-micron-sized, membrane-bound particles released from all cell types. The innate ability of EVs to deliver cargo to recipient cells has caused these vesicles to gain interest as therapeutic delivery vehicles. In this study, we show that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SMN protein in HepG2 cells leads to the release of EVs loaded with high levels of SMN protein into conditioned medium. Application of this medium to recipient cells in tissue culture led to uptake of the SMN protein, which subsequently transited to the nucleus and co-localized with Gemin2 protein, forming nuclear gem-like structures similar to the native SMN protein. Overall, this work demonstrates that SMN protein can be delivered to cells through EVs, which holds promise as a potential therapy for patients with SMA."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating neuromuscular condition resulting from the loss of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Precise genetic testing has become essential after the authorization of several potent medications. To achieve this objective, the use of dried blood spot (DBS) has assured convenient and extensive testing from a distance. Nevertheless, developing countries such as Indonesia sometimes lack access to standard filter papers like FTA or Guthrie cards for DBS processing. Here, we aim to develop a cellulose-based card as an alternative filter paper for DBS preparation suitable for the genetic testing of SMA including but not limited to a direct polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and multiplex allele-specific amplification (multi-ASA). An in-house paper was developed from a 180 gsm cellulose-based paper and was used for DBS preparation. The performance of dried blood spotted on the cellulose-based card (DBSc) was compared to pure genomic DNA (gDNA) isolate and dried blood spotted on FTA cards (DBSf) for genetic testing. The results of the genetic testing of our cellulose-based card were completely matched with those of gDNA and DBSf in both direct PCR-RFLP and Multi-ASA to separate SMN1 from SMN2. In addition, after three months of storing, the DBSc continued to exhibit a clear result, suggesting its high stability for DNA storage. Our cellulose-based card has the potential to be used for DBS carrier and for further genetic testing using PCR. Our findings can assist physicians in sending DBS samples from SMA suspicion cases to genetic testing centers, thereby preventing diagnosis delay or misdiagnosis."

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle atrophy is commonly present in various pathological states, posing a huge burden on society and patients. Increased protein hydrolysis, decreased protein synthesis, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and unfolded protein response (UPR) are all important molecular mechanisms involved in the occurrence and development of skeletal muscle atrophy. The potential mechanisms of ERS and UPR in skeletal muscle atrophy are extremely complex and have not yet been fully elucidated. This article elucidates the molecular mechanisms of ERS and UPR, and discusses their effects on different types of muscle atrophy (muscle atrophy caused by disuse, cachexia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), aging, sarcopenia, obesity, and starvation), and explores the preventive and therapeutic strategies targeting ERS and UPR in skeletal muscle atrophy, including inhibitor therapy and drug therapy. This review aims to emphasize the importance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in maintaining skeletal muscle homeostasis, which helps us further understand the molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle atrophy and provides new ideas and insights for the development of effective therapeutic drugs and preventive measures for skeletal muscle atrophy."

The impact of nusinersen treatment on myocardial function in children with SMA remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate changes in left ventricular (LV) function in children with SMA before and after nusinersen treatment using echocardiography. A prospective observational study was conducted on 35 children with SMA who received six doses of nusinersen within 10 months at a tertiary hospital in China. 35 healthy controls were included for comparison. LV function was assessed using echocardiography at baseline and after 10 months of treatment. LV dyssynchrony and myocardial strain were measured using two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. The mean age of the SMA children was 6.58 ± 3.11 years. Before treatment, the global longitudinal strain (GLS) in the SMA group was significantly lower than in the control group (p < 0.001), and LV systolic synchronization was poorer (p < 0.001). Following nusinersen treatment, GLS increased (p < 0.001) and synchrony improved (p = 0.004) in the SMA group. However, even after 10 months of treatment, GLS in the SMA group remained lower than in the control group (p = 0.011), and LV synchronization was still inferior (p = 0.028). Short-term nusinersen treatment improved LV function in children with SMA, as evidenced by changes in LV myocardial strain indicators. Further research is warranted to explore the treatment of myocardial injury in SMA patients."

This study investigates neurofilament light chain (NfL) concentrations during long-term nusinersen treatment in adult SMA. In a retrospective study of prospectively collected data, NfL concentrations in the CSF (cNfL) and serum (sNfL) were measured in patients with SMA from 8 German centers and in neurologic controls using a single-molecule array (Simoa) assay. NfL concentrations and clinical characteristics, including the clinical scores Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), were analyzed for defined treatment intervals (T1-T4 [loading phase until 4 months], T5-T8 [until 23 months], T9-T12 [until 37 months], and T13-T19 [until 60 months]). Linear mixed models with a random intercept were used to assess the changes in NfL levels during treatment, considering time and covariates as fixed effects. One hundred thirteen adult patients with SMA (median age 35, 46% female), with a treatment duration of maximum 60 months, and 52 controls were included. At baseline, NfL concentrations were significantly higher in SMA {cNfL median, 585 (interquartile range [IQR] 428-787) pg/mL; sNfL, 11 (IQR 8-14) pg/mL} than in controls (cNfL, 420 [IQR 323-662] pg/mL; sNfL, 8 [IQR 6-12] pg/mL) (cNfL, <i>p</i> = 0.021; sNfL, <i>p</i> = 0.030). Median differences for all clinical scores were the highest for T5-T8 compared with the loading phase (Δ HFMSE, 0.6 [IQR 0.1-1.4], <i>p</i> = 0.017; Δ RULM, 0.9 [IQR 0.4-1.3], <i>p</i> < 0.001; Δ ALSFRS-R, 0.7 [IQR 0.4-1.0], <i>p</i> < 0.001), but not for subsequent intervals. Longitudinal analysis revealed a significant decrease of NfL concentrations during each treatment interval compared with the loading phase (<i>p</i> < 0.05, respectively) except for sNfL in T13-T19. Even among patients with no measurable clinical improvement (Δ HFMSE ≤ 0), more than 50% showed declining cNfL and sNfL levels up to T13-T19. NfL decreased during nusinersen treatment, suggesting its potential as a pharmacodynamic response marker in adult SMA. However, in patients without detectable clinical improvement, our study cannot determine whether they represent a more sensitive outcome measure or are not clinically meaningful."

However, it has also contributed to further inbreeding, leading to an increased risk of outbreaks of monogenic recessive defects. Some long-known inherited diseases such as arachnomelia, spinal muscular atrophy, spinal dysmyelination, Weaver syndrome and renal dysplasia are now of little clinical importance, while new haplotypes and gene variants associated with reproductive disorders have recently been described. These include so-called fertility haplotypes and genetic diseases that rarely or never occur homozygous because the affected animals die shortly after birth or early in pregnancy. This work provides an overview of the known recessive genetic defects in Swiss Braunvieh cattle. Data from 56, 000 Swiss breeding cattle on 12 genetic defects show that known inherited diseases in Braunvieh only occur very sporadically (defect allele frequency < 1 %). Only the recently described achromatopsia (Original Braunvieh haplotype 1) has a relevant defect allele frequency of over 7 % and should be taken into account for mating plans in order to avoid calves with day blindness. In addition, the Braunvieh haplotypes 6 and 14 and the Original Braunvieh haplotypes 4 and 9 occur between 2-6 % and the mating of heterozygous carriers should be avoided in order to avoid homozygous offsprings that are presumably not embryonically viable. The further spread of known genetic defects can be prevented through comprehensive genotyping of the breeding populations and the careful selection of breeding animals, recently also with the help of digital apps for mating planning. Thus, genetically caused reproductive losses or the number of affected animals can be reduced, animal health and welfare can be sustainably improved through selective breeding."

    "title": "Genomic analysis of the SMN1 gene region in patients with clinically diagnosed spinal muscular atrophy: a retrospective observational study.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease. Most patients with SMA have a mutation in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene on chromosome 5q. With current genetic testing, SMN1 copy number is determined; a diagnosis is reached when the copy number is zero. When the SMN1 copy number is 1, exons and intron/exon boundaries of the allele are examined for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). Genetically undiagnosed cases of SMA exist when 2 copies of SMN1 exist or when a SNV is in the deep intron. Furthermore, SMN1 is highly homologous to SMN2; therefore, it is expected that many SNVs have not been elucidated. This retrospective observational study conducted in Japan used pre-collected DNA samples from patients with clinically diagnosed SMA. Enrollment period was January 28, 2020 to September 30, 2021. SNV analysis of SMN1 (exon 1-8 and intron 1-7) was conducted by long-range polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing. From 336 DNA samples collected from patients, 62 patient samples were included in the SNV analysis. Two patients have been genetically diagnosed (a heterozygous variant in intron 6 with 1 copy of SMN1; a homozygous missense mutation in exon 3 with 2 copies of SMN1). Three SNVs in intron 6, c.834+1506A>G (n = 9), c.834+1751G>A (n = 2), and c.835-367C>A (n = 5) were identified; all were numerically, and c.834+1506A>G and c.835-367C>A were significantly, more frequent in patients with 0 copies versus those with ≥ 1 copy of exon 7 in SMN1. We confirmed 3 hybrid SMN gene types in 5 patients that contained SMN2 gene sequence (aaTgg) flanked by upstream \"t\" and downstream \"G\" SMN1 sequence. In this study of patients with clinically diagnosed SMA, 2 cases with genetic SMN types were identified that would not have been identified through current genetic testing, which examines SMN1 deletions only. Furthermore, for 1 patient with a homozygous SMN1 missense mutation, SMA was not suspected by the current copy number screening method. This study demonstrated the importance of performing full-length sequencing for clinically diagnosed SMA to complement current screening methods.

    "title": "The lived experience of migrant Syrian mothers' interaction with the neonatal screening program.",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of migrant Syrian mothers regarding the neonatal screening programs (NSP) using in-depth interviews. Women were selected from the Migrant Health Center (MHC), which is the primary health care institution in Istanbul. A translator who spoke Arabic, the native language of participants, used an open-ended, semi-structed interview form to guide face-to-face interviews with participants. Questions were about sociodemographic information, opinions about NSP's heel prick testing, diseases the test screens for, reasons for agreeing to the heel prick test, and challenges faced accessing health care services. The interviews were audio recorded. The translator then transcribed the audio recordings in Arabic and translated them into Turkish. The framework method for analysis of qualitative data was used to analyze transcripts of the interviews. Forty-one migrant women were interviewed. Four themes were identified from analysis of transcripts of the interviews, regarding (1) knowledge of the NSP, (2) attitudes about the NSP, (3) practices that create barriers to accessing health care services, (4) practices to overcome barriers to accessing health care services. Most participants had no knowledge of the diseases the NSP tests for. A few participants had heard of congenital hypothyroidism (CH), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), but they were not aware of the symptoms and effects of these diseases. Some participants thought the heel prick test benefited their child's health as it enables early diagnosis and treatment of diseases. All participants agree to heal prick testing after the birth of their most recent child. Participants noted the information and recommendations health care professionals provided influenced their decision to agree to the heel prick test. Most participants experienced language barriers when accessing health care services. Migrant women expressed a positive attitude toward the NSP. Future health care interventions regarding migrants should aim to reduce the negative experiences they encounter accessing health care, such as language barriers."

    "abstract": "Here, we report an autopsy case of concurrent spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). A 55-year-old man presented with weakness, atrophy, and fasciculation of the tongue and the proximal parts of all limbs. The patient gradually developed severe orthostatic hypotension, urinary retention, and cerebellar ataxia; however, no parkinsonism was observed. The patient succumbed to sudden death during sleep. The autopsy revealed widespread and abundant α-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic inclusions in the central nervous system, indicative of MSA. Neuronal loss was also observed in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. Consequently, the patient was diagnosed with MSA. Additionally, immunostaining for the monoclonal 1C2 antibody revealed positive neurons in the medulla oblongata and spinal cord, supporting the additional diagnosis of SBMA. Genetic analysis revealed an expansion of 41 CAG repeats in the androgen receptor (AR) gene (normal range: 12-38), confirming the diagnosis of SBMA. Altogether, concurrent SBMA and MSA were diagnosed based on the autopsy findings, making this the first reported case of such coexistence in the Japanese and English literature."

    "title": "Therapeutic targeting of the polyglutamine androgen receptor in Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy.",
    "abstract": "Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy (SBMA) is a slowly progressive, X-linked, and sex-limited degenerative disorder affecting lower motor neurons and skeletal muscle which lacks disease-modifying therapies. This disease is caused by a CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) tract expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, and its pathogenesis is driven by toxic gain-of-function mechanisms. Affected men develop proximal limb and bulbar muscle weakness along with signs of partial androgen insensitivity. Toxicity of the polyQ AR is mediated by protein misfolding and nuclear translocation that follow ligand binding, resulting in the disruption of downstream homeostatic mechanisms. This review highlights what is known about disease pathogenesis and how this has been leveraged to test potential therapeutic approaches. The focus is on strategies that alleviate polyQ AR toxicity in SBMA, including those that alter AR function, diminish the expression of the encoding gene, or promote clearance of the misfolded, mutant protein. We discuss emerging strategies to mitigate polyQ AR toxicity, including gene editing, RNA targeted therapies, and efforts to harness proteostatic mechanisms. These promising approaches are discussed in the context of challenges for drug discovery efforts that are faced when attempting to treat a rare and slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease causing motoneuron dysfunction, muscle weakness, fatigue and early mortality. Three new therapies can slow disease progression, enabling people to survive albeit with lingering motor impairments. Indeed, weakness and fatigue are still among patients' main concerns. Here we show that epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS) improved motoneuron function, thereby increasing strength, endurance and gait quality, in three adults with type 3 SMA. Preclinical works demonstrated that SMA motoneurons show low firing rates because of a loss of excitatory input from primary sensory afferents. In the present study, we hypothesized that correcting this loss with electrical stimulation of the sensory afferents could improve motoneuron function. To test this hypothesis, we implanted three adults with SMA with epidural electrodes over the lumbosacral spinal cord, targeting sensory axons of the legs. We delivered SCS for 4 weeks, 2 h per day during motor tasks. Our intervention led to improvements in strength (up to +180%), gait quality (mean step length: +40%) and endurance (mean change in 6-minute walk test: +26 m), paralleled by increased motoneuron firing rates. These changes persisted even when SCS was turned OFF. Notably, no adverse events related to the stimulation were reported. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05430113 ."

    "abstract": "The landscape of spinal muscular atrophy care is evolving with the emergence of disease-modifying therapies and newborn screening programs, leading to new phenotypes and changing patient needs. This necessitates a reevaluation of existing care recommendations to address new challenges and opportunities in spinal muscular atrophy management. To better evaluate how different areas of care have evolved since the advent of disease-modifying therapies, we focused on highlighting areas where existing practices remain valid, those in which changes are needed and supported by evidence, and those in which further research or experience is required. The initiative brought together experts from the Italian spinal muscular atrophy community, initially involving a survey of care practices and a two-day event with workshops on specific topics. The results of the survey and focus groups provide the experts' opinions of the changing aspects of care for key domains: nutrition and bone health, swallowing, respiratory function, and rehabilitation and management of spine deformities. Suggestions were provided, identifying immediate actionable changes and areas requiring further investigation. This framework represents an initial step towards updating care recommendations in the era of novel therapies. It offers a critical view of the evolving care landscape, balancing established practices with emerging evidence and identifying key areas for future research."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy 5q (5q SMA) is one of the most prevalent autosomal recessive disorders globally. The underlying cause of 5q SMA is attributed to variants in SMN1. Exon 7 of SMN1 is not detectable in major of probands with 5q SMA, and minor of probands have a combination of the deletion and an intragenic subtle variant in the second allele. From 1991 to 2023, DNA samples from 2796 probands representing unrelated families were analyzed at the Research Centre for Medical Genetics for the diagnosis of 5q SMA. The copy number of Exon 7 of SMN1 and SMN2 was determined for all probands by MLPA. Subsequently, direct automated Sanger sequencing was employed to perform intragenic subtle variant screenings in all 116 probands with one copy of Exon 7 of SMN1. The diagnosis of 5q SMA was confirmed in 1495 probands. Among the 41 probands with one copy of Exon 7 of SMN1 from the initial 116 tested, 24 intragenic subtle variants in SMN1/SMN2 were documented. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize intragenic subtle variants in SMN1 and analyze their relationship with clinical manifestations in probands with 5q SMA in the Russian cohort."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare neuromuscular disease caused by biallelic mutations in the SMN1 gene, leading to progressive muscle weakness due to degeneration of the anterior horn cells. Since 2017, SMA patients can be treated with the anti-sense oligonucleotide Nusinersen, which promotes alternative splicing of the SMN2 gene, by regular intrathecal injections. In this prospective study, we applied metabolomic, lipidomic, and proteomic analysis to examine sequential CSF samples from 13 SMA patients and controls. This multi-omic approach identified over 800 proteins and 400 small molecules including lipids. Multivariate analysis of multi-omic data successfully discriminated between the CSF derived from SMA patients and control subjects. Lipidomic analysis revealed increased levels of cholesteryl esters and lyso-phospholipids, along with reduced levels of cholesterol and phospholipids in the CSF of SMA patients as compared to healthy controls. These data, combined with results from functional assays, led us to conclude that SMA patients exhibit altered levels and function of high-density-lipoprotein (HDL)-like particles in the CSF. Notably, Nusinersen therapy was observed to reverse disease-specific profile changes toward a physiological state, potentially explicable by restoring HDL function."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a health- and life-limiting neuromuscular disorder. Although varying degrees of mitochondrial abnormalities have been documented in SMA skeletal muscle, the influence of disease progression on pathways that govern organelle turnover and dynamics are poorly understood. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate skeletal muscle mitochondria during SMA disease progression and determine the effects of therapeutic modalities on organelle biology. Smn<sup>2B/+</sup> and Smn<sup>2B/-</sup> severe SMA-like mice were used to investigate mitochondrial turnover and dynamics signalling. Muscles were analysed at postnatal day 9 (P9), P13 or P21 to address pre-symptomatic, early symptomatic and late symptomatic periods of the disorder. Additionally, we utilized an acute dose of exercise and urolithin A (UA) to stimulate organelle remodelling in skeletal muscle of SMA mice in vivo and in SMA patient-derived myotubes in vitro, respectively. Smn<sup>2B/+</sup> and Smn<sup>2B/-</sup> mice demonstrated similar levels of muscle mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) proteins throughout disease progression. In contrast, at P21 the mRNA levels of upstream factors important for the transcription of mitochondrial genes encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, including nuclear respiratory factor 2, sirtuin 1, mitochondrial transcription factor A and tumour protein 53, were upregulated (+31%-195%, p < 0.05) in Smn<sup>2B/-</sup> mice relative to Smn<sup>2B/+</sup>. Early and late symptomatic skeletal muscle from SMA-like mice showed greater autophagosome formation as denoted by more phosphorylated autophagy related 16-like 1 (p-ATG16L1<sup>Ser278</sup>) puncta (+60%-80%, p < 0.05), along with a build-up of molecules indicative of damaged mitochondria such as BCL2 interacting protein 3, Parkin and PTEN-induced kinase 1 (+100%-195%, p < 0.05). Furthermore, we observed a fragmented mitochondrial phenotype at P21 that was concomitant with abnormal splicing of Optic atrophy 1 transcripts (-53%, p < 0.05). A single dose of exercise augmented the expression of citrate synthase (+43%, p < 0.05) and corrected the over-assembly of autophagosomes (-64%, p < 0.05). In patient muscle cells, UA treatment stimulated autophagic flux, increased the expression of OxPhos proteins (+15%-47%, p < 0.05) and improved maximal oxygen consumption (+84%, p < 0.05). Abnormal skeletal muscle mitochondrial turnover and dynamics are associated with disease progression in Smn<sup>2B/-</sup> mice despite compensatory elevations in upstream factors important for organelle synthesis and recycling. Exercise and UA enhance mitochondrial health in skeletal muscle, which indicates that lifestyle-based and pharmacological interventions may be effective countermeasures targeting the organelle for therapeutic remodelling in SMA."

Despite being primary caregivers, mothers of children with SMA in Ghana often find their voices unheard, with restricted access to vital interventions like counselling, support groups, and respite care designed to aid them. This study aimed to explore the experiences of mothers caring for children with SMA in Ghana, where the diagnosis is often delayed and support systems are limited. We conducted an interpretative phenomenological study with a purposive sample of seven mothers whose children, aged between 8 and 24 months, were diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and registered with the Rare Disease Ghana Initiative (RDGI). Individual interviews were conducted between August and September 2023 using semi-structured interview guides. The data were manually analysed using a pen-and-paper method. The study adhered to ethical guidelines, including informed consent procedures and confidentiality measures to protect participants' rights and privacy. This study explored mothers' experiences caring for children with SMA, revealing a spectrum of challenges that impact their physical, emotional, spiritual, and social well-being. The findings identified five dominant themes and thirteen subcategories, encompassing issues such as sleep deprivation, mental health concerns, emotional turmoil, practical difficulties, and social isolation. It was also found that mothers tend to have a deep connection to their faith and a sense of closeness to God during challenging times, which provides them with strength and comfort. This collectively identifies the difficult journey of these mothers as they seek diagnosis and treatment for their children. The study identified challenges faced by mothers in caring for their children with SMA. These challenges are reported to significantly impact their physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being. To support these mothers effectively, it is recommended that the Ministry of Health, Ghana Health Service, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and non-governmental organisations in Ghana should consider community engagement and education, integration of spiritual care, and psychosocial support programmes."

    "abstract": "Wearable sensors have the potential to transform diagnosis, monitoring, and management of children who have neurological conditions. Traditional methods for assessing neurological disorders rely on clinical scales and subjective measures. The snapshot of the disease progression at a particular time point, lack of cooperation by the children during assessments, and susceptibility to bias limit the utility of these measures. Wearable sensors, which capture data continuously in natural settings, offer a non-invasive and objective alternative to traditional methods. This review examines the role of wearable sensors in various paediatric neurological conditions, including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, as well as Rett syndrome, Down syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy, ataxia, Gaucher disease, headaches, and sleep disorders. The review highlights their application in tracking motor function, seizure activity, and daily movement patterns to gain insights into disease progression and therapeutic response. Although challenges related to population size, compliance, ethics, and regulatory approval remain, wearable technology promises to improve clinical trials and outcomes for patients in paediatric neurology."

    "abstract": "Motor dysfunction in various diseases and aging is often accompanied by skeletal muscle atrophy and reduced axonal projections from motor neurons to the skeletal muscles. While several studies have investigated the correlations and molecular mechanisms between muscle atrophy and motor neuron denervation to explain the pathology of motor diseases, it remains unclear whether skeletal muscle atrophy directly causes axonal denervation of motor neurons. Here, we used a casts-attached mouse model which represents muscle atrophy and motor dysfunction in the hindlimbs to explore how skeletal muscle atrophy affects motor neuronal axon projections. Retrograde neuronal tracing from the skeletal muscles to motor neurons revealed that axonal projections from motor neurons were reduced to the atrophied skeletal muscles compared to the healthy muscles. In addition, we identified glycogen phosphorylase (GP) as an upregulated protein in the plasma membrane of atrophied gastrocnemius muscles. The expression level of GP was also increased on the membrane of primary cultured myotubes treated with dexamethasone to induce muscle atrophy in vitro. Importantly, intramuscular injection of a GP inhibitor into the hindlimbs improved motor function in a mouse model of spinal cord injury. Furthermore, axonal projection from spinal cord neurons to dexamethasone-treated atrophied myotubes was reduced compared to healthy myotubes, whereas GP inhibitor treatment to atrophied myotubes promoted axonal growth of the spinal cord neurons overlayed on the myotubes. This study demonstrated that skeletal muscle atrophy induces attenuation of motor neuronal innervation and inhibition of GP in atrophied skeletal muscles may be a novel therapeutic approach for spinal cord injury by enhancing axonal projections from motor neurons to the skeletal muscles."

These conditions significantly affect patients' quality of life and impose a substantial burden on caregivers. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a relatively common NMD in children that presents in various types with varying degrees of severity. This study aimed to evaluate the sleep quality of children with NMDs, particularly SMA types 1, 2, and 3 and assess the stress levels experienced by their parents. A descriptive analytical study was conducted from February to October 2023, in selected hospitals and dystrophy associations in Tehran and Isfahan, Iran. A total of 207 children aged 1-14 years with various NMDs were included in the study. Data were collected using a web-based questionnaire with 3 parts: demographic information, the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire to assess children's sleep, and the Stress Response Inventory to measure parental stress. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22, with an α level of .05. Significant differences in sleep quality were found among SMA types, with mean scores of 74.76 (SD 7.48) for SMA type 1, 76.4 (SD 7.29) for SMA type 2, 72.88 (SD 6.73) for SMA type 3, and 75.87 (SD 5.74) for other NMDs (P=.02). A correlation was found between sleep and length of hospital stay (r=0.234, P<.001)and between sleep and the child's sex (r=-0.140, P=.04). Parental stress scores averaged 95.73 (SD 32.12). There was not a statistically significant difference in parental stress scores among the 4 groups (P=.78). This suggests that parental stress levels were similar across different NMD groups. Sleep disorders are prevalent among children with NMDs, especially SMA. Parents experience high levels of stress that can affect the care they provide. Therefore, interventions to improve children's sleep and address parental stress are crucial. Regular screening, counseling, and tailored support are recommended to enhance the well-being of children with NMDs and their families."

During the course of the disease, however, some patients exhibit concomitant non-motor signs; thus, MNDs are currently perceived as multisystem disorders. Assessment of non-motor symptoms is usually performed clinically, although laboratory tests can also be routinely used to objectively evaluate these symptoms. Sympathetic Skin Response (SSR) is an example of a neurophysiological test that has been used in cases of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, and Monomelic Atrophy, mostly to assess Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) disorders. Dysautonomia affects quality of life and life expectancy, as it is involved in cardiovascular events and incidents of sudden death. SSR abnormalities are present even in subclinical involvement of the ANS in MNDs. In this review, we present published research examining SSR findings in various MNDs, and discuss the correlation of SSR findings with clinical symptoms and disease severity, as well as the potential sources of abnormal findings. The aim of this study is to raise clinician awareness of autonomic dysfunction in MNDs and present the benefits of SSR examination in patient care."

This stratified randomized controlled trial, conducted in the advanced critical care center of a university hospital, comprised 49 individuals with American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale grade C and D incomplete cervical SCI. The participants were stratified based on the ASIA impairment scale grade and randomly assigned to the control (n = 25) or NMES (n = 24) group. The control group participants received only conventional rehabilitation; the NMES group participants received conventional rehabilitation plus NMES in the quadriceps muscles of both lower limbs. The primary endpoints were quadriceps muscle thickness and L3 ASIA lower extremity motor score (L3 motor score), measured at the study's initiation and after 2 weeks. The quadriceps muscle thickness changes on the stronger and weaker sides were -14.2% ± 11.3% and -15.1% ± 13.8%, respectively, in the NMES group and -25.7% ± 16.8% and -26.0% ± 13.3%, respectively, in the control group, indicating significantly lesser reduction on both sides in the NMES group (<i>p</i> <0.05).

This observational, retrospective analysis of natural history data included untreated individuals with a genetic diagnosis of types 1-3 SMA and stratified disease-related characteristics by SMN2 copy number. The outcomes investigated were time to: death, permanent ventilation, respiratory support, feeding support, scoliosis surgery, and achievement and loss of motor milestones. Of 134 individuals; 33 had two SMN2 copies and 101 had 3 or more copies. Survival was linked to increasing SMN2 copy number: mean age at death for individuals with two SMN2 copies was 8 months (standard deviation [SD]: 4 months) and 10 years (SD: 5 months) for individuals with three copies, and no deaths were reported in individuals with ≥4 SMN2 copies. Increasing SMN2 copy number was linked to a longer time to permanent ventilation, respiratory support, feeding support, and scoliosis, as well as loss of motor milestones. SMA disease-related endpoints showed distinct patterns between groups with differing SMN2 copy numbers. Prediction and assessment of disease progression may be stratified by SMN2 copy number, which will be important for evaluating the impact of treatment."

Nusinersen and Risdiplam, recognized as disease-modifying therapies, were included in the National Reimbursement Drug List in 2022 and 2023, respectively, in China. Policies have been implemented to enhance a multi-level medical security system, particularly for rare diseases. This study explores the self-perceived burden and offers policy suggestions to improve China's social security for rare diseases. <b>Methods:</b> In our mixed study, we conducted 37 semi-structured online interviews and a quantitative survey with 3 adult SMA patients and 34 family members (primary caregivers) in collaboration with the Meier Advocacy and Support Center. The interviews explored self-perceived burdens in psychology, domestic relations, medical care, rehabilitation, and economy, analyzing mainly through thematic analysis and multiple linear regression. <b>Results:</b> Respondents reported significant psychological burdens mainly stemming from limited treatment access. The instability within these families was linked to inconsistent therapeutic schedules, the lack of development opportunities, and misunderstandings. Choices between institutional and home rehabilitation were influenced by economic conditions and symptom severity. After the inclusion of medications, six patients (16.2%) still had not received pharmacological treatment, and many of those who underwent treatment were dissatisfied with the outcomes. The high costs of rehabilitation, family labor loss, and an incomplete medical security system resulted in significant economic burdens. Respondents called for more effective medications and better patient support. <b>Conclusion:</b> Although the inclusion of medications in National Reimbursement Drug List has improved availability and affordability, families still experienced significant burdens across multiple domains. A broader focus on social security is needed to enhance the comprehensive development of patients with rare diseases."

In total, 42 patients (mean age, 10.86 ± 4.07 years; 23 men) were included. TBSS analysis revealed widespread white matter changes in SMA patients. The SMA patients showed changes in multiple small-world and network efficiency parameters. Compared to the HC group, SMA showed increased characteristic path length (L<sub>p</sub>), normalized clustering coefficient (γ), small-world characteristic (σ), and decreased global efficiency (E<sub>glob</sub>) (all p < 0.05). In the node properties, right supramarginal gyrus, right orbital part of superior frontal gyrus, right supplementary motor area, and left median cingulate and paracingulate gyri changed in SMA patients. A decreased axial diffusivity (AD) value was associated with lower Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded scores (r = 0.45, p = 0.02), which means that the symptoms of SMA patients are more severe. This study found white matter and DTI-based brain network abnormalities in SMA patients, suggesting SMN protein deficiency may affect white matter development."

    "abstract": "Most cases of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) can be diagnosed by copy number analysis of survival motor neuron (SMN) 1. However, a small number of cases of SMA can only be diagnosed by sequencing analysis. We present a case of SMA diagnosed 7 years after the onset of symptoms. She was a 12-year-old girl of Sri Lankan origin. At age 5, she began to fall easily. She had normal intellectual development, and electromyography suggested a neurogenic disorder. Copy number analysis of SMN1 exons 7 and 8 via polymerase chain reaction revealed at least one copy of SMN1. Exome sequence analysis for neuromuscular disorders panel could not detect the pathogenic mutation. She moved to Japan at the age of 12 years. Sequencing analysis later identified a novel mutation in SMN1 at the same locus as previously reported (c.284G>A: p.Gly95Glu). Multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification indicated she had two copies of SMN2. She was diagnosed with SMA type 3b and treated with nusinersen. In patients with SMA, 2-5 % have a point mutation or a small insertion/deletion in SMN1. Since copy number analysis cannot detect such mutations, sequencing analysis is required. Two copies of SMN2 often result in SMA type 1 or 2, but her mild symptoms of SMA type 3b may be due to a combination of a point mutation and a deletion in SMN1. Even if genetic testing has been performed at previous institutions, sequencing analysis should be considered if the patient's symptoms are consistent with SMA."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a degenerative neuromuscular condition resulting from a homozygous deletion of the survival motor neuron 1 (<i>SMN1</i>) gene in 95% of patients. A timely diagnosis via newborn screening (NBS) and initiating treatment before the onset of symptoms are critical for improving health outcomes in affected individuals. We carried out a screening test by quantitative PCR (qPCR) to amplify the exon seven of <i>SMN1</i> using dried blood spot (DBS) samples. From October 2021 to August 2024, a total of 31,560 samples were tested in the Valencian Community (Spain) and 4 of them were positive for SMA, indicating an incidence of 1/7890. Genetic confirmation was performed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and AmplideX PCR/CE <i>SMN1/2</i> Plus kit, in parallel obtaining concordant results in survival motor neuron 2 (<i>SMN2</i>) gene copy number. Within the first few weeks of their lives, two of the four patients detected by NBS showed signs of severe hypotonia, becoming ineligible for treatment. The other two patients were the first presymptomatic patients with two copies of <i>SMN2</i> to receive treatment with Risdiplam in Spain. In order to treat positive cases in their early stages, we conclude that the official deployment of SMA newborn screening is necessary."

    "abstract": "The advent of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies in neurodegenerative disorders is associated with enormous hope. Nusinersen treatment was a breakthrough intervention in the recessive disease spinal muscular atrophy, and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) seems to be the paradigm disease in dominant degenerative diseases. The results of treatment with the ASO tofersen in SOD1-ALS show that the drug has a convincing beneficial effect on ALS caused by SOD1 mutations, that preclinical studies in rodents predicted the therapeutic effect in the human disease, and that clinical efficacy is associated with a specific sequence of effects of the drug on mechanistic and degenerative biomarkers and, subsequently, functional outcomes such as weight stabilization and ALSFRS-R. Therefore, the enthusiasm seems to be justified; but this should be followed by an attempt to obtain further insights with the goal to improve this therapy. In particular, the following issues are only partially resolved: Which mechanisms are responsible for the clinical effect following the downregulation of SOD1 protein by ASOs? Is long-term downregulation of SOD1 function associated with side effects? Is there an autoimmune response caused by this and other ASO? Is prevention of SOD1-associated ALS possible?"

    "abstract": "Prior to the introduction of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), children with type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) typically did not survive beyond the age of 2 years; management was mainly palliative. Novel therapies have made this a treatable condition, resulting in increased life expectancy and more time spent upright. Survival and improved function mean spinal asymmetry is a new complication with limited data on its prevalence and severity and no current guidelines on management and treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the spinal presentation and management of type 1 SMA children on nusinersen across the SMA-REACH UK network. Spinal presentation and management of 80 children (age range 4 months-14 years, median 4 years 2 months) with type 1 SMA on nusinersen across the SMA-REACH UK network were reviewed through retrospective data analysis. There were 60 type 1 children who developed a spinal asymmetry, of which 40 had kyphosis and 50 used a supportive thoraco-lumbar-sacral orthosis (TLSO). TLSOs were predominantly a one-piece jacket with abdominal hole, advised to be worn when upright during the day. Reduced neck range of movement was found in 33, 1 of these had plagiocephaly and 5 had torticollis. Of those with reduced neck range of movement, 26 (79%) had spinal asymmetry. Spinal surgery was performed in 7. Our study confirms high prevalence of spinal asymmetry in this cohort, requiring long-term management planning. It provides information on presentation and treatment options, facilitating development of guidelines for these new complications observed in children surviving longer with DMTs."

Cross-sectional analytical observational study. In the first part, socioeconomic, demographic, clinical, and treatment information were collected from patients diagnosed with SMA, regardless of type, sex, or age. SMA type 1 does not sit; SMA type 2 sits; SMA type 3 walks; and SMA type 4 begins in adulthood. In the second part of the study, patients aged between 2 and 25 years and their caregivers responded to the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 questionnaire. Of the 235 families recruited, 167 were eligible to respond to the questionnaire, 115 caregivers and 49 patients were included. The results point to a different perception of quality of life between patients and caregivers. Patients with SMA type 2 perceive more impaired physical and emotional capacity compared to SMA type 3 and 1, respectively. As for caregivers, the perception of quality of life in relation to physical and social capacity and the total score are worse for patients with SMA type 1 compared to other types. Perceptions correlate with emotional capacity in SMA type 2 and the total aspect in SMA type 3. Patients with SMA type 2 had a worse perception of their quality of life than other patients. Perception differed between patients and their caregivers, with the former having a better perception than the latter."

    "abstract": "Motor dysfunction and muscle atrophy are typical symptoms of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). Exercise training is a conventional physical therapy after SCI, but exercise intervention alone may have limited efficacy in reducing secondary injury and promoting nerve regeneration and functional remodeling. Our previous research found that intramedullary pressure after SCI is one of the key factors affecting functional prognosis. It has been reported that GsMTx-4, a specific blocker of the mechanosensitive ion channels Piezo1, can protect the integrity of the neuromuscular junction and promote nerve regeneration, and thus has the potential as a therapeutic agent for SCI. In this study, we observed the combined and separate therapeutic effect of GsMTx-4 and exercise on the structure of the soleus muscle and motor function in rats with SCI. At 42 days post-injury, compared with SCI rats, the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan score (P = 0.0007) and Gait Symmetry (P = 0.0002) were significantly improved after combination therapy. On histology of rat soleus muscle, compared with SCI rats, the combined treatment significantly increased the wet weight ratio, muscle fiber cross-sectional area and acetylcholinesterase (all P<0.0001). On histology of rat spinal tissue, compared with SCI rats, the combined treatment significantly increased neuron counts and BDNF levels, and significantly reduced the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells (all P<0.0001). On physiology of rat soleus muscle, compared with SCI rats, the combined treatment increased the succinate dehydrogenase expression (P<0.0001), while the expression of α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (P<0.0001) and GDF8 protein (P = 0.0008) decreased. Results indicate the combination therapy effectively improves histopathology of spinal cord and soleus muscle in SCI rats, enhancing motor function. This study was conducted on animal models, it offers insights for SCI treatment, advancing understanding of lower limb muscle pathology post-SCI. Further research is needed for clinical validation in the future."

Information on its adverse drug reactions is mainly from clinical trials and real-world studies with extensive sample sizes are lacking. In this study, we analyzed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to assess the drug safety profile of Zolgensma. A total of 1951 adverse event reports associated with onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma), containing 778 import important medical event (IME) signals, were identified from the FAERS database, and multiple disproportionate analysis algorithms were used to determine the significance of these adverse events. This study identified 281 onasemnogene abeparvovec-related adverse events (AEs), including some significant adverse events not mentioned in the product labelling. Elevated liver enzymes, fever, vomiting, and thrombocytopenia were the most common adverse reactions. Most adverse events manifested within the initial month of onasemnogene abeparvovec use, especially the first 8 days, but some may still occur after 1 year of treatment. Sex-specific scrutiny revealed differing risk levels for adverse events among women and men. Thrombocytopenia and thrombotic microangiopathy are more common in patients weighing ≥8.5 kg, and changes in renal function need to be closely monitored if thrombotic microangiopathy occurs. The above findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the utilization of onasemnogene abeparvovec, improving its effectiveness, and minimizing potential side effects, thereby greatly facilitating its practical application in clinical settings."

To determine the feasibility of using routinely collected newborn dried blood spots (DBS) in a population-based cCMV screen to identify infants at risk for hearing loss and describe outcomes of infants screened. This diagnostic study of a population-based screening program in Ontario, Canada, took place from July 29, 2019, to July 31, 2023. All newborns with a DBS sample collected as part of routine care were screened using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for cCMV as a risk factor for hearing loss. Infants with positive DBS PCR results for cCMV were referred for confirmation of infection by urine PCR (the gold standard), as well as complete medical and audiologic assessments for sequelae of cCMV infection. Infants with possible or confirmed symptomatic cCMV were referred to pediatric infectious disease specialists for evaluation for potential treatment with valganciclovir. Detection of cCMV by polymerase chain reaction assay on a newborn DBS. Number of infants with positive screening results successfully retrieved and confirmed to have cCMV and the timeliness of retrieval and symptomatic evaluation. Of 565 987 infants born in the screening period, 551 034 (97.4%) received cCMV screening on the DBS (45.7% female, 54.3% male). Of these infants, 689 (0.13%) screened positive for cCMV; 601 (87.2%) had cCMV infection confirmed and a complete assessment of sequelae of their congenital infection. Ninety-six infants with completed assessments (16.0%) were deemed to have cCMV symptoms, and 63 of these (65.6%) began valganciclovir treatment. Sensorineural hearing loss was confirmed in 34 of 96 infants (35.4%). This program found acceptable and feasible implementation of a population-based screening program using routinely collected DBS samples, suggesting that it may serve as a template for jurisdictions considering universal cCMV screening. The program had a much lower than expected prevalence of cCMV-positive screens but still identified many children who would otherwise not have been diagnosed and who would benefit from ongoing audiologic surveillance."

Prospective observational study. Lumbar intrathecal access was unfeasible due to significant scoliosis and prior spinal surgeries with instrumentation. Patients were infused with Nusinersen through the Ommaya reservoir at Hospital Universitario La Paz (Spain) following the standard dosing protocol. The cohort was composed of 6 patients, 5 individuals with type 2 SMA (83.3 %), and 1 patient presenting with type 3 SMA. 4 of the patients were functionally sitters (66.7 %) and 2 had lost this ability prior to initiating treatment (non-sitters).

    "abstract": "While many genetic tools exist for zebrafish, this animal model still lacks robust gene-silencing and microRNA-delivery technologies enabling spatio-temporal control and traceability. We have recently demonstrated that engineered pri-miR backbones can trigger stable gene knockdown and/or express microRNA(s) of choice in this organism. However, this miRNA-expressing technology presents important limitations. First, to trigger potent knockdown(s), multiple synthetic-miRNAs must be expressed simultaneously, compromising the co-expression of fluorescent marker(s) and knockdown traceability. Second, when gene(s) knockdown triggers significant phenotypes, like homozygous mutants with severe early phenotypes, it is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain transgenic carriers. To solve these problems and provide a mature RNAi and microRNA-delivery technology, we have generated new RNAi reagents and an inducible delivery system based on the Cre/Lox technology. This system allows the creation of asymptomatic/silent carriers, easing the production of embryos with potent knockdowns that can be traced and spatiotemporally controlled. We further demonstrated the utility of this approach by establishing novel inducible and tissue-specific models of spinal muscular atrophy, opening new avenues for studying smn1-gene function and pathogenicity. All in all, these materials and techniques will be invaluable in studying microRNA biology and in modelling or tackling conditions in which gene dosage is key."

Nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide, has been shown to improve motor function in SMA patients. However, concerns regarding its renal safety remain as previous studies have linked similar treatments to renal toxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the nusinersen treatment on platelet counts and renal functions, specifically urine protein excretion, in SMA patients and to estimate safe urinary protein levels before administration of each intrathecal injection. This retrospective study examined data from 33 patients with SMA to assess the effects of nusinersen on motor functions and laboratory parameters including platelet count, serum creatinine, urine protein, and urine creatinine. Measurements were taken at baseline andprior to each maintenance dose, after the completion of four initial loading doses. The baseline values were compared between SMA Type 1 and Type 2 patients, while the changes in these values over time were analyzed within each group. No significant adverse effects on platelet counts or renal functions were observed. Urine creatinine and protein levels were significantly higher in SMA Type 2 patients compared to SMA Type 1 at baseline; these parameters remained stable in SMA Type 2 but increased significantly after the loading doses in SMA Type 1. Motor function improvements were observed in both groups, with the most significant gains in SMA Type 1 after the loading doses. Thus, improvement in motor functions was associated with increase in urine creatinine. Nusinersen treatment did not cause significant renal toxicity or affect platelet counts. Urine creatinine levels may serve as a potential biomarker for assessing treatment response in SMA Type 1."

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates like U-bodies are specialized cellular structures formed through multivalent interactions among intrinsically disordered regions. U-bodies sequester small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes (snRNPs) in the cytoplasm, and their formation in mammalian cells depends on stress conditions. Because of their location adjacent to P-bodies, U-bodies have been considered potential sites for snRNP storage or turnover. SMN, a chaperone for snRNP biogenesis, forms condensates through its Tudor domain. In fly models, defects in SMN trigger innate immune responses similar to those observed with excess cytoplasmic snRNA during viral infection in mammalian cells. Additionally, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), caused by SMN deficiency, is associated with inflammation. Therefore, SMN may help prevent innate immune aberrant activation due to defective snRNP biogenesis by forming U-bodies to sequester these molecules. Further studies on U-body functions may provide therapeutic insights for diseases related to RNA metabolism."

The clinical phenotype of five patients was compatible with spondylometaphyseal dysplasia Kozlowski type, three each with metatropic dysplasia and brachyolmia type 3, and one each with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia Maroteaux type and congenital distal spinal muscular atrophy. Short stature and bone pain when running, walking, and climbing stairs occurred in patients with spondylometaphyseal dysplasia Kozlowski type and metatropic dysplasia from the age of 5 years and worsened with increasing age. Kyphosis was more pronounced with increasing age in these two groups of patients, while severe scoliosis occurred in brachyolmia type 3. In the radiographs of patients with spondylometaphyseal dysplasia Kozlowski type and metatropic dysplasia, severe platyspondyly persisted into adulthood or puberty. The patients with spondylometaphyseal dysplasia Kozlowski type exhibited irregular proximal femora leading to destruction of the femoral head towards the end of puberty, whereas metatropic dysplasia showed marked irregularity and widening of the femoral neck. We also observed that metaphyseal dysplasia in long bones other than the proximal femur was so inconspicuous that it could be ignored in patients with spondylometaphyseal dysplasia Kozlowski type. Comparison of radiologic features that change with age in five different TRPV4-related skeletal dysplasias will be of great benefit in the management of this patient group."

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, the pathological age-related loss of muscle mass and strength, contributes to physical decline, frailty, and diminished healthspan. The impact of sarcopenia is expected to rise as the aging population grows, and treatments remain limited. Therefore, novel approaches for enhancing physical function and strength in older adults are desperately needed. Recent evidence suggests that deficits in motor neuron excitability contribute significantly to age-related weakness. Accordingly, we hypothesized that enhancing motor neuron excitability could be a novel strategy for mitigating age-related declines in physical function and strength. To test this hypothesis, we targeted the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor with an agonist, as this receptor is known to enhance intrinsic excitability and amplify persistent inward currents of motor neurons. We found that a single oral gavage dose of 1.5, 3, and 6 mg/kg lorcaserin, a selective 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> agonist, significantly increased indices of motor neuron excitability (e.g., cervical motor evoked potential (cMEP) amplitude by 53-64% and reduced attenuation in cMEP amplitude during repetitive stimulation), along with improvements in motor coordination (22-24% enhancement in rotarod performance) and functional strength (~ 17% increase in max weighted cart pull and 12% increase in grip strength) in aged mice. In contrast, antagonism of 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors resulted in the opposite effect, reducing cMEP amplitude by ~ 26%, increasing attenuation of cMEP amplitude during repetitive stimulation, and decreasing grip strength by ~ 10% in aged mice. Overall, our findings indicate that enhancing motor neuron excitability via 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> agonism holds promise as a neurotherapeutic approach to treat age-related motor decline and sarcopenia."

We present a summary of the pathogenic mechanism and causative genes associated with ALS and describe the mechanism and efficacy of NSPC treatment for ALS. We comprehensively searched for relevant English-language articles published between January 1, 2000 and October 1, 2023, across the following five medical databases: PubMed, EMBASE, OVID, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. We examined experimental indices of physical function in animals and patients who underwent stem cell transplantation. All statistical analyses were performed via Review Manager 5.4. The study comprised a total of 16 investigations, including 5 clinical studies and 11 animal studies and involving 66 patients and 203 animals. The meta-analysis revealed that the administration of NSPCs appeared to yield positive outcomes in clinical patients, as assessed by the ALS functional rating scale and forced vital capacity. Furthermore, improvements following cell injection were observed in the rotarod test results, the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan Locomotor Rating Scale score, weight, and survival time. Our meta-analysis, which was grounded in randomized controlled trials, revealed that the transplantation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs), has potential effects on ALS patients, enhancing the physical function of animals and mitigating degenerative effects in individuals. These underscored the promise of NSPC therapy as a viable treatment option. We report that the transplantation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) is promising for enhancing bodily function and slowing the progression of ALS in affected patients. In this review, we summarize the treatment of ALS with NSPCs, evaluating both its efficacy and safety. Through database searches, we identified 16 studies involving 66 patients and 203 animals and analyzed the experimental indices of physical function following stem cell transplantation. The meta-analysis results indicated a positive impact of NSPCs on the clinical conditions of patients and the behavior of animals. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials further supported the conclusion that NSPC transplantation has a beneficial effect on improving physical function and mitigating degeneration in ALS patients."

    "title": "Maximal mouth opening in infants and toddlers with spinal muscular atrophy: a prospective controlled study.",
    "abstract": "Bulbar function is frequently impaired in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Although extremely important for the patient's quality of life, it is difficult to address therapeutically. Due to bulbar dysfunction, maximum mouth opening (MMO) is suspected to be reduced in children with SMA. However, no published MMO values exist for SMA children younger than 24 months. This study presents a novel approach to measuring MMO in infants and toddlers with SMA and compares it with healthy controls. Children with SMA (0-24 months) who received disease-modifying therapy at a single neuropediatric center and similarly aged healthy children were prospectively recruited. MMO was measured using a cardboard scale and a custom-designed instrument. A total of 115 children were included (SMA = 24, healthy controls = 91). Inter-rater reliability between two examiners was excellent (ICC = 0.987, 95% CI 0.959 to 0.995), as was the reliability between the cardboard scale and the custom-designed instrument (ICC = 0.986, 95% CI 0.968 to 0.994). A mixed linear model showed a significant increase of MMO with age, and a significantly wider mouth opening in healthy controls (p < .001). For future research, MMO can provide valuable information about the involvement of cranial nerves, particularly in the context of disease-modifying therapies, even at a very early age."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disorder encompassing 5q and non-5q forms, causing muscle weakness and atrophy due to spinal cord cell degeneration. Understanding its genetic basis is crucial for genetic counseling and personalized treatment options. This study retrospectively analyzed families of patients suspected of SMA at our institution from February 2006 to March 2024. Various molecular techniques, including multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis, long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with nested PCR, Sanger sequencing, and whole-exome sequencing were employed to establish a thorough genetic variant profile in 680 Chinese pedigrees with clinically suspected SMA. Out of 680 families suspected of having SMA, 675 exhibited mutations in the SMN1 gene, while three families were linked to mutations in the IGHMBP2 gene. One family exhibited a genetic variation in the NEB gene, and another family exhibited a variation in the SCO2 gene. Among the families with mutations in the SMN1 gene, 645 families exhibited either E7‒E8 or E7 homozygous deletion. Some families displayed E7‒8 heterozygous deletions along with other mutations, such as E1 or E1‒6 heterozygote deletion and point mutations. Furthermore, one family demonstrated a compound-heterozygous double mutation, while another carried a type \"2 + 0\" mutation alongside a point mutation. This study comprehensively analyzed the genetics of suspected familial SMA cases in the Chinese population, providing insights into the molecular genetic mechanisms of SMA and the utility of various detection techniques. The findings revealed important implications for genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis, and targeted therapies in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "To understand patient, caregiver, and clinician perspectives on patient-reported outcome measures, critical functional domains, and disease-modifying therapies in adult spinal muscular atrophy. An exploratory qualitative single-site study. Ten adults with spinal muscular atrophy and two clinicians participated in semi-structured interviews. Semi-structured interviews were conducted virtually or in person with participants after they completed outcome measures at a routine clinic visit. Two researchers analysed transcripts concurrently using a thematic approach to determine themes. Ten themes were identified among partici-pants. Patient-reported outcome measure preference varied between functional groups and was under-responsive, although it captured meaningful data. Motor stability was most frequently expected with disease-modifying therapy, but participants also reported improved fatigue and respiratory status. After considering patient goals, functional status, and preferences, patient-reported outcome measures represent a valuable adjunct to standard clinical and research tools. Optimal selection of patient-reported outcome measures requires careful consideration of multiple patient factors. Collaborative development of modified patient-reported outcome measures may yield a responsive, meaningful, and acceptable tool that can be used across a broad functional spectrum."

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations and deletions within the SMN1 gene, with predominantly childhood onset. Although primarily a motor neuron disease, defects in non-neuronal tissues are described in both patients and mouse models. Here, we have undertaken a detailed study of the heart in the Smn2B/- mouse models of SMA, and reveal a thinning of the ventriclar walls as previously described in more severe mouse models of SMA. However most structural changes are resolved by accounting for the smaller body size of the SMA mouse, as was also confirmed in the SMN∆7 model. Echocardiography revealed increased systolic function, which was particularly pronounced in subsets of mice and an increase in global longitudinal strain, collectively indicative of increased cardiac stress in the Smn2B/- mouse model. We have used TMT proteomics to perform a longitudinal study of the proteome of the hearts of Smn2B/- mice and reveal a progressive dysregulation of LXR/RXR signalling which is a regulator of lipid metabolism. We further show consistent perturbations in lipid metabolism in the Smn2B/-, Smn-/-;SMN2;SmnΔ7and SmnΔ7/Δ7;SMN2 mouse models of SMA on the day of birth. This work indicates that although structural changes in the heart can be overstated by failing to account for body size, there are functional defects which could predispose the heart to subsequent failure. We identify a common molecular signature across mouse models pointing to a dysregulation in lipid metabolism, and suggest that manipulation of LXR/RXR signalling offers an opportunity to impact upon these pathways."

This study aims to present the initial findings of the registry. In this cross-sectional study, epidemiological and demographic data were obtained from the registry and compared between invasive ventilation (IV) and non-IV (NIV) groups. The study included 952 patients registered from 23 centers with a median (interquartile range) age of 6.0 (3.0-12.0) years. IV support was observed in 51.1% of patients (n = 486). There was no difference in sex between IV and NIV groups, but a significant difference in age, nutrition, mobility status, and education were observed between the subgroups. The largest patient group had neuromuscular disease, with spinal muscular atrophy being the most common primary diagnosis (15.7%). Most of the caregivers (78.7% in the NIV group and 93.8% in the IV group) received formal training before the initiation of HMV. Turkey's first registry for pediatric HMV patients is introduced. This system helps understand and solve mobility and education issues for these patients in our country. Collaboration with relevant ministries is crucial. In addition, although most of the caregivers have received training before discharge, efforts are still needed to ensure that this rate is 100%. The long-term results will be presented in the future."

    "abstract": "Safety and efficacy of IV onasemnogene abeparvovec has been demonstrated for patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) weighing <8.5 kg. SMART was the first clinical trial to evaluate onasemnogene abeparvovec for participants weighing 8.5-21 kg. SMART was an open-label, multicenter, phase 3b study conducted across 13 sites in 9 countries (NCT04851873). Symptomatic pediatric participants with SMA (any type; treatment-naïve or had discontinued prior treatment) were stratified into 3 weight cohorts (≥8.5-13, >13-17, and >17-21 kg), administered onasemnogene abeparvovec, and followed for 52 weeks. Corticosteroids were initiated 24 hours before infusion with dose increases in response to adverse events (AEs) and subsequent tapering at investigator discretion. The primary objective was safety. Secondary objective was efficacy (motor function/motor milestones). Twenty-four participants were enrolled; the majority had SMA type 2 (n = 11), 3 <i>SMN2</i> copies (n = 18), and prior treatment (n = 21). All participants completed the study; no deaths occurred. All participants had ≥1 treatment-related AE(s), 7 of 24 (29%) had serious treatment-related AEs, and 23 of 24 (96%) had ≥1 AE of special interest. Twenty of 24 participants (83%) had asymptomatic hepatotoxicity events, which were primarily transaminase elevations. No participant had bilirubin elevations >2× upper limit of normal, developed symptomatic hepatotoxicity, or met Hy law criteria. Transient asymptomatic thrombocytopenia events were reported in 17 of 24 participants (71%); all resolved spontaneously with no related bleeding events reported. Three of 24 participants (13%) had cardiac AEs (all unrelated to treatment). No thrombotic microangiopathy or dorsal root ganglionopathy-related AEs were reported. AE frequency and severity were similar across weight groups, although corticosteroid exposure was greater for the 2 heavier cohorts (median 135.0, 201.0, and 194.0 days, respectively) with 37% and 33% still on corticosteroids at the study end. By week 52, most participants maintained or improved motor function (Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded 16/18; Revised Upper Limb Module 15/17); 4 participants (all 3 <i>SMN2</i> copies) achieved new motor milestones. Onasemnogene abeparvovec safety profile was similar across weight groups in this heterogenous participant population. Frequency and duration of asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations and thrombocytopenia are notable findings. Most participants demonstrated maintenance or improvement of motor function, suggesting clinical benefit for patients with SMA weighing up to 21 kg. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier (NCT04851873, clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04851873) submitted April 19, 2021. First participant enrolled on September 8, 2021. This study provides Class IV evidence that intravenous onasemnogene abeparvovec is safe in pediatric patients with SMA who weigh 8.5-21 kg."

    "abstract": "In <i>Drosophila</i> motoneurons, spatiotemporal dendritic patterns are established in the ventral nerve cord. While many guidance cues have been identified, the mechanisms of temporal regulation remain unknown. Previously, we identified the actin modulator Cdc42 GTPase as a key factor in this process. In this report, we further identify the upstream factors that activate Cdc42. Using single-cell genetics, FRET-based imaging, and biochemical techniques, we demonstrate that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav is anchored to the plasma membrane via the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase, enabling Cdc42 activation. VAMP-associated protein 33 (Vap33), an Eph ligand supplied non-cell-autonomously, may induce Eph autophosphorylation, initiating downstream signaling. Traditionally known as an ER-resident protein, Vap33 is secreted extracellularly at the onset of Cdc42 activation, acting as a temporal cue. In humans, VAPB-the ortholog of Vap33-is similarly secreted in the spinal cord, and its dysregulation leads to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 8 (ALS8) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Our findings provide a framework linking VAPB signaling to motor circuitry formation in both health and disease."

In combining these etiology groups, we obligatorily lump together many disparate diagnoses, particularly true in the neuromuscular (NM) cohort. We sought to evaluate the influence of underlying neuromuscular diagnosis on the HrQOL at 5 years following surgery for EOS. A retrospective review of a multi-center EOS database was performed. Children treated with primary distraction-based, growth-friendly instrumentation (GFI) for EOS with complete baseline, 2-year, and 5-year post-surgical EOSQs were included. Neuromuscular scoliosis patients, as classified by the C-EOS system, were isolated and subdivided by underlying diagnosis into 5 groups. EOSQ domains and composite HrQOL score at presentation, 2-year, and 5-year follow-up were compared across underlying diagnosis. A total of 65 neuromuscular EOS patients were identified (mean 7.6 ± 1.99 years of age, 50% female). Cerebral palsy was the most common underlying diagnosis (30%, N = 18), followed by spinal muscular atrophy (SMA, N = 16). There were differences in EOSQ domains with CP, SMA, and MD having significantly lower scores than Chiari/Syrinx patients at 2-year follow-up. Chiari/Syrinx patients demonstrated EOSQ scores statistically similar to idiopathic EOS patients at all time points (P > 0.05). CP patients were most likely to experience improvement in HrQOL at 5-year follow-up. Underlying NM diagnosis has direct implications on treatment response following GFI for EOS. Cerebral palsy patients demonstrate the best improvement in HrQOL at 5 years following surgery while others actually deteriorate over time. Children with EOS related to Chiari and Syringomyelia had similar HrQOL scores to idiopathic EOS and may not be best suited for inclusion in NM cohorts when assessing HrQOL scores following treatment. Increasing population-based HrQOL data may allow further refinement and prognostication of neuromuscular diagnoses over time."

Recent breakthroughs in treatments targeting SMA have improved both lifespan and quality of life for infants and children with the disease. Given the impact of these treatments, it is essential to develop methods for managing treatment-induced changes in disease characteristics. Zolgensma® is the first effective and approved gene therapy for SMA caused by biallelic mutation in the SMN1 gene. In three children with SMA treated with Zolgensma®, neuronal, glial, inflammation, and vascular markers in the plasma exhibited a quicker response, emphasizing their potential as valuable biomarkers of treatment efficacy in clinical trials. We chose the novel Nucleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay, to investigate a predefined panel of neuroinflammatory markers in plasma samples collected from SMA patients at baseline and six months after Zolgensma® treatment. We identified a set of novel targets whose levels differed between pre and post Zolgensma® treatment group and that were responsive to treatment. Even though our results warrant validation in larger SMA cohorts and longer follow-up time, they may pave the way for a panel of responsive proteins solidifying biomarker endpoints in SMA clinical trials."

The aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nusinersen treatment in children with SMA and to investigate prognostic factors. Motor function, compound muscle action potential (CMAP), and other indicators were prospectively collected before and 14 months after nusinersen treatment. A total of 55 children were included in our study to assess safety. 41 patients (with at least 6 months of nusinersen treatment) were included in the final efficacy analyses, with a median age at first treatment of 4.2 years. After 14 months of treatment with nusinersen, motor function improved, with increases in CHOP INTEND (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders), HINE-2 (Hammersmith Infant Neurological Exam-Part 2), HFMSE (Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded) and RULM (Revised Upper Limb Module) of 5.5 (95 % CI -2.4-13.4), 0.8 (95 % CI -0.2-1.9), 5.0 (95 % CI 2.5-7.4) and 2.4 (95 % CI 0.7-4.1) points, respectively. The CMAP amplitudes of the bilateral tibial, median and ulnar nerves increased, with greatest improvements of 0.87 ± 1.41 mV, 1.08 ± 1.71 mV and 0.59 ± 1.01 mV, respectively. Spearman correlation analysis showed that age at first treatment, disease duration, joint contractures and scoliosis were associated with treatment efficacy (r = -0.4-0.7, P < 0.05). Subgroup analyses showed that the mean HFMSE and RULM scores improved in the Physical therapy group (P < 0.05).

However, few reports exist on this indicator. This study calculated the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for assessing motor function in the upper and lower limbs of individuals with SMA to estimate the degree of change within a functional score that is considered clinically meaningful. This cohort study relied on individual participant measurements. A distribution-based approach was used to calculate the MCID values, incorporating data from 26 patients with SMA for the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), and grip and pinch strength. The standard errors of measurement for all patients were: 58.38 m for 6MWT; 4.71 points for HFMSE; 3.25 points for RULM; 10.93 N and 9.86 N for right and left grip strength, respectively; 5.42 N and 4.73 N for right and left Palmar pinch; and 11.96 N and 8.66 N for right and left Key pinch. Significant correlations were observed between the physical function assessments. We calculated MCID values for physical function evaluations of SMA and, as a sub-analysis, determined the SMA type and ambulatory status. These findings are expected to contribute to future SMA treatment and rehabilitation and promote the selection of appropriate physical function assessments."

    "abstract": "The traditional posterior median approach laminectomy is widely used for lumbar decompression. However, the bilateral dissection of paraspinal muscles during this procedure often leads to postoperative muscle atrophy, chronic low back pain, and other complications. The posterior midline spinous process-splitting approach (SPSA) offers a significant advantage over the traditional approach by minimizing damage to the paraspinal muscles. SPSA reduces the incidence of muscle atrophy and chronic low back pain while maintaining the integrity of the posterior spinal structures. The technique involves longitudinal splitting of the spinous process, which allows for adequate access to the lamina for decompression without detaching the paraspinal muscles. As a result, it provides a clearer surgical field and facilitates muscle preservation, which reduces the risk of postoperative complications. Additionally, SPSA requires only standard surgical instruments, making it accessible in most surgical settings. This paper reviews the anatomical considerations, surgical techniques, and clinical applications of the SPSA, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing muscle atrophy and improving recovery outcomes. The paper also discusses its potential in treating conditions such as lumbar spinal stenosis, disc herniation, and spondylolisthesis. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for future research to establish the long-term benefits of SPSA and refine surgical techniques. The results suggest that SPSA is a promising alternative to traditional approaches, with better outcomes in terms of muscle preservation and overall recovery."

This study aims to assess SC GM atrophy in patients with 5q-SMA and its associations with clinical disability. Twenty-one patients with 5q-SMA and twenty-one age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) prospectively underwent 3 T axial 2D-rAMIRA MR-imaging at the intervertebral disc levels C2/C3-C5/C6 and T<sub>max</sub> (lumbar enlargement level). Associations between SC GM areas with muscle strength tested by dynamometry, Motor Function Measure (MFM), revised upper limb module (RULM), Revised Hammersmith Scale (RHS), and SMA-Functional Rating Scale (SMA-FRS) were assessed by Spearman Rank correlations and linear regression analysis. Compared to HCs, patients had significantly reduced SC GM areas at levels C3/C4 (relative reduction (RR) = 13.6%, p < 0.0001); C4/C5 (RR = 16.7%, p < 0.0001), C5/C6 (RR = 17.1%, p < 0.0001), and T<sub>max</sub> (RR = 17.4%, p < 0.0001). Significant correlations were found between cervical SC GM areas and muscle strength, RULM, MFM, RHS, and SMA-FRS. In linear regression analysis, GM area C3/C4 explained 33% of RHS variance. SC GM atrophy is detectable in patients with 5q-SMA and is consistently associated with clinical measures of upper limb function, physiotherapeutic assessments, and SMA-FRS indicating the clinical relevance of the observed atrophy. Further longitudinal investigations are necessary next steps to evaluate this novel and easily applicable imaging marker as a potential disease course and therapeutic response marker."

We aimed to determine whether there is an association of CMDs, namely, any cardiovascular disease, cardiac arrhythmia, heart failure, thromboembolic disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypercholesterolemia with the risk and progression of MNDs. We included 1463 MND patients (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), progressive spinal muscular atrophy (PSMA), and unspecified MND) diagnosed from January 1, 2015, to July 1, 2023, in Sweden according to the Swedish Motor Neuron Disease Quality Registry (i.e., cases), up to 5 MND-free population controls per case (N = 7311) who were individually matched to the cases on age and sex, and the full siblings (N = 2002) and spouses (N = 1220) of MND patients (i.e., relative controls). Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the risk of MND diagnosis in relation to previous CMDs, through comparing MND patients to population controls or relative controls. MND patients were followed from diagnosis to assess the role of pre-diagnostic CMDs on disease progression. A joint longitudinal-survival model was used to estimate risk of mortality (or use of invasive ventilation) in relation to CMDs after taking into account the longitudinal changes of ALS functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) in the time-to-event analysis. Hierarchical clustering with the Ward's linkage and a dissimilarity matrix created by Gower's method was used to identify clusters of MND patients with distinct phenotypes. Among the CMDs studied, a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.62, 0.93) or hypercholesterolemia (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.71, 0.94) more than one year before diagnosis was associated with a lower risk for MNDs. The associations persisted for more than five years before MND diagnosis. MND patients with a history of any cardiovascular disease (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.13, 1.81), arrhythmia (HR 1.42; 95% CI 1.04, 1.93), heart failure (HR 1.79; 95% CI 1.02, 3.14), hypertension (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.12, 1.77), or hypercholesterolemia (HR 1.28; 95% CI 1.01, 1.62) had an increased mortality risk, compared to others, after taking into consideration the longitudinal changes in ALSFRS-R. Cluster analysis identified two clusters of MND patients, where one cluster demonstrated higher age, worse functional status, and higher prevalence of CMDs at the time of diagnosis as well as a higher mortality and faster functional decline during follow-up, compared to the ones included in the other cluster. Diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypercholesterolemia were associated with a lower future risk of MND. On the other hand, most of the CMDs were indicative of a poor disease progression after an MND diagnosis.

    "abstract": "Due to improved treatment options, more SMA patients reach childbearing age. Currently, limited data on pregnant SMA patients is available, especially in relation to disease-modifying therapies (DMT). This case report helps to elucidate new approaches for future guidelines in the management of pregnancy and SMA. A 33-year-old wheelchair-bound patient with SMA type 3 (sitter) became pregnant following 36 months of Nusinersen treatment. The last dose was administered in the third gestational week. After pregnancy was confirmed, therapy was stopped immediately. A healthy child was born in the 34th gestational week by caesarean section. After a short nursing period, Nusinersen was restarted 6 weeks after the expected gestational date. At this time, the patient reported deteriorated motor functions, which stabilized at a lower level compared to pre-pregnancy in the 2-year follow-up, despite restarting Nusinersen treatment. So far, only few cases of successful pregnancies of SMA patients on DMT have been reported. In natural history, the majority of patients experienced an increased deterioration of motor function while fetal outcome was not impaired. Our case shows that although Nusinersen treatment was applied in the third gestational week prior to proof of pregnancy, outcome was positive for mother and child. Future studies will have to determine whether ongoing treatment with Nusinersen during pregnancy should be recommended."

    "abstract": "Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is an uncommon sequela of low intracranial pressure, which may result from a lumbar puncture (LP). We describe a case of a patient in their 40s presenting with 48 hours of persistent headache following intrathecal administration of nusinersen for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 3. There were no focal neurological signs or symptoms apart from baseline symmetrical proximal limb weakness attributed to SMA. Initial investigations revealed radiological evidence of an acute cerebral venous sinus thrombus (CVST). The patient was promptly started on anticoagulation. Partial recanalisation was seen as soon as 48 hours after commencement of anticoagulation, with almost full resolution of the thrombus at follow-up in 2 months. Awareness of CVST as a potential complication of intrathecal therapies and diagnostic LP allows for early identification, management and prevention of serious neurological consequences."

    "abstract": "Development and maintenance of posture is essential behavior for overground mammalian locomotion. Dopamine and noradrenaline strongly influence locomotion, and their dysregulation initiates the development of motor impairments linked to neurodegenerative disease. However, the precise cellular and circuit mechanisms are not well defined. Here, we investigated the role of catecholaminergic neuromodulation in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is characterized by severe motor dysfunction and postural deficits. We identify progressive loss of catecholaminergic synapses from spinal neurons that occur via non-cell autonomous mechanisms. Importantly, the selective restoration of survival motor neuron (SMN) in either catecholaminergic or serotonergic neurons is sufficient to correct impairments in locomotion. However, only combined SMN restoration in both catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons or pharmacological treatment with l-dopa improve the severe postural deficits. These findings uncover the synaptic and cellular mechanisms responsible for the postural and motor symptoms in SMA and identify catecholaminergic neuromodulation as a potential therapeutic target."

    "abstract": "Nusinersen and risdiplam are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). No head-to-head clinical trials to assess efficacy exist. Observational studies are needed to determine if transitioning to risdiplam is safe and efficacious. This retrospective study at Nationwide Children's Hospital included individuals with SMA treated with nusinersen who switched to risdiplam. Motor, pulmonary and bulbar function were assessed before and 2 years after nusinersen and risdiplam initiation. Forty-four individuals were included: 11 with SMA type 1, 25 with SMA type 2 and 8 with SMA type 3. Motor function improved after initiation of nusinersen treatment with the most significant improvements seen in the first year. After transition to risdiplam, motor function remained largely stable. Need for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) overnight occurred in both groups. Cough peak flow significantly improved in the risdiplam group. Hospitalizations were the same in both groups. One individual in the nusinersen group gained the ability to take some food by mouth; two individuals in the risdiplam group achieved some oral feeding and two became exclusively orally fed. As expected, motor function was most improved in treatment naïve individuals in the first year after nusinersen initiation. Over half of our study population had posterior spinal fusion surgery (57%) which significantly impacted motor and respiratory outcomes, though slightly less so in the risdiplam group. Overall, our data demonstrates that transitioning from nusinersen to risdiplam is associated with a favorable safety profile and stable motor outcomes."

    "abstract": "5q-spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a treatable neuromuscular disorder associated with scoliosis in up to 90% of patients. New SMA therapies could mark a paradigm shift in scoliosis management, but their effects on scoliosis development remain unclear. This study aims to observe scoliosis progression in the current treatment landscape to inform management strategies. We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective analysis of 94 SMA patients treated at our center. Scoliosis development was evaluated in 75 patients using spine radiographs and electronic health records. Statistical analysis was performed using Python and GraphPad Prism. One-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation were used for group comparisons and correlation analysis, respectively. Scoliosis parameters in 5q-SMA patients who had received either nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec, risdiplam, or their combinations showed mean ages at scoliosis detection were 23.94, 55.52, and 168.11 months for SMA types 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Cobb angles at detection showed no significant intergroup differences. The mean ages at scoliosis surgery were 60, 88.43, and 124.8 months. Pelvic obliquity (PO) was highest in type 1 and lowest in type 3. A strong correlation (r = 0.9) was found between PO measurement techniques. HFMSE scores correlated moderately with scoliosis severity (r = -0.38), while CHOP-INTEND showed no correlation. The observations made in this study suggest that the effects of SMA therapies do not prevent scoliosis development. The improved prognosis may lead to a growing cohort of SMA type 1 and 2 patients with early onset scoliosis who require early growth-friendly surgical interventions."

Risdiplam, a daily oral therapy, was approved in the United States for the treatment of SMA. Risdiplam's effectiveness depends on patient adherence to the treatment regimen. This retrospective claims database analysis assessed real-world treatment adherence and persistence, and all-cause health care costs by adherence status, for patients with SMA receiving risdiplam. Outcomes were summarized by SMA types (1-4) and age groups (0-2, 3-5, 6-17, and ≥ 18 years). 86 patients with ≥ 1 SMA diagnosis, risdiplam treatment, and ≥ 6 months of continuous enrollment after the index date (SMA diagnosis) were identified in the IQVIA PharMetrics<sup>®</sup> Plus database (01/01/2020-06/30/2022). One patient had SMA type 1 (a 1-year-old boy), 18 had type 2 (mean ± SD age: 7.9 ± 5.7 years; 61% female), 47 had type 3 (17.3 ± 10.2 years; 55% female), and 20 had type 4 (38.2 ± 11.6 years; 55% female). The mean proportion of days covered (PDC) with risdiplam was 0.89 overall, ranging from 0.88 for SMA type 4 to 0.97 for type 1. The majority (83.7%) of patients were adherent to risdiplam (PDC ≥0.80), ranging from 75.0% for type 4 to 100% for type 1. Adherence ranged from 76.5% among 6-12-year-olds to 100% among 0-2-year-olds. Compared with adherent patients, nonadherent patients had higher median total health care costs by $335,049 for type 2, $41,204 for type 3, and $12,223 for type 4. Among adherent patients, patients with PDC between 0.90 and 1.00 had lower costs compared with patients with PDC between 0.80 and 0.90. Nonadherence to risdiplam was observed in the first year of treatment, especially for patients with SMA type 4 and patients aged 6-12 years. Nonadherence was associated with higher all-cause health care costs, with the most pronounced cost difference for SMA type 2. For adherent patients, those who were highly adherent incurred lower health care costs. These findings underscore the importance of treatment adherence and persistence for patients with SMA receiving risdiplam, particularly for younger children and those with greater disease severity."

    "abstract": "Nusinersen, the first treatment approved for all spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) types, is administered intrathecally through lumbar puncture. We used ultrasound assistance or a landmark-based technique to access the lumbar intrathecal space in adult SMA patients. This study aimed to evaluate the technical success and adverse events (AEs) in such patients using either technique over a long observation period. Fifty-one adult patients received 507 consecutive interlaminar nusinersen administrations. Patients presented with both 'uncomplicated spines' or 'complicated spines'; two patients had previous back surgery. Technical success and AEs were recorded using either technique. A generalised linear mixed model was applied to evaluate predictors of technical success and complications. An overall success rate of 99.6%, with only two procedures failing to reach the intrathecal space, and an overall optimal procedure rate of 90.3% have been reported. A total of 455 procedures (89.7%) were uneventfully performed. One (0.2%) case of severe AE (puncture of a bulky abdominal annexal cyst) was recorded. Twenty-seven episodes (5.3%) of post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) and 24 episodes (4.7%) of radicular or back pain, both successfully treated with medical therapy, have also been reported. Technical success was significantly associated with 'complicated spines' (P = 0.022) and the use of ultrasound assistance (P = 0.01), and the use of ultrasound was the only independent predictor of uncomplicated procedures (P = 0.007). In adult patients with SMA both landmark-based and ultrasound-assisted techniques are safe and effective even in the long term. The use of assistance is associated with technical success and can predict uncomplicated procedures. Our results support the use of ultrasonography in order to improve the success and reduce the burden of nusinersen intrathecal administration."

    "abstract": "The expansion of glutamine residue track (polyQ) within soluble proteins (Q proteins) is responsible for nine autosomal-dominant genetic neurodegenerative disorders. These disorders develop when polyQ expansion exceeds a specific pathogenic threshold (Q<sub>th</sub>) which is unique for each disease. However, the pathogenic mechanisms associated with the variability of Q<sub>th</sub> within the family of Q proteins are poorly understood. In the previous publication we proposed that polarity of the regions flanking polyQ track in each protein plays a key role in defining Q<sub>th</sub> value (Kim, M. Mol Neurodegener 9 (2014) 45) and that these effects can be explained as a result of interactions between polyQ-expanded protein and proteasome (Kim, M Bezprozvanny, I (2021). Biochem Biophys Res Commun 536:95-99). In the present manuscript we extended our analysis and analyzed effects of location of polyQ-expanded track within the protein sequence. To accomplish this, we divided a family of polyQ-expanded proteins into 3 classes - G1, G2 and G3 groups, which differ by position of polyQ-expanded track in the protein sequence. We determined that polarity of flanking regions have different effect on Q<sub>th.</sub> value for each of these classes, and explained these differences by mechanistic analysis of proteasomal function. Our results further support the hypothesis that differences in Q<sub>th.</sub> values of pathogenic threshold can be explained by different mode of interactions between polyQ-flanking regions and proteasome and these findings provide novel insight into pathogenic mechanisms of polyQ-expanded disorders."

However, the limitations of these therapies have now become evident, highlighting the need for the development of complementary targets beyond SMN replacement. To address these challenges, here we explored, in in vitro and in vivo disease models, Stathmin-2 (STMN2), a neuronal microtubule regulator implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), as a novel SMN-independent target for SMA therapy. Our findings revealed that STMN2 overexpression effectively restored axonal growth and outgrowth defects in induced pluripotent stem cell-(iPSC)-derived motor neurons (MNs) from SMA patients. Intracerebroventricular administration of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) carrying Stmn2 cDNA significantly ameliorated survival rates, motor functions, muscular and neuromuscular junction pathological features in SMA mice, mirrored by in vitro outcomes. Overall, this pioneering study not only provides insight into the therapeutic potential of STMN2 in SMA, but also suggests its broader applications for MN diseases, marking a substantial step forward in addressing the multifaceted challenges of neurological diseases treatment."

The increasing availability of disease-modifying therapies has prompted the development of biomarkers to facilitate clinical assessments. We explored the association between disease severity and serum creatinine (Crn) levels in SMA patients undergoing up to two years of treatment with nusinersen. We measured serum Crn levels and assessed function performance using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE), Medical Research Council Scale (MRC), 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), ulnar Compound Muscle Action Potential (CMAP), and forced vital capacity (FVC) in a cohort comprising 28 adolescent and adult patients with SMA. The association between Crn and disease severity was investigated through partial rank correlation analysis and linear mixed models while accounting for age, gender, and BMI. Linear models were employed to predict functional performance. 28 SMA patients and 28 gender- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were included, resulting in a dataset of 185 visits. Compared to HCs, SMA patients exhibited significantly lower Crn values ​​(67.4 ± 14 vs. 23.7 ± 14.8 umol/L, p<0.0001). After adjusting for age, sex, and BMI, Crn showed positive correlations with the HFMSE (p<0.0001, r = 0.884), MRC (p<0.0001, r = 0.827), FVC (p = 0.002, r = 0.730), and ulnar CMAP (p<0.0001, r = 0.807). Patients with SMN2 copy number ≥ 4 had nearly twice as high Crn levels as those with SMN2 copy number < 4 (34.1 ± 3.75 vs. 17.2 ± 2.52 umol/L, p = 0.00145). Ambulant SMA patients had more than double the Crn levels compared to non-ambulant ones (32 ± 2.33 vs. 12.9 ± 2.38 umol/L, p<0.0001). Furthermore, Crn explained that up to 83.5% of the variance in functional performance measured by HFMSE, MRC, and 6MWT was significantly higher than that of traditional biomarkers. These findings suggest that Crn may be a potential biomarker for assessing disease severity in adolescents and adults with SMA, demonstrating its promise in clinical applications."

In this study, we performed cross-sectional surveys using large-scale patient and caregiver data to identify the prevalence and average impact of symptoms and symptomatic themes experienced by adults with AD, MCI, and dementia. Subsequent analyses were used to determine which demographic and disease-specific factors are associated with more severe disease. Fifteen adults with AD (6), MCI (8), and dementia (1) and 15 caregivers of adults with AD (7), MCI (6), and dementia (2) participated in qualitative interviews providing 1,166 and 1,097 unique quotes pertaining to symptom burden. Using open-ended questions from a comprehensive interview guide, participants were asked to identify the symptoms of AD that have the greatest effect on their lives or the lives of the individual for whom they provide care. A cross-sectional survey was then implemented inquiring about the potential symptoms of importance identified during preliminary qualitative interviews. Four-hundred thirty-three individuals (patients and caregivers) participated in the cross-sectional survey, providing more than 35,000 symptom rating responses. Subsequent analyses were conducted to determine how demographic and disease-specific characteristics correlate with symptomatic theme prevalence. The most frequent symptomatic themes reported by individuals with AD, MCI, and dementia in the cross-sectional survey were memory problems (99.0%), problems thinking (90.3%), and communication difficulties (80.4%). Patients identified decreased satisfaction in social situations (1.45), fatigue (1.45), and memory problems (1.41) as the most impactful symptomatic themes (range 0-4). Patient-reported symptomatic theme prevalence was strongly associated with the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for neurologic disability. Individuals with AD, MCI, and dementia experience a variety of symptoms that significantly affect their daily lives. These symptoms, many underrecognized, are of variable importance to individuals with these diseases and may inform potential targets for future therapeutic intervention as well as facilitate the development and validation of disease-specific outcome measures."

This study aimed to evaluate the changes in HRQoL and independence in children with later-onset SMA receiving longitudinal treatment with nusinersen. Forty-nine pediatric patients with later-onset SMA (symptom onset after 6 months of age) and their caregivers were enrolled. The HRQoL of patients evaluated by the proxy-reported Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 3.0 Neuromuscular Module (PedsQL NMM) and the independence level determined by the SMA Independence Scale-Upper Limb Module (SMAIS-ULM) were assessed. Caregiver HRQoL was assessed using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Family Impact Module (PedsQL FIM). Motor function was recorded using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) and the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), with subsequent analysis of the correlation between motor function, HRQoL, and independence scores. A significant difference was observed across all domains of the proxy-reported PedsQL NMM and in the independence assessment over the 18-month follow-up period (p < 0.001). A positive correlation was identified between RULM and total PedsQL NMM scores (Pearson-r = 0.539, p < 0.001), as well as SMAIS-ULM scores (Spearman-rho = 0.507, p < 0.001). Scores in all modules of the PedsQL FIM improved over time (p < 0.001).

Type 1 HH, the most common form, is primarily caused by a common variant in Western Europe (p.Cys282Tyr, C282Y, or c.845 G>A). It is generally preventable during in vitro fertilization if proper genetic testing is performed before implantation. Here, we demonstrated a direct detection and cost-effective approach using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) settings. We began by validating the assay with genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from Coriell cell lines of known HFE C282Y genotypes, followed by testing patients' genomic DNA samples. After establishing the assay on genomic DNA, we extended the assay to whole-genome amplified DNA from embryo biopsies. The subjects include cell line samples and human specimens and human embryo biopsies. Patients and embryos either carried or did not carry the HFE C282Y variant in their genome. No intervention was applied. The readout included the genotype of samples at the HFE C282Y locus and accuracy of PCR-RFLP results. An accuracy of >99% was achieved across 80 cell line samples, 38 patient samples, and 81 embryo biopsies. In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of using the PCR-RFLP approach to PGT. Specifically, we validated the assay for the HFE C282Y variant, the primary cause of type 1 hemochromatosis. The assay was tested on genomic DNA and DNA resulting from whole-genome amplification, achieving >99% accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and specificity. These results also suggest the possibility for extending the PCR-RFLP approach to cover a broader range of conditions, such as spinal muscular atrophy, to benefit more patients currently ineligible for testing at PGT laboratories."

    "abstract": "Neuromuscular disorders can cause respiratory impairment by affecting the muscle fibers, neuromuscular junction, or innervation of respiratory muscles, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Over the past few years, new disease-modifying therapies have been developed and made available for treating different neuromuscular disorders. Some of these therapies have remarkable effectiveness, resulting in the prevention and reduction of respiratory complications. For myasthenia gravis (MG), efgartigimod, ravulizumab, rozanolixizumab, and zilucoplan have been Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive generalized MG in the past 2 years. Rozanolixiumab is also approved for treating MG caused by muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies. The new MG therapeutics target the complement system or block the neonatal fragment crystallizable (Fc) receptors (FcRn), leading to significant clinical improvement. For spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), nusinersen (intrathecal route) and risdiplam (oral route) modify the splicing of the <i>SMN2</i> gene, increasing the production of normal survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Onasemnogene abeparvovec is a gene replacement therapy that encodes a functional SMN protein. All SMA medications, particularly onasemnogene abeparvovec, have led to clinically meaningful improvement. For late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), avalglucosidase alfa has shown a greater improvement in respiratory function, ambulation, and functional outcomes in comparison to alglucosidase alfa, and cipaglucosidase alfa combined with miglustat has shown improvement in respiratory and motor function in a cohort of enzyme replacement therapy-experienced LOPD patients. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a challenge. The two most recent FDA-approved medications, namely sodium phenylbutyrate and tofersen, may slow down the disease by a few months in a selected population but do not stop the progression of the disease."

Fertility disorders were identified in 27 of the 41 patients (65·9%, 95%CI 51·3-80·4%) in particular SMA2 patients: 19 cases (90<sup>.</sup>5%, CI 77·9-100%) (SMA3: 8 cases (40%, CI 18·5-61·5%). Among the patients with available spermograms, 81% (27/33) had abnormal sperm concentration; 30% presented azoospermia. These abnormalities were significantly associated with SMA type (more prevalent in SMA2 patients, p < 0·001), disease motor severity, which included age at the loss of walking ability and wheelchair use duration (p < 0·001). The Motor Function Measure (MFM) determined that the sperm counts were also correlated with disease severity (p < 0·01). The fertility disorders were correlated with SMA severity and were particularly evident in SMA2 patients. In the latter, sperm concentration positively correlated with MFM. This study is the first one to link fertility disorders with spermogram abnormalities in SMA males. Understanding spermatogenesis in SMA is crucial, especially with new therapies such as risdiplam. Consequently, conducting systematic spermogram studies prior to SMA treatment is recommended."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy linked to chromosome 5q (SMA-5q) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the <i>SMN1</i> gene. To describe the key demographic, clinical and genetic characteristics, as well as natural history data of patients with SMA-5q. Up to January 2022, 706 patients with confirmed genetic diagnosis of SMA-5q, or their parents, completed a self-reported questionnaire on natural history, genetic characteristics, drug treatments, and multidisciplinary care. Most patients had type 1 SMA-5q (42%); with 33% having type 2, and 23% type 3. There were 667 patients (94.4%) with a homozygous <i>SMN1</i>-exon 7 deletion. Of the total, 131 (18.6%) patients had a previous family history of the disease, and the familial recurrence rate was higher in type 3 (25.6%). Type 1 patients had a mean age of 3 months at the onset of symptoms and a delay of more than 3 months until genetic diagnosis. The median survival of patients with type 1 without invasive ventilation was 27 months. Before 2018, the median age of use of invasive ventilation was 16 months and, after, most patients (71%) were not submitted to invasive ventilation. About 50% of patients with type 3 lost their walking ability by 37 years of age. Further, 384 (54.4%) patients had access to disease-modifying therapy, and 62.3% of type 1 patients were in treatment, compared with only 47.2% of type 2 and 31.9% of type 3 patients. There is still a substantial diagnostic delay, especially in those patients with types 2 and 3 SMA-5q. However, the present study demonstrated prolonged survival, especially in type 1 patients."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2S (CMT2S) typically present before age 10. Genetic factors account for up to 50 % of neuropathies, which often display varied symptoms. Mutations in the IGHMBP2 gene are associated with both CMT2S and SMARD1, resulting in a rare clinical condition marked by axonal neuropathy, spinal muscular atrophy, respiratory distress, and muscle weakness. Detailed family histories and medical data were collected. Segregation analysis was performed using Sanger sequencing and whole exome sequencing. Additionally, a review of molecularly confirmed patients was conducted. Protein tertiary structures expressed in the IGHMBP2 gene were tested for topological and conformational changes using modeling programs and in-silico tools. We identified a novel homozygous nonsense mutation (c.2568_2569del p.Gly857Alafs*27) in a family with a member showing neuropathy. This report details the clinical and genetic findings of the affected individuals, including a Turkish patient with neuropathy, and compares them with literature cases. Understanding the clinical impact of the (c.2568_2569del p.Gly857Alafs*27) mutation will enhance our knowledge of IGHMBP2 gene defects role in neuropathy. This study aims to highlight this severe recessive disease caused by pathogenic IGHMBP2 gene mutations and to examine the mutation spectrum and phenotype differences."

    "abstract": "Intrapleural injections of cholera toxin B conjugated to saporin (CTB-SAP) result in selective respiratory (<i>e.g.</i>, phrenic) motor neuron death and mimics aspects of motor neuron disease [(<i>e.g.</i>, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)], such as breathing deficits. This rodent model allows us to study the impact motor neuron death has on the output of surviving phrenic motor neurons as well as the compensatory mechanisms that are recruited. Microglial density in the phrenic motor nucleus as well as cervical gene expression of markers associated with inflammation (<i>e.g</i>., tumor necrosis factor α; TNF-α) are increased following CTB-SAP-induced phrenic motor neuron death, and ketoprofen (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) delivery attenuated phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF) in 7 day (d) CTB-SAP rats but enhanced pLTF in 28d CTB-SAP rats. Here, we worked to determine the impact of TNF-α in the phrenic motor nucleus by: 1) quantifying TNFR1 (a high affinity transmembrane receptor for TNF-α) expression; 2) investigating astrocytes (glial cells known to release TNF-α) by performing a morphological analysis in the phrenic motor nucleus; and 3) determining whether acute TNFR1 inhibition differentially affects phrenic plasticity over the course of CTB-SAP-induced motor neuron loss by delivering an inhibitor for TNF-α receptor 1 (sTNFR1i) in 7d and 28d male CTB-SAP and control rats. Results revealed that TNFR1 expression was increased on phrenic motor neurons of 28d CTB-SAP rats (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and that astrocytes were increased and exhibited reactive morphology (consistent with an activated phenotype; <i>p</i> < 0.05) in the phrenic motor nucleus of CTB-SAP rats. Additionally, we found that pLTF was attenuated in 7d CTB-SAP rats but enhanced in 28d CTB-SAP rats (<i>p</i> < 0.05) following intrathecal sTNFR1i delivery. This work suggests that we could harness TNFR1 as a potential therapeutic agent in CTB-SAP rats and patients with respiratory motor neuron disease by increasing compensatory plasticity in surviving neurons to improve phrenic motor neuron function and breathing as well as quality of life. Future studies will focus on microglial and astrocytic cytokine release, the role they play in the differential mechanisms of pLTF utilized by 7d and 28d CTB-SAP rats, and potential therapies that target them."

    "title": "Investigating a Domain Adaptation Approach for Integrating Different Measurement Instruments in a Longitudinal Clinical Registry.",
    "abstract": "In a longitudinal clinical registry, different measurement instruments might have been used for assessing individuals at different time points. To combine them, we investigate deep learning techniques for obtaining a joint latent representation, to which the items of different measurement instruments are mapped. This corresponds to domain adaptation, an established concept in computer science for image data. Using the proposed approach as an example, we evaluate the potential of domain adaptation in a longitudinal cohort setting with a rather small number of time points, motivated by an application with different motor function measurement instruments in a registry of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients. There, we model trajectories in the latent representation by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where person-specific ODE parameters are inferred from baseline characteristics. The goodness of fit and complexity of the ODE solutions then allow to judge the measurement instrument mappings. We subsequently explore how alignment can be improved by incorporating corresponding penalty terms into model fitting. To systematically investigate the effect of differences between measurement instruments, we consider several scenarios based on modified SMA data, including scenarios where a mapping should be feasible in principle and scenarios where no perfect mapping is available. While misalignment increases in more complex scenarios, some structure is still recovered, even if the availability of measurement instruments depends on patient state. A reasonable mapping is feasible also in the more complex real SMA data set. These results indicate that domain adaptation might be more generally useful in statistical modeling for longitudinal registry data."

    "abstract": "Fatigue and gait speed are established determinants of fall risk in patients with neurological disorders. However, data on adults with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is limited. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate falls and risk factors in adults with SMA. A retrospective chart review of ambulatory adults with genetically confirmed 5q-SMA included: age, sex, age of symptom onset, SMN2 copy number, BMI, and 6MWT distance and speed at minutes 1, 2, and 6. Fourteen ambulatory patients were included in the analysis with an average follow-up of 36 months (range of 12-66 months). 10 patients were classified as fallers (F<sub>all</sub>) and four as non-fallers (NF<sub>all</sub>). One faller received Risdiplam, while the remaining fallers and non-fallers received Nusinersen for the duration of the follow-up period. In the F<sub>all</sub> cohort, the median speed at 1, 2, and 6 min were 0.92 m/s, 0.89 m/s, and 0.77 m/s, respectively, with a heterogeneous range including one faller at 1.25 m/s. In the NF<sub>all</sub> cohort, the slowest collected median recorded speeds were 1.18 m/s, 1.11 m/s, and 1.09 m/s respectively, with one non-faller at 0.56 m/s. There was no significant statistical difference between 6-min gait speeds and individuals experiencing falls. However, we found a three-fold greater decline in speed between the 6MWT first and last minute in the F<sub>all</sub> (13.01%) compared to the NF<sub>all</sub> (5.16%). 7 of 10 patients had multiple falls (70%) with two individuals consequently losing ambulation (20%). These findings underscore the need for larger studies on fatigability and the importance of considering factors beyond gait speed alone."

Studies in my lab since the 1980s have identified, sequenced and characterized the major pre-mRNA- and mRNA-RBPs (hnRNPs/mRNPs), revealing RNA-binding domains and common features of numerous RBPs and their central roles in posttranscriptional gene regulation. The first links between RBPs and RNPs to diseases emerged serendipitously for fragile X syndrome, as its gene (<i>FMR1</i>) encoded RBP (FMRP), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), caused by deficits in survival motor neurons (SMN). Discoveries of the SMN complex and its unanticipated function in RNP assembly, essential for spliceosomal snRNP biogenesis, advanced understanding of RNA biology and pathogenesis. I reflect on how these and other contributions (e.g., nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, telescripting) originated from curiosity-driven exploration and highly collaborative lab culture. The vast RNA and RBP assortments are beneficial, but increase complexity and chances of disorders, making the RNP sphere a rich source for future discoveries."

    "abstract": "The Royal Australian College of General Practice recommends that all women contemplating pregnancy or in early pregnancy should be offered reproductive genetic carrier screening (RGCS). In November 2023, a new Medicare item number was introduced for RGCS to detect cystic fibrosis (CF), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and fragile X syndrome (FXS) carrier status. The role of general practice in offering RGCS is recognised as being of crucial importance, but only a minority of general practitioners (GPs) are offering such screening. This study investigates the facilitators and barriers to offering RGCS in general practice. Fifteen Victorian GPs who had offered RGCS for CF, SMA and FXS participated in semi-structured telephone interviews. A behavioural change framework was used for this study. Barriers to offering screening (eg out-of-pocket costs, low frequency of preconception care and lack of GP education) mapped predominantly onto the 'opportunity' domain of the behaviour change framework. Reducing out-of-pocket costs and increasing the provision of preconception care and GP education will provide more people with the opportunity to make informed choices about participation in RGCS."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by low levels of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Even though SMN is ubiquitously expressed, the disease selectively affects motor neurons, leading to progressive muscle weakness. Even among motor neurons, certain motor units appear more clinically resistant to SMA. To quantitatively survey selective resistance, we studied extensive neuromuscular autopsies of Type I SMA patients and age-matched controls. We found highly divergent degrees of degeneration of neighboring motor units, even within individual cranial nerves or a single anatomical area such as the neck. Examination of a Type I SMA patient maintained on life support for 17 years found that most muscles were atrophied, but the diaphragm was strikingly preserved. Nevertheless, some resistant human muscles with preserved morphology displayed nearly complete conversion to slow Type I myofibers. Remarkably, a similar pattern of selective resistance was observed in the SMNΔ7 mouse model. Overall, differential motor unit vulnerability in human Type I SMA suggests the existence of potent, motor unit-specific disease modifiers. Mechanisms that confer selective resistance to SMA may represent therapeutic targets independent of the SMN protein, particularly in patients with neuromuscular weakness refractory to current treatments."

    "title": "[Natural history of spinal muscular atrophy type I].",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a group of genetically heterogeneous neuromuscular diseases characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons in the anterior horns of the spinal cord. The prevalence of SMA is approximately 1 in 10.000 live births. The cause of SMA is a mutation in the <i>SMN1</i> gene, which encodes a neuronal survival protein. The phenotype of the disease depends on the number of copies of the <i>SMN2</i> gene, which encodes an unstable isoform of the same protein. Despite the emergence of new drugs that increase SMN protein levels, there remains a need to collect and systematize data on the natural history of the disease to evaluate the effectiveness of new therapeutic approaches. This review analyzed the results of 12 retrospective and prospective studies over the past 16 years, which examined the natural history of the disease in 646 children with SMA type I. The mean age of onset of symptoms was 2.1±0.7 months, with the first documented symptoms being muscle hypotonia, respiratory distress, and feeding difficulties. The mean age at death was 19.2±10.1 months, the median age at achievement of the composite endpoint (defined as death or the date of initiation of long-term respiratory support) was 7.7 months (95% CI 3.8; 13.9). For 310 children, the number of copies of the <i>SMN2</i> gene was known, 81.5% of them had 2 copies, 3.7% had 1 copy, 14.5% had 3 copies, 0.3% had 4 copies. Age at death varied according to <i>SMN2</i> gene copy number, children with three copies of the <i>SMN2</i> gene lived on average significantly longer than children with two copies of SMN2 (22.7 months versus 6.6 months). Life expectancy was also positively influenced by the use of maintenance therapy, tracheostomy or gastrostomy."

This study utilized the FDA's adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database to examine, evaluate, and provide substantiation for the safety of Nusinersen to assist in clinical decision-making. Nusinersen-related adverse reaction signals were mined using the reporting odds ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), Multi-item Gamma-Poisson Shrinker (MGPS) models with Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM). The rate and frequency of reported adverse reactions were investigated. Nusinersen-induced adverse events were observed in 25 system organ categories (SOCs). A total of 230 disproportionate preferred terms (PTs) were eliminated using four algorithms. Cardiac arrest, autism spectrum disorder, and epilepsy emerged as potential new side effects not previously listed, warranting further attention for drug safety. Analysis of the age distribution of the signals found that younger patients should be watched out for upper respiratory tract infections and increased CSF pressure; senior patients should be extensively checked for symptoms of post-lumbar puncture syndrome and protein urine present. Our investigation discovered potential signals of novel adverse drug events that could support clinical monitoring and risk identification of Nusinersen. However, these results should be interpreted with caution."

Besides medical and legal considerations, genetic testing, including carrier screening for multiple autosomal and X-linked recessive disorders plays an essential role in evaluating hereditary risk among donors and therefore exclude them from the donation process. A retrospective study was conducted on oocyte donors from a private clinic of assisted reproduction who underwent genetic testing between June 2014 and September 2023. Pre and post-test procedures were performed at the private clinic while karyotyping and carrier screening for Cystic Fibrosis, Fragile X syndrome and Spinal Muscular Atrophy were performed at the Genetic Unit of Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto. Among 581 donors, 81 women were excluded from the donation process since 5/563 had an alteration in karyotype, 57/581 were carriers of a Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator pathogenic variant or had a 5T allele, 11/394 had Survival of Motor Neuron 1 deletion and 8/426 had an intermediate or premutation allele in Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein gene. While recommendations from fertility societies advocate for comprehensive screening, opinions differ on the mandatory implementation of expanded carrier screening. In conclusion, the genetic tests and the pre and post-test counseling is imperative to optimize reproductive outcomes in the oocyte donation process."

Pregnancy in women with SMA is associated with a high risk of rapid progression of symptoms, including increased weakness, growing paresis, or even onset of respiratory failure requiring ventilation support. Muscle weakness frequently leads to disability, which in a high percentage is irreversible. Pre-term labor and delivery by cesarean section are the most commonly described cases in the literature. <b>Methods:</b> This paper aims to describe the first case in Europe, a 21-year-old patient treated with Nusinersen under the drug program during the third trimester of pregnancy. Despite the significant progression of the disease during pregnancy, the patient did not lose gait function. The pregnancy was ended at 33Hbd, and the baby's condition was unremarkable. In addition to clinical data, this paper also discusses the economic aspects. <b>Conclusions:</b> Thanks to the rapid initiation of treatment, the patient did not lose her ability to walk, and a significant improvement in motor function was observed after the postpartum period. No side effects or negative effects on the fetus were observed."

Following the PRISMA procedure guidelines, we systematically analyzed studies published since 2020 using the PICO framework to derive reliable conclusions. The efficacy of various gene therapies was evaluated for Parkinson's disease (n = 12), spinal muscular atrophy (n = 8), Huntington's disease (n = 3), Alzheimer's disease (n = 3), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 6). For each condition, we assessed the therapeutic approach, curative or disease-modifying potential, delivery methods, advantages, drawbacks, and side effects. Results indicate that gene therapies targeting specific genes are particularly effective in monogenic disorders, with promising clinical outcomes expected in the near future. In contrast, in polygenic diseases, therapies primarily aim to promote cell survival. A major challenge remains: the translation of animal model success to human clinical application. Additionally, while intracerebral delivery methods enhance therapeutic efficacy, they are highly invasive. Despite these hurdles, gene therapy represents a promising frontier in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the need for continued research to refine and personalize treatments for each condition."

However, clinicians often encounter difficulties distinguishing between essential tremor and other etiologies due to overlapping symptoms and atypical features. A twenty-year-old man presented with a five-year history of progressive hand tremors. Neurological examinations were notable for asymmetric postural tremors in both hands, with mild distal finger muscle wasting and subtle kinetic tremors. NCS/EMG revealed neurogenic changes in the C7-C8 myotome. Upon neck flexion, cervical spinal cord MRI revealed prominent flow voids in the widened posterior epidural space from C6 to T3 levels. We diagnosed him with Hirayama disease. Hand tremors caused by Hirayama disease have distinctive patterns from that of essential tremor (ET). In our patient, the prominent postural tremor, the involvement of finger joints rather than writs and elbows, and the spiral drawing waveforms argue against ET. Moreover, the onset age, absence of family history, and right-hand intrinsic muscle wasting are also red flag signs. Recognition of these clinical nuances is important to avoid misdiagnosis. Our case highlights the importance of thorough physical examinations and the necessity of considering Hirayama disease in young men presenting with hand tremors."

To study the efficacy and safety of Nusinersen among children with SMA type 2 and 3 from North India compared to standard of care (SOC) over 12 months. Children with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of SMA and ≥2 copies of the SMN2 gene were screened for enrolment in prospective study design. Revised Hammersmith score (RHS) and revised upper limb module (RULM) were assessed every three months. Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) at median and ulnar nerves and quality of life (QOL) were performed at baseline and 12 months.

Outcome measures at 6 and 12 months were compared between the Nusinersen and SOC groups. Forty-two children with SMA, mean age of 85 ± 6 months, including 16 in the Nusinersen group and 26 in the SOC group, were enrolled. The mean RHS score in the Nusinersen group increased from the baseline of 35 ± 18 to 38.9 ± 19, and 39.9 ± 17 at 6 and 12 months (p value-0.001), in the SOC group increased from the baseline of 28.8 ± 15, to 29.6 ± 16, and 29.9 ± 17 at 6 and 12 months respectively (p value-0.35). The mean gain in the RHS score over 12 months in the Nusinersen group was significantly higher compared to the SOC group (p-value 0.02). RULM showed significant gain in the Nusinersen group compared to the SOC group over 12 months (p value 0.03). The median and ulnar nerve CMAPs, and QOL were similar in both the groups.

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a pediatric genetic disorder characterized by the loss of spinal cord motor neurons (MNs). Although the mechanisms underlying MN loss are not clear, current data suggest that glial cells contribute to disease pathology. We have previously found that SMA astrocytes drive microglial activation and MN loss potentially through the upregulation of NF-κB-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we tested the ability of neutralizing C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) while increasing either interleukin-10 (IL-10) or IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) to reduce the pro-inflammatory phenotype of SMA astrocytes. While IL-10 was ineffective, IL-1ra ameliorated SMA astrocyte-driven glial activation and MN loss in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cultures in vitro. In vivo AAV5 delivered IL-1ra overexpression, and miR-30 small hairpin RNA knockdown of CCL5 made modest but significant improvements in lifespan, weight gain, MN number, and motor function of SMNΔ7 mice. These data identify IL-1ra and CCL5 as possible therapeutic targets for SMA and highlight the importance of glial-targeted therapeutics for neurodegenerative disease."

The SMA Finder algorithm detects the most common genetic causes of SMA by evaluating reads that overlap the c.840 position of the SMN1 and SMN2 paralogs. It uses these reads to determine whether an individual most likely has 0 functional copies of SMN1. We developed SMA Finder and evaluated it on 16,626 exomes and 3911 genomes from the Broad Institute Center for Mendelian Genomics, 1157 exomes and 8762 panel samples from Tartu University Hospital, and 198,868 exomes and 198,868 genomes from the UK Biobank. SMA Finder's false-positive rate was below 1 in 200,000 samples, its positive predictive value was greater than 96%, and its true-positive rate was 29 out of 29. Most of these SMA diagnoses had initially been clinically misdiagnosed as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Our extensive evaluation of SMA Finder on exome, genome, and panel sequencing samples found it to have nearly 100% accuracy and demonstrated its ability to reduce diagnostic delays, particularly in individuals with milder subtypes of SMA. Given this accuracy, the common misdiagnoses identified here, the widespread availability of clinical confirmatory testing for SMA, and the existence of treatment options, we propose that it is time to add SMN1 to the American College of Medical Genetics list of genes with reportable secondary findings after genome and exome sequencing."

    "title": "Cytoskeleton dysfunction of motor neuron in spinal muscular atrophy.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by deletions or mutations of survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. To date, the mechanism of selective cell death of motor neurons as a hallmark of SMA is still unclear. The severity of SMA is dependent on the amount of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is an essential and ubiquitously expressed protein involved in various cellular processes including regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. In this review, we discuss the effect of SMN ablation on cytoskeleton organization including actin dynamics, growth cone formation, axonal stability, neurite outgrowth, microtubule stability, synaptic vesicle dynamics and neurofilament protein release in SMA. We also summarized a list of critical proteins such as profilin-2 (PFN2), plastin-3 (PLS3), stathmin-1 (STMN1), microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) and neurofilament which play an important role in modulating cytoskeleton in SMA. Our aim is to highlight how cytoskeletal defects contribute to motor neuron degeneration in SMA disease progression and concentrating on cytoskeleton dynamics may be a promising approach to develop new therapy or biomarker."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy is a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive motor neuron loss. The most common form of SMA is linked to 5q (5q-SMA) and is classified into subtypes according to the age of onset and maximum motor function achieved. The severity ranges from progressive infantile paralysis and premature death (type 1) to limited motor neuron loss in adults (type 4). The LATAM RegistrAME protocol is an observational, retrospective, prospective international multicenter clinical registry study involving Latin Americans. We will include 5q-SMA patients across all age groups, from pediatric to adult, to describe their clinical characteristics and disease progression. The protocol will use an international clinical research form based on the Treat Neuromuscular Disease Global Academic Network (TREAT-NMD), which focuses on advancing research on neuromuscular disorders in patients with spinal muscular atrophy. The study will include six countries in Latin America, sampling a total of 415 patients with SMA and 5q-SMA types 1, 2, 3, and 4 of all ages and both sexes who have genetically confirmed 5q-SMA. The mean follow-up period was 24 months. The primary outcomes will be the description of general clinical characteristics, access to medications capable of modifying the course of the disease, functional assessments, motor milestones, and ventilatory support. This study will provide insights into 5q spinal muscular atrophy patients in Latin America to better understand their clinical characteristics, use of medications, and outcomes while supporting further clinical management protocols and clinical trials.

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy can cause progressive physical disability and difficulties with self-care. Self-care motivation can enhance patient persistence in self-care behavior and maintain health. This study was designed to explore and describe motivations for self-care among school-aged children and adolescents with spinal muscular atrophy and the perspectives of their primary caregivers. Husserl's phenomenological research method was adopted, and data were collected using in-depth, face-to-face, open-ended interviews with patients and their primary caregivers aged 8-18 years with spinal muscular atrophy. A total of eight patient-caregiver dyads were recruited via purposeful sampling from a hospital clinic and through the Muscular Dystrophy Association of Taiwan. The interviews were conducted in the participants' homes and transcribed verbatim. Data were then thematically analyzed using the Giorgi analysis method. Six themes were identified from the patients' perspective: (a) adapting to dietary restrictions, (b) proactive measures for physical safety, c3) pursuing social connection and peer support, (d) navigating emotional well-being, (e) seeking independence, and (f) achieving success motivation. From the caregivers' perspective, the motivations for patient self-care were identified as follows: (a) ensuring safe and enjoyable eating for patients, (b) facilitating patient autonomy in health risk management, (c) facilitating patient engagement with peers, (d) balancing support with encouraging independence, (e) assessing and balancing independence and safety in patient caregiving, and (f) admiring patients' resilience and self-care innovation. This study highlights the vital roles of caregivers in adapting to the dynamic self-care motivations of children and adolescents and of healthcare professionals in facilitating communication and care strategies. Personalized approaches are essential for enhancing autonomy and well-being in pediatric patients."

    "abstract": "The availability of three therapies for the neuromuscular disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) highlights the need to match patients to the optimal treatment. Two of these treatments (nusinersen and risdiplam) target splicing of <i>SMN2</i>, but treatment outcomes vary from patient to patient. An incomplete understanding of the complex interactions among SMA genetics, SMN protein and mRNA levels, and gene-targeting treatments, limits our ability to explain this variability and identify optimal treatment strategies for individual patients. To address this, we analyzed responses to nusinersen and risdiplam in 45 primary fibroblast cell lines. Pre-treatment <i>SMN2-FL</i>, <i>SMN2Δ7</i> mRNA, and SMN protein levels were influenced by <i>SMN2</i> copy number, age, and sex. After treatment, SMN and mRNA levels were more heterogeneous. In 43% of patients, response to both therapies was similar, but in 57% one treatment led to a significantly higher SMN increase than the other treatment. Younger age, higher <i>SMN2</i> copy number, and higher SMN levels before treatment predicted better <i>in vitro</i> efficacy. These findings showcase patient-derived fibroblasts as a tool for identifying molecular predictors for personalized treatment."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited disease that leads to weakness, loss of ambulation, and progressive scoliosis in many patients, frequently requiring early spinal fusion. Nusinersen is a disease-modifying agent that improves symptoms and slows the progression of SMA but requires serial lumbar punctures for intrathecal drug delivery. Spinal fusion for scoliosis has historically been a contraindication for nusinersen therapy, as the fused spinal laminae block access to the thecal sac. Here, the authors report a case wherein a patient with SMA and prior scoliosis surgery underwent a one-level lumbar laminectomy with the placement of four titanium microscrews at the corners of the bone window thatfunction as fiducial targets for radiography-guided lumbar punctures. This procedure allowed the patient to receive nusinersen injections easily and successfully on an ongoing basis. Nusinersen is an important novel treatment for children with SMA. Thus, it is imperative to discover new ways to administer intrathecal injections to increase the number of patients able to undergo this therapy. The described one-level laminectomy with microscrew placement for serial lumbar punctures can increase the number of patients able to receive nusinersen and other intrathecal therapies. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24411."

    "title": "Measuring multifidus muscles atrophy after midline lumbar fusion with cortical bone trajectory screws due to spinal instability and spondylolisthesis: a retrospective case series.",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the impact of midline lumbar fusion with cortical bone trajectory screws (MIDLF/CBT) on the multifidus muscles, focusing on the evaluation of their postoperative atrophy. MIDLF/CBT is a relatively new technique increasingly used to treat spinal instability. Despite its reduced invasiveness compared to traditional posterior lumbar interbody fusion with traditional pedicle screws (PLIF/TP), concerns remain about potential damage to the multifidus muscles that are crucial for spinal stability. Understanding the extent of muscular atrophy post-MIDLF/CBT is vital for improving surgical outcomes, and potentially patient rehabilitation strategies. This study retrospectively analysed preoperative and postoperative MRI scans of patients who underwent MIDLF/CBT for degenerative segmental spondylolisthesis. The bilateral width of the multifidus muscles at the operated segment and adjacent segments was measured using axial T2-weighted MRI scans. Statistical comparisons were made using a paired t test, with significance set at p < 0.05. The study included 16 patients with an average age of 57 ± 10 years, 10 of whom (62.5%) were women, and featured a mean follow-up period of 37 ± 25 months. Postoperative measurements showed a significant reduction in the width of the multifidus muscles at the operated segment (mean difference -3.3mm, p = 0.02) and the inferior adjacent segment (-7.4 mm, p < 0.01). A decrease in muscle width at the superior adjacent segment was also observed, although this was not statistically significant. Our study concluded that MIDLF/CBT results in significant multifidus muscle atrophy at and below the operated segment, potentially impacting postoperative rehabilitation and recovery. These findings highlight the need for further research comparing MIDLF/CBT to other spinal stabilisation techniques. Additionally, incorporating functional electromyographic assessments of paraspinal muscles could provide deeper insights into the long-term consequences of spinal surgeries and helpdevelop new approaches and strategies to mitigate paravertebral muscles atrophy, thus enhancing patient outcomes."

This study aims to examine the emotions of parents who have a child with Spinal Muscular Atrophy within the framework of a phenomenological design. This study was conducted with a phenomenological design. The study was carried out between August 2022 and April 2024 with the parents of children treated for Spinal Muscular Atrophy in the pediatric ward of a university hospital. Using a purposive sampling method, 11 parents were involved in interviews. A semi-structured questionnaire was employed during the interviews, and all the interviews were audio recorded. The data analysis done by applying the inductive thematic analysis method. The study was carried out according to the COREQ checklist. It was found that 54.54 % of the children who participated in the study were diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy between the ages of 0 and 1 year, 72.72 % between 0 and 6 months, and 54.54 % were Spinal Muscular Atrophy TYPE 1 patients. As a result of thematic analysis method, five main and ten sub-themes had emerged. These are; (1) helplessness (helplessness of having to accept, helplessness of not being able to spare time), (2) being upset (being upset about the symptoms of the disease, feeling misunderstood, sadness about their healthy children), (3) stress (stress due to the intensive and exhausting treatment and care process, stress due to the economic situation), (4) fear (fear of death, fear of future pregnancies), (5) unhappiness (being unhappy with the changing living conditions). It was observed that parents who have a child with Spinal Muscular Atrophy experience emotional challenges. Gaining insights into the perspectives of parents can enable healthcare professionals to better understand the negative emotional experiences of parents caring for children with Spinal Muscular Atrophy. Such understanding may guide the development of targeted strategies to provide comprehensive psychological support aimed at improving parental mental health outcomes. Increasing awareness among healthcare professionals and the broader society fosters a more informed and empathetic approach to addressing the challenges faced by children with Spinal Muscular Atrophy and their families, enhancing the quality of care and support provided."

    "abstract": "Brachial plexu root avulsion (BPRA) commonly causes extensive motoneuron death, motor axon degeneration and denervation of biceps, leading to devastating motor dysfunction in the upper limb. Edaravone (Eda) has been proven to exert anti-oxidative and neuroprotective effects on various neurological disorders. Herein, we aimed to investigate the efficacy profile and potential mechanisms of Eda on BPRA in vitro and in vivo models. Rats following BPRA and reimplantation surgery were intraperitoneally injected with Eda once daily. The motor function recovery of the affected forelimb was assessed by Terzis grooming test. Histological staining and transmission electron microscopy were performed to evaluate the morphological appearance of the spinal cord, musculocutaneous nerve, and biceps. Further in-depth studies to explore the underlying mechanisms of Eda were conducted using Western blotting, biochemical assays, and immunofluorescence in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced NSC-34 cells. Eda significantly accelerated motor function recovery, enhanced motoneuron survival, prevented motor axon descent, preserved myelin sheath integrity and attenuated muscle atrophy. Additionally, Eda treatment markedly suppressed oxidative stress-related indicators, downregulated apoptosis-related proteins, mitigated glial reactivity, and activated SIRT1 and TFEB. Notably, the neuroprotective effect of Eda was diminished by the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated NSC-34 cells, suggesting that Eda regulated oxidative stress and apoptosis through SIRT1/TFEB-induced autophagy flux. Eda enhanced motoneuron survival and axonal regeneration that promotes motor functional restoration by inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis via the SIRT1/TFEB-autophagy pathway. Thus, it may serve as a promising strategy in reimplantation surgery for the treatment of BPRA."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, respiratory failure, and in severe cases, infantile death. Early detection and treatment before symptom onset may substantially improve outcomes, allowing patients to achieve age-appropriate motor milestones and longer survival. We assessed the cost-utility of newborn screening (NBS) for SMA in Japan. A cost-utility model (decision tree and Markov model) compared lifetime health effects and costs between \"NBS\" for SMA (presymptomatic treatment) or \"no NBS\" (treatment initiated at symptom onset). Model inputs were sourced from literature, local data, and expert opinion. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted to assess model robustness and data validity. Based on the 1:10,000 SMA incidence, it was estimated that 43 newborns/year would have SMA, and a total of 39 patients with SMA would initiate presymptomatic treatment after NBS. An estimated 736 quality-adjusted life-years were gained per annual birth cohort with NBS. NBS for SMA was dominant compared with no NBS (i.e. less costly and more effective), with ¥8,856,960,096 reduced total costs with NBS versus no NBS (base-case). Sensitivity and scenario analyses supported cost effectiveness of NBS for SMA versus no NBS. A greater percentage of patients was estimated to enjoy longer survival and be without permanent assisted ventilation with NBS versus no NBS. Real-world observations may differ from single-arm clinical trial outcomes. It was assumed that patients with SMA identified via NBS were asymptomatic and would receive treatment prior to symptoms. Best supportive care was not considered, and Japan-specific variations in gene replacement therapy protocol were not fully reflected. NBS for SMA allows for early identification of patients with SMA and treatment initiation before symptom onset, improving health outcomes and reducing total costs than without NBS."

    "title": "Feature Engineering for the Prediction of Scoliosis in 5q-Spinal Muscular Atrophy.",
    "abstract": "5q-Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is now one of the 5% treatable rare diseases worldwide. As disease-modifying therapies alter disease progression and patient phenotypes, paediatricians and consulting disciplines face new unknowns in their treatment decisions. Conclusions made from historical patient data sets are now mostly limited, and new approaches are needed to ensure our continued best standard-of-care practices for this exceptional patient group. Here, we present a data-driven machine learning approach to a rare disease data set to predict spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)-associated scoliosis. We collected data from 84 genetically confirmed 5q-SMA patients who have received novel SMA therapies. We performed expert domain knowledge-directed feature engineering, correlation and predictive power score (PPS) analyses for feature selection. To test the predictive performance of the selected features, we trained a Random Forest Classifier and evaluated model performance using standard metrics. The SMA data set consisted of 1304 visits and over 360 variables. We performed feature engineering for variables related to 'interventions', 'devices', 'orthosis', 'ventilation', 'muscle contractures' and 'motor milestones'. Through correlation and PPS analysis paired with expert domain knowledge feature selection, we identified relevant features for scoliosis prediction in SMA that included disease progression markers: Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded 'HFMSE' (PPS = 0.27) and 6-Minute Walk Test '6MWT' scores (PPS = 0.44), 'age' (PPS = 0.41) and 'weight' (PPS = 0.49), 'contractures' (PPS = 0.17), the use of 'assistive devices' (PPS = 0.39, 'ventilation' (PPS = 0.16) and the presence of 'gastric tubes' (PPS = 0.35) in SMA patients. These features were validated using expert domain knowledge and used to train a Random Forest Classifier with an observed accuracy of 0.82 and an average receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area of 0.87. The introduction of disease-modifying SMA therapies, followed by the implementation of SMA in newborn screenings, has presented physicians with never-seen patients. We used feature engineering tools to overcome one of the main challenges when using data-driven approaches in rare disease data sets. Through predictive modelling of this data, we defined disease progression markers, which are easily assessed during patient visits and can help anticipate scoliosis onset. This highlights the importance of progressive features in the drug-induced revolution of this rare disease and further supports the ongoing efforts to update the SMA classification. We advocate for the consistent documentation of relevant progression markers, which will serve as a basis for data-driven models that physicians can use to update their best standard-of-care practices."

    "abstract": "White matter tracts within the central nervous system are organized into ascending and descending pathways that transmit sensory input and motor output, respectively. Tractopathy, or damage to these tracts, can impair sensory or motor functions. Motor neuron diseases are pathologic processes affecting the upper or lower motor neurons. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of acquired motor neuron disease. Traditionally, ALS has affected upper and lower motor neurons of the extremities, torso, and head and neck. There are several ALS variants, some of which affect only the upper motor neurons (eg, primary lateral sclerosis), lower motor neurons (eg, progressive muscular atrophy), or motor neurons of the head and neck (eg, progressive bulbar palsy). Characteristic imaging features of ALS include abnormal T2 hyperintensity within the brain along the corticospinal tract, as well as cortical susceptibility signal intensity along the precentral gyrus, termed the \"motor band\" sign. Spinal muscular atrophy is a less common primary motor neuron disease and appears on images as atrophy of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, as well as proximal muscle atrophy. In addition to pure motor neuron diseases, there are numerous toxic and metabolic conditions, genetic disorders, infectious diseases, and immune-mediated disorders that can secondarily affect the corticospinal tracts (corticospinal tractopathies), producing symptoms of upper motor neuron injury. These tractopathies are visible at MRI as T2-hyperintense lesions along varying segments of the corticospinal tract. A comprehensive diagnostic approach that integrates clinical symptoms with radiologic and laboratory findings is crucial to distinguish among these varied conditions. <sup>©</sup>RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article."

    "abstract": "Individuals diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), particularly those presenting with the most severe phenotypes, have long contended with significant swallowing dysfunction. The recent emergence of efficacious advanced therapy has fundamentally altered the landscape of SMA management. By encompassing both the pre and post gene-based therapy eras within our analysis, we endeavour to elucidate the potential impact of these novel therapeutic interventions on this function. Following the established methodology outlined by the Joanna Briggs Institute, a scoping review was conducted. This review encompassed relevant literature published up to March 2024. Two electronic databases were searched, with additional studies identified by reviewing reference lists of pertinent articles. The search strategy employed a combination of keywords including \"spinal muscular atrophy\", \"SMA\", \"swallowing\", \"feeding\", and \"nutrition\". Articles were initially screened based on title and abstract, followed by a full-text review of eligible studies published in peer-reviewed English language journals. The initial database search resulted in 462 articles, from which 23 studies were ultimately selected for analysis. Pre gene-based therapy studies revealed swallowing dysfunction as a prominent feature. Patients frequently reported challenges with chewing, choking on solids and liquids, and abnormal tongue movements during eating. Early dysphagia research relied on subjective measures (questionnaires, scales). objective measures like video fluoroscopic (VFSS) were rare. After gene-based therapies (GBTs), VFSS became the dominant, more objective method. Studies investigating the post-gene therapy era suggest potential clinical benefits, with trends towards improvement or stabilization of swallowing function. Pre gene-based therapy studies revealed widespread swallowing dysfunction in SMA. Conversely, the post-treatment era suggests potential improvement. Future research should prioritize identifying optimal therapies for individual swallowing function and develop validated assessments to optimize SMA management."

This study provides real-world respiratory data for pediatric SMA patients receiving OA who were assessed before and one year after treatment in a multicenter cohort study conducted from 2019 to 2021. Twenty-five OA-treated SMA patients (23 with type 1 and 2 with type 2; median age at treatment 6.1 months, with a range of 0.36-23 months) were included. Sixteen were treatment-naïve, and nine had received various prior treatments. Two patients died due to respiratory failure during the study period. Of the remaining 23 patients, four were put on non-invasive ventilation (NIV), bringing ventilated patients to a total of ten during the post-treatment year. Three patients required permanent NIV support, while 13 did not require any respiratory support. Ventilation time decreased from 14.3 to 11.1 hours per day, and respiratory hospitalizations decreased by 26% (from 0.76 to 0.57 per life year). Fifteen of the 23 patients maintained full oral nutrition at study closure compared to 20 of the 25 at study initiation. This real-world data analysis demonstrates that OA may improve respiratory outcomes in SMA patients. Importantly, compounding factors, such as age at treatment initiation, treatment combinations, and natural history, may influence the respiratory course, thus highlighting the need for standardized long-term management. What is Known: • Respiratory failure is a leading cause of mortality in untreated spinal muscular atrophy type 1 patients. • Onasemnogene abeparvovec (OA) improves neurological outcomes, but real-world respiratory data are limited. What is New: • Our real-world analysis suggests OA may improve respiratory outcomes. • Age at treatment and treatment combinations may also influence respiratory trajectory."

The carrier frequency of SMA was estimated to be 5.55%. Furthermore, 3.06% of SMA parents (n = 24) had two copies of the SMN1 gene. Among 725 patients, those with an earlier onset of SMA were more likely to have two copies of the SMN2 gene (46.45%) and no copies of the NAIP gene (49.36%). Among the 654 fetal samples screened for SMA, 22.33% were found to be affected, while 3.46% of their parents tested normal. These findings are valuable for genetic counseling, carrier screening, and prenatal diagnosis of SMA in Iran. Furthermore, they underscore the importance of CNV analysis of SMN1, SMN2, and NAIP genes for accurate diagnosis and prognosis of SMA."

    "abstract": "The intercommunication between nerves and muscles plays an important role in the functioning of our body, and its failure leads to severe neuromuscular disorders such as spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying nerve-muscle interactions and mediating their mutual influence is an integral part of strategies aimed at curing neuromuscular diseases. Here, we propose a novel ex vivo experimental model for the spinal cord (SC) and skeletal muscle interactions which for the first time utilizes only fully formed (but not yet quite functional) postnatal tissues. The model represents an organotypic co-culture comprising a longitudinal slice of the mouse postnatal SC and an extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle explant placed in the \"damage zone\" of transversally dissected longitudinal slice of the SC. Using this model, we have shown that SC tissue stimulates muscle contractions and reduces the area occupied by acetylcholine receptors on muscle surface. In turn, EDL muscles stimulate the growth of SC-derived neurites. Thus, our organotypic model allows one to assess the mutual influence of neurons and muscles in a nearly natural setting which maintains the architecture and cellular composition of intact tissues. Therefore, this model may provide an effective platform for studying molecular and cellular mechanisms linked to defective neuromuscular interactions in associated pathologies."

Common complications were polyhydramnios, preterm labor, miscarriages, and cesarean sections. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) showed higher neonatal risks than type 2 (DM2). Women with SMA faced exacerbated muscle weakness, while CMT and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy were associated with preterm labor and cesarean deliveries. Pompe disease exacerbated symptoms, and GNE myopathy showed similar pregnancy outcomes to the general population. Non-dystrophic myotonias had higher fetal distress and postpartum complications. Women with genetic neuromuscular disorders face increased pregnancy complications, including preterm labor, cesarean sections, and disease symptom exacerbation. Multidisciplinary care between neurologists and obstetricians is essential in managing these high-risk pregnancies effectively, ensuring better maternal and neonatal outcomes.

In this study, we aimed to characterize the pattern of motor unit loss in the hand intrinsic muscles of SMA patients compared to ALS patients and healthy controls (HC) using MScanFit MUNE. <b>Methods:</b> Patients diagnosed with ALS, adult SMA patients, and HC were prospectively enrolled. MScanFit examinations were performed on the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles. To focus on the different patterns of motor neuron degeneration in the intrinsic hand muscles, the ratio of CMAP amplitude of APB to ADM (CMAP ratio) and the ratio of MUNE values of APB to those of the ADM muscle (MUNE ratio) were calculated. <b>Results:</b> The study included 46 ALS patients, 16 SMA patients, and 23 HC. MScanFit MUNE revealed distinct patterns of motor unit degeneration in SMA patients, notably more severe in the ADM than in the APB muscle, indicating a \"reverse\" split-hand phenomenon. Both CMAP and MUNE ratios demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing ALS from SMA, with the MUNE ratio performing better. <b>Conclusions:</b> MScanFit MUNE is a valuable tool for exploring distinct patterns of motor neuron degeneration in patients with different types of motor neuron diseases."

    "title": "A Modular Genetic Approach to Newborn Screening from Spinal Muscular Atrophy to Sickle Cell Disease-Results from Six Years of Genetic Newborn Screening.",
    "abstract": "Genetic newborn screening (NBS) has already entered the phase of common practice in many countries. In Germany, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and sickle cell disease (SCD) are currently a mandatory part of NBS. Here, we describe the experience of six years of genetic NBS including the prevalence of those three diseases in Germany. Samples and nucleic acids were extracted from dried blood spot cards, commonly used for NBS. A qPCR assay was used to detect disease-causing variants for SMA and SCD, and the detection of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) was performed for SCID screening. The results of the NBS of over 1 million newborns for SMA, approximately 770,000 for SCID and over 410,000 for SCD are discussed in detail. In these newborns, we have identified 121 cases of SMA, 15 cases of SCID and syndrome-based immunodeficiencies and 77 cases of SCD or β-thalassemia. The flexibility of multiplex qPCR is assessed as an effective tool for incorporating different molecular genetic markers for screening. The processing of dried blood spot (DBS) filter cards for molecular genetic assays and the assays are described in detail; turn-around times and cost estimations are included to give an insight into the processes and discuss further options for optimization. The identified cases are in the range expected for the total number of screened newborns, but present a more exact view on the actual prevalences for Germany."

    "title": "SMN Deficiency Induces an Early Non-Atrophic Myopathy with Alterations in the Contractile and Excitatory Coupling Machinery of Skeletal Myofibers in the SMN∆7 Mouse Model of Spinal Muscular Atrophy.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by a deficiency of the ubiquitously expressed survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. The main pathological hallmark of SMA is the degeneration of lower motor neurons (MNs) with subsequent denervation and atrophy of skeletal muscle. However, increasing evidence indicates that low SMN levels not only are detrimental to the central nervous system (CNS) but also directly affect other peripheral tissues and organs, including skeletal muscle. To better understand the potential primary impact of SMN deficiency in muscle, we explored the cellular, ultrastructural, and molecular basis of SMA myopathy in the SMNΔ7 mouse model of severe SMA at an early postnatal period (P0-7) prior to muscle denervation and MN loss (preneurodegenerative [PND] stage). This period contrasts with the neurodegenerative (ND) stage (P8-14), in which MN loss and muscle atrophy occur. At the PND stage, we found that SMN∆7 mice displayed early signs of motor dysfunction with overt myofiber alterations in the absence of atrophy. We provide essential new ultrastructural data on focal and segmental lesions in the myofibrillar contractile apparatus. These lesions were observed in association with specific myonuclear domains and included abnormal accumulations of actin-thin myofilaments, sarcomere disruption, and the formation of minisarcomeres. The sarcoplasmic reticulum and triads also exhibited ultrastructural alterations, suggesting decoupling during the excitation-contraction process. Finally, changes in intermyofibrillar mitochondrial organization and dynamics, indicative of mitochondrial biogenesis overactivation, were also found. Overall, our results demonstrated that SMN deficiency induces early and MN loss-independent alterations in myofibers that essentially contribute to SMA myopathy. This strongly supports the growing body of evidence indicating the existence of intrinsic alterations in the skeletal muscle in SMA and further reinforces the relevance of this peripheral tissue as a key therapeutic target for the disease."

    "abstract": "RNA therapeutics have undergone remarkable evolution since their inception in the late 1970s, revolutionizing medicine by offering new possibilities for treating previously intractable diseases. The field encompasses various modalities, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs), each with unique mechanisms and applications. The foundation was laid in 1978 with the discovery that synthetic oligonucleotides could inhibit viral replication, followed by pivotal developments such as RNA interference's discovery in 1998. The COVID-19 pandemic marked a crucial turning point, demonstrating the potential of mRNA vaccines and accelerating interest in RNA-based approaches. However, significant challenges remain, including stability issues, delivery to target tissues, potential off-target effects, and immunogenicity concerns. Recent advancements in chemical modifications, delivery systems, and the integration of AI technologies are addressing these challenges. The field has seen notable successes, such as approved treatments for spinal muscular atrophy and hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis. Looking ahead, RNA therapeutics show promise for personalized medicine approaches, particularly in treating genetic disorders and cancer. The continued evolution of this field, driven by technological innovations and deeper understanding of RNA biology, suggests a transformative impact on future medical treatments.

The polymorphic CAG<i>n</i> locus in exon 1 of the <i>AR</i> gene is associated with several diseases, including spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), prostate cancer, and male infertility. This study evaluated the CAG<i>n</i> locus in 9000 infertile Russian men and 286 fertile men (control group). The CAG<i>n</i> locus was analyzed using the amplified fragment length polymorphism method. In the infertile cohort, the number of CAG repeats ranged from 6 to 46, with a unimodal distribution. The number of CAG repeats in infertile and fertile men was 22.15 ± 0.93 and 22.02 ± 1.36, respectively. In infertile men, variants with 16 to 29 repeats were present in 97% of the alleles. A complete mutation (≥42 CAG repeats) was found in three patients, while three others had 39-41 repeats. The incidence of SBMA was 1:3000 infertile men. Significant differences (<i>p</i> < 0.05) were observed between infertile and fertile men in alleles with 21, 24 and 25 repeats. This study revealed certain differences in the CAG<i>n</i> polymorphic locus of the <i>AR</i> gene in Russian infertile and fertile men and determined the frequency of SBMA in infertile patients."

A total of 213 biosamples (urine, plasma, and CSF) from 153 treatment-naïve patients with SMA across five German centers were analyzed using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy. Prediction models were developed using machine learning algorithms which enabled the patients with SMA to be grouped according to disease severity. A quantitative enrichment analysis was employed to identify metabolic pathways associated with disease progression. The results demonstrate high sensitivity (84-91%) and specificity (91-94%) in distinguishing treatment-naïve patients with SMA from controls across all biofluids. The urinary and plasma profiles differentiated between early-onset (type I) and later-onset (type II/III) SMA with over 80% accuracy. Key metabolic differences involved alterations in energy and amino acid metabolism. This study suggests that <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy based metabolic profiling may be a promising, non-invasive tool to identify patients with SMA and for severity stratification, potentially complementing current diagnostic and prognostic strategies in SMA management."

    "abstract": "The primary life-threatening complication in spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is ventilatory failure. The present study analyzes the longitudinal patterns of respiratory function tests over a follow-up of 11 years. We collected data from 9 genetically confirmed SBMA patients. Spirometric measurements [maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), and forced vital capacity (FVC)], serum biochemical indices and SBMA functional rating scale (SBMAFRS) were collected every 6 months for 11 years. An average time curve was utilized to assess the changes in both pulmonary tests and serum biochemical indices of the patients. One-way repeated-measures ANOVA was applied to assess statistical differences. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was utilized to evaluate the correlations between the respiratory function tests and serum biochemical and clinical indices. A progressive decrease was observed in the respiratory function tests; the slope of the linear regression was significantly non-zero (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) for all three time curves. A major decrease was observed for MEP (52%) and MIP (42%), while this was minor for FVC (25%). SBMAFRS score correlated with FVC (r = 0.27), MIP (r = 0.53) and MEP (r = 0.51). MIP and MEP correlated with creatine phosphokinase (r = 0.3, r = 0.25, respectively) and MIP with creatinine levels (r = 0.31). This longitudinal study shows a progressive decline of spirometric data throughout life in SBMA patients. The decline appears to be related to clinical deterioration and muscle denervation. Spirometric measures relative to maximal strength of the respiratory muscles (MIP and MEP) may have a better predictive value for pulmonary and muscular decline than FVC."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe neurodegenerative disease caused by the loss of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, leading to degeneration of anterior motor neurons and resulting in progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Given that SMA has a single, well-defined genetic cause, gene-targeted therapies have been developed, aiming to increase SMN production in SMA patients. The SMN protein is likely involved in the synthesis of microRNAs (miRNAs), and dysregulated miRNA expression is increasingly associated with the pathophysiology of SMA. Currently, there is a lack of reliable biomarkers to monitor SMA; therefore, the search for novel SMA biomarkers, including miRNAs, is crucial as reliable tools are needed to track disease progression, predict the response to therapy and understand the different clinical outcomes of available treatments. In this review, we compile data on miRNAs associated with SMA pathogenesis and their potential use as biomarkers. Based on current knowledge, the most frequently deregulated miRNAs between SMA patients and controls, as well as pre- and post-treatment in SMA patients, include miR-1-3p, miR-133a-3p, miR-133b, and miR-206. These findings offer promising possibilities for improving patient classification and monitoring disease progression and response to treatment. Additionally, these findings provide insights into the broader molecular mechanisms and networks of SMA that could inform the development of future therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) are a group of rare disorders characterized by significant genetic and clinical complexity. Advances in genomics have revolutionized both the diagnosis and treatment of NMDs. While fewer than 30 NMDs had known genetic causes before the 1990s, more than 600 have now been identified, largely due to the adoption of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies such as whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). These technologies have enabled more precise and earlier diagnoses, although the genetic complexity of many NMDs continues to pose challenges. Gene therapy has been a transformative breakthrough in the treatment of NMDs. In spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), therapies like nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec, and risdiplam have dramatically improved patient outcomes. Similarly, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has seen significant progress, most notably with the FDA approval of delandistrogene moxeparvovec, the first micro-dystrophin gene therapy. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including the rarity of many NMDs, genetic heterogeneity, and the high costs associated with genomic technologies and therapies. Continued progress in gene therapy, RNA-based therapeutics, and personalized medicine holds promise for further breakthroughs in the management of these debilitating diseases."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder resulting in the loss of α-motor neurons. Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide administered intrathecally to SMA patients that corrects the splicing defect of SMN2. Not all SMA patients respond equally to the therapy and work is in progress to identify biomarkers that may help stratify to SMA patients. In this study, we evaluated the expression of SMN circular RNAs (circRNAs) as potential biomarkers of the disease. This monocentric study was conducted at Fondazione Policlinico A. Gemelli in collaboration with Catholic University of Sacred Heart between December 2019 and March 2023. The inclusion criteria comprised having a diagnosis of SMA I and being treated with Nusinersen. The quantitative analysis of SMN circ4-2b-3 was conducted analyzing patients' serum-derived exosomes. The study included 19 type I SMA patients. Among several SMN circRNAs expressed in SMA cells, only SMN circ4-2b-3 was also detected in exosomes isolated from both type I SMA cell lines and patient-derived serum. High copy number of SMN circ4-2b-3 occurred in a small subgroup of type I SMA patients who were defined as super-responders, based on their response to the Nusinersen therapy. The levels of this circRNA remained high over time. Our results suggest that SMN circ4-2b-3 is a potential biomarker to predict the therapeutic response of type I SMA patients to Nusinersen. However, since other super-responders had a lower number of SMN circ4-2b-3 copies, these findings should be confirmed in larger cohorts."

    "abstract": "Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a rare, slowly progressive, and debilitating disease without effective treatments available. Lack of reliable biomarkers and sensitive outcome measures makes clinical research conduct challenging. The primary objective of this study was to identify clinically meaningful and statistically sensitive outcome measures enabling the evaluation of therapeutic interventions in late-stage clinical trials. This study was a meta-analysis of SBMA patient-level data from 6 observational studies conducted in Italy, South Korea, Denmark, United Kingdom, Japan, and United States. Patients with confirmed SBMA genetic diagnosis and differing severity were enrolled following individual site protocols. Routine assessments were performed longitudinally for approximately 3 years, including one or more clinical outcomes, such as SBMA functional rating scale (SBMAFRS), 6-minute walk test (6MWT), quantitative muscle testing (QMT), and Adult Myopathy Assessment Tool (AMAT). A modified scale, m-SBMAFRS, was derived by including only lower limb and trunk subscales having lower variability and larger effect size compared with the others. Changes from baseline at follow-up time points were calculated for all measures, and percent changes using random slope models were calculated to compare clinical measure performances. A survey conducted on 196 patients by the Coordination of Rare Diseases at Sanford (CoRDS), elucidating the impact of specific disease aspects on patients' lives, was also evaluated to corroborate these research outcomes. This global SBMA dataset analyzed data from 278 men (mean age = 59.7 ± 10.8 years, mean disease duration = 17.7 ± 11.9 years). Patients progressed on SBMAFRS (-4.7 ± 6.2 points after 38 months with 1-year standard response mean [SRM] = 0.6) and 6MWT (distance walked decreased by -53.2 ± 87.0 meters after 26 months with 1-year SRM = 0.5). These measures showed lower variability and larger effect size than AMAT and QMT (1-year SRM = 0.1 and -0.2, respectively) and confirmed SBMA linear progression across a range of disease stages. The m-SBMAFRS also showed a significant yearly decline of 0.9 ± 1.5 points (SRM = 0.6) and more consistent performance with less variability across clinical sites. The CoRDS survey confirmed the relevance of lower limb strength and mobility, which correlated with higher quality-of-life metrics and were reported by patients as predominant disease issues. We generated a comprehensive global SBMA dataset, enabling the identification of sensitive functional end points for clinical trials. Possible limitations relate to data collection nuances across sites that a single study protocol could override."

This condition is caused by a mutation in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which inevitably results in a deficiency of the SMN protein. In present study, we investigated the potential role of telomere attrition in SMA patients. Relative telomere length in peripheral blood lymphocytes was measured by Monochrome Multiplex Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (MMQPCR) in 98 subjects and we conclusively found that SMA cases exhibit telomere attrition compared to healthy controls (P = 4 × 10<sup>- 2</sup>). Moreover, significant attrition was also observed in severe form of SMA, i.e. SMA type 0 (P = 0.04) as well.Although, the exact mechanism through which telomere shortening contributes to the pathogenesis of SMA is not fully understood and is yet to be delineated. However, one possibility is that telomere shortening leads to genomic instability and DNA damage, which can contribute to motor neuron degeneration. Another possibility is that telomere shortening leads to cellular senescence, which can impair the ability of motor neurons to regenerate and repair themselves. Recent studies have suggested that telomere shortening may be a potential therapeutic target in SMA. Thus, understanding the role of SMN1 gene in disease pathogenesis & its effect on telomere length will aid in estimating the risk & prognosis of SMA in genetically less explored & highly inbred region of Kashmir, Northern India."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy due to the absence of the survival motor neuron 1 (<i>SMN1</i>) gene. SMA is classified into types 0 through 4 based on the age of symptom onset and the severity of motor function decline. Recent advances in SMA treatment, including nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec, and risdiplam, have significantly improved the prognosis of SMA patients. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of nusinersen in pediatric patients with SMA types 1, 2, and 3 in a real-world clinical setting. This prospective observational single-center study assessed the treatment effects of nusinersen in 23 pediatric patients with genetically confirmed SMA over a 22-month observation period. All the participants received intrathecal loading doses of 12 mg of nusinersen on days 1, 14, 28, and 63, followed by maintenance doses every four months. Functional assessments were conducted using the CHOP-INTEND scale. Data were collected during routine patient visits, including clinical laboratory tests and vital sign parameters, and adverse events were recorded. The inclusion criteria were defined by the national reimbursement program for nusinersen treatment in Poland. Initially, 37 patients ranging from 1 month old to 18 years old were included, but 23 were ultimately observed due to changes in treatment regimens or assessment scales. The patients showed significantly improved CHOP-INTEND scores over the 22-month period. At 6 months, the average increase was 4.2 points, continuing to 17.8 points at 22 months. By the end of the study, 100% of patients showed either stabilization or improvement, with significant clinical improvements observed in several patients. Nusinersen was generally well-tolerated, with post-lumbar puncture headache and lower back pain being the most common adverse events. Nusinersen treatment significantly enhances motor function in pediatric patients with SMA types 1, 2, and 3. This study demonstrates the importance of early and sustained treatment, with most patients showing the continuous improvement or stabilization of motor function. These findings support the use of nusinersen as an effective therapy for SMA; however, further research is needed to understand the long-term outcomes and optimize treatment strategies."

Conventional methodologies, however, fail to provide a comprehensive gene overview of <i>SMN</i> and are often both time-intensive and costly. In this study, we present a novel one-step MALDI-TOF MS assay for SMA gene testing. To accurately quantify CNV, we incorporated <i>RPPH1</i> as an internal control alongside normal samples and competing templates targeting <i>SMN1</i>, <i>SMN2</i>, and <i>RPPH1</i> for multiple corrections. The CNV assay enables precise quantification of exons 7/8 in both <i>SMN1</i> and <i>SMN2</i> genes, achieving a kappa value of 0.935 (<i>P</i> < 0.001) when compared with multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) during its development phase. This accuracy was further corroborated in a cohort comprising 78 individuals. To identify patients harboring compound heterozygous mutations or silent carriers, prevalent pathogenic variants along with sequence variants of <i>SMN1</i> were integrated into our analysis framework; plasmids were constructed for methodological validation purposes. Utilizing these combinatorial assays for <i>SMN</i> detection, we identified one patient exhibiting a compound heterozygous mutation characterized by genotype [0 + 1<sup>d</sup>] and another subject presenting genotype [2 + 1], who harbored simultaneous variants of g.27134T > G and g.27706_27707delAT. The CNV assessment combined with pathogenic variants analysis developed through MALDI-TOF MS provides a comprehensive gene profile of <i>SMN</i> within a single analytical run.

The study included 16 patients diagnosed with SMA type 1 according to clinical findings and genetic results between 2017 and 2022. The patients were divided into two groups as living and deceased, and complications were examined and compared between the groups. The patients comprised 8 (50%) females and 8 (50%) males with a median age at diagnosis of 3 months. The patients had a history of gastrointestinal problems, orthopedic problems, infection and sepsis, and especially respiratory distress. Death occurred in 8 (50%) patients during follow-up (median age 38 months). Mortality was higher in patients who needed tracheostomy and had gastroesophageal reflux. The survival rate was better in patients who received more nusinersen treatment and had a higher CHOP-INTEND score. Despite new-generation treatments for SMA type 1, morbidity and mortality rates remain very high. As the survival rate in SMA type 1 increases, the incidence of complications similar to those frequently seen in SMA type 2 and type 3 patients also increases.

    "abstract": "Proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by deficiency of the ubiquitously expressed survival motor neuron protein. Although primarily a hereditary lower motor neuron disease, it is probably also characterized by abnormalities in other organs. Brain abnormalities and cognitive impairment have been reported in severe SMA. We aimed to systematically investigate brain structure in SMA using MRI. We acquired high-resolution T1-weighted images of treatment-naive patients with SMA, age- and sex-matched healthy and disease controls with other neuromuscular diseases, on a 3 T MRI scanner. We performed vertex-wise whole brain analysis and region of interest analysis of cortical thickness (CT), and volumetric analysis of the thalamus and compared findings in patients and controls using multiple linear regression models and Wald test. We correlated structural abnormalities with motor function as assessed by the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) and SMA Functional Rating Scale (SMA-FRS).

We found a reduced CT in patients with SMA compared to healthy controls at the precentral, postcentral and medial orbitofrontal gyri and at the temporal pole (mean differences -0.059(p = 0.04); -0.055(p = 0.04), -0.06(p = 0.04); -0.17 mm(p = 0.001)).

Compared to healthy controls, we found a reduced volume of the whole thalamus (mean difference -325 mm<sup>3</sup>(p = 0.03)) and of the anterior, ventral and intralaminar thalamic nuclei (mean differences -9.9(p = 0.02); -157(p = 0.01); -24.2 mm<sup>3</sup>(p = 0.02) in patients with SMA and a positive correlation between these volumes and motor function. MRI shows structural changes in motor and non-motor regions of the cortex and the thalamus of patients with SMA type 2 and 3, indicating that SMA pathology is not confined to motor neurons."

    "title": "Risdiplam: therapeutic effects and tolerability in a small cohort of 6 adult type 2 and type 3 SMA patients.",
    "abstract": "Risdiplam is a validated treatment for adult SMA patients, but clear guidelines concerning functional assessment at baseline and during the follow-up are still limited, especially in terms of sensible and validated outcome measures able to capture minimal changes in motor performances induced by therapy. The aim of this work is to describe the effect of Risdiplam on a cohort of 6 adult type 2 and type 3 SMA patients, using Motor Function Measure (MFM32) as a standardized scaleto quantify the motor improvements induced by therapy. Risdiplam at the dose of 5 mg/daily was administered to a population of 6 (4 F;2 M) type 2 (N = 4) and type 3 (N = 2), adult SMA patients. Two patients were previously treated by Nusinersen, later suspended due to side effects. At baseline, all patients received a neuromuscular evaluation and a MFM32 assessment. After the beginning of treatment, we evaluated MFM32, patient reported outcomes (PROs), and adverse events over 7-27 months of follow-up. The MFM32 showed an increased score ranging from + 2.16% to + 7.29% in 4 patients. The improvement was maintained overtime, with two patients presenting the longest follow-up period of 24 and 27 months respectively. Subdomain D3 was ameliorated in 66.6% of patients. Two patients previously treated with Nusinersen maintained the pre-Risdiplam scores. The HFMSE was also performed and failed to show significant improvements after treatment. All patients reported subjective ameliorations. The commonest PROs were improvements in breath fatigue, voice's intelligibility, hand strength and dexterity. Adverse effects were mild and decreased over time. Risdiplam is a well-tolerated treatment in our cohort of adult type 2 and type 3 SMA patients and resulted in improvement or stabilization in motor functions. MFM32 proved to be sensitive to detect changes induced by therapy. Subjective meaningful improvements were sustained overtime especially in bulbar functions, breath fatigue and distal motor abilities."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the gratitude experience of young and middle-aged patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) during hospitalisation to provide a theoretical basis for medical professionals to develop gratitude intervention programs. Patients with SMA who were treated with nusinersen in the Department of Neurology of the First Hospital of Jilin University between April 20 and May 20, 2024 were selected using the purposive sampling method, and semi-structured interviews were conducted. The interview data were analysed using Colaizzi's 7-step analysis method. Four themes were extracted: gratitude stimulated positive emotions; gratitude enhanced life motivation; gratitude reflected the level of social support; and gratitude promoted life restructuring planning. Patients with SMA have gratitude experience and their own perception of life. Strengthened feelings of gratitude could be helpful to the psychological resilience of patients, influence their view of life in a grateful way of thinking and help them actively plan all aspects of their lives, from daily living to social re-integration."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy is a severe, progressive autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder associated with neuromuscular scoliosis. When bracing is not sufficient to control the deformity, early spinal surgery is required. To the best of our knowledge, no work in the literature have assessed modifications in spinal and thigh muscles of subjects with type 2 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA2) following spinal surgery. This study aimed to better understand modifications in the spinal and thigh muscles of subjects with SMA2 and early onset scoliosis, before and after minimally invasive fusionless surgery. 20 SMA2 patients with confirmed scoliosis on bi-planar low-dose X-ray were included: 10 preoperative and 10 postoperative patients with a minimal follow-up of 5 years after surgery. The surgery consisted of a bilateral sliding rod construct extended from T1 to the sacrum, through a minimally invasive approach. All subjects had fat/water separation muscle magnetic resonance imaging from the spine to the thigh. The percentage of fat degeneration was compared before and after surgery. A quality-of-life survey was performed. Fat infiltration was diffuse and symmetric in both groups of patients, and on average six times more compared to control subjects previously published at thigh level. Adductors, sartorius, and gracilis were less affected with respectively, 51%, 56%, and 57% of fat fraction before surgery. Comparing the preoperative and postoperative groups, fat infiltration was higher in sartorius and multifidus after surgery (p < 0.05). No significant difference was found for the other muscles studied. These results did not affect quality of life. This is the first study to compare fat infiltration of spinal and thigh muscles of SMA2 patients before and after minimally invasive surgery. Our results demonstrate that muscles were globally preserved apart from multifidus and sartorius which were more affected."

    "abstract": "New paradigms of diagnosis and treatment have changed the neurodegenerative trajectory for individuals with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Registries are a critical tool to provide real-world data on treatment patterns, their effects and health care provision within this evolving paradigm of care. This study aimed to evaluate the phenotypic and genotypic landscape, treatment patterns and health impact of SMA in Australia through the national registry. This cross-sectional study investigated demographic, clinical and genetic information, sequelae of weakness, treatment patterns and patient-reported outcomes amongst individuals with SMA enrolled in the Australian Neuromuscular Disease Registry (ANMDR) from 1st January 2020 to 30th April 2023. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis and Chi-Squared or Fisher's exact tests for associations. 195 individuals with SMA enrolled into the ANMDR. 5/195 (2.6%) were deceased by censor date. Of (n = 190) individuals living with SMA, 104/190 (54.7%) were children. Minimum Australian prevalence was 0.73/100,000. <i>SMN2</i> copies were inversely associated with phenotype in those with homozygous <i>SMN1</i> deletions (<i>p < 0.0001</i>)). Treatment was utilised in 154/190 (81%) of the population, with 65/137 (47.6%) of individuals perceiving improvements with therapeutic intervention on Patient/Parent Global Impression of Improvement scale (<i>p < 0.0001</i>). Engagement with multidisciplinary care practitioners was significantly higher among children with SMA than adults (93% versus 12%, <i>p < 0.0001</i>). Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advances, mortality and the multi-systemic health impact of SMA continue to be experienced within the Australian population. Healthcare provision must align with patient-centred outcomes, adapting to meeting their changing but ongoing care requirements. The study identified the considerable unmet need for multidisciplinary care, not only for adults with SMA but also for the emerging cohort of treated children, emphasising the imperative for comprehensive healthcare provision to address their evolving needs.

    "abstract": "RNA is implicated in numerous aberrant cellular functions and disease progressions, highlighting the crucial importance of RNA-targeted drugs. To accelerate the discovery of such drugs, it is essential to develop an effective computational method for predicting RNA-small molecule affinity (RSMA). Recently, deep learning-based computational methods have been promising due to their powerful nonlinear modeling ability. However, the leveraging of advanced deep learning methods to mine the diverse information of RNAs, small molecules, and their interaction still remains a great challenge. In this study, we present DeepRSMA, an innovative cross-attention-based deep learning method for RSMA prediction. To effectively capture fine-grained features from RNA and small molecules, we developed nucleotide-level and atomic-level feature extraction modules for RNA and small molecules, respectively. Additionally, we incorporated both sequence and graph views into these modules to capture features from multiple perspectives. Moreover, a transformer-based cross-fusion module is introduced to learn the general patterns of interactions between RNAs and small molecules. To achieve effective RSMA prediction, we integrated the RNA and small molecule representations from the feature extraction and cross-fusion modules. Our results show that DeepRSMA outperforms baseline methods in multiple test settings. The interpretability analysis and the case study on spinal muscular atrophy demonstrate that DeepRSMA has the potential to guide RNA-targeted drug design.

    "abstract": "Gene therapies delivered through a single administration have revolutionized treatment possibilities for many patients living with serious or fatal conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy, hemophilia and sickle cell disease. However, shadowing the excitement about the transformational potential of many gene therapies has been widespread concern about the combination of uncertainty in the durability of their benefits over the long term and the short-term financial shock of high prices. As the healthcare payment ecosystem prepares for the growing number of gene therapies entering the market, three key interconnected challenges must be addressed: determining a fair price, managing clinical uncertainty and managing short-term budget impacts. This paper identifies specific policy reforms and market-based tools to help the US health system address these challenges to achieve more equitable and affordable access for patients to the growing number of gene therapies expected to be approved in the coming years."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to define how different force environments by neuromuscular diagnosis (hypertonic versus hypotonic) impact the growth and morphology of the proximal femoral and acetabular regions relative to typically developing children. Children with cerebral palsy and spinal muscular atrophy were compared with typically developing children aged 6 months to 11 years. Routine pelvic radiographs were evaluated using measures of hip geometry for the proximal femur and acetabulum. The data were analyzed using general linear models to estimate the developmental patterns according to age and diagnosis. One hundred eighty-four children met the inclusion criteria: 58 spastic cerebral palsy Gross Motor Function Classification System I-V (263 hips), 32 spinal muscular atrophy (79 hips)), and 94 typically developing (187 hips) were included with a mean age of 4.9 ± 3.1 years. Using spinal muscular atrophy as a reference, significant differences in proximal femoral development included long thin versus short neck (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and round versus flat epiphysis (<i>p</i> = 0.001). A thin neck-wide epiphysis was found in spinal muscular atrophy versus thick neck-small epiphysis for typically developing (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The ratio of acetabular width to proximal femoral epiphysis width differed significantly for typically developing (<i>p</i> = 0.001) compared with cerebral palsy and spinal muscular atrophy. There was a negative correlation between migration percentage and acetabular width to epiphysis width in children with cerebral palsy, but no correlation in children with spinal muscular atrophy. Hip geometry was impacted by the force environment experienced during growth. These findings emphasize the crucial roles of gross motor function, muscle tone, and strength differences in determining hip morphology. III, retrospective case control."

Mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene leads to the deficiency of SMN protein that causes SMA. The molecular alterations associated with SMA extends across the transcriptome and proteome. Although several studies have examined the transcriptomic profile of SMA, the difference in experimental settings across these studies highlight the need for a comparative meta-analysis to better understand these differences. We conducted a systematic comparative meta-analysis of publicly available gene expression data from six selected studies to elucidate variations in the transcriptomic landscape across different experimental conditions, including tissue types and mouse models. We used both microarray and RNA-seq datasets, retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress (AE). Methods included normalization, differential expression analysis, gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), network reconstruction and co-expression analysis. Differential expression analysis revealed varying numbers of differentially expressed genes ranging between zero and 1,655 across the selected studies. Notably, the Metallothionein gene Mt2 was common in several of the eight comparisons. This highlights its role in oxidative stress and detoxification. Additionally, genes such as Hspb1, St14 and Sult1a1 were among the top ten differentially expressed genes in more than one comparison. The Snrpa1 gene, involved in pre-mRNA splicing, was upregulated in the spinal cord and has a strong correlation with other differentially expressed genes from other comparisons in our network reconstruction analysis. Gene-set enrichment analysis identified significant GO terms such as contractile fibers and myosin complexes in more than one comparison which highlights its significant role in SMA. Our comparative meta-analysis identified only few genes and pathways that were consistently dysregulated in SMA across different tissues and experimental settings. Conversely, many genes and pathways appeared to play a tissue-specific role in SMA. In comparison with the original studies, reproducibility was rather weak."

Our principal objective is to describe the sociodemographic characteristics and evaluate the association between the number of <i>SMN2</i> copies and SMA type in patients from the Colombian Foundation for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (FAMECOL) database. <b>Methodology:</b> An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 201 patients with a genetic diagnosis of SMA. Data were identified, extracted, and collected from patient records provided by FAMECOL as patients registered with the association, including 201 patients from April 2013 to April 2024, when the database was delivered. Qualitative variables were described using relative and absolute frequencies, while quantitative variables were described using central tendency and dispersion measures according to their distribution. The association between the SMA type and the <i>SMN2</i> number of copies was assessed by Fisher's exact test (1 to 5 copies). <b>Results:</b> Of the 201 patients studied, 42% were female (n = 85), and 58% were male (n = 116). The median age was 9 years (IQR 4-16 years). The median age at diagnosis was 9 years (IQR 4-16), varying by subgroup: 2, 7, 14, and 41.5 years for each type, respectively. A total of 25% patients were from Antioquia (n = 51). Eighty-nine per cent had gastrostomy (n = 18). The association between the two variables was statistically significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> This study highlights SMA clinical variability and its association with the number of SMN2 copies, underscoring the importance of a personalised approach to diagnosing and managing this disease.

    "abstract": "The liver is a key metabolic organ, acting as a hub to metabolically connect various tissues. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder whereby patients have an increased susceptibility to developing dyslipidaemia and liver steatosis. It remains unknown whether fatty liver is due to an intrinsic or extrinsic impact of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein depletion. Using an adeno-associated viral vector with a liver specific promoter (albumin), we restored SMN protein levels in the liver alone in Smn<sup>2B/-</sup> mice, a model of SMA. Experiments assessed central and peripheral impacts using immunoblot, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy techniques. We demonstrate that AAV9-albumin-SMN successfully expresses SMN protein in the liver with no detectable expression in the spinal cord or muscle in Smn<sup>2B/-</sup> mice. Liver intrinsic rescue of SMN protein was sufficient to increase survival of Smn<sup>2B/-</sup> mice. Fatty liver was ameliorated while key markers of liver function were also restored to normal levels. Certain peripheral pathologies were rescued including muscle size and pancreatic cell imbalance. Only a partial CNS recovery was seen using a liver therapeutic strategy alone. The fatty liver phenotype is a direct impact of liver intrinsic SMN protein loss. Correction of SMN protein levels in liver is enough to restore some aspects of disease in SMA. We conclude that the liver is an important contributor to whole-body pathology in Smn<sup>2B/-</sup> mice.

This question is motivated by the SUNFISH trial, which investigated the effect of risdiplam on motor function in patients with spinal muscular atrophy. While the original analysis used only data generated by the trial, we explore an alternative analysis incorporating external controls from the placebo arm of a historical trial. We cast the setting into a formal causal inference framework and show how these designs are characterized by a lack of full randomization to treatment and heightened dependency on modeling. To address this, we outline sufficient causal assumptions about the exchangeability between the internal and external controls to identify the ATE and establish a connection with novel graphical criteria. Furthermore, we propose estimators, review efficiency bounds, develop an approach for efficient doubly robust estimation even when unknown nuisance models are estimated with flexible machine learning methods, suggest model diagnostics, and demonstrate finite-sample performance of the methods through a simulation study. The ideas and methods are illustrated through their application to the SUNFISH trial, where we find that external controls can increase the efficiency of treatment effect estimation."

The median radiation dose measured under the physician's lead apron and patient dose in terms of DLP was 0.20 µSv and 31.90 mGy*cm respectively. The radiation doses were significantly higher (p = 0.047) in patients with spinal instrumentation.

Despite the comprehensive investigations conducted by global scientists, effective treatments or interventions remain elusive. The time- and resource-intensive nature of the initial stages of drug research underscores the need for alternate strategies like drug repurposing. This review explores the repurposed drugs that have shown some improvement in treating SMA, including branaplam, riluzole, olesoxime, harmine, and prednisolone. The current strategy for medication repurposing, however, lacks systematicity and frequently depends more on serendipitous discoveries than on organized approaches. To speed up the development of successful therapeutic interventions, it is apparent that a methodical approach targeting the molecular origins of SMA is strictly required."

However, previous studies of this association, mainly from Europe, have yielded controversial results, suggesting possible regional differences. Here, we investigated the effect of the SMN gene in Japanese patients with ALS and LMND. We examined the SMN copy numbers and clinical histories of 487 Japanese patients with sporadic ALS (281 men; mean age at onset 61.5 years), 50 with adult LMND (50 men; mean age at onset 58.4 years) and 399 Japanese controls (171 men; mean age 62.2 years). Patients with pathogenic mutations in ALS-causing genes were excluded. SMN1 and SMN2 copy numbers were determined using the droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. The frequency of a copy number of one for the SMN2 gene was higher in patients with ALS (38.0%) than in healthy controls (30.8%) (odds ratio (OR) = 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.82, p < 0.05). The SMN2 copy number affected the survival time of patients with ALS (median time: 0 copies, 34 months; 1 copy, 39 months; 2 copies, 44 months; 3 copies, 54 months; log-rank test, p < 0.05). Cox regression analysis revealed that the SMN2 copy number was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.72-0.98, p < 0.05). Also, null SMN2 cases were significantly more frequent in the LMND group (12.0%) than in the control group (4.8%) (OR = 2.73, 95% CI = 1.06-6.98, p < 0.05).

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is characterized by low levels of the ubiquitously expressed Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein, leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Skeletal muscle satellite cells play a crucial role in muscle fiber maintenance, repair, and remodelling. While the effects of SMN depletion in muscle are well documented, its precise role in satellite cell function remains largely unclear. Using the Smn2B/- mouse model, we investigated SMN-depleted satellite cell biology through single fiber culture studies. Myofibers from Smn2B/- mice were smaller in size, shorter in length, had reduced myonuclear domain size, and reduced sub-synaptic myonuclear clusters-all suggesting impaired muscle function and integrity. These changes were accompanied by a reduction in the number of myonuclei in myofibers from Smn2B/- mice across all disease stages examined. Although the number of satellite cells in myofibers was significantly reduced, those remaining retained their capacity for myogenic activation and proliferation. These findings support the idea that a dysregulated myogenic process could be occurring as early in muscle stem cells during muscle formation and maturation in SMA. Targeting those pathways could offer additional options for combinatorial therapies for SMA."

To describe the safety and clinical efficacy of disease-modifying therapies based on <i>SMN1</i> and <i>SMN2</i> gene strategies concerning motor, respiratory, and bulbar function. Patients with SMA 1 were divided into 2 groups: those exclusively on nusinersen (group 1) and those transitioning to onasemnogene abeparvovec (OA) (group 2). Over 18 months, patients were assessed using the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) scale, developmental milestones, ventilation needs and duration, nutritional support needs, consistency of food, and signs of dysphagia. There were ten patients, divided between the groups; in group 1, the average age for starting nusinersen was 53.6 (12-115) months, and, in group 2, the age was 7 (1-12) months for nusinersen and 15.2 (10-19) months for OA. Our results indicate that 70% of patients reached some motor milestones, with group 1 increasing by 10.2 points on the CHOP-INTEND scale, while group 2 increased by 33 points. Additionally, 90% of the patients experienced no respiratory decline, and 30% maintained oral feeding. No serious adverse effects or deaths were recorded. Both groups showed improvement in motor function and stabilization of respiratory and bulbar function, with the difference between the groups possibly being related to the earlier treatment initiation. Thus, the present study provides valuable insights into the real-world safety and clinical efficacy of disease-modifying therapies for SMA 1 patients."

After flow cytometry evaluation and/or genetic diagnostics, we identified one patient with SCID, two patients with XLA, nine patients with SMA [one of whom also had Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS)], and eight patients with other medical conditions. The positive predictive values (PPVs) of NBS for SCID, XLA, and SMA were 2.44%, 2.78%, and 100%, respectively. The estimated prevalence rates in the Chinese population were 1 in 103,240 for SCID, 1 in 51,620 for XLA, and 1 in 11,471 for SMA. This study represents the first large-scale screening in mainland China using a TREC/KREC/SMN1 multiplex assay, providing valuable epidemiological data. Our findings suggest that this multiplex assay is an effective screening method for SCID, XLA, and SMA, potentially supporting the universal implementation of NBS programs across China."

    "title": "Delayed Diagnosis of Spinal Muscular Atrophy in Two Chinese Families due to Novel SMN1 Deletions.",
    "abstract": "Autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a leading cause of infant and child mortality, with homozygous deletion in exon 7 of the SMN1 gene being a major genetic cause. However, routine genetic testing methods may overlook structural variants outside of exon 7, potentially leading to misdiagnosis of SMA patients. Here, we reported two Chinese SMA patients who primarily exhibited developmental delays. Physical examinations revealed markedly reduced muscle strength and tone in their extremities, and electromyography suggested extensive neurogenic damage in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. The MLPA results indicated a single copy number of SMN1 in both patients, which is inconsistent with the typical genetic pattern of SMA. Through RNA sequencing and ultra-long read sequencing, we ultimately identified a rare structural variant involving the deletion of exons 2a-5 in both unrelated patients. This confirmed the presence of compound heterozygous variants in the SMN1 gene as the actual genetic cause. To our knowledge, this is the first case where a combination of RNA sequencing and ultra-long read sequencing has been used to diagnose SMA. We demonstrated the significant value of RNA sequencing in cases where children are highly suspected of having SMA but present negative results in routine genetic testing. This underscores the crucial role of accurate genetic testing methods in achieving early diagnosis of SMA."

Children aged 1-12 years with spastic cerebral palsy, spinal muscular atrophy types 1 and 2, or typical development were reviewed to evaluate the neck-shaft angle and head-shaft angle. Patients were divided into five groups: Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I and II, Gross Motor Function Classification System level III, Gross Motor Function Classification System levels IV and V, spinal muscular atrophy types 1 and 2, and typical development. A linear mixed model was utilized to evaluate neck-shaft angle and head-shaft angle. Data from 196 children (mean age 4.8 ± 4.5 years) were included. Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I and II: 22 children, 130 hip radiographs measured, neck-shaft angle 143.7 ± 7.4, and head-shaft angle 160.0 ± 7.1. Gross Motor Function Classification System level III: 8 children, 33 hips evaluated, neck-shaft angle 153.1 ± 4.3, and head-shaft angle 163.4 ± 4.2. Gross Motor Function Classification System levels IV and V: 30 children, 137 hip radiographs measured, neck-shaft angle 156.4 ± 5.6, and head-shaft angle 167.9 ± 6.8. Spinal muscular atrophy types 1 and 2: 32 children, 83 hip radiographs measured, neck-shaft angle 161.9 ± 9.7, and head-shaft angle 173.4 ± 7.4. Typical development: 104 children, 222 hip radiographs measured, neck-shaft angle 138.6 ± 7.0, and head-shaft angle 156.4 ± 5.9. There were significant statistical differences when comparing neck-shaft angle and head-shaft angle. As children grow, neck-shaft angle and head-shaft angle tend to decrease in typical development and Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I and II groups. However, in low-tone (spinal muscular atrophy types 1 and 2) and high-tone groups (Gross Motor Function Classification System levels IV and V), neck-shaft angle and head-shaft angle tend to increase with age. In both low-tone and high-tone groups, coxa valga is observed. When evaluating the effect of proximal femur-guided growth, these defined normal growth patterns should be considered.

    "abstract": "Molecular chaperones and co-chaperones are highly conserved cellular components that perform a variety of duties related to the proper three-dimensional folding of the proteome. The web of factors that carries out this essential task is called the proteostasis network (PN). Ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) represent an underexplored area in terms of the connections they make with the PN. The Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) complex is an assembly chaperone and serves as a paradigm for studying how specific RNAs are identified and paired with their client substrate proteins to form RNPs. SMN is the eponymous component of a large complex, required for the biogenesis of uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U-snRNPs), that localizes to distinct membraneless organelles in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of animal cells. SMN protein forms the oligomeric core of this complex, and missense mutations in the human <i>SMN1</i> gene are known to cause Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). The basic framework for understanding how snRNAs are assembled into U-snRNPs is known. However, the pathways and mechanisms used by cells to regulate their biogenesis are poorly understood. Given the importance of these processes to normal development as well as neurodegenerative disease, we set out to identify and characterize novel SMN binding partners. We carried out affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) of <i>Drosophila</i> SMN complexes using fly lines exclusively expressing either wildtype or SMA-causing missense alleles. Bioinformatic analyses of the pulldown data, along with comparisons to proximity labeling studies carried out in human cells, revealed conserved connections to at least two other major chaperone systems including heat shock folding chaperones (HSPs) and histone/nucleosome assembly chaperones. Notably, we found that heat shock cognate protein Hsc70-4 and other HspA family members preferentially associated with SMA-causing alleles of SMN. Hsc70-4 is particularly interesting because its mRNA is aberrantly sequestered by a mutant form of TDP-43 in mouse and <i>Drosophila</i> ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) disease models. Most important, a missense allele of Hsc70-4 (HspA8 in mammals) was recently identified as a bypass suppressor of the SMA phenotype in mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that chaperone-related dysfunction lies at the etiological root of both ALS and SMA."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by reduced expression of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. In addition to motor neuron survival, SMN deficiency affects the integrity and function of afferent synapses that provide glutamatergic excitatory drive essential for motor neuron firing and muscle contraction. However, it is unknown whether deficits in the metabolism of excitatory amino acids and their precursors contribute to neuronal dysfunction in SMA. To address this issue, we measured the levels of the main neuroactive D- and L-amino acids acting on glutamatergic receptors in the central nervous system of SMNΔ7 mice as well as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SMA patients of varying severity before and after treatment with the SMN-inducing drug Nusinersen. Our findings reveal that SMN deficiency disrupts glutamate and serine metabolism in the CSF of severe SMA patients, including decreased concentration of L-glutamate, which is partially corrected by Nusinersen therapy. Moreover, we identify dysregulated L-glutamine to L-glutamate conversion as a shared neurochemical signature of altered glutamatergic synapse metabolism that implicates astrocyte dysfunction in both severe SMA patients and mouse models. Lastly, consistent with a correlation of higher CSF levels of D-serine with better motor function in severe SMA patients, we show that daily supplementation with the NMDA receptor co-agonist D-serine improves neurological deficits in SMNΔ7 mice. Altogether, these findings provide direct evidence for dysregulation of D- and L-amino acid metabolism linked to glutamatergic neurotransmission in severe SMA and have potential implications for treating this neurological disorder."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) involve the progressive loss of neuronal structure or function in the brain and spinal cord. Despite their diverse etiologies, NDs manifest similar pathologies. Emerging research identifies vascular defects as a previously neglected hallmark of NDs. The development and popularization of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have significantly advanced our understanding of brain vascular cell types and their molecular characteristics, including gene expression changes at the single-cell level in NDs. These unprecedented insights deepen our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying NDs. However, the occurrence and role of vascular defects in disease progression remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically summarize recent advances in the structure and organization of the central nervous system vasculature in mice, healthy individuals, and patients with NDs, focussing primarily on disease-specific alterations in vascular cell types or subtypes. Combining scRNA-seq with pathology evidence, we propose that vascular defects, characterized by disruptions in cell types and structural integrity, may serve as common early features of NDs. Finally, we discuss several pathways through which vascular defects in NDs lead to neuronal degeneration. A deeper understanding of the causes and contributions of vascular defects to NDs aids in elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms and developing meaningful therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "We investigated myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform expression at early postnatal stages of clinically and genetically confirmed spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA1) patients, in order to study the muscle fibre differentiation compared to age-matched controls at single fibre level. Open skeletal muscle biopsies were performed from the quadriceps muscle in four SMA1 patients and three age-matched controls. Standard techniques were used for immunohistochemistry of embryonic and foetal MyHCs. Type I, IIa and IIx MyHCs were assessed by applying quadruple immunofluorescence. Western blot was performed to analyse the amount of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein in the muscle samples. There were profound and early alterations in MyHC expression from 7 days of life compared to age-matched controls. The expression of type IIx MyHC was completely lost in SMA1 and instead developmental isoforms remained highly expressed. Foetal MyHC was still, at 3.5 months of age, expressed in the majority of muscle fibres in SMA1 patients, whereas it was completely downregulated in age-matched controls. The level of SMN protein was reduced in all SMN1 patients. The abnormal pattern of MyHC expression in postnatal stages of SMA1 was observed early in the newborn period, which may have implications for the effects of gene therapy, since there are clear clinical benefits from early treatment. Whether such aberrant and delayed expression of MyHCs can be completely restored by postnatal gene therapy remains to be studied and may also have implications for new phenotypes that will evolve with new therapies."

    "abstract": "Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are motor neuron disorders that demonstrate overlapping clinical features, especially in the early stage. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the utility of chest tomography (CT) imaging in distinguishing between SBMA and ALS. This was a retrospective study reviewing CT images from patients with SBMA and sporadic ALS and those in the control group. The CT images were assessed to measure the diameter and morphology of glandular tissue associated with gynecomastia. We compared CT-measured gynecomastia between the SBMA, ALS, and control groups. Additionally, correlation analyses were performed between the quantitative measurements of gynecomastia obtained from CT scans and various clinical/laboratory parameter in the SBMA group. 15 chest CT images were collected from SBMA, 41 from ALS, and 29 from control group. No statistical differences were observed in BMI, functional scales, or age at the time of CT scans between the SBMA and ALS groups. Despite similar functional scales and age in both groups, the mean glandular tissue diameter of breast tissue observed in chest CT imaging differed significantly between SBMA, ALS, and controls: 32.22 ± 12.57 mm, 15.91 ± 4.81 mm, and 15.76 ± 7.26 mm, respectively. This disparity allowed for the differentiation of SBMA from ALS and controls with statistical significance. Clinical gynecomastia was 80%, while radiological gynecomastia was 93.3% in SBMA. A significantly higher prevalence of diffuse glandular morphology pattern in SBMA (50%) was observed, contrasting with the predominance of nodular morphology in ALS and controls (9.1% and 20%). Correlative analysis between glandular tissue diameter and other clinical/laboratory parameters within the SBMA group showed no specific finding. CT-based radiological gynecomastia effectively differentiated SBMA from ALS. These findings support the usefulness of radiological gynecomastia as a potential differential diagnostic marker for SBMA, especially in the early stages."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a degenerative neuromuscular disorder leading to muscle hypotonia, weakness, and respiratory and bulbar impairment. Infants with SMA have an increased risk of respiratory tract infections (RTI) including severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. Therefore, guidelines for the treatment of SMA recommend RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab for patients aged below two years who have compromised motor functions (\"non-sitters\"). Since palivizumab is not approved for RSV prophylaxis in SMA patients in Switzerland, payers usually do not grant cost approvals for this indication. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the frequency of severe RTI among SMA patients focusing on RSV infections requiring hospital treatment and to determine the long-term impact of RSV infections on the natural history of SMA. A single-centre cohort study at the tertiary paediatric Neuromuscular Centre Zurich, Switzerland, including data of SMA patients with a genetic-based therapy initiated below two years of age between May 2019 and December 2022. All hospitalisations were analysed with a focus on severe RTI and especially RSV infections, and their impact on nutritional and respiratory function. The costs of inpatient treatment of RSV infections were determined and compared with estimated expenses for RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab. 12 SMA patients (median age at treatment initiation: 3.5 months, range: 0-17 months) were followed for a cumulative period of 25.75 years (7 SMA type 1; 5 SMA type 2 including one presymptomatic individual). With an incidence rate of 2.34 per patient-year, the risk of severe RTI was especially high in SMA type 1 (versus 0.1 in SMA type 2, p = 0.044). A total of 37 hospitalisations (279 hospital days) was necessary for the treatment of RTI in general; 9 of them were attributed to RSV infections (in 5 SMA type 1 patients; 84 hospital days). Only 3/12 SMA patients had received seasonal RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab. No RSV infections requiring hospital treatment occurred in patients while receiving seasonal RSV prophylaxis. During RTI, nutritional support had to be commonly initiated and continued after discharge. In 3/7 SMA type 1 patients, non-invasive ventilation was started during acute treatment for RTI and continued to the end of follow-up. We observed a high risk of RTI, especially RSV infections, among young SMA patients. Failure to adhere to established care protocols, for example by omitting RSV prophylaxis, may be linked to a heightened risk of morbidity in these children."

    "abstract": "The spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) phenotype strongly correlates with the SMN2 gene copy number. However, the severity and progression of the disease vary widely even among affected individuals with identical copy numbers. This study aimed to investigate the impact of genetic variability in oxidative stress, inflammatory, and neurodevelopmental pathways on SMA susceptibility and clinical progression. Genotyping for 31 genetic variants across 20 genes was conducted in 54 SMA patients and 163 healthy controls. Our results revealed associations between specific polymorphisms and SMA susceptibility, disease type, age at symptom onset, and motor and respiratory function. Notably, the TNF rs1800629 and BDNF rs6265 polymorphisms demonstrated a protective effect against SMA susceptibility, whereas the IL6 rs1800795 was associated with an increased risk. The polymorphisms CARD8 rs2043211 and BDNF rs6265 were associated with SMA type, while SOD2 rs4880, CAT rs1001179, and MIR146A rs2910164 were associated with age at onset of symptoms after adjustment for clinical parameters. In addition, GPX1 rs1050450 and HMOX1 rs2071747 were associated with motor function scores and lung function scores, while MIR146A rs2910164, NOTCH rs367398 SNPs, and GSTM1 deletion were associated with motor and upper limb function scores, and BDNF rs6265 was associated with lung function scores after adjustment. These findings emphasize the potential of genetic variability in oxidative stress, inflammatory processes, and neurodevelopmental pathways to elucidate the complex course of SMA. Further exploration of these pathways offers a promising avenue for developing personalized therapeutic strategies for SMA patients."

To understand the phenotypic and molecular differences between SMARD1 and CMT2S, and the role of IGHMBP2 in disease development, we generated mouse models based on six IGHMBP2 patient mutations. Previously, we reported the development and characterization of Ighmbp2<sup>D564N/D564N</sup> mice and in this manuscript, we examine two mutations: D565N (D564N in mice) and H924Y (H922Y in mice) in the Ighmbp2<sup>H922Y/H922Y</sup> and Ighmbp2<sup>D564N/H922Y</sup> contexts. We found significant differences between these mouse models, providing critical insight into the role of IGHMBP2 in the pathogenesis of SMARD1 and CMT2S. Importantly, these studies also demonstrate how disease pathogenesis is significantly altered in the context of Ighmbp2 D564N and H922Y homozygous recessive and compound heterozygous mutations. Notably, there were short-lived and long-lived lifespan cohorts within Ighmbp2<sup>D564N/H922Y</sup> mice with early (P12/P16) respiratory pathology serving as a key predictor of lifespan. Despite differences in lifespan, motor function deficits initiated early and progressively worsened in all Ighmbp2<sup>D564N/H922Y</sup> mice. There was decreased limb skeletal muscle fiber area and increased neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation in Ighmbp2<sup>D564N/H922Y</sup> mice. Consistent with CMT2S, Ighmbp2<sup>H922Y/H922Y</sup> mice did not have altered lifespans nor respiratory pathology. Interestingly, Ighmbp2<sup>H922Y/H922Y</sup> limb muscle fibers demonstrated an increase in muscle fiber area followed by a reduction while changes in NMJ innervation were minimal even at P180. This is the first study that demonstrates differences associated with IGHMBP2 function within respiration with those within limb motor function. Significant to our understanding of IGHMBP2 function, we demonstrate that there is a direct correlation between disease pathogenesis associated with these IGHMBP2 patient mutations and IGHMBP2 biochemical activity. Importantly, these studies reveal the dynamic differences that are presented when either a single mutant protein is present (IGHMBP2-D564N or IGHMBP2-H922Y) or two mutant proteins are present (IGHMBP2-D564N and IGHMBP2-H922Y) within cells."

    "abstract": "Inherited pediatric motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and the spinal cord. These diseases can manifest as early as infancy and originate from inherited pathogenic mutations in known genes. Key clinical features of MNDs include muscle weakness, hypotonia, and atrophy due to the degeneration of lower motor neurons or spasticity, hypertonia, and hyperreflexia caused by upper motor neuron dysfunction. The course of the disease varies among individuals and is influenced by the specific subtype. We performed a non-systematic, narrative clinical review, employing a systematic methodology for the literature search and article selection to delineate the features of hereditary pediatric motor neuron diseases. The growing availability of advanced molecular testing, such as whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS), has expanded the range of identified genetic factors. These advancements provide insights into the genetic complexity and underlying mechanisms of these disorders. As more MND-related genes are discovered, the accumulating genetic data will help prioritize promising candidate genes for future research. In some cases, targeted treatments based on specific genetic mechanisms have already emerged, underscoring the critical role of early and timely diagnosis in improving patient outcomes. Common MNDs include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and bulbar spinal muscular atrophy. This narrative clinical review covers the clinical presentation, genetics, molecular features, and pathophysiology of inherited pediatric MNDs."

The term \"SMA\" usually refers to the most common form, 5q-SMA, which is caused by biallelic mutations in <i>SMN1</i> (located on chromosome 5q13). However, long before the discovery of <i>SMN1</i>, it was known that other forms of SMA existed. Therefore, SMA is currently divided into two groups: 5q-SMA and non-5q-SMA. This is a simple and practical classification, and therapeutic drugs have only been developed for 5q-SMA (nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec, risdiplam) and not for non-5q-SMA disease. We conducted a non-systematic critical review to identify the characteristics of each SMA disease. Many of the non-5q-SMA diseases have similar symptoms, making DNA analysis of patients essential for accurate diagnosis. Currently, genetic analysis technology using next-generation sequencers is rapidly advancing, opening up the possibility of elucidating the pathology and treating non-5q-SMA.

Numerous clinical conditions may cause ARF, including pneumonia, obstructive lung diseases (e.g., asthma), restrictive diseases such as neuromuscular diseases (e.g., spinal muscular atrophy and muscular dystrophy), and albeit rarely, interstitial lung diseases. Children, especially infants, may be more vulnerable to ARF than adults due to anatomical and physiological features of the respiratory system. Assessing respiratory impairment in the pediatric population is particularly challenging as children frequently present difficulties in reporting symptoms and due to compliance and cooperation in diagnostic tests. The evaluation of clinical and anamnestic aspects represents the cornerstone of ARF diagnosis: first level exams (e.g., arterial blood gas analysis) confirm and evaluate the severity of the ARF and second level exams help to uncover the underlying cause. Prompt management is critical, with supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and the treatment of the underlying problem. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the current state of the art in diagnosing pediatric ARF, with a focus on pathophysiology, novel imaging applications, and new perspectives, such as biomarkers and artificial intelligence."

Currently, it is the leading cause of infantile mortality worldwide. SMA is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with \"continuum of clinical severity\", which can be modulated by genetic and epigenetic factors known as disease modifiers (DMs). Individuals (even siblings) with the same defects in <i>SMN1</i> gene might have strikingly different types of SMA, supposedly due to the impact of DMs. There are several therapeutic options for SMA, all of them focusing on the restoration of the SMN protein levels to normal. Determining DMs and the pathways in which they are involved might aid in enhancing existing curative approaches. Furthermore, DMs might become novel therapeutic targets or prognostic biomarkers of the disease. This narrative review provides a brief overview of the genetics and pathobiology of SMA, and its bona fide modifiers. We describe novel, emerging DMs, approaches and tools used to identify them, as well as their potential mechanisms of action and impact on disease severity.

This study evaluates the effect of combined neuromuscular electrical stimulation (Comb-NMES) on skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and inflammatory signaling within the acute phase of SCI. We applied a novel Comb-NMES regimen, integrating both high-frequency resistance and low-frequency aerobic protocols on the vastus lateralis muscle, to participants early post-SCI. Muscle biopsies were analyzed for CSA and inflammatory markers pre- and post-intervention. The results suggest a potential preservation of muscle CSA in the Comb-NMES group compared to a control group. Inflammatory signaling proteins such as TLR4 and Atrogin-1 were downregulated, whereas markers associated with muscle repair and growth were modulated beneficially in the Comb-NMES group. The study's findings suggest that early application of Comb-NMES post-SCI may attenuate inflammatory pathways linked to muscle atrophy and promote muscle repair. However, the small sample size and variability in injury characteristics emphasize the need for further research to corroborate these results across a more diverse and extensive SCI population."

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relatively common and invariably fatal, paralyzing motor neuron disease for which there are few treatment options. ALS is frequently associated with ubiquitin-positive motor neuronal aggregates, a pathology suggestive of perturbed proteostasis. Indeed, cellular chaperones, which are involved in protein trafficking and degradation often underlie familial ALS. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a second, common paralytic condition resulting from motor neuron loss and muscle atrophy. While SMA is now effectively treated, mechanisms underlying motor neuron degeneration in the disease remain far from clear. To address mechanistic questions about SMA, we recently identified a genetic modifier of the disease. The factor, a G470R variant in the constitutively expressed cellular chaperone, Hspa8, arrested motor neuron loss, prevented the abnormal accumulation of neurofilament aggregates at nerve terminals and suppressed disease. Hspa8 is best known for its role in autophagy. Amongst its many clients is the ALS-associated superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein. Given its suppression of the SMA phenotype, we tested potential disease-mitigating effects of Hspa8<sup>G470R</sup> in a mutant SOD1 mouse model of ALS. Unexpectedly, disease in mutant SOD1 mice expressing the G470R variant was aggravated. Motor performance of the mice deteriorated, muscle atrophy worsened, and lifespan shrunk even further. Paradoxically, SOD1 protein in spinal cord tissue of the mice was dramatically reduced. Our results suggest that Hspa8 modulates the ALS phenotype. However, rather than mitigating disease, the G470R variant exacerbates it."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> This study aimed to examine intra- and inter-rater reliability of a myotonometer (MyotonPRO) in measuring upper and lower extremity mechanical properties in children with spinal muscular atrophy types I and II. <b>Methods:</b> Biceps brachii, triceps brachii, rectus femoris, and gastrocnemius muscle tone and stiffness in children (<i>n</i> = 21) were measured using the MyotonPRO device. Examiner 1 performed two sets of measurements in 60 min to determine intra-rater reliability. Examiner 2 performed measurements between Examiner 1's sets. Intra-interclass correlation coefficient, minimal detectable change, and standard error of measurement values were calculated to assess intra- and inter-rater reliabilities in this cross-sectional study. <b>Results:</b> The results showed excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability analyses for frequency and stiffness values except for the stiffness value of the gastrocnemius muscle, which presented good reliability (ICC = 0.71). Minimal detectable change values ranged from 0.59 to 1.98 Hz for muscle tone and 16.08 to 124.74 N/m for stiffness (for both intra- and inter-rater reliabilities). <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings indicate that MyotonPRO is a reliable tool for quantifying upper and lower extremity mechanical properties within one session in children with spinal muscular atrophy types I and II. Mechanical properties of the extremity muscle can be determined using this easily applied tool in future studies."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a life-limiting paediatric motor neuron disease characterised by lower motor neuron loss, skeletal muscle atrophy and respiratory failure, if untreated. Revolutionary treatments now extend patient survival. However, a limited understanding of the foundational neuropathology challenges the evaluation of therapeutic success. As opportunities to study treatment-naïve tissue decrease, we have characterised spinal cord pathology in severe infantile SMA using gold-standard techniques, providing a baseline to measure treatment success and therapeutic limitations. Detailed histological analysis, stereology and transmission electron microscopy were applied to post-mortem spinal cord from severe infantile SMA patients to estimate neuron number at the end of life; characterise the morphology of ventral horn, lateral horn and Clarke's column neuron populations; assess cross-sectional spinal cord area; and observe myelinated white matter tracts in the clinically relevant thoracic spinal cord. Ventral horn neuron loss was substantial in all patients, even the youngest cases. The remaining ventral horn neurons were small with abnormal, occasionally chromatolytic morphology, indicating cellular damage. In addition to ventral horn pathology, Clarke's column sensory-associated neurons displayed morphological features of cellular injury, in contrast to the preserved sympathetic lateral horn neurons. Cellular changes were associated with aberrant development of grey and white matter structures that affected the overall dimensions of the spinal cord. We provide robust quantification of the neuronal deficit found at the end of life in SMA spinal cord. We question long-accepted dogmas of SMA pathogenesis and shed new light on SMA neuropathology out with the ventral horn, which must be considered in future therapeutic design."

    "abstract": "New treatments for 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) have led to changes in the disease phenotype. Questions about long-term efficacy, however, persist. We present the results from five-year follow-up of the first ten Norwegian patients with SMA type1 treated with nusinersen. - Ten patients referred to the expanded access program were included. Standardized assessments with Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND), the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE-2), compound muscle action potential (CMAP) examination and cerebrospinal fluid analysis of neurofilament light chain (cNfL) were performed. Age at baseline ranged from three months to 11 years and eight months. Nine patients were alive and continued to receive treatment at 62 months of follow-up. CHOP INTEND scores increased significantly up to 38 months. Any further increase from 38 to 50 months was not statistically significant, and scores remained almost unchanged from 50 to 62 months. HINE-2 scores increased but the difference from baseline never reached statistical significance. The youngest patients showed the best motor outcome. The changes in CMAP scores were not statistically significant. cNfL values were significantly reduced after 18 months compared with baseline; the largest difference occurred between baseline and 6 months. There was a significant negative correlation between log cNfL and CHOP INTEND (p = 0.042). Bulbar and respiratory function did not improve during the observation period. Our findings support previously reported results on efficacy and safety of nusinersen. All patients have shown improvement in motor function. The need of respiratory and nutritional support did not improve."

However, limited research has been conducted on lumbosacral multifidus muscle injuries in elderly individuals undergoing MISS for lumbar spinal canal stenosis. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of single-channel and double-channel MISS on the multifidus muscle in elderly patients. A total of 107 patients who underwent MISS were stratified into two cohorts: group A (<65 years) and group B (≥65 years). Preoperative imaging data, including magnetic resonance imaging, were gathered to classify the degree of stenosis based on the nerve root compression. The extent of multifidus muscle atrophy and fat infiltration was assessed by calculating the fat-free cross-sectional area (FCSA)/cross-sectional area (CSA) ratio before and after surgery through measurements of CSA and FCSA. Total cross-sectional area/FCSA were calculated using MRI cross-sectional T2WI. The degree of atrophy and fat infiltration did not change between procedures in group A (<i>P</i>>.05), but changed significantly in group B (<i>P</i><.05). Unilateral single-channel and double-channel surgery had no significant effect on the degree of multifidus muscle atrophy and fat infiltration in patients younger than 65 years. However, in patients 65 years and older, the degree of multifidus muscle atrophy and fat infiltration significantly increased with the increasing incidence of lateral recess stenosis, which was positively correlated with the duration of surgery.

Aim of this study is therefore a population-based analysis of all patients with SMA treated with OA across Germany, Austria and Switzerland (D-A-CH). This observational study included individuals with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) treated with OA in 29 specialized neuromuscular centers in the D-A-CH-region. A standardized data set including WHO gross motor milestones, SMA validated motor assessments, need for nutritional and respiratory support, and adverse events was collected using the SMArtCARE registry and the Swiss-Reg-NMD. Outcome data were analyzed using a prespecified statistical analysis plan including potential predictors such as age at GAT, <i>SMN2</i> copy number, past treatment, and symptom status. 343 individuals with SMA (46% male, 54% female) with a mean age at OA of 14.0 months (range 0-90, IQR 20.0 months) were included in the analysis. 79 (23%) patients were clinically presymptomatic at the time of treatment. 172 (50%) patients received <i>SMN2</i> splice-modifying drugs prior to GAT (risdiplam: n = 16, nusinersen: n = 154, both: n = 2). Functional motor improvement correlated with lower age at GAT, with the best motor outcome in those younger than 6 weeks, carrying 3 <i>SMN2</i> copies, and being clinically presymptomatic at time of treatment. The likelihood of requiring ventilation or nutritional support showed a significantly increase with older age at the time of GAT and remained stable thereafter. Pre-treatment had no effect on disease trajectories. Liver-related adverse events occurred significantly less frequently up to 8 months of age. All other adverse events showed an even distribution across all age and weight groups. Overall, motor, respiratory, and nutritional outcome were dependent on timing of GAT and initial symptom status. It was best in presymptomatic children treated within the first six weeks of life, but functional motor scores also increased significantly after treatment in all age groups up to 24 months. Additionally, OA was best tolerated when administered at a young age. Our study therefore highlights the need for SMA newborn screening and immediate treatment to achieve the best possible benefit-risk ratio. The SMArtCARE and Swiss-Reg-NMD registries are funded by different sources (see acknowledgements)."

    "title": "Treatment preferences in spinal muscular atrophy: A swing weighting study for caregivers of patients with SMA types 1 and 2.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy. Patients with SMA types 1 and 2 develop severe disabilities conferring substantial patient and caregiver burden. Caregiver treatment characteristic preferences are useful for informing treatment choices and improving adherence. We aimed to identify drivers of SMA treatment preference from the perspective of caregivers of patients with SMA types 1 or 2 in the United States. We quantified the relative importance of different treatment characteristics and compared preferences for hypothetical treatment scenarios. Treatment attributes and attribute levels elicited were based on a literature search and interviews with caregivers and health care professionals. The most important treatment characteristics from the perspective of health care professionals and caregivers were identified and used in a survey to quantify relative importance for caregivers. Caregivers completed surveys regarding their preferences using swing weighting methodology. These results were used to estimate the relative value of four hypothetical SMA treatment scenarios exploring different modes of treatment administration. The swing weighting survey, completed by 20 caregivers, demonstrated that the attributes driving treatment preference were reduction in permanent ventilation needs and risk of severe adverse events, followed by treatment access (including cost coverage and availability), increased ability to sit without support, and less treatment administration burden. The hypothetical SMA treatment scenarios with the highest relative value offered an easier mode of administration, lowest risk of severe adverse events, less need of permanent ventilation, and highest ability of patients to feed and sit without support. Our findings suggest that caregivers prefer a treatment with reduced clinical burden and risk in which the cost is covered and treatment is available in the short term. These results can provide important contextual information for decision-makers and help promote patient-centered care for patients with SMA."

This study addresses the scarcity of research on novel disease-modifying therapies for SMA in Latin America by reporting a real-world experience in Southern Brazil. This is a single-center historical cohort that included all patients diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy at a Regional Reference Service for rare diseases. Eighty-one patients were included, of whom 7 died during follow-up. Of the remaining 74 patients, 5.4 % were classified as pre-symptomatic, 24.3 % with SMA type 1, 28.4 % with type 2, 36.5 % with type 3, and 5.4 % with type 4. The mean follow-up time ranged from 1.8 years for pre-symptomatic cases to 8.7 years for SMA types 2 and 3. Approximately 42 % of these patients received specific disease-modifying therapy, of these, 96.8 % received Nusinersen, with 19.4 % transitioning to gene therapy using Onasemnogene Abeparvovec, and 6.4 % starting Risdiplam. Most patients with SMA type 1 were on disease-modifying treatment, whereas only slightly over a third of patients with type 2 and about 10 % of type 3 were receiving such treatments. Among treated patients, 80 % demonstrated improvement in motor performance during the follow-up, with a lesser therapeutic response being associated with late initiation of treatment and low motor function scores at baseline. This real-world study reinforces the effectiveness of disease-modifying therapies for SMA in Brazil within the context of low- and middle-income countries, which is greater the earlier and the better the patient's functional status."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy is a rare neurodegenerative disorder in children which leads untreated to muscle wasting, respiratory impairments, and a shortened life expectancy. Parents as primary caregivers are often physically and psychologically burdened. In recent years, new and promising treatment options have been approved, but it remains unclear if they have an impact on the psychosocial situation of affected families. The aim of this study was to explore the views and experiences of parents as informal caregivers of children with SMA in the course of the disease against the background of new treatment options (Spinraza® or Zolgensma®). We conducted qualitative interviews with 27 parents of children with SMA treated with Spinraza® and Zolgensma® from April to September 2020. The analysis was done using thematic analysis and reported according to the COREQ criteria. The data analysis resulted in three main themes: a) caregiver burden and negative consequences for families, b) resources and protective aspects, c) psychosocial care needs. The results are discussed against the background of new treatment options and previous models of supportive care needs. Parental caregivers of affected children face multiple burdens in different stages of the child's disease progression. Although new treatment options for SMA showed observable effects for most parents, the main caregiver burden and reported symptoms were attributable to the overburdening care tasks. To unburden families, more screening for unmet needs, family-centered help services, professional caregivers, childcare, and sufficient financial support are needed."

    "abstract": "Sm-ring assembly is important for the biogenesis, stability, and function of uridine-rich small nuclear RNAs (U snRNAs) involved in pre-mRNA splicing and histone pre-mRNA processing. Sm-ring assembly is cytoplasmic and dependent upon the Sm-site sequence and structural motif, ATP, and <i>Survival motor neuron</i> (SMN) protein complex. While RNAs other than U snRNAs were previously shown to associate with Sm proteins, whether this association follows Sm-ring assembly requirements is unknown. We systematically identified Sm-sites within the human and mouse transcriptomes and assessed whether these sites can accept Sm-rings. In addition to snRNAs, Sm-sites are highly prevalent in the 3' untranslated regions of long messenger RNAs. RNA immunoprecipitation experiments confirm that Sm-site containing mRNAs associate with Sm proteins in the cytoplasm. In modified Sm-ring assembly assays, Sm-site containing RNAs, from either bulk polyadenylated RNAs or those transcribed <i>in vitro</i> , specifically associate with Sm proteins in an Sm-site and ATP-dependent manner. In cell and animal models of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), mRNAs containing Sm-sites are downregulated, suggesting reduced Sm-ring assembly on these mRNAs may contribute to SMA pathogenesis. Together, this study establishes that Sm-site containing mRNAs can accept Sm-rings and identifies a novel mechanism for Sm proteins in regulation of cytoplasmic mRNAs."

This pilot study evaluates acceptability, validity and clinical relevance of Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) to monitor spontaneous movement recovery in early onset SMA patients after GT. Clinical assessments including CHOPINTEND score (the gold standard motor score for infants with SMA) and IMU measurements were performed before (M0) and repeatedly after GT. Inertial data was recorded during a 25-min spontaneous movement task, the child lying on the back, without (10 min) and with a playset (15 min) wearing IMUs. Two commonly used parameters, norm acceleration 95th centile (||A||_95) and counts per minute (||A||_CPM) were computed for each wrist, elbow and foot sensors. 23 SMA-patients were included (mean age at diagnosis 8 months [min 2, max 20], 19 SMA type 1, three type 2 and one presymptomatic) and 104 IMU-measurements were performed, all well accepted by families and 84/104 with a good child participation (evaluated with Brazelton scale). ||A||_95 and ||A||_CPM showed high internal consistency (without versus with a playset) with interclass correlation coefficient for the wrist sensors of 0.88 and 0.85 respectively and for the foot sensors of 0.93 and 0.91 respectively. ||A||_95 and ||A||_CPM were strongly correlated with CHOPINTEND (r for wrist sensors 0.74 and 0.67 respectively and for foot sensors 0.61 and 0.68 respectively, p-values < 0.001). ||A||_95 for the foot, the wrist, the elbow sensors and ||A||_CPM for the foot, the wrist, the elbow sensors increased significantly between baseline and the 12 months follow-up visit (respective p-values: 0.004, < 0.001, < 0.001, 0.006, < 0.001, < 0.001). IMUs were well accepted, consistent, concurrently valid, responsive and associated with unaided sitting acquisition especially for the elbow sensors. This study is the first reporting a large set of inertial sensor derived data after GT in SMA patients and paves the way for IMU-based follow-up of SMA patients after treatment."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare, genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by insufficient production of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Diminished SMN protein levels lead to motor neuron loss, causing muscle atrophy and weakness that impairs daily functioning and reduces quality of life. SMN upregulators offer clinical improvements and increased survival in SMA patients, although significant unmet needs remain. Myostatin, a TGF-β superfamily signaling molecule that binds to the activin II receptor, negatively regulates muscle growth; myostatin inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing muscle. Combining myostatin inhibition with SMN upregulation, a comprehensive therapeutic strategy targeting the whole motor unit, offers promise in SMA. Taldefgrobep alfa is a novel, fully human recombinant protein that selectively binds to myostatin and competitively inhibits other ligands that signal through the activin II receptor. Given a robust scientific and clinical rationale and the favorable safety profile of taldefgrobep in patients with neuromuscular disease, the RESILIENT phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is investigating taldefgrobep as an adjunct to SMN upregulators in SMA (NCT05337553). This manuscript reviews the role of myostatin in muscle, explores the preclinical and clinical development of taldefgrobep and introduces the phase 3 RESILIENT trial of taldefgrobep in SMA."

Although not routinely recorded, it is known that persons with SMA are affected to varying degrees. Detecting differences in bite and tongue force, endurance, and maximum mouth opening has become particularly promising since the introduction of causal therapy for SMA. This study aimed to compare oral function among adult persons with SMA with different SMA types, walking abilities, and treatment status to a healthy control group. Data from oral function tests conducted on 58 persons with SMA and 45 healthy individuals were analyzed. Differences in oral function between SMA subgroups were pairwise tested and compared to the healthy control group using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. In an overall comparison, three out of five oral function tests revealed lower values for the SMA group compared to the control group. Subgroup analyses indicated lower scores for most oral function tests in non-ambulatory, untreated patients with SMA type 2 compared to controls. Ambulatory, treated patients with SMA type 3 achieved strength and endurance values comparable to those of healthy individuals. The impairment of oral function varies across persons with SMA. Routine measurement of oral function is warranted to determine individual bulbar involvement stages. Further evaluation should be scheduled if indicators such as restricted maximum mouth opening arise. Trial registration DRKS, DRKS00015842.

The dependent variable was the willingness to pay for this disease screening test. The independent variables included sociodemographic, economic, and health characteristics, the history of this disease or other diseases of the person and family, and knowledge about this disease in the included population. Logistic regression was utilized to identify independent variables associated with the dependent variable, and the results were reported as unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and P values with 95% CIs. A questionnaire was used as a research tool, and STATA 17 software was used for data analysis. The monetary value of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) screening was calculated by estimating willingness to pay using the congenital valuation method. In total, 578 women were included. About 64.85% of respondents had a willingness to pay for SMA screening as the dependent variable, with a mean of $526. University education (<i>P</i> = 0.009) and pregnancy experience (<i>P</i> = 0.021) were associated with the dependent variable. Iranian women expressed their willingness to undergo screening tests, but due to financial constraints, they expected the government and nongovernmental organizations to bear most of the cost."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic variants of the <i>Survival Motor Neuron 1</i> gene (<i>SMN1</i>) that affects approximately 1 in 15,000 live births. Availability of 3 SMN-enhancing treatments for SMA has led to urgency to review how clinicians and patients use these treatments for SMA, while additional research and real-world data and experience are being collected. This work describes important factors to assist with decision-making for SMN-enhancing treatments. A systematic literature review was conducted on SMN-enhancing treatments for SMA and related studies. A working group of American and European health care providers with expertise in SMA care identified barriers and developed recommendations through a modified Delphi technique with serial surveys and feedback through virtual meetings to fill gaps for information where evidence is limited. A community working group of an individual living with SMA and caregivers provided insight and perspective on SMA treatments and support through a virtual meeting to guide recommendations. The health care provider working group and the community working group agreed that when determining whether to start, change, add, or discontinue a treatment, essential considerations include patient and family/caregiver perspective, and treatment safety and side effects. When initiating treatment for patients newly diagnosed with SMA, important patient characteristics are age and <i>Survival Motor Neuron 2</i> gene <i>(SMN2)</i> copy number. Furthermore, when initiating, changing, or adding treatment, current clinical status and comorbidities drive decision-making. When considering a medication or treatment plan change, unless there is an urgent indication, a treatment and associated patient outcomes should be monitored for a minimum of 6-12 months. When determining a treatment plan with an adolescent or adult with SMA, consider factors such as quality of life, burden vs benefit of treatment, and reproductive issues. Access to care coordination and interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary care are essential to treatment success. Sharing information about current knowledge of treatments and shared decision-making between health care providers and patients living with SMA and caregivers are essential to overcoming barriers to providing SMN-enhancing treatments."

Demographic data, laboratory parameters, QCT data, and data on spinal radiographs were collected. A linear regression model was carried out to explore the correlations between BMD and its related factors. Sixty-six patients with SMA who had complete records between July 2017 and July 2023 were analyzed, with SMA with a mean age of 5.4 years (range, 2.4-9.7 years), including type 1 in 14, type 2 in 37, and type 3 in 15. 28.8% of patients (19/66) were diagnosed with low BMD (Z-scores ≤ - 2), and the mean BMD Z-scores on QCT was - 1.5 ± 1.0. In our model, BMD Z-scores was associated with age (β=-0.153, p = 0.001). SMA phenotype and serum bone metabolism markers, such as serum phosphorus (P), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and 25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) levels did not independently predict low BMD. ROC analysis showed that the age ≥ 6.3 years predicts a Z-scores ≤ -2.0 with a sensitivity of 68.4% and a specificity of 68.1%. Low BMD were highly prevalent in children with SMA without disease-modifying treatment in our centre. Regular monitoring of BMD is necessary for all types of SMA children, especially those aged ≥ 6.3 years."

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by variants in the SMN1 gene, leading to progressive muscle weakness. The carrier frequency of SMN1 gene variants, including variant and copy number variations, is estimated to be around 1 in 50 people, while the global prevalence of SMA is 1-3 per 10,000 live births. In response to the increasing carrier proportion, especially due to consanguineous marriages, Turkey launched the SMA Carrier Screening Program in 2021. Notably, recent SMA cases have been observed in the children of healthcare workers who did not undergo carrier screening, prompting us to evaluate their awareness of this program. After receiving ethics approval, 1,322 healthcare professionals completed a 15-item survey based on the SMA Carrier Screening Guidelines. Of these, 5.8% were unaware of SMA, and 26% lacked information about the national screening program. Awareness of the screening program was significantly lower among secondary and tertiary healthcare professionals compared to primary healthcare professionals (p < 0.0001) and among non-physician healthcare professionals compared to physicians (p < 0.0001). Additionally, a serious lack of knowledge was observed concerning the parts of the screening covering the pregnancy period. Although there is generally high awareness of the SMA Carrier Screening Program among healthcare professionals, significant knowledge gaps exist. These findings highlight the need for increased efforts to more effectively deliver screening programs and continue the education of healthcare professionals. Education and awareness campaigns can enhance program awareness and effectiveness, reach wider audiences, and contribute to preventive measures for the health of future generations."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder caused by SMN1 gene mutations. Although studies on available disease-modifying treatments have reported their efficacy and safety, long-term natural history data are lacking for comparison. The aim of this prospective study was to report 4-year changes on the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) in type II and III SMA in relation to several variables such as age, functional status and SMN2 copy number. The study involves retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from international datasets (Belgium, Italy, Spain, USA, UK). HFMSE longitudinal changes were analyzed using linear mixed effect models, examining annualized HFMSE change and its association with variables such as age at baseline, sex, motor function, SMN2 copy number. In SMA type II (n = 226), the 4-year mean change was -2.20 points. The largest mean changes were observed in sitters aged 5-14 years and the lowest in those who lost the ability to sit unsupported. In SMA type III (n = 162), the 4-year mean change was -2.75 points. The largest mean changes were in those aged 7-15 years, whilst the lowest were in those below 7 and in the SMA type IIIa subgroup over 15. Age and score at baseline were predictive of 4-year changes. Our findings provide natural history reference data for comparison with long-term follow-up of clinical trials or real-world data, highlighting the need to define patterns of changes in smaller SMA subgroups instead of reporting mean changes across an entire SMA cohort."

    "title": "CRISPR-Cas9 guided RNA-based model for the silencing of spinal bulbar muscular atrophy: A functional genetic disorder.",
    "abstract": "This study explores a novel therapeutic approach for spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the Androgen Receptor (AR) gene. The aim is to investigate the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 technology in targeting the mutant AR gene to inhibit its production. The objectives include assessing the accuracy and efficacy of CRISPR-Cas9 guided RNAs in silencing the mutant gene and evaluating the feasibility of this approach as a treatment for SBMA. Computational and in-silico approaches are used to evaluate the feasibility of using CRISPR-Cas9 technology for treating SBMA. Computational analysis is used to design CRISPR-Cas9 guided RNAs targeting the mutant AR gene, assessing their on-target and off-target scores, GC content, and structural accuracy. In-silico simulations predict the potential therapeutic outcomes of the CRISPR-Cas9 approach in an artificial environment. Three guided RNA (gRNA) sequences were designed using the CHOPCHOP tool, targeting specific regions of the AR gene with high efficiency and 100% match. These gRNAs demonstrated effective targeting with minimal off-target scores and optimal GC content. Additionally, lentiCRISPR v2 plasmids were designed for the delivery of CRISPR materials, enabling high-efficiency multiplex genome editing of the AR gene. Thermodynamic ensemble predictions indicated favorable secondary structure stability of the designed gRNAs, further supporting their suitability for gene editing. The evaluation of designed gRNAs confirmed their strong binding ability to the target sequences, validating their potential as effective tools for genome editing. The study highlights the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 technology for targeting the Androgen Receptor gene associated with spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). The findings support the feasibility of this approach for gene editing and suggest further exploration in preclinical and clinical settings. Recommendations include continued research to optimize CRISPR-Cas9 delivery methods and enhance specificity for therapeutic applications in SBMA."

    "title": "Profiling neuroinflammatory markers and response to nusinersen in paediatric spinal muscular atrophy.",
    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is an emerging clinical feature in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Characterizing neuroinflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in SMA and their response to nusinersen is important for identifying new biomarkers and understanding the pathophysiology of SMA. We measured twenty-seven neuroinflammatory markers in CSF from twenty SMA children at different time points, and correlated the findings with motor function improvement. At baseline, MCP-1, IL-7 and IL-8 were significantly increased in SMA1 patients compared to SMA2, and were significantly correlated with disease severity. After six months of nusinersen treatment, CSF levels of eotaxin and MIP-1β were markedly reduced, while IL-2, IL-4 and VEGF-A were increased. The decreases in eotaxin and MIP-1β were associated with changes in motor scores in SMA1. We also detected a transient increase in MCP-1, MDC, MIP-1α, IL-12/IL-23p40 and IL-8 after the first or second injection of nusinersen, followed by a steady return to baseline levels within six months. Our study provides a detailed profile of neuroinflammatory markers in SMA CSF. Our data confirms the potential of MCP-1, eotaxin and MIP-1β as new neuroinflammatory biomarkers in SMA1 and indicates the presence of a subtle inflammatory response to nusinersen during the early phase of treatment."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare inherited autosomal recessive progressive disease of a varying phenotype, with varying clinical symptoms, and as a result the patients suffering from it require multiple types of care. It was deemed useful to conduct a systematic literature review on the pharmacoeconomic evaluations of all currently registered disease-modifying therapies in order to inform policy and highlight research gaps. Pharmacoeconomic analyses written in English and published after 2016 were considered for inclusion. PubMed/Medline, Global Health and Embase were systematically and separately searched between 16 October and 23 October 2023. Hand-searching was also conducted on PubMed based on reference lists of published literature. After the exclusion criteria were applied, 14 studies were included. BMJ checklist was used for quality assessment and the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist was used to assess the quality of reporting of all included studies. Data extraction was performed manually. Regarding evidence synthesis, data were heterogeneous and are thus presented based on comparison. This study confirms the need for pharmacoeconomic analyses (cost-effectiveness or cost-utility) also in cases when the cost of treatment is very high and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio values exceed the usual, acceptable values for standard therapy. Specific willingness to pay thresholds for orphan medicines are of the utmost importance, to allow patients with SMA to have access to safe and effective treatments. With such economic evaluations, it is possible to compare the value of medications with the same indication, but it should be emphasized that in the interpretation of data and in making decisions about the use of medicines, the impact of new knowledge should be considered."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder of mainly early onset and variable severity. Prior to the introduction of disease modifying therapies (DMTs), children with SMA type 1 typically died before 2 years of age and management was primarily palliative. Onasemnogene abeparvovec (OA), nusinersen, and risdiplam are novel DMTs which ameliorate the effects of the underlying genetic defect at least partially making SMA a treatable condition. Survival and achievement of previously unmet developmental milestones result in treated SMA type 1 children spending more time upright than expected based on the natural history of the treatment-naïve condition. Consequently, spinal asymmetry and kyphosis, features not typically seen in untreated SMA type 1 children due to early mortality, are increasingly common complications. Precise data regarding their prevalence, severity, and management are currently limited. This study describes the spinal features and management in 75 children with SMA type 1 who received OA between March 2021 and December 2022. Retrospective analysis from SMA REACH UK data showed that 44/75 (59 %) clinically had spinal asymmetry and 37 (49 %) had kyphosis. This study aims to raise awareness of this important feature as part of the changed natural history of SMA type 1 post OA treatment."

    "abstract": "Rare diseases affect almost 500 million people globally, predominantly impacting children and often leading to significantly impaired quality of life and high treatment costs. While significant contributions have been made to develop effective treatments for those with rare diseases, more rapid drug discovery strategies are needed. Therapeutic antisense oligonucleotides can modulate target gene expression with high specificity through various mechanisms determined by base sequences and chemical modifications; and have shown efficacy in clinical trials for a few rare neurological conditions. Therefore, this review will focus on the applications of antisense oligonucleotides, in particular splice-switching antisense oligomers as promising therapeutics for rare neurological diseases, with key examples of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. Challenges and future perspectives in developing antisense therapeutics for rare conditions including target discovery, antisense chemical modifications, animal models for therapeutic validations, and clinical trial designs will also be briefly discussed."

    "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease type 5 (McArdle disease) leads to a deficiency in the activity of myophosphorylase resulting in an impaired glucose utilization. The disease can be caused by a variety of mutations in the PYGM gene, and its typical clinical manifestation is muscles weakness within the first three decades of life. In this case report we present the diagnostic work-up of a physically active 78-year-old Caucasian patient suffering from a 2-year history of progressive camptocormia including clinical, radiologic, histological, and genetic tests. There was no history of neuro-muscular diseases in the family. Serum CK levels were moderately increased while other blood/urine parameters were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging showed fatty remodeling of the muscles of the back. Histochemical examination of a muscle biopsy revealed the absence of myophosphorylase activity, while gene analysis identified a known early-onset McArdle mutation in the PYGM gene. This case highlights that the clinical spectrum of PYGM gene mutation typically manifest during adolescence, but it is also a differential diagnosis in late onset muscle disorders and emphases the investigation of the role of ACE inhibitors in this disease."

    "abstract": "While prompt identification and treatment of infants with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) can ameliorate outcomes, variability persists. This study assessed management and outcomes of early-treated infants with SMA. We analyzed retrospective data at 12 centers on infants with SMA treated at age ≤6 weeks from August 2018 to December 2023. Sixty-six patients, 35 with two SMN2 copies and 31 with ≥3 SMN2 copies, were included. Twenty-five (38%, 22 with two SMN2 copies), had SMA findings before initial treatment which was onasemnogene abeparvovec in 47 (71%) and nusinersen in 19 (29%). Thirty-two received sequential or combination treatments, including 16 adding nusinersen or risdiplam due to SMA findings following onasemnogene abeparvovec. All sat independently. Compared to children with ≥3 SMN2 copies, those with two SMN2 copies were less likely to walk (23/34 [68%] vs. 31/31 [100%], p < .001) and less likely to walk on time (9/34 [26%] vs. 29/31 [94%], p < .001); one non-ambulatory child was <18 months old and was excluded from this analysis. No patients required permanent ventilation or exclusively enteral nutrition; six required nocturnal non-invasive ventilation and four utilized supplemental enteral nutrition, all with two SMN2 copies. Early treatment of infants with SMA can improve outcomes as indicated by our cohort, all of whom sat independently and are without permanent ventilation. However, our study demonstrates ongoing disability in most children with two SMN2 copies despite early monotherapy and emphasizes the need for additional research, including earlier monotherapy, initial combination therapy, prenatal treatment, and non-SMN modifying treatments."

We aimed to assess the endocrine profile in a cohort of adults with SMA. Second, we compared body composition and endocrine profiles between nonambulatory and ambulatory patients and between different types of SMA. The cross-sectional study included 29 SMA patients (18 [62.1%] males and 11 [37.9%] females) of median age 44 (IQR 30-51.5) years with type 2, 3, or 4. Body composition was measured by bioimpedance. Morning blood samples were drawn for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, testosterone, cortisol, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Blood glucose, insulin, and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) were measured during a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. The homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance index was calculated. In total, 75.9% of patients had increased fat mass (FM), with 51.7% having an increase despite normal body mass index. Ambulation was the most important discriminating factor of body composition. 93.1% of patients had metabolic abnormalities, including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Increased BHB, a marker of ketosis, was present in more than a third of patients. Functional hypogonadism was present in half of male patients. Testosterone and IGF-1 negatively correlated with FM. Adult patients with SMA had abnormal body composition and highly prevalent metabolic disturbances that might increase cardiometabolic risk. Because treatments have modified the course of SMA, it is important to investigate whether these observations translate into clinically relevant outcomes."

    "title": "Recent Advance in Disease Modifying Therapies for Spinal Muscular Atrophy.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy of skeletal muscles. With homozygous survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene mutation, all SMA patients have at least one copy of the SMN2 gene, which provides an opportunity for drug targeting to enhance SMN expression. Current three disease modifying drugs, including nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec, and risdiplam, have demonstrated impressive effectiveness in SMA treatment. Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide targeting SMN2 pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) to modify alternative splicing and is effective in SMA children and adults, administrating via intermittent intrathecal injection. Onasemnogene abeparvovec is an adeno-associated viral vector carrying human SMN1 gene, featuring intravenous injection once in a lifetime for SMA patients less than 2 years of the age. Risdiplam is a small molecule also targeting SMN2 pre-mRNA and is effective in SMA children and adults with administration via oral intake once per day. Patients with SMA should receive these disease modifying therapies as soon as possible to not only stabilize disease progression, but potentially obtain neurological improvement. The development in these therapies has benefited patients with SMA and will potentially provide insight in future drug discovery for other neurodegenerative diseases.

    "abstract": "Persons with spinal muscular atrophy (pwSMA) report progressive muscle weakness but also reduced endurance when performing repetitive tasks in daily life, referred to as \"performance fatigability\" (PF). Data regarding the effects of the new disease-modifying drugs on PF are scarce. Thus, our main objective was to examine PF in adult ambulatory pwSMA treated long-term with nusinersen. Six-minute walk test (6MWT) data from 14 adult pwSMA treated with nusinersen for up to 70 months were retrospectively analyzed to determine PF. Performance fatigability was defined as the percentage change in the distance covered between the last and first minute of the 6MWT. In addition, relationships between PF and other clinical features were assessed. Performance fatigability was found in 12/14 pwSMA (85.7%) prior to treatment. The mean distance walked in the sixth minute (71.1 m) was shorter than the distance covered in the first minute (81.8 m), corresponding to a mean PF of 13.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.5-19.6, p = .0007). During treatment with nusinersen, there was a mean reduction in PF of 5.6% (95% CI: -10.0 to -1.3, p = .0148). We found no relationship between PF and fatigue as measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale. This study demonstrates the presence of PF as an independent component of motor impairment and as a potential therapeutic target in our cohort of adult ambulatory pwSMA. Furthermore, the observations in our cohort suggest that nusinersen may have a beneficial effect on PF."

    "abstract": "An 8-year-old neutered male Bengal cat was referred because of a 1-year history of progressive and relapsing generalized muscle weakness and muscle atrophy. Before referral, the cat was treated with immunosuppressive doses of oral prednisolone, intermittently for 6 mo, and had responded well when the immunosuppressive dose was maintained. Generalized paresis, diffuse muscle atrophy, and diminished spinal reflexes were present in all limbs, consistent with a generalized lower motor neuron disease. Histopathologic evaluation of muscle biopsies confirmed a pattern of muscle fiber atrophy consistent with chronic and severe denervation. No specific abnormalities were identified in the nerve biopsy or within intramuscular nerve branches. A presumptive antemortem diagnosis of an adult-onset motor neuron degeneration resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or spinal muscle atrophy was suspected. However, given the response to immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids, an autoimmune process or other degenerative process could not be definitively excluded. Key clinical message: In this case, an adult cat had a chronic, progressive history of lower motor neuron weakness and absent spinal reflexes; biopsies revealed a neurogenic pattern of muscle fiber atrophy and histologically normal peripheral nerve and intramuscular nerve branches. Although reports of motor neuron disease are rare in the veterinary literature, this case report highlights the importance of muscle and nerve biopsies that lead to a presumptive diagnosis of motor neuron degeneration."

With new therapeutics, objective methods with increased sensitivity are needed to assess muscle function. Ultrasound imaging is a promising approach for assessing muscle fat and fibrosis in neuromuscular disorders. This study builds on prior work by combining ultrasound-based measurements of muscle size, shape, and quality, relating these measures to muscle strength, and proposing a multivariable image-based estimate of muscle function. Maximum voluntary elbow flexion torque of 36 participants (SMA, DMD, and healthy controls) was measured by hand-held dynamometry and elbow flexor muscles were imaged using ultrasound. Muscle size (cross-sectional area, maximum Feret diameter or width, and thickness), quality (echogenicity, texture anisotropy index), and cross-sectional shape (diameter ratio) were measured. Multivariable regression was used to select ultrasound measurements that predict elbow flexion torque. Significant differences were observed in muscle size (decreased), shape (thinned), and quality (decreased) with increased disease severity and compared to healthy participants. CSA (brachioradialis R<sup>2</sup> = 0.51), maximum Feret diameter (biceps R<sup>2</sup> = 0.49, brachioradialis R<sup>2</sup> = 0.58) and echogenicity (brachioradialis R<sup>2</sup> = 0.61) were most correlated with torque production. Multivariable regression models identified that muscle size (CSA, maximum Feret diameter) and quality (echogenicity) were both essential to predict elbow flexion torque (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.65). A multivariable approach combining muscle size and quality improves strength predictions over single variable approaches. These methods present a promising avenue for the development of sensitive and functionally relevant biomarkers of neuromuscular disease."

Two male children with complicated SMA diagnosed at the Children's Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics respectively in July 2021 and April 2022 due to delayed or retrograde motor development were selected as the study subjects. Clinical data of the children were collected. Primary culture of skin fibroblasts was carried out, and peripheral blood samples were collected from both children and their parents. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, combined long-range PCR and nested PCR, and Sanger sequencing were carried out to detect the copy number and variants of the SMN1 gene. Absolute quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to determine the transcriptional level of the SMN gene, expression of the SMN protein, and the number of functional SMN protein complexes (gems body), respectively. This study was approved by the Children's Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics (Ethics No. SHERLLM2021009). Child 1, a 1-year-old boy, was clinically diagnosed with type 1 SMA. Child 2, a 2-and-a-half-year-old boy, was clinically diagnosed with type 3 SMA. Both children were found to harbor a paternally derived SMN1 deletion and a maternally derived SMN1 gene variant, namely c.824G>T (p.Gly275Val) and c.884A>T (p.*295Leu). Compared with the normal controls and carriers, the levels of full-length SMN1 transcripts in their peripheral blood and skin fibroblast cell lines were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), and the levels of SMN protein normalized to that of β-actin, and the numbers of gems bodies in the primary fibroblast cells were also significantly lower (P < 0.05). Based on the guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, both variants were classified as likely pathogenic (PS3+PM3+PM5+PP3; PS3+PM3+PM4+PP3). Following the diagnosis, both children had received nusinersen treatment. Although their motor function was improved, child 1 still died at the age of 2 due to severe pulmonary infection. The walking ability of child 2 was significantly improved, and his prognosis appeared to be good. Two cases of clinically complicated SMA have been confirmed by genetic testing and experimental studies, which has provided a reference for their accurate treatment."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the second most common fatal genetic disease in infancy. It is caused by deletion or intragenic pathogenic variants of the causative gene SMN1, which degenerates anterior horn motor neurons and leads to progressive myasthenia and muscle atrophy. Early treatment improves motor function and prognosis in patients with SMA, but drugs are expensive and do not cure the disease. Therefore, carrier screening seems to be the most effective way to prevent SMA birth defects. In this study, we genetically analyzed 1400 samples using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and compared the consistency of the results. We randomly selected 44 samples with consistent MLPA and qPCR results for comprehensive SMA analysis (CASMA) using a long-read sequencing (LRS)-based approach. CASMA results showed 100% consistency, visually and intuitively explained the inconsistency between exons 7 and 8 copy numbers detected by MLPA in 13 samples. A total of 16 samples showed inconsistent MLPA and qPCR results for SMN1 exon 7. CASMA was performed on all samples and the results were consistent with those of resampling for MLPA and qPCR detection. CASMA also detected an additional intragenic variant c.-39A>G in a sample with two copies of SMN1 (RT02). Finally, we detected 23 SMA carriers, with an estimated carrier rate of 1/61 in this cohort. In addition, CASMA identified the \"2 + 0\" carrier status of SMN1 and SMN2 in a family by analyzing the genotypes of only three samples (parents and one sibling). CASMA has great advantages over MLPA and qPCR assays, and could become a powerful technical support for large-scale screening of SMA."

Current therapies improve patient outcomes but achieve no definite cure, prompting renewed efforts to better understand disease mechanisms. The calcium channel blocker flunarizine improves motor function in <i>Smn</i>-deficient mice and can help uncover neuroprotective pathways. Murine motor neuron-like NSC34 cells were used to study the molecular cell-autonomous mechanism. Following RNA and protein extraction, RT-qPCR and immunodetection experiments were performed. The relationship between flunarizine mRNA targets and RNA-binding protein GEMIN5 was explored by RNA-immunoprecipitation. Flunarizine increases demethylase <i>Kdm6b</i> transcripts across cell cultures and mouse models. It causes, in NSC34 cells, a temporal expression of GEMIN5 and KDM6B. GEMIN5 binds to flunarizine-modulated mRNAs, including <i>Kdm6b</i> transcripts. <i>Gemin5</i> depletion reduces <i>Kdm6b</i> mRNA and protein levels and hampers responses to flunarizine, including neurite extension in NSC34 cells. Moreover, flunarizine increases the axonal extension of motor neurons derived from SMA patient-induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, immunofluorescence studies of spinal cord motor neurons in <i>Smn</i>-deficient mice reveal that flunarizine modulates the expression of KDM6B and its target, the motor neuron-specific transcription factor HB9, driving motor neuron maturation.

    "abstract": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is a form of cell death distinct from accidental cell death (ACD) and is also referred to as regulated cell death (RCD). Typically, PCD signaling events are precisely regulated by various biomolecules in both spatial and temporal contexts to promote neuronal development, establish neural architecture, and shape the central nervous system (CNS), although the role of PCD extends beyond the CNS. Abnormalities in PCD signaling cascades contribute to the irreversible loss of neuronal cells and function, leading to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize the molecular processes and features of different modalities of PCD, including apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, cuproptosis, and other novel forms of PCD, and their effects on the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), multiple sclerosis (MS), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and stroke. Additionally, we examine the key factors involved in these PCD signaling pathways and discuss the potential for their development as therapeutic targets and strategies. Therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting the inhibition or facilitation of PCD signaling pathways offer a promising approach for clinical applications in treating neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy type 3 (juvenile SMA, Kugelberg-Welander disease) is a genetic disease caused by changes in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN) gene. However, there is increasing evidence of metabolic abnormalities in SMA patients, such as altered fatty acid metabolism, impaired glucose tolerance, and defects in the functioning of muscle mitochondria. Given that data in the literature are scarce regarding this subject, the purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of glucose and lipid metabolism disorders in adult patients with SMA type 3. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 23 adult patients with SMA type 3 who underwent a comprehensive evaluation, including a physical examination, biochemical analysis, and an oral glucose tolerance test during 2020-2023. At least one lipid abnormality was observed in 60.8% of patients. All four lipid parameters were atypical in 4.3% of patients, three lipid parameters were abnormal in 21.7% of patients, and two lipid parameters were altered in 8.7% patients. A total of 91.3% of SMA3 patients met the HOMA-IR criteria for insulin resistance, with 30.43% having impaired glucose tolerance. None of the patients met the criteria for a diagnosis of overt DM2. The prevalence of dyslipidemia and altered glucose metabolism in our study sets apart the adult population with SMA3 from the general population, confirming a significant interplay between muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. Ensuring metabolic care for aging patients with SMA 3 is crucial, as they are vulnerable to metabolic derangements and cardiovascular risks."

This study evaluated the cost-utility of onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi gene therapy and risdiplam for SMA in Thailand. A Markov model was used to analyze the lifetime costs and outcomes of these treatments compared with standard of care for symptomatic SMA types 1 and 2-3. SMA type 1 patients were treated with one of either onasemnogene or risdiplam, while SMA types 2-3 patients received risdiplam. Data on disease progression and medical costs were sourced from hospital databases, while treatment efficacy was based on clinical trials. Interviews with patients and caregivers provided data on non-medical costs and utilities. Base case cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analyses were conducted, with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculated in US dollars (USD) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, against a willingness-to-pay threshold of 4444 USD/QALY gained. For SMA type 1, the ICERs for onasemnogene and risdiplam were 163,102 and 158,357 USD/QALY gained, respectively. For SMA types 2-3, the ICER for risdiplam was 496,704 USD/QALY gained. While onasemnogene and risdiplam exceeded the value-for-money threshold of the Thai healthcare system, they yielded the highest QALY gains among all approved medications. Policy-makers should incorporate various pieces of evidence alongside the cost-effectiveness results for rare diseases with costly drugs. Additionally, cost-effectiveness findings are useful for price negotiations and alternative financial funding, which allows policy-makers to seek solutions to ensure patient access, aligning with universal health coverage principles in Thailand."

    "title": "Paradoxical metabolic acidosis after vomiting in children with spinal muscular atrophy: A report of 9 patients.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a hereditary neuromuscular disease that progresses toward restrictive respiratory failure due to muscle paralysis. We observed that SMA patients presented with a specific clinical and laboratory profile, consisting of severe metabolic acidosis following an episode of mild vomiting. This is an unusual, little-known, and life-threatening situation for these patients, as hyperventilation induced by metabolic acidosis can lead to exhaustion and to death by mixed acidosis. The aim of our study was to describe this paradoxical acidosis after vomiting in SMA patients and to discuss the physiological basis of this condition. We conducted a retrospective single-center study reviewing the clinical and laboratory data of SMA patients who were hospitalized in the intensive care unit for severe metabolic acidosis after vomiting. Our cohort comprised 11 cases. On arrival, the median pH of the patients was 7.23 with a median bicarbonate concentration of 11.7 mmol/L and almost half of them (45 %) had ketone bodies in the blood and/or urine. The median correction time was 24 h for pH and 48 h for bicarbonate concentrations after receiving intravenous hydration with a glucose solution. We suggest that SMA patients are particularly sensitive to ketoacidosis induced by fasting, even after a few episodes of mild vomiting. Moreover, they have a low buffering capacity due to their severe amyotrophy, which favors metabolic acidosis. They must be quickly hydrated through a glucose-containing solution to avoid exhaustion, mixed acidosis, and death."

    "abstract": "Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a rare X-linked recessive motor neuron degenerative disease. Due to the lack of specificity in its early clinical manifestations, SBMA is easily misdiagnosed. Herein, we present a case in which SBMA was misdiagnosed as polymyositis. A 58-year-old patient began to develop symptoms of limb weakness 20 years ago and was admitted to the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University 10 years ago without special treatment. Two years ago, the above symptoms worsened and he was admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The patient was misdiagnosed as polymyositis. According to the gene mutation characteristics of SBMA, the patient was diagnosed with SBMA. The result of the Kennedy gene test was positive, and the patient was diagnosed with Kennedy disease. After the diagnosis of SBMA, the patient was given symptomatic treatment to alleviate the condition. Conservative treatment after discharge was requested. It is recommended that patients avoid bucking to prevent complications. This is a case of milder SBMA being misdiagnosed as polymyositis. For patients with weak limbs, the possibility of SBMA should be considered."

    "abstract": "The introduction of newborn screening (NBS) for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has increased the early diagnosis of 5q-associated SMA in presymptomatic and symptomatic preterm infants. National and international recommendations for treating preterms and newborns < 38 weeks of gestational age are unavailable. Our retrospective multicentre study aimed to evaluate the postnatal clinical course of preterm infants with 5q-associated SMA diagnosed since the implementation of NBS in Germany in 2021 and to summarize the German experience regarding the decision-making process for available treatment regimens for preterm infants with ≤ 3 survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) copies. Twelve preterm infants with 5q-associated SMA and a mean gestational age of 34.0 weeks (range: 26.1-36.8) and birth weight of 2022 g (range: 645-3370) were reported from 8/20 German SMA NBS follow-up centers using a pseudonymized questionnaire. Confirmatory diagnosis, including SMN2 copy number, was completed on average on postnatal day 13. All patients had a biallelic deletion of exon 7 or exons 7 and 8 of the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, with SMN2 copy numbers of two in 10 patients and three in two patients. The neonatal course was complicated by respiratory distress due to prematurity (n = 2), sepsis (n = 2), and jaundice (n = 2). At birth, 11 preterm infants (91.6%) were presymptomatic. However, the neurological status of one patient deteriorated at five weeks of age (postconceptional age of 41.8 weeks) prior to the start of treatment. Disease-modifying treatments were initiated in all patients at a mean postconceptional age of 38.8 weeks, with the majority receiving onasemnogene abeparvovec (83.3%, including 2 patients with prior risdiplam bridge therapy). Notably, consensus among participating experts from German neuromuscular centers resulted in 83.3% of patients receiving disease-modifying treatment at term. Premature infants with SMA require interdisciplinary care in close collaboration with the neuromuscular center. SMA NBS facilitates early initiation of disease-modifying therapy, ideally during the presymptomatic phase, which significantly influences the prognosis of the newborn."

    "title": "An early Transcriptomic Investigation in Adult Patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Under Treatment with Nusinersen.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare degenerative disorder with loss of motor neurons caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene. Nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide, was approved for SMA treatment to compensate the deficit of the encoded protein SMN by modulating the pre-mRNA splicing of SMN2, the centromeric homologous of SMN1, thus inducing the production of a greater amount of biologically active protein. Here, we reported a 10-month transcriptomics investigation in 10 adult SMA who received nusinersen to search for early genetic markers for clinical monitoring. By comparing their profiles with age-matched healthy controls (HC), we also analyzed the changes in miRNA/mRNAs expression and miRNA-target gene interactions possibly associated with SMA. A multidisciplinary approach of HT-NGS followed by bioinformatics/biostatistics analysis was applied. Within the study interval, those SMA patients who showed some clinical improvements were characterized by having the SMN2/SMN1 ratio slightly increased over the time, while in the stable ones the ratio decreased, suggesting that the estimation of SMN2/SMN1 expression may be an early indicator of nusinersen efficacy. On the other hand, the expression of 38/147 genes/genetic regions DE at T0 between SMA and HC like TRADD and JUND resulted \"restored\" at T10. We also confirmed the dysregulation of miR-146a(-5p), miR-324-5p and miR-423-5p in SMA subjects. Of interest, miR-146a-5p targeted SMN1, in line with experimental evidence showing the key role of astrocyte-produced miR-146a in SMA motor neuron loss. Molecular pathways such as NOTCH, NF-kappa B, and Toll-like receptor signalings seem to be involved in the SMA pathogenesis."

To understand the diagnostic process of Korean patients with SMA, we analyzed their clinical characteristics and challenges. We conducted a retrospective study of 38 patients with SMA (9 type II and 29 type III) between January 2000 and September 2023. Clinical, laboratory, and genetic data were reviewed. The median ages at symptom onset and diagnosis were 3.0 years [interquartile range (IQR): 1.0-7.3 years] and 25.0 years (IQR: 10.5-37.3 years), respectively. The median diagnostic delay was 19.6 years (IQR: 6.4-31.0 years). A significantly longer delay was observed in SMA type III patients (median: 21.0 years, IQR: 11.0-31.0 years) compared to SMA type II patients (median: 3.0 years, IQR: 0.9-21.0 years) (<i>p</i>=0.021).

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), identified over a century ago, is characterized by severe muscle wasting and early mortality. Despite its rarity, the high carrier frequency of the responsible genetic mutations and the variability in its manifestations make it a significant research focus. This prospective cross-sectional descriptive study evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) across eight health domains in 43 Romanian SMA patients treated with nusinersen, using the SF-36 questionnaire to analyze influencing factors. The survey was conducted online with informed consent, and the data were analyzed using MedCalc software, employing both parametric and non-parametric statistical tests for accurate interpretation. The results revealed significant variations in HRQoL. Most patients were non-ambulatory (74.4%), reflecting SMA's impact on mobility. Urban residents reported better outcomes, particularly in physical functioning (<i>p</i> = 0.014), which may be attributed to improved access to healthcare services. Younger participants (under 14), represented by proxy responses, noted better general health (<i>p</i> = 0.0072) and emotional well-being (<i>p</i> = 0.0217) compared to older participants. These findings suggest that younger patients or their proxies perceive a better health status, highlighting the need for age-specific approaches in SMA management and the potential optimistic bias associated with proxy reporting on perceived health outcomes."

We aimed to assess the short-term safety and efficacy of gene therapy (onasemnogene abeparvovec; Zolgensma) on respiratory function in SMA-1 patients ventilated via tracheostomy pre-gene therapy. A prospective cohort study included 22 patients. Patients were weaned off ventilation for at least 8 h daily by optimizing ventilator settings and duration, using cough augmentation, managing excessive airway secretions, enhancing nutrition, screening for respiratory bacterial colonization, and treating infections. Gene therapy was administered at a median age of 26 (Q1: 18, Q3: 43) months with a mean follow-up period of 7.64 (SD: 6.50) months. Gene therapy was safe and effective in resolving paradoxical breathing, improving cough ability, reducing airway secretions, and enhancing CHOP-INTEND scores. The clinical assessment and management implemented pre-gene therapy were effective in safely weaning patients for at least 8 h off ventilation daily. Gene therapy at a late age was safe and effective over the short-term period; however, long-term follow-up is recommended. In conjunction with gene therapy, high-quality clinical care is beneficial and should be paired with gene therapy."

    "abstract": "Most individuals with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) on disease-modifying therapies continue to have chronic motor impairment. Insights into brain involvement in SMA may open new pathways for adjunctive therapies to optimize outcomes. We aimed to characterize macrostructural brain abnormalities detected by MRI in individuals with SMA compared with peer controls. We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study of children and adults with a confirmed genetic diagnosis of 5q SMA, and peer controls matched by age and sex. Brain MRIs acquired on a 3T MRI scanner through a standardized research protocol were reviewed to qualitatively assess the presence of macrostructural changes. The primary outcome was the presence of any structural brain anomaly on MRI. In addition, the total volume of each participant's lateral ventricles was quantified by volumetry using MRIcron. Genetic and clinical variables, including <i>SMN2</i> copy number and motor function (Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded and Revised Upper Limb Module scores), were then correlated with neuroimaging findings. A total of 42 participants completed the study (mean age 17.4, range 7-40; 67% male). Of the 21 individuals with 5q SMA, 9 (43%) had macrostructural brain abnormalities identified on MRI compared with 2 of 21 (10%) peer controls (odds ratio 7.1, 95% confidence interval 1.4-34.0). In patients with SMA, the most common structural changes were widening of the arachnoid spaces (n = 4) and ventriculomegaly (n = 4). Individuals with SMA had larger median lateral ventricular volume than their normally developing peers (9.3 mL, interquartile range [IQR] 5.5-13.1 vs 5.3 mL, IQR 3.8-9.8; <i>p</i> = 0.034). Structural brain abnormalities were more frequent in those with 2 <i>SMN2</i> copies (3/5, 60%) compared with 3 or 4 <i>SMN2</i> copies (4/10, 40% and 2/6, 33% respectively), not reaching significance. We found no association between structural changes and motor function scores. Individuals with SMA have higher rates of macrostructural brain abnormalities than their neurotypical peers, suggesting CNS involvement in SMA. Understanding changes in the brain architecture of the SMA population can inform the development of adjunct therapies targeting the CNS and potentially guide rehabilitation strategies."

    "title": "The spinal muscular atrophy gene product regulates actin dynamics.",
    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by low levels of the Survival of Motoneuron (SMN) protein. SMN interacts with and regulates the actin-binding protein profilin2a, thereby influencing actin dynamics. Dysfunctional actin dynamics caused by SMN loss disrupts neurite outgrowth, axonal pathfinding, and formation of functional synapses in neurons. Whether the SMN protein directly interacts with and regulates filamentous (F-) and monomeric globular (G-) actin is still elusive. In a quantitative single cell approach, we show that SMN loss leads to dysregulated F-/G-actin fractions. Furthermore, quantitative assessment of cell morphology suggests an F-actin organizational defect. Interestingly, this is mediated by an interaction of SMN with G- and F-actin. In co-immunoprecipitation, in-vitro pulldown and co-localization assays, we elucidated that this interaction is independent of the SMN-profilin2a interaction. Therefore, we suggest two populations being relevant for functional actin dynamics in healthy neurons: SMN-profilin2a-actin and SMN-actin. Additionally, those two populations may influence each other and therefore regulate binding of SMN to actin. In SMA, we showed a dysregulated co-localization pattern of SMN-actin which could only partially rescued by SMN restoration. However, dysregulation of F-/G-actin fractions was reduced by SMN restoration. Taken together, our results suggest a novel molecular function of SMN in binding to actin independent from SMN-profilin2a interaction."

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS), characterized by trisomy of chromosome 21, and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder, are individually recognized distinct entities. Their co-occurrence in clinical practice is rare and has not been extensively reported. We present a case of a three-month-old, female child who presented with respiratory failure necessitating intubation. Due to typical facial features and congenital heart disease, DS was confirmed with chromosomal analysis. However, subsequent recurrent chest and bloodstream infections, failure to extubate, and laboratory abnormalities raised the suspicion of accompanying immune disorder with DS. To investigate this, whole exome sequencing analysis was sent, and it revealed a homozygous pathogenic mutation in the SMA type 1 gene in the patient. This rare intersection of two unique genetic conditions presents diagnostic challenges due to overlapping clinical features like hypotonia and delay in motor skills, which can be progressive in both situations. Additionally, the clinical trajectory, therapeutic interventions, and outcomes are variable for both conditions and a lack of guidelines for the management of two concurrent genetic conditions, such as in our patient, can pose a challenge for clinicians. Hence, this case report underscores the importance of comprehensive clinical and diagnostic evaluation in individuals with syndromic features and the need for heightened vigilance for concurrent rare genetic conditions that add to the complexity of the disease and may impact clinical outcomes, management, and counseling for the family."

There was a loss of one or more activities in 54% in type II and in 29% type III. A gain of one or more activities was found in 42% type II and in 22% type III. There were concomitant gains and losses in 27% in SMA II and in 9% in SMA III. Our results, measuring the number of abilities that are lost or gained, provide an additional method of detecting changes that can be used for the interpretation of the longitudinal data collected in treated SMA individuals."

Purpose To systematically determine the accuracy of the lateral corticospinal tract sign for detecting patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at rAMIRA MRI. Materials and Methods This study included prospectively acquired data from participants in ALS and other motor neuron disease imaging studies at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. All participants underwent 3-T axial two-dimensional rAMIRA imaging at four cervical intervertebral disk levels. The lateral CST sign was defined as spinal cord white matter hyperintensity dorsolateral to the anterior horns, with higher signal intensity than in the dorsal columns on axial rAMIRA images. Marker accuracy was assessed in a study data set and in an independent validation data set. Postmortem rAMIRA imaging and histopathologic analysis were performed in one participant who died during the study. Results Participants with ALS (study data set: 38 participants [mean age, 61 years; IQR, 15 years], 22 male participants; validation data set: 10 participants [mean age, 61 years; IQR, 21 years], seven male participants), post-polio syndrome (study data set: 25 participants [mean age, 68 years; IQR, 8 years], 12 male participants), spinal muscular atrophy (study data set: 10 participants [mean age, 43 years; IQR, 14 years], eight male participants; validation data set: five participants [mean age, 38 years; IQR, 19 years], two male participants), and healthy control participants (study data set: 60 participants [mean age, 57 years; IQR, 20 years], 36 male participants; validation data set: 10 participants [mean age, 44 years; IQR, 17 years], seven male participants) were included. The sensitivity and specificity of rAMIRA for ALS were 60% (23 of 38) and 97% (91 of 94) in the study data set and 100% (10 of 10) and 93% (14 of 15) in the validation data set, respectively. Histopathologic analysis showed distinct loss of myelinated axons in the localization of the hyperintensities observed at rAMIRA imaging performed in situ and after organ extraction. Conclusion The recently defined marker at rAMIRA MRI may be a promising tool for assessing upper motor neuron degeneration in the lateral CST in patients with ALS. Clinical trials registration no.

Despite their potential, the relationship between biomarkers and clinical outcomes in SMA remains underexplored. This study aimed to assess the association among biomarkers, phenotypes, and motor milestones in Chinese patients diagnosed with SMA. We collected retrospective clinical and follow-up data of disease-modifying therapy (DMT)-naïve patients with SMA at our center from 2019 to 2021. Four biomarkers were included: survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) copies, neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) copies, full-length SMN2 (<i>fl</i>-SMN2), and F-actin bundling protein plastin 3 (PLS3) transcript levels. Data were analyzed and stratified according to SMA subtype. Of the 123 patients, 30 were diagnosed with Type 1 (24.3%), 56 with Type 2 (45.5%), and 37 with Type 3 (30.1%). The mortality rate for Type 1 was 50%, with median survival times of 2 and 8 months for types 1a and 1b, respectively. All four biomarkers were correlated with disease severity. Notably, <i>fl</i>-SMN2 transcript levels increased with SMN2 copies and were higher in Type 2b than those in Type 2a (<i>p</i> = 0.028). Motor milestone deterioration was correlated with SMN2 copies, NAIP copies, and <i>fl</i>-SMN2 levels, while PLS3 levels were correlated with standing and walking function. Our findings suggest that SMN2 copies contribute to survival and that <i>fl</i>-SMN2 may serve as a valuable biomarker for phenotypic variability in SMA Type 2 subtypes. These insights can guide future research and clinical management of SMA."

    "abstract": "Hip subluxation and dislocation are known problems for children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Medical complexity of these children typically results in absence of monitoring and intervention for pathologic hips. Patterns of hip migration and acetabular morphology in SMA have not been described. This study examines the natural progression of hip instability across all types of SMA in a pediatric population. Following institutional review board approval, a retrospective chart review of all children with SMA at our institution was performed. All x-rays taken before the age of 18 years containing adequate projections of the pelvis were measured for Reimer migration index (MI), acetabular depth ratio (ADR), and acetabular index (AI). Demographics and clinical data were collected including use of nusinersen, ambulatory status, contractures, and hip pain. Linear mixed effects model was fit to serial MI measures of individual hips with fixed effects consisting of SMA type, age at x-ray, and their interaction. ADR and AI measures were similarly modeled following conversion of raw values to z-scores based on the model developed by Novais et al Slope indicated rate of measure change as a function of age. Forty-five children (22 males) with SMA types 1 to 3 were included in this retrospective study. Six children were classified as type 1, 25 were type 2, and 14 were type 3. The interaction of age by SMA type was statistically significant ( P =0.01), indicating a difference in the rate of hip subluxation between the 3 SMA types as measured by MI. By age 4, MI values were different from one another across all 3 groups ( P <0.01). ADR decreased with age across all SMA types. The slopes of ADR regression lines were negative and statistically significant between the 3 groups ( P =0.002). AI values were higher for all types of SMA, which is the opposite of expected in normal hips. Hip subluxation occurs across all SMA types, most rapidly in SMA type 1. Regression lines of ADR and AI compared with those seen in unaffected populations suggest hips in children with SMA demonstrate a difference in morphology of the acetabulum and do not follow normal adaptive remodeling. As treatments advance and the population of SMA patients becomes more mobile, there is an increased need to monitor hip instability in children with SMA, thus making orthopaedic management an important consideration."

Onasemnogene abeparvovec gene transfer therapy (GT) has changed the natural history of SMA1, but real-world data are scarce. A French national expert committee identified 95 newly diagnosed treatment-naive SMA1 patients between June 2019 and June 2022. We prospectively report on children treated with GT as the first and only therapy who had more than one-year of follow-up. Forty-six SMA1 patients received GT. Twelve patients received other treatments. Patients with respiratory insufficiency were oriented toward palliative care after discussion with families. Twenty-nine of the treated patients with more than 12 months of follow-up were included in the follow-up analysis. Among them, 17 had 24 months of follow-up. The mean age at treatment was 7.5 (2.1-12.5) months. Twenty-two patients had two SMN2 copies, and seven had three copies. One infant died in the month following GT due to severe thrombotic microangiopathy, and another died due to respiratory distress. Among the 17 patients with 24 months of follow-up, 90% required spinal bracing (15/17), three patients required nocturnal noninvasive ventilation, and two needed gastrostomy. Concerning motor milestones at the 24-month follow-up, all patients held their head, 15/17 sat for 30 s unassisted, and 12/17 stood with aid. Motor scores (CHOPINTEND and HINE-2) and thoracic circumference significantly improved in all patients. Our study shows favorable motor outcomes and preserved respiratory and feeding functions in treatment-naive SMA1 infants treated by GT as the first and only therapy before respiratory and bulbar dysfunctions occurred. Nevertheless, almost all patients developed spinal deformities."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a recessive developmental disorder caused by the genetic loss or mutation of the gene SMN1 (survival of motor neuron 1). SMA is characterized by neuromuscular symptoms and muscle weakness. Several years ago, SMA treatment underwent a radical transformation, with the approval of 3 different SMN-dependent disease-modifying therapies. This includes 2 SMN2 splicing therapies - risdiplam and nusinersen. One main challenge for type II SMA patients treated with these drugs is ongoing muscle fatigue, limited mobility, and other skeletal problems. To date, few molecular studies have been conducted on SMA patient-derived tissues after treatment, limiting our understanding of what targets remain unchanged after the spinal cord-targeted therapies are applied. Therefore, we collected paravertebral muscle from 8 type II patients undergoing spinal surgery for scoliosis and 7 controls. We used RNA-seq to characterize their transcriptional profiles and correlate these molecular changes with muscle histology. Despite the limited cohort size and heterogeneity, we observed a consistent loss of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery of the mitochondria, a decrease in mitochondrial DNA copy number, and a correlation between signals of cellular stress, denervation, and increased fibrosis. This work provides new putative targets for combination therapies for type II SMA."

    "abstract": "We describe outcomes following onasemnogene abeparvovec monotherapy for patients with ≥four survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene copies in RESTORE, a noninterventional spinal muscular atrophy patient registry. We evaluated baseline characteristics, motor milestone achievement, post-treatment motor function, use of ventilatory/nutritional support, and adverse events as of December 22, 2022. At data cutoff, 19 patients in RESTORE had ≥four SMN2 copies and were treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec monotherapy (n=12 [63.2%] four copies; n=7 [36.8%] >four copies). All patients were identified by newborn screening and were reported as asymptomatic at diagnosis. Median age at onasemnogene abeparvovec administration was 3.0 months. Median time from treatment to last recorded visit was 15.4 months, with a range of post-treatment follow-up of 0.03-39.4 months. All 12 children who were assessed for motor development achieved new milestones, including standing alone (n=2) and walking alone (n=5). Five children reported one or more treatment-emergent adverse events (one Grade 3 or greater). No deaths or use of ventilatory/nutritional support were reported. Real-world findings from the RESTORE registry indicate that patients with ≥four SMN2 gene copies treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec monotherapy demonstrated improvements in motor function. Adverse events experienced by these patients were consistent with previously reported findings."

    "title": "Dissecting the role of SMN multimerization in its dissociation from the Cajal body using harmine as a tool compound.",
    "abstract": "Survival motor neuron protein (SMN), which is linked to spinal muscular atrophy, is a key component of the Gemin complex, which is essential for the assembly of small nuclear RNA-protein complexes (snRNPs). After initial snRNP assembly in the cytoplasm, both snRNPs and SMN migrate to the nucleus and associate with Cajal bodies, where final snRNP maturation occurs. It is assumed that SMN must be free from the Cajal bodies for continuous snRNP biogenesis. Previous observation of the SMN granules docked in the Cajal bodies suggests the existence of a separation mechanism. However, the precise processes that regulate the spatial separation of SMN complexes from Cajal bodies remain unclear. Here, we have employed a super-resolution microscope alongside the β-carboline alkaloid harmine, which disrupts the Cajal body in a reversible manner. Upon removal of harmine, SMN and Coilin first appear as small interconnected condensates. The SMN condensates mature into spheroidal structures encircled by Coilin, eventually segregating into distinct condensates. Expression of a multimerization-deficient SMN mutant leads to enlarged, atypical Cajal bodies in which SMN is unable to segregate into separate condensates. These findings underscore the importance of multimerization in facilitating the segregation of SMN from Coilin within Cajal bodies."

    "title": "Synaptic imbalance and increased inhibition impair motor function in SMA.",
    "abstract": "Movement is executed through the balanced action of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in motor circuits of the spinal cord. Short-term perturbations in one of the two types of transmission are counteracted by homeostatic changes of the opposing type. Prolonged failure to balance excitatory and inhibitory drive results in dysfunction at the single neuron, as well as neuronal network levels. However, whether dysfunction in one or both types of neurotransmission leads to pathogenicity in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by select synaptic deficits is not known. Here, we used mouse genetics, functional assays, morphological methods, and viral-mediated approaches to uncover the pathogenic contribution of unbalanced excitation-inhibition neurotransmission in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We show that vulnerable motor circuits in the SMA spinal cord fail to respond homeostatically to the reduction of excitatory drive and instead increase inhibition. This imposes an excessive burden on motor neurons and further restricts their recruitment to activate muscle contraction. Importantly, genetic or pharmacological reduction of inhibitory synaptic drive improves neuronal function and provides behavioural benefit in SMA mice. Our findings identify the lack of excitation-inhibition homeostasis as a major maladaptive mechanism in SMA, by which the combined effects of reduced excitation and increased inhibition diminish the capacity of premotor commands to recruit motor neurons and elicit muscle contractions."

    "abstract": "The availability of disease-modifying therapies and newborn screening programs for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has generated an urgent need for reliable prognostic biomarkers to classify patients according to disease severity. We aim to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) prognostic protein biomarkers in CSF samples of SMA patients collected at baseline (T0), and to describe proteomic profile changes and biological pathways influenced by nusinersen before the sixth nusinersen infusion (T302). In this multicenter retrospective longitudinal study, we employed an untargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based proteomic approach on CSF samples collected from 61 SMA patients treated with nusinersen (SMA1 n=19, SMA2 n=19, SMA3 n=23) at T0 at T302. The Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm and pathway enrichment analysis were applied for analysis. The RF algorithm, applied to the protein expression profile of naïve patients, revealed several proteins that could classify the different types of SMA according to their differential abundance at T0. Analysis of changes in proteomic profiles identified a total of 147 differentially expressed proteins after nusinersen treatment in SMA1, 135 in SMA2, and 289 in SMA3. Overall, nusinersen-induced changes on proteomic profile were consistent with i) common effects observed in allSMA types (i.e. regulation of axonogenesis), and ii) disease severity-specific changes, namely regulation of glucose metabolism in SMA1, of coagulation processes in SMA2, and of complement cascade in SMA3. This untargeted LC-MS proteomic profiling in the CSF of SMA patients revealed differences in protein expression in naïve patients and showed nusinersen-related modulation in several biological processes after 10 months of treatment. Further confirmatory studies are needed to validate these results in larger number of patients and over abroader timeframe."

    "abstract": "The therapeutic options for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are encouraging. However, there is currently no cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The clinical and economic uncertainty surrounding innovative treatments for rare neurodegenerative diseases makes it necessary to understand managed entry agreements (MEAs). The aim of this study was to review whether models of MEAs in SMA could be extrapolated to ALS. We performed a scoping review with information on MEAs on SMA in Web of Science (WOS), PubMed, Lyfegen Library, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH). We found 45 results in WOS and PubMed. After an initial survey, 10 were reviewed to assess eligibility, and three were selected. We obtained 44 results from Lyfegen Library, and three results each from NICE and CADTH. The main objective of MEAs is to reduce uncertainty in the financing of drugs with a high budgetary impact and clinical concerns, as is the case with drugs for SMA and ALS. While the information available on MEAs in SMA is scarce, some conceptual models are publicly available. MEAs for long-term treatments for SMA could be used for the design of MEAs in ALS because of their similarities in economic and clinical uncertainty."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy is being successfully developed for the treatment of several genetic disorders. Various methods of gene transfer have been developed to enable the production of the deficient enzyme or protein. One of the most important is adeno-associated virus vectors, which have been shown to be viable for use in in vivo gene therapy. Several gene therapies have already been approved. They are also promising for acquired diseases. Important examples include gene therapy for haemophilia A and B, X-linked myotubular myopathy, spinal muscular atrophy and several liver diseases such as Criggler-Najjar disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and Fabry disease. However, the introduction of a foreign compound into hepatocytes leads to hepatic reactions with heterogeneous phenotypic expression and a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from mild transaminase elevation to acute liver failure. Several mechanisms appear to be involved in liver injury, including an immune response, but also direct toxicity depending on the method of gene transfer. As a result, the incidence, expression and severity of liver injury vary from indication to indication and from patient to patient. Patients treated for haemophilia A are more prone to transaminase elevation than those treated for haemophilia B. Corticosteroids are successfully used to correct liver reactions but also to prevent degradation of the transferred gene and loss of therapeutic activity. The aim of this review is to describe the risk of liver injury according to the indication for gene therapy and the short- and long-term management currently proposed to prevent or correct liver reactions in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations or deletions in the survival motoneuron 1 (<i>SMN1</i>) gene, resulting in deficiency of the SMN protein that is essential for motoneuron function. Smn depletion in mice disturbs axonal RNA transport and translation, thereby contributing to axon growth impairment, muscle denervation, and motoneuron degeneration. However, the mechanisms whereby Smn loss causes axonal defects remain unclear. RNA localization and translation in axons are controlled by RNA-binding proteins (RBP) and we recently observed that the neuronal RBP Ptbp2 modulates axon growth in motoneurons. Here, we identify Smn as an interactor of Ptbp2 in the cytosolic compartments of motoneurons. We show that the expression level of Ptbp2 is reduced in axons but not in the somata of Smn-depleted motoneurons. This is accompanied by reduced synthesis of the RBP hnRNP R in axons. Re-expression of Ptbp2 in axons compensates for the deficiency of Smn and rescues the defects in axon elongation and growth cone maturation observed in Smn-deficient motoneurons. Our data suggest that Ptbp2 and Smn are components of cytosolic mRNP particles, contributing to the precise spatial and temporal control of protein synthesis within axons and axon terminals."

We aimed to determine if the ultrasound (US)-assistance reduces the number of needle attempts and needle redirections needed for intrathecal drug administration and its impact on the procedure time, the incidence of adverse events (AEs), and patient satisfaction in these patients. Fifty-eight patients aged 18 years and older scheduled for intrathecal nusinersen injection were enrolled and randomized (1:1 ratio) into Group 1 (nusinersen infusion with US-assisted technique) or Group 2 (nusinersen infusion with landmark-based technique). The number of attempts, number of redirections, periprocedural time, AEs and patient satisfaction were reported. Continuous variables were compared with the Student t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical variables were evaluated with the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test in case of expected frequencies <5. The p-values <.05 were considered statistically significant. There were no statistical differences in the number of attempts, AEs, or patient satisfaction between the two groups. The number of needle redirections was significantly lower in the ultrasound group versus landmark-based group (p < .05) in both the overall group of patients and in the subgroup with difficult spines. The periprocedural time was about 40 seconds longer in US-group versus landmark-based group (p < .05). In SMA adults, US assistance reduces the number of needle redirections needed for intrathecal drug administration. These results suggest that the US assistance may be advantageous for nusinersen therapy to reduce the therapeutic burden of intrathecal infusion."

Besides some biomarkers like SMN2 copy number therapeutic biomarkers for SMA with known relevance for neuromuscular transmission are lacking. Here, we examined the potential of Thrombospondin-4 (TSP4) to serve as a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker, which may also indicate treatment response. We used untargeted proteomic analyses to determine biomarkers in CSF samples derived from pediatric pre-symptomatic (n = 6) and symptomatic (n = 4) SMA patients. The identified biomarker TSP4 was then validated in additional 68 CSF samples (9 adult and 24 pediatric SMA patients, 5 adult and 13 pediatric non-disease controls in addition to 17 pediatric disease controls) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as an additional analytical approach. Untargeted proteomic analyses of CSF identified a dysregulation of TSP4 and revealed a difference between pre-symptomatic SMA patients and patients identified after the onset of first symptoms. Subsequent ELISA-analyses showed that TSP4 is decreased in pediatric but not adult SMA patients. CSF of pediatric patients with other neurological disorders demonstrated no alteration of TSP4 levels. Furthermore, CSF TSP4 levels of pediatric SMA patients increased after first dose of Nusinersen. We found that TSP4 levels are exclusively reduced in CSF of pediatric SMA patients and increase after treatment, leading us to the hypothesis that TSP4 could serve as a CSF biomarker with the potential to monitor treatment response in pediatric SMA patients. Moreover, TSP4 enable to distinguish pre-symptomatic and symptomatic patients suggesting a potential to serve as a stratification marker."

Concurrent muscle hypertrophy or persistently elevated creatine kinase (CK) is rare. While muscle hypertrophy is commonly observed in myogenic diseases, such as muscular dystrophy, acromegaly, inflammatory myopathies, and hypothyroidism, reports of muscle hypertrophy caused by neuropathy are infrequent. We encountered a patient with persistently elevated CK levels and unilateral lower leg muscle hypertrophy associated with neuropathy. The patient had cauda equina syndrome symptoms and pain in the left lower leg. Lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed central spinal stenosis, which was believed to be the cause of the symptoms. Lower-limb MRI revealed high signal intensity in the gastrocnemius muscle on fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging. Surgical treatment improved the radiculopathy, hypertrophy, and pain in the left lower leg. During the one-year follow-up, improvement was confirmed with both MRI and nerve conduction studies. Calf muscle hypertrophy associated with neuropathy has been reported; however, no reports have demonstrated pre- and postoperative changes with MRI and nerve conduction studies.

We aimed to investigate postsurgical changes in respiratory function, motor function, weight, pain, and satisfaction. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical notes of 32 disease-modifying treatment-naïve patients (26 SMA2, 6 nonambulant SMA3). We also performed investigator-developed phone interviews and conducted a focus group with families on postsurgical satisfaction. Mean annual rate of forced vital capacity percent decline improved in SMA2: -3.2% postsurgery versus -6.9% presurgery (p < .001), with similar trajectories in SMA3. Gross motor functional scores (Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale) available in 12/32 dropped immediately after surgery: median loss of 6.5 points, with relatively spared upper limb function. Weight z-scores postsurgery dropped in 16/32, requiring food supplements (5/16); one/16 lost >5% of total weight requiring gastrostomy. Postsurgical pain was frequently reported, especially hip pain (13/32). Overall, 10/10 patients/parents participating in the phone interview rated the procedure as very successful for posture and physical appearance. Nonetheless, 7/10 reported postsurgical pain, reduced mobility, and unmet care needs. The seven patients/parents attending the focus group highlighted lack of intensive physiotherapy programs, occupational therapy assistance, and psychological support as postsurgical unmet care needs. This study reports a positive impact of scoliosis surgery on respiratory function and overall satisfaction with posture and physical appearance. The observed negative impact on the other outcomes highlights the importance of multidisciplinary approaches to improve postoperative management."

The aim was to analyze FEES feasibility, swallow safety and efficacy, dysphagia phenotype, and agreement with VideoFluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) in children with symptomatic, medication-treated SMA1 and oral feeding. 10 children with SMA1 underwent FEES. Six patients had also a VFSS. Two clinicians independently rated FEES and VFSS videos. Swallowing safety was assessed using the Penetration-Aspiration scale (PAS). Dysphagia phenotypes were defined according to the classification defined by Warnecke et al. Swallowing efficacy was evaluated with the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale (YPRSRS) in FEES, whereas pharyngeal residue was rated as present or absent in VFSS. FEES was performed in all children without complications. Four children tolerated bolus trials during FEES, in 4 children swallowing characteristics were inferred based on post-swallow residues, while 2 children refused to eat and only saliva management was assessed. The dysphagia phenotype of predominance of residue in the piriform sinuses was documented in 7/8 children. The PAS score was < 3 in 3 children and > 5 in one child. Swallowing efficacy was impaired in 8/8 children. VFSS showed complete agreement with FEES. FEES is a feasible examination in children with SMA1. Swallowing safety and efficacy are impaired in nearly all patients with strong agreement between FEES and VFSS. Dysphagia is characterized by the predominance of residue in the piriform sinus."

    "abstract": "The motor neuron survival protein performs numerous cellular functions; hence, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is considered to be a multi-organ disease with possible sensory system damage. The controversy surrounding the presence of sensory disturbances, prompted us to conduct standard electrophysiological studies and assess the sensory thresholds for different modalities in adults with SMA types 2 and 3. The study group consisted of 44 adult SMA patients (types 2 and 3). All patients underwent neurological examination using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale - Expanded (HFMSE). Standard sensory electrophysiological studies in the ulnar nerve and the estimation of vibratory, temperature, and warm- and cold-induced pain thresholds with temperature dispersion assessment were performed using quantitative sensory testing (QST). The most repeatable result was the high amplitude of the sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) in SMA patients compared to controls. This was higher in type 2 patients compared to type 3a and 3b patients and patients with low HFSME scores. Patients with SMA, especially type 3b presented a longer sensory latency and slower conduction velocity than did controls. Cold pain threshold was higher and warm dispersion larger in SMA. The vibratory limit was higher in patients with high HFSME scores. A high SNAP amplitude suggests sensory fibre hyperactivity, which may be based on overactivation of metabolic pathways as an adaptive mechanism in response to SMN protein deficiency with additionally coexisting small C- and A-delta fibre damage. SMA patients seem to have a concomitant, mild demyelinating process present at the early SMA stage."

Fourteen publications including 539 patients followed up to 24 months met inclusion criteria for the SLR. Patients were age 13-72 years and most (99%) had SMA Type II or III. Modest improvement or stability in motor function was consistently observed at the group level. Significant mean increases from baseline were observed in HFMSE [2.3 points (95% CI 1.3-3.3)] with 32.1% (21.7-44.6) of patients demonstrating a clinically meaningful increase (≥ 3 points) at 18 months. Significant increases in RULM were consistently found, with a mean increase of 1.1 points (0.7-1.4) and 38.3% (30.3-47.1) showing a clinically meaningful improvement (≥ 2 points) at 14 months.

Only a few studies have investigated the reconstruction of motor function in denervated diaphragms caused by such conditions. Here, we studied the efficacy of transplanting E14 embryonic spinal motor neurons (SMNs) into peripheral nerve grafts for functionally reconstructing a denervated diaphragm in a rat model. The diaphragms of 8-week-old male Fischer 344 rats were first denervated by transecting the phrenic nerves. Subsequently, peripheral nerve grafts taken from the lower limb were used for neurotization of the denervated diaphragms. One week later, fetal E14 SMNs were transplanted into the peripheral nerve grafts. After 3 months, we observed functional contraction of the diaphragm following neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the peripheral nerve graft. Additionally, we confirmed that SMN transplantation into the peripheral nerve graft had an inhibitory effect on diaphragm muscle atrophy. The SMNs transplanted into the peripheral nerve grafts formed a structure similar to the spinal cord, and the neuromuscular junction of the denervated diaphragm was reinnervated. These findings suggest the establishment of an ectopic motor neuron pool in the peripheral nerve graft. Free peripheral intra-nerve SMN transplantation in combination with NMES, which can be applied for diaphragmatic pacing, offers novel insights into the development of neuroregenerative therapies for treating life-threatening and intractable respiratory muscle paralysis caused by severe nerve damage and degenerative diseases."

Aberrant AR activity is associated with numerous diseases, including prostate cancer, androgen insensitivity syndrome, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, and androgenic alopecia. Recent studies have shown that AR adopts numerous conformations that can modulate its ability to bind and transcribe its target DNA substrates, a feature that can be hijacked in the context of cancer. Here, we summarize a series of structural observations describing how this elusive shape-shifter binds to multiple partners, including self-interactions, DNA, and steroid and non-steroidal ligands. We present evidence that AR's pervasive structural plasticity confers an ability to broadly bind and transcribe numerous ligands in the normal and disease state, and explain the structural basis for adaptive resistance mutations to antiandrogen treatment. These evolutionary features are integral to receptor function, and are commonly lost in androgen insensitivity syndrome, or reinforced in cancer."

    "abstract": "The impact of disease-modifying therapy ranges from cure to no impact with a wide range of intermediates. In cases where the intermediate group reaches a plateau after the acquisition of some muscle strength, it is necessary to set a functional level appropriate for increased motor power and establish a long-term exercise plan to maintain it. As the disease status stabilizes and the life span increases, early nonsurgical interventions are required, such as using a standing frame to prevent joint contracture, applying a spinal brace at the early stage of scoliosis, and maintaining sitting postures that exaggerate lumbar lordosis. In cases where scoliosis and hip displacement occur and progress even after conservative managements are implemented, early referral to surgery should be considered. Oromotor activity and swallowing function are influenced not only by the effects of disease-modifying drugs, but also by post-birth experience and training. Therefore, although the feeding tube cannot be removed, it is necessary to make efforts to simulate the infant feeding development while maintaining partial oral feeding. Since the application period of non-invasive ventilators has increased, it has become more important to prevent long-term complications such as facial abrasion, skin allergy, orthodontic deformities, and maxillary flattening caused by the interface. Dual ventilator mode or interface can also be utilized."

    "title": "Prognostic factors for tube feeding in type I SMA patients treated with disease-modifying therapies: a cohort study.",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the need for tube feeding in a cohort of treated infants with type I SMA and to identify predictive factors. All patients were classified at baseline, when treatment started, and at follow-up according to their functional level and the need for tube feeding. Fisher's exact test was used to examine the associations between the outcome at the last follow-up and SMA type, SMN2 copy number, and baseline nutritional status. ANOVA was performed to compare CHOP INTEND scores and age at treatment initiation with outcomes. The cohort includes 75 type I SMA infants treated between 0.1 and 5 years of age. At the last follow-up, 34 had no need for tube feeding, 9 had tube feeding but were also able to be fed by mouth, and 32 had tube feeding and were unable to be fed by mouth. Thirty of the 41 infants with tube feeding at follow-up already had feeding difficulties when treatment was started. The need for tube feeding at follow-up was associated with the level of feeding involvement at baseline and with CHOP INTEND scores [p < 0.001] but not with SMN2 copy number, SMA type 1 subtypes or age at treatment. The results of this study suggest that the need for tube feeding is not frequent in treated infants with type I SMA and, when occurring, can be predicted by the level of feeding involvement and low CHOP INTEND scores at baseline. What is Known: • The advent of disease-modifying therapies is increasingly changing the approach to swallowing and nutritional management in type I SMA. • Clinical trials and real-world data using all three disease-modifying therapies report a rather wide variability of feeding outcome and need for tube feeding that is often related to different cohorts that makes comparison between studies very difficult. What is New: • The real-world findings of this study, including all the children treated since treatments became available, confirmed that the need for tube feeding is not an invariable finding. • The level of feeding involvement at baseline appears to be a reliable prognostic indicator of bulbar outcome. • The results highlight the need for interventional studies with structured Speech and Language Therapist protocols that will help to better understand the extent to which bulbar function can be maintained or regained even in children requiring tube feeding."

    "abstract": "Despite disease modifying treatments (DMT), assisted ventilation is commonly required in children with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). Guidelines suggest screening with oximetry and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO<sub>2</sub>) for sleep disordered breathing (SDB). To determine the utility of pulse oximetry and TcCO<sub>2</sub> as a screen for SDB and the need for Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) in children with SMA type 1-3. A prospective cohort study was conducted in Queensland, Australia. Full diagnostic PSG was completed in DMT naïve children with SMA. Pulse oximetry and TcCO<sub>2</sub> were extracted from PSG. Apnoea-hypopnoea indices (AHI) criteria were applied to PSG results to define the need for NIV. Abnormal was defined as: ≤3 months of age [mo] AHI≥10 events/hour; >3mo AHI ≥5 events/hour. Receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated for abnormal PSG and pulse oximetry/TcCO<sub>2</sub> variables, and diagnostic statistics were calculated. Forty-seven untreated children with SMA were recruited (type 1 n = 13; 2 n = 21; 3 n = 13) ranging from 0.2 to 18.8 years old (median 4.9 years). Oxygen desaturation index ≥4 % (ODI4) ≥20events/hour had sensitivity 82.6 % (95 % CI 61.2-95.0) and specificity of 58.3 % (95 % CI 36.6-77.9). TcCO<sub>2</sub> alone and combinations of oximetry/TcCO<sub>2</sub> had low diagnostic ability. The same methodology was applied to 36 children who were treated (type 1 n = 7; type 2 n = 17; type n = 12) and oximetry±TcCO2 had low diagnostic ability. ODI4 ≥20events/hour can predict the need for NIV in untreated children with SMA. TcCO2 monitoring does not improve the PPV. If normal however, children may still require a diagnostic PSG. Neither oximetry nor TcCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring were useful screening tests in the children treated with DMT."

Detailed knowledge about pareses patterns in SMA facilitates differential diagnosis and supports therapeutic monitoring. Between January 2021, and June 2021, 66 SMA patients (59.1% male, aged 33.6 ± 15.2 years) were included in the study. Most patients had SMA type II (<i>n</i> = 28) or SMA type III (<i>n</i> = 28), seven patients had SMA type I, and three patients had SMA type IV. We analyzed the pattern of pareses using the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) scoring system. In both, upper and lower limbs muscle weakness was less pronounced in distal (upper limbs: MRC median 3.0 (interquartile range 1.5-3.5); lower limbs: 1.5 (0.5-3.0)) compared to proximal muscle groups (upper limbs: 2.0 (1.5-2.6); <i>p</i> < 0.001; lower limbs: 0.5 (0.5-1.5); <i>p</i> < 0.001). Thenar muscles were stronger than other small hand muscles (3.0 (2.0-3.5) vs 3.0 (1.5-3.5); <i>p</i> = 0.004). Muscles had more strength in upper (2.3 (1.5-3.1)) compared to lower limbs (1.1 (0.5-2.3); <i>p</i> < 0.001) and in flexors compared to extensors. We identified a specific pattern of muscle paresis in SMA which is different from the pattern of paresis in ALS and SBMA. As a rule of thumb, the pattern of pareses is similar, but not identical to ALS in distal, but different in proximal muscle groups."

    "title": "Recent Progress in Gene-Targeting Therapies for Spinal Muscular Atrophy: Promises and Challenges.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe genetic disorder characterized by the loss of motor neurons, leading to progressive muscle weakness, loss of mobility, and respiratory complications. In its most severe forms, SMA can result in death within the first two years of life if untreated. The condition arises from mutations in the <i>SMN1</i> (survival of motor neuron 1) gene, causing a deficiency in the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Humans possess a near-identical gene, <i>SMN2</i>, which modifies disease severity and is a primary target for therapies. Recent therapeutic advancements include antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), small molecules targeting SMN2, and virus-mediated gene replacement therapy delivering a functional copy of SMN1. Additionally, recognizing SMA's broader phenotype involving multiple organs has led to the development of SMN-independent therapies. Evidence now indicates that SMA affects multiple organ systems, suggesting the need for SMN-independent treatments along with SMN-targeting therapies. No single therapy can cure SMA; thus, combination therapies may be essential for comprehensive treatment. This review addresses the SMA etiology, the role of SMN, and provides an overview of the rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape, highlighting current achievements and future directions."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1; OMIM #604320, ORPHA:98920) is a rare autosomal recessive congenital motor neuron disease. It is caused by variants in the <i>IGHMBP2</i> gene. Clinically, it presents with respiratory failure due to diaphragmatic paralysis, progressive muscle weakness starting in the distal parts of the limbs, dysphagia, and damage to sensory and autonomic nerves. Unlike spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), SMARD1 has a distinct genetic etiology and is not detected in the population newborn screening programs. Most children with SMARD1 do not survive beyond the first year of life due to progressive respiratory failure. Artificial ventilation can prolong survival, but no specific treatment is available. Therapy focuses on mechanical ventilation and improving the patient's quality of life. Research into gene therapy is ongoing. We report three female patients with SMARD1, including twins from a triplet pregnancy. In twin sisters (patient no. 1 and patient no. 2), two heterozygous variants in the <i>IGHMBP2</i> gene were identified: c.595G>C/p.Ala199Pro and c.1615_1623del/p.Ser539_Tyr541del. In patient no. 3, a variant c.1478C>T/p.Thr493Ile and a variant c.439C>T/p.Arg147* in the <i>IGHMBP2</i> gene were detected. Our findings underscore the variability of clinical presentations, even among patients sharing the same pathogenic variants in the <i>IGHMBP2</i> gene, and emphasize the importance of early genetic diagnosis in patients presenting with respiratory failure, with or without associated diaphragmatic muscle paralysis."

    "abstract": "Background This study examines spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neuromuscular disease associated with malnutrition. Our goals are to assess how effectively screening tools can detect malnutrition and evaluate the impact of nutritional interventions on neurological outcomes, particularly motor functions. Methods Thirty-seven genetically diagnosed SMA patients (types 1, 2, and 3) under nusinersen therapy were included in the study. The nutritional status of these patients was assessed by using anthropometric measurements, including height for age (HFA), weight for height (WFH), and body mass index (BMI) before and after the study. Additionally, the risk of malnutrition was determined using screening tools, namely the Pediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score (PYMS) and the Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Pediatrics (STAMP). Nutritional counseling followed the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines and considered the patients' dietary history, including content and administration method. Motor functions were assessed by validated tests: the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE). Result The study showed an improvement in HFA, by a change from -0.95 to -0.65 (<i>p</i> = 0.015). Conversely, BMI scores decreased from 0.08 to -0.54 (<i>p</i> = 0.015), while WFH and MUAC showed no significant alterations (<i>p</i> = 0.135, <i>p</i> = 0.307). Following nutritional interventions, HFMSE demonstrated a median increase from 29.5 to 30.5 (<i>p</i> = 0.023). Patients identified as being at high risk for malnutrition based on PYMS and STAMP belonged to the moderate-to-severe malnutrition group (BMI Z-score ≤ -2, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Conclusions Use of screening tools in SMA patients is highly beneficial for the early detection of malnutrition. Future research should highlight the importance of combining nutritional management with nusinersen therapy to potentially alter the disease trajectory, especially in motor and neurological functions."

    "title": "Ubiquitination Insight from Spinal Muscular Atrophy-From Pathogenesis to Therapy: A Muscle Perspective.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of the most frequent causes of death in childhood. The disease's molecular basis is deletion or mutations in the <i>SMN1</i> gene, which produces reduced survival motor neuron protein (SMN) levels. As a result, there is spinal motor neuron degeneration and a large increase in muscle atrophy, in which the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a significant role. In humans, a paralogue of <i>SMN1</i>, <i>SMN2</i> encodes the truncated protein SMNΔ7. Structural differences between SMN and SMNΔ7 affect the interaction of the proteins with UPS and decrease the stability of the truncated protein. SMN loss affects the general ubiquitination process by lowering the levels of UBA1, one of the main enzymes in the ubiquitination process. We discuss how SMN loss affects both SMN stability and the general ubiquitination process, and how the proteins involved in ubiquitination could be used as future targets for SMA treatment."

    "abstract": "Clinical trials with treatments inhibiting myostatin pathways to increase muscle mass are currently ongoing in spinal muscular atrophy. Given evidence of potential myostatin pathway downregulation in Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), restoring sufficient myostatin levels using disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) might arguably be necessary prior to considering myostatin inhibitors as an add-on treatment. This retrospective study assessed pre-treatment myostatin and follistatin levels' correlation with disease severity and explored their alteration by disease-modifying treatment in SMA. We retrospectively collected clinical characteristics, motor scores, and mysotatin and follistatin levels between 2018 and 2020 in 25 Belgian patients with SMA (SMA1 (<i>n</i> = 13), SMA2 (<i>n</i> = 6), SMA 3 (<i>n</i> = 6)) and treated by nusinersen. Data were collected prior to treatment and after 2, 6, 10, 18, and 30 months of treatment. Myostatin levels correlated with patients' age, weight, SMA type, and motor function before treatment initiation. After treatment, we observed correlations between myostatin levels and some motor function scores (i.e., MFM32, HFMSE, 6MWT), but no major effect of nusinersen on myostatin or follistatin levels over time. In conclusion, further research is needed to determine if DMTs can impact myostatin and follistatin levels in SMA, and how this could potentially influence patient selection for ongoing myostatin inhibitor trials."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder primarily caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, leading to motor neuron degeneration and muscle atrophy, affecting multiple organ systems. Nusinersen treatment targets gene expression and is expected to enhance the motor function of voluntary muscles in the limbs and trunk. Motor skills can be assessed through specific scales like the Revised Upper Limb Module Scale (RULM) and Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE). This study aims to evaluate the influence of nusinersen on the motor skills of patients with SMA Type 2 and 3 using real-world data collected over 54 months. A prospective longitudinal study was conducted on 37 SMA patients treated with nusinersen, analyzing data with R statistical software. The outcomes revealed significant improvements in motor functions, particularly in SMA Type 3 patients with higher RULM and HFSME scores. Additionally, GEE analysis identified time, type, age, and exon deletions as essential predictors of motor score improvements. The extended observation period is both a major strength and a limitation of this research, as the dropout rates could present challenges in interpretation. Variability in responses, influenced by genetic background, SMA type, and onset age, highlights the need for personalized treatment approaches."

We applied a variety of modern, supervised ML approaches to this data, first seeking to differentiate healthy from SMA muscle, and then, using the best method, to track SMA progression.<i>Main Results.</i>Several of the ML algorithms worked well, but linear discriminant analysis (LDA) achieved 88.6% accuracy on subject muscles studied. This contrasts with a maximum of 60% accuracy that could be achieved using the single or multifrequency assessment approaches available at the time. LDA scores were also able to track progression effectively, although a multifrequency reactance-based measure also performed very well in this context.<i>Significance.</i>EIM enhanced with ML promises to be effective for providing effective diagnosis and tracking children and adults with SMA treated with currently available therapies.

There is likely variation in the practice patterns of state NBS programs and among the providers caring for newborns with SMA. This is a prospective, descriptive, observational study that seeks to quantify and describe practice patterns and heterogeneities in state NBS programs and provider practices in the U.S. We surveyed U.S. state NBS programs and care providers of newborns with SMA. Thirty states and 41 practitioners responded. NBS program practices vary by state. Most (74%) state programs provide results to both primary care and specialist providers and also defer confirmatory SMA testing to those providers. Two states had relatively high rates of false-positive or inclusive results. The total birth prevalence of SMA was 1:13,862. Most providers were in tertiary care centers (90%) and were child neurologists (81%) and/or had fellowship training in Neuromuscular Medicine or Electromyography (76%). All providers see new referrals in less than a week, but many do not initiate treatment until >3 weeks of age (39%), with most commonly reported delays related to insurance processes. Most (81%) prefer onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (OA) as the treatment of choice, mainly due to perceived efficacy and the route/frequency of administration. NBS practice patterns in the U.S. vary by state but overall yielded the predicted birth prevalence of positive results. Providers evaluate these newborns urgently, but many do not initiate therapy until after 3 weeks of age. Treatment delays are mainly related to insurance processes."

We aimed to establish statewide NBS for SMA in Serbia. Our stepwise implementation process involved technical validation of a screening assay, collaboration with patient organizations and medical professionals, a feasibility study, and negotiation with public health representatives. Over 12,000 newborns were tested during the 17-month feasibility study, revealing two unrelated SMA infants and one older sibling. All three children received therapeutic interventions during the presymptomatic phase and have shown no signs of SMA. No false-negative results were found among the negative test results. As frontrunners in this field in Serbia, we established screening and diagnostic algorithms and follow-up protocols and raised awareness among stakeholders about the importance of early disease detection, leading to the incorporation of NBS for SMA into the national program on 15 September 2023. Since then, 54,393 newborns have been tested, identifying six SMA cases and enabling timely treatment. Our study demonstrates that effective collaborations between academia, non-profit organizations, and industry are crucial in bringing innovative healthcare initiatives to fruition, and highlights the potential of NBS to revolutionize healthcare outcomes for presymptomatic SMA infants and their families."

Treatments including nusinersen, risdiplam, and onasemnogene abeparvovec have been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms, with recent studies suggesting greater effectiveness when treatment is initiated in the presymptomatic stage. This systematic review synthesises findings from prospective studies of presymptomatic treatment for 5q SMA published up to December 2023. The review identified three single-arm interventional studies of presymptomatic treatment (NURTURE, RAINBOWFISH, and SPR1NT), six observational studies comparing presymptomatic or screened cohorts versus symptomatic cohorts, and twelve follow-up studies of screened cohorts only (i.e., babies identified via newborn screening for SMA). Babies with three <i>SMN2</i> copies met most motor milestones in the NURTURE study of nusinersen and in the SPR1NT study of onasemnogene abeparvovec. Babies with two <i>SMN2</i> copies in these two studies met most motor milestones but with some delays, and some required ventilatory or feeding support. The RAINBOWFISH study of risdiplam is ongoing. Naïve comparisons of presymptomatic treatment in SPR1NT, versus untreated or symptomatic treatment cohorts, suggested improved outcomes in patients treated presymptomatically. Comparative observational studies supported the finding that presymptomatic treatment, and early treatment following screening, may improve outcomes compared with treatment at the symptomatic stage. Further research should assess the long-term clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of presymptomatic treatment for SMA."

    "abstract": "Mutations in the <i>Survival of Motor Neuron 1</i> gene lead to a loss of survival motor neuron protein in patients with spinal muscular atrophy. Revolutionary advances in gene therapy have led to survival motor neuron-replacement therapies that significantly prolong life expectancy and improve neuromuscular function. However, accumulating evidence suggests that the timing of survival motor neuron-replacement therapies is a critical determinant of success. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all pre-clinical studies testing survival motor neuron replacement therapies in mouse models of spinal muscular atrophy to assess the impact of timing of delivery on therapeutic effectiveness. We incorporated four databases in this pre-registered study (PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020200180): EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria were; primary research article, a measure of survival analysis, use of survival motor neuron mouse model and evaluation of survival motor neuron-targeting therapy. Exclusion criteria included; use of therapies not known to directly target survival motor neuron, genetic manipulations and/or lack of appropriate controls. We screened papers using the SyRF platform. The main outcome we assessed was survival in treated groups compared to untreated groups. We performed meta-analysis of survival using median survival ratio and the random effects model and measured heterogeneity using the <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> statistic. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess treatment efficacy based on timing of intervention (embryonic delivery, day of birth, postnatal day 2 and postnatal day 3 or later) and treatment type. If detailed in the studies, body weight compared to untreated spinal muscular atrophy models and motor neuron number were included as secondary outcomes for meta-analysis. 3469 studies were initially identified, with 78 ultimately included. Survival motor neuron-replacement therapies significantly affected survival in favour of treatment by a factor of 1.20 (95% CI 1.10-1.30, <i>P</i> < 0.001) with high heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 95%). Timing of treatment was a significant source of heterogeneity (<i>P</i> < 0.01), with earlier treatment having a greater impact on survival. When stratified by type of treatment, earlier treatment continued to have the strongest effect with viral vector replacement therapy and antisense oligonucleotide therapy. Secondary outcome measures of body weight and spinal motor neuron counts were also positively associated with early treatment. Earlier delivery of survival motor neuron replacement therapies is therefore a key determinant of treatment efficacy in spinal muscular atrophy."

    "title": "Health information literacy among children with spinal muscular atrophy and their caregivers.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease that leads to multiple organ dysfunction. The advent of disease-modifying treatments makes the early diagnosis of SMA critical. Health information literacy is vital for obtaining, understanding, screening, and using health information. Considering the importance of early diagnosis and the challenges in obtaining accurate information on patients with SMA, this cross-sectional study assessed health information literacy among children with SMA and their caregivers in China. Interviews with the caregivers of 10 patients with SMA were conducted by neurologists specializing in SMA. A questionnaire for evaluating the level of health information literacy was further developed among 145 children with SMA aged 10.0-120.0 months, with the average age of 81.9 months, and their caregivers. Parameters, such as the age at the onset of the first symptom and time from recognition of the first symptom to diagnosis, were examined. Health information literacy was measured using four dimensions: cognition, search, evaluation, and application. The average time from the first symptom to first medical consultation was 4.8 months, and that from the first symptom to diagnosis was 10.8 months. There is a significant delay from the onset of the initial symptoms to a definitive diagnosis. Thirty-five (24%) patients had poor while 26 (18%) had high health information literacy. The overall score for health information literacy was 69; the scores for health information cognition and application were 90 and 84, respectively. The scores for evaluation (61) and search (57) were low. Medical personnel were considered the most professional and credible sources of information. Additionally, search engines and patient organizations were the other two most important sources of health literacy. Patients with SMA and their caregivers had low levels of health information literacy. SMA information visibility and standardization need to be improved. Medical personnel with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of SMA and media should aim to share knowledge and increase the quality of life of those with SMA."

    "abstract": "Monogenic diseases are well-suited paradigms for the causal analysis of disease-driving molecular patterns. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one such monogenic model, caused by mutation or deletion of the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Although several functions of the SMN protein have been studied, single functions and pathways alone do not allow the identification of crucial disease-driving molecules. Here, we analysed the systemic characteristics of SMA, using proteomics, phosphoproteomics, translatomics and interactomics, from two mouse models with different disease severities and genetics. This systems approach revealed subnetworks and proteins characterizing commonalities and differences of both models. To link the identified molecular networks with the disease-causing SMN protein, we combined SMN-interactome data with both proteomes, creating a comprehensive representation of SMA. By this approach, disease hubs and bottlenecks between SMN and downstream pathways could be identified. Linking a disease-causing molecule with widespread molecular dysregulations via multiomics is a concept for analyses of monogenic diseases."

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated gene therapy is a leading gene delivery platform with potential to transform the landscape of treatment for neurological disorders. While AAV is deemed non-immunogenic compared to other viral vectors, adverse immune reactions have been observed in the clinic, raising concerns. As the central nervous system (CNS) has a tightly regulated immune system, characterized by a degree of tolerance, it has been considered a unique target for AAV gene therapy. AAV vectors have shown promising results for the treatment of several CNS disorders including Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Giant Axonal Neuropathy, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Tay Sachs Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and others, demonstrating safety and success. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Zolgensma and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of Upstaza, for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency (AADC) respectively, represent this success, all while highlighting significant differences in immune responses to AAV, particularly with regards to therapeutic administration route. AAV therapies like Upstaza that are injected directly into the immune-specialized brain have been characterized by mild immune response profiles and minor adverse events, whereas therapies like Zolgensma that are injected systemically demonstrate more robust immune stimulation and off-target toxicities. Despite these contrasting parallels, these therapeutics and others in the clinic have demonstrated clinical benefit for patients, warranting further exploration of immune responses to CNS-directed AAV clinical trials. Thus, in this review, we discuss effects of different routes of AAV administration on eliciting local and peripheral immune responses specifically observed in CNS-targeted trials."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disorder. Although prior studies have investigated the metabolomes of SMA in various contexts, there is a gap in research on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolomics compared to healthy controls. CSF metabolomics can provide insights into central nervous system function and patient outcomes. This study aims to investigate CSF metabolite profiles in untreated SMA patients to enhance our understanding of SMA metabolic dysregulation. This case control study included 15 SMA patients and 14 control subjects. CSF samples were collected, and untargeted metabolomics was conducted to detect metabolites in SMA and control groups. A total of 118 metabolites abundance were significantly changed between the SMA and control groups. Of those, 27 metabolites with variable importance for the projection (VIP) ≥ 1.5 were identified. The top 5 differential metabolites were N-acetylneuraminic acid (VIP = 2.38, Fold change = 0.43, P = 5.49 × 10<sup>-5</sup>), 2,3-dihydroxyindole (VIP = 2.33, Fold change = 0.39, P = 1.81 × 10<sup>-4</sup>), lumichrome (VIP = 2.30, Fold change = 0.48, P = 7.90 × 10<sup>-5</sup>), arachidic acid (VIP = 2.23, Fold change = 10.79, P = 6.50 × 10<sup>-6</sup>), and 10-hydroxydecanoic acid (VIP = 2.23, Fold change = 0.60, P = 1.44 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). Cluster analysis demonstrated that the differentially metabolites predominantly clustered within two main categories: protein and amino acid metabolism, and lipid metabolism. The findings highlight the complexity of SMA, with widespread effects on multiple metabolic pathways, particularly in amino acid and lipid metabolism. N-acetylneuraminic acid may be a potential treatment for functional improvement in SMA. The exact mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets associated with metabolic dysregulation in SMA require further investigation."

    "title": "Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Newborn Screening for Spinal Muscular Atrophy in Italy.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Untreated spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the leading genetic cause of death in children younger than 2 years of age. Early detection through newborn screening allows for presymptomatic diagnosis and treatment of SMA. With effective treatments available and reimbursed by the National Health Service, many regions in Italy are implementing newborn screening for SMA. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of universal newborn screening for SMA in Italy. A decision-analytic model assessed the cost effectiveness of newborn screening from the National Health Service perspective in 400,000 newborns. Newborn screening enabling early identification and presymptomatic treatment of SMA was compared with no newborn screening, symptomatic diagnosis, and treatment. Transition probabilities between health states were estimated from clinical trial data. Higher-functioning health states were associated with increased survival, higher utility values, and lower costs. Long-term survival and utilities were extrapolated from scientific literature. Health care costs were collected from official Italian sources. A lifetime time horizon was applied, and costs and outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Newborn screening followed by presymptomatic treatment yielded 324 incremental life-years, 390 incremental quality-adjusted life-years, and reduced costs by €1,513,375 over a lifetime time horizon compared with no newborn screening. Thus, newborn screening was less costly and more effective than no newborn screening. Newborn screening has a 100% probability of being cost effective, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of > €40,000. Newborn screening followed by presymptomatic SMA treatment is cost effective from the Italian National Health Service perspective."

    "abstract": "Spinal and lower extremity degeneration often causes pain and disability. Lower extremity osteoarthritis, eventually leading to total knee- (TKA) and -hip arthroplasty (THA), can alter posture through compensatory mechanisms, potentially causing spinal misalignment and paraspinal muscle (PM) atrophy. This study aims to evaluate the association between prior THA or TKA and PM-degeneration in patients undergoing elective lumbar surgery for degenerative conditions. A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing lumbar surgery for degenerative conditions was conducted. Patients were categorized based on prior THA, TKA, or both. Quantitative analysis of functional cross-sectional area (fCSA) and fat infiltration (FI) of psoas, multifidus (MF), and erector spinae (ES) muscles at L4-level was performed using T2-weighted MRI images. The association between the FI and fCSA of the PM and prior arthroplasty was investigated. Differences were assessed using ANOVA and multivariable linear regression. Overall, 584 patients (60% female, 64 ± 12 years) were included. 66 patients (11%) had prior TKA, 36 patients (6%) THA, and 15 patients (3%) both TKA and THA. Patients with arthroplasty were mostly female (57%) and notably older (p < 0.001). The FI of the MF and the ES was significantly higher in the arthroplasty-group (both p < 0.001). Patients with prior TKA showed significantly higher FI (Est = 4.3%, p = 0.013) and lower fCSA (Est=-0.9 cm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.012) in the MF compared to the non-arthroplasty-group. This study demonstrates a significant lower fCSA and higher FI in the MF among individuals with prior TKA. This highlights the complex knee-spine relationship and how these structures interact with each other."

    "abstract": "Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) progressively impairs gait function, resulting in the need for patients to use a wheelchair approximately 20 years after onset. No reports have investigated the effects of long-term exercise training using the Hybrid Assisted Limb (HAL) in patients with multiple SBMA. This study investigated the effects of long-term exercise training using HAL in patients with SBMA and its effects on the quality of life (QoL). Six courses of HAL treatment were administered to three males with SBMA, and leuprorelin was administered to each patient. Each course had a 4-5 week duration, during which the treatment was performed nine times, with a rest period of at least 2 months between each course. A 2-minute walk test (2MWT) and a 10-m walk test (10MWT) were performed to measure gait ability, and a blood test to measure the serum creatine kinase (CK) and creatinine (CRE) levels was performed before and after each course of treatment. We evaluated QoL using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). The average 2MWT distance improved over 2 years (p = 0.038), and the 10MWT showed neither improvement nor decline. No increase or decrease in serum CK or CRE levels was observed. There were no significant changes in the SF-36 physical, mental, or social summary scores. In combination with leuprorelin therapy, robot-assisted training using HAL maintained gait ability and QoL in patients with SBMA for 2 years."

This study aimed to investigate the association between cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and five neurodegenerative diseases, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and related syndromes, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and disorders of the autonomic nervous system (DANS). This prospective cohort included white British individuals who underwent CMV testing in the UK Biobank from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2021. A Cox proportional hazard model was utilized to estimate the future risk of developing five neurodegenerative diseases in individuals with or without CMV infection, adjusted for batch effect, age, sex, and Townsend deprivation index in Model 1, and additionally for type 2 diabetes, cancer, osteoporosis, vitamin D, monocyte count and leukocyte count in Model 2. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization was employed to validate the potential causal relationship between CMV infection and PD. A total of 8346 individuals, consisting of 4620 females (55.4%) and 3726 males (44.6%) who were white British at an average age of 56.74 (8.11), were included in this study. The results showed that CMV infection did not affect the risk of developing AD (model 1: HR [95% CI] = 1.01 [0.57, 1.81], <i>P</i> = 0.965; model 2: HR = 1.00 [0.56, 1.79], <i>P</i> = 0.999), SMA and related syndromes (model 1: HR = 3.57 [0.64, 19.80], <i>P</i> = 0.146; model 2: HR = 3.52 [0.63, 19.61], <i>P</i> = 0.152), MS (model 1: HR = 1.16 [0.45, 2.97], <i>P</i> = 0.756; model 2: HR = 1.16 [0.45, 2.97], <i>P</i> = 0.761) and DANS (model 1: HR = 0.65 [0.16, 2.66], <i>P</i> = 0.552; model 2: HR = 0.65 [0.16, 2.64], <i>P</i> = 0.543). Interestingly, it was found that participants who were CMV seronegative had a higher risk of developing PD compared to those who were seropositive (model 1: HR = 2.37 [1.25, 4.51], <i>P</i> = 0.009; model 2: HR = 2.39 [1.25, 4.54], <i>P</i> = 0.008) after excluding deceased individuals. This association was notably stronger in males (model 1: HR = 3.16 [1.42, 7.07], <i>P</i> = 0.005; model 2: HR = 3.41 [1.50, 7.71], <i>P</i> = 0.003), but no significant difference was observed in the female subgroup (model 1: HR = 1.28 [0.40, 4.07], <i>P</i> = 0.679; model 2: HR = 1.27 [0.40, 4.06], <i>P</i> = 0.684). However, a bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis did not find a genetic association between CMV infection and PD. The study found that males who did not have a CMV infection were at a higher risk of developing PD. The findings provided a new viewpoint on the risk factors for PD and may potentially influence public health approaches for the disease.

    "abstract": "This study investigated the correlation between Hounsfield units (HU) of the cervical vertebrae and atrophy of the cervical deep paraspinal muscles, namely the multifidus and semispinalis cervicis (SCer), in patients diagnosed with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). The authors retrospectively analyzed data from 136 patients aged 50-79 years (81 males and 55 females) who underwent surgical intervention for DCM. HU measurements of the cancellous bone in the C4 vertebra were acquired through standardized techniques. The authors evaluated fatty infiltration (FI); analyzed functional and vertebral cross-sectional area (CSA) of the multifidus and SCer at the C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7 levels; and analyzed the presence of Modic changes (MCs) and the incidence of axial neck pain. Patients were categorized into group A (n = 56) with mean ± SD HU of 293.3 ± 15.6 and group B (n = 80) with mean ± SD HU of 389.5 ± 10.6. Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in postoperative clinical outcomes (p < 0.05); however, no statistically significant difference was observed (p > 0.05). Significant disparities in HU measurements and visual analog scale (VAS) scores for neck pain were observed between the groups (p < 0.05). The highest VAS score correlated with MCs-1 type (i.e., low signal on T1-weighted images and high signal on T2-weighted images). The functional CSA to vertebral CSA ratios of the multifidus and SCer in group A were markedly reduced compared to those of group B (p < 0.05). No significant difference was noted in functional CSA asymmetry between the groups for both muscles (p > 0.05). Lower HU measurements directly correlated with increased FI in the multifidus (p = 0.002) and SCer (p = 0.035). Furthermore, a strong positive association was found between the functional CSA to vertebral CSA ratio of the multifidus and HU values (p = 0.003), whereas HU measurements and VAS scores exhibited a negative correlation (p = 0.020). Among those patients older than 50 years with DCM, those with decreased HU values demonstrated elevated FI levels in the multifidus and SCer muscles. Moreover, these patients presented with pronounced muscle atrophy, which correlated with axial neck pain. A significant relationship was also identified between MCs and diminished HU values."

We present ctyper, a method that leverages pangenomes to produce allele-specific copy numbers with locally phased variants from next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads. Benchmarking on 3,351 CNV genes, including HLA, SMN, and CYP2D6, and 212 challenging medically relevant (CMR) genes that are poorly mapped by NGS, ctyper captures 96.5% of phased variants with ≥99.1% correctness of copy number on CNV genes and 94.8% of phased variants on CMR genes. Applying alignment-free algorithms, ctyper requires 1.5 hours per genome on a single CPU. The results improve prediction of gene expression compared to known expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) variants. Allele-specific expression quantified divergent expression on 7.94% of paralogs and tissue-specific biases on 4.68% of paralogs. We found reduced expression of SMN-2 due to SMN1 conversion, potentially affecting spinal muscular atrophy, and increased expression of translocated duplications of AMY2B. Overall, ctyper enables biobank-scale genotyping of CNV and CMR genes."

Data was requested from the Ministry of Health via the Access to Information Act. Information was extracted on the epidemiological profile of the beneficiaries of the lawsuits, as well as the expenses spent by the Ministry of Health in cases where the requests were granted. 136 lawsuits were identified, of which 113 (83%) were favorable to patients at a cost of R$ 944.8 million in the period analyzed. Demographic (gender and age), clinical (SMA subtypes, use of ventilatory or nutritional support), and lawsuit (type of legal service) characteristics were not associated with the granting of lawsuits. Prior use of medication (nusinersena or ridisplam) was associated with the dismissal of lawsuits. Of the 113 lawsuits granted in favor of patients, only six (5.3%) would meet the criteria currently established by the National Committee for Health Technology Incorporation - Conitec (children up to six months without ventilatory and nutritional support). R$ 146 million was spent on supplying Zolgensma to children over the age of two, which is outside the recommendation contained in the drug's package leaflet. The Ministry of Health incurs a high cost with the judicialization of Zolgensma for SMA, representing 2.45% of total spending on medicines in the Unified Health System, including spending by the three administrative spheres.

Participants were asked about the relative importance of each symptom, and analysis was conducted to determine how age, education, disease duration, CAG repeat length, and ambulation status relate to symptom prevalence. Hip, thigh, or knee weakness (96.5%), fatigue (96.5%), problems with hands and fingers (95.7%), and limitations with walking (95.7%) were the themes with the highest prevalence in the study population. Ambulatory status was associated with the prevalence of 9 of the 14 themes, and CAG repeat length and education were each associated with 4 of 14 themes. The prevalence of fatigue was reduced in those with a lower CAG repeat length and increased with a longer disease duration. Younger patients reported a higher prevalence of emotional issues. There are a diversity of themes that are important to patients with SBMA. These themes have a variable level of importance to the population with SBMA and represent clinically meaningful outcome measures for future therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by homozygous loss of the <i>SMN1</i> gene with <i>SMN2</i> gene copy number correlating with disease severity. Rarely SMA is caused by a deletion on one allele and a pathogenic variant on the other. The pathogenic missense variant c.5C>G (p.Ala2Gly) correlates with a mild disease phenotype that does not correlate with <i>SMN2</i> copy number. In a mouse model the c.5C>G transgene produces SMN that is thought to form partially functional SMN complexes, but levels in humans have not yet been investigated. We identified two patients with mild SMA caused by a heterozygous deletion of <i>SMN1</i> and the heterozygous variant, c.5C>G. Molecular findings were confirmed with deletion/duplication analysis and Sanger sequencing. Skin fibroblasts were collected and cultured, and SMN expression was analyzed using immunofluorescence. Two patients with slowly progressing mild weakness were confirmed to have heterozygous pathogenic missense variant c.5C>G and a heterozygous deletion of <i>SMN1</i>. Their clinical presentation revealed much milder disease progression than patients with matched <i>SMN2</i> copy number. Analysis of the patients' fibroblasts revealed much higher numbers of SMN nuclear complexes than a patient with a homozygous <i>SMN1</i> deletion and matched <i>SMN2</i> copy number. These case reports reinforce that the rare c.5C>G variant causes mild disease. Furthermore, the analysis of SMA nuclear gems in patient samples supports the theory that the p.Ala2Gly SMN can form partially functional SMN complexes that may carry out essential cellular functions and result in mild disease."

    "abstract": "Rare disorders comprise of ~ 7500 different conditions affecting multiple systems. Diagnosis of rare diseases is complex due to dearth of specialized medical professionals, testing labs and limited therapeutic options. There is scarcity of data on the prevalence of rare diseases in different populations. India being home to a large population comprising of 4600 population groups, of which several thousand are endogamous, is likely to have a high burden of rare diseases. The present study provides a retrospective overview of a cohort of patients with rare genetic diseases identified at a tertiary genetic test centre in India. Overall, 3294 patients with 305 rare diseases were identified in the present study cohort. These were categorized into 14 disease groups based on the major organ/ organ system affected. Highest number of rare diseases (D = 149/305, 48.9%) were identified in the neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental (NMND) group followed by inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) (D = 47/305; 15.4%). Majority patients in the present cohort (N = 1992, 61%) were diagnosed under IEM group, of which Gaucher disease constituted maximum cases (N = 224, 11.2%). Under the NMND group, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (N = 291/885, 32.9%), trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders (N = 242/885; 27.3%) and spinal muscular atrophy (N = 141/885, 15.9%) were the most common. Majority cases of β-thalassemia (N = 120/149, 80.5%) and cystic fibrosis (N = 74/75, 98.7%) under the haematological and pulmonary groups were observed, respectively. Founder variants were identified for Tay-Sachs disease and mucopolysaccharidosis IVA diseases. Recurrent variants for Gaucher disease (GBA:c.1448T > C), β-thalassemia (HBB:c.92.+5G > C), non-syndromic hearing loss (GJB2:c.71G > A), albinism (TYR:c.832 C > T), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CYP21A2:c.29-13 C > G) and progressive pseudo rheumatoid dysplasia (CCN6:c.298T > A) were observed in the present study. The present retrospective study of rare disease patients diagnosed at a tertiary genetic test centre provides first insight into the distribution of rare genetic diseases across the country. This information will likely aid in drafting future health policies, including newborn screening programs, development of target specific panel for affordable diagnosis of rare diseases and eventually build a platform for devising novel treatment strategies for rare diseases."

This review describes the impact of DMT on nutrition outcomes. A systematic search strategy was applied across seven databases until May 2023. Eligible studies measured nutrition outcomes in individuals with SMA on DMT (nusinersen, risdiplam or onasemnogene abeparvovec [OA]) compared to untreated comparators. Nutrition outcomes included anthropometry, feeding route, swallowing dysfunction, dietary intake, dietetic intervention, nutritional biochemistry, metabolism, gastrointestinal issues and energy expenditure. Articles retrieved were screened in duplicate, data were extracted and appraised systematically. Sixty three articles from 54 studies were included; 41% (n = 22) investigated nusinersen in pediatric participants with SMA type 1. Anthropometry (n = 18), feeding route (n = 39), and swallowing dysfunction (n = 18) were the most commonly reported outcomes. In combined pediatric and adult cohorts, BMI z-score remained stable post nusinersen therapy. The proportion of children with SMA requiring enteral nutrition was stable post nusinersen therapy. Ability to thrive at age 1.5 years was higher in children treated in early infancy with OA compared to historical controls. Significant heterogeneity existed across study population characteristics and outcome measures. Nusinersen may prevent deterioration in some nutrition outcomes; and OA in early infancy may be associated with improved nutrition outcomes. Timing of DMT initiation is an important consideration for future nutrition research. Studies investigating nutrition as a primary outcome of DMT, using consistent outcome measures are required for nutritional management strategies for this cohort to be appropriately tailored."

    "title": "Clinically relevant mouse models of severe spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1.",
    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Respiratory Distress (SMARD1) is a lethal infantile disease, characterized by the loss of motor neurons leading to muscular atrophy, diaphragmatic paralysis, and weakness in the trunk and limbs. Mutations in IGHMBP2, a ubiquitously expressed DNA/RNA helicase, have been shown to cause a wide spectrum of motor neuron disease. Though mutations in IGHMBP2 are mostly associated with SMARD1, milder alleles cause the axonal neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2S (CMT2S), and some null alleles are potentially a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Variant heterogeneity studied using an allelic series can be informative in order to create a broad spectrum of models that better exhibit the human variation. We previously identified the nmd2J mouse model of SMARD1, as well as two milder CMT2S mouse models. Here, we used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to create three new, more severe Ighmbp2 mouse models of SMARD1, including a null allele, a deletion of C495 (C495del) and a deletion of L362 (L362del). Phenotypic characterization of the IGHMBP2L362del homozygous mutants and IGHMBP2C495del homozygous mutants respectively show a more severe disease presentation than the previous nmd2J model. The IGHMBP2L362del mutants lack a clear denervation in the diaphragm while the IGHMBP2C495del mutants display a neurogenic diaphragmatic phenotype as observed in SMARD1 patients. Characterization of the Ighmbp2-null model indicated neo-natal lethality (median lifespan = 0.5 days). These novel strains expand the spectrum of SMARD1 models to better reflect the clinical continuum observed in the human patients with various IGHMBP2 recessive mutations."

    "title": "Physiological Features of the Neural Stem Cells Obtained from an Animal Model of Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Their Response to Antioxidant Curcumin.",
    "abstract": "The most prevalent rare genetic disease affecting young individuals is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the telomeric gene survival motor neuron (<i>SMN</i>) <i>1</i>. The high heterogeneity of the SMA pathophysiology is determined by the number of copies of <i>SMN2</i>, a separate centromeric gene that can transcribe for the same protein, although it is expressed at a slower rate. SMA affects motor neurons. However, a variety of different tissues and organs may also be affected depending on the severity of the condition. Novel pharmacological treatments, such as Spinraza, Onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi, and Evrysdi, are considered to be disease modifiers because their use can change the phenotypes of the patients. Since oxidative stress has been reported in SMA-affected cells, we studied the impact of antioxidant therapy on neural stem cells (NSCs) that have the potential to differentiate into motor neurons. Antioxidants can act through various pathways; for example, some of them exert their function through nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2). We found that curcumin is able to induce positive effects in healthy and SMA-affected NSCs by activating the nuclear translocation of NRF2, which may use a different mechanism than canonical redox regulation through the antioxidant-response elements and the production of antioxidant molecules."

    "abstract": "Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) usually manifests as an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterised by pronounced and advancing rigidity, primarily affecting the trunk and proximal muscles. There are various clinical subtypes like classic SPS (truncal stiffness, generalised rigidity and muscle spasms), partial SPS (stiff-limb syndrome) and uncommon forms including progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Camptocormia, defined as forward flexion of the spine in the upright position that disappears in the supine position, without fixed deformity, has been described only in two cases as an initial presentation of Anti glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) autoimmunity. We encountered a young male presenting with a progressive forward-leaning posture and involuntary rhythmic movements in the lower limb. Diagnostic workup included MRI, blood routines, autoimmune screening, genetic testing, lumbar puncture and electromyography. Elevated serum anti-GAD antibody levels, inflammatory CSF and certain other clinical features supported the diagnosis of SPS. Treatment involved benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants and immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulin. This case underscores the importance of considering immune-mediated causes, such as SPS, in patients presenting with camptocormia."

More than 20 years after the link between IGHMBP2 and SMARD1 was revealed, and 10 years after the discovery of the association between IGHMBP2 and CMT2S, the pathogenic mechanism of these diseases is still not well defined. The discovery that IGHMBP2 functions as an RNA/DNA helicase was an important step, but it did not reveal the pathogenic mechanism. Helicases are enzymes that use ATP hydrolysis to catalyse the separation of nucleic acid strands. They are involved in numerous cellular processes, including DNA repair and transcription; RNA splicing, transport, editing and degradation; ribosome biogenesis; translation; telomere maintenance; and homologous recombination. IGHMBP2 appears to be a multifunctional factor involved in several cellular processes that regulate gene expression. It is difficult to determine which processes, when dysregulated, lead to pathology. Here, we summarise our current knowledge of the clinical presentation of IGHMBP2-related diseases. We also overview the available models, including yeast, mice and cells, which are used to study the function of IGHMBP2 and the pathogenesis of the related diseases. Further, we discuss the structure of the IGHMBP2 protein and its postulated roles in cellular functioning. Finally, we present potential anomalies that may result in the neurodegeneration observed in IGHMBP2-related disease and highlight the most prominent ones."

The current study aimed to define functional and central nervous system abnormalities associated with SBMA pathology, their interaction, and to identify novel clinical markers for quantifying disease activity. 27 study participants (12 SBMA; 8 ALS; 7 Control) were recruited. SBMA patients underwent comprehensive motor and sensory functional assessments, and neurophysiological testing. All participants underwent whole-brain structural and diffusion MRI. SBMA patients demonstrated marked peripheral motor and sensory abnormalities across clinical assessments. Increased abnormalities on neurological examination were significantly associated with increased disease duration in SBMA patients (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.85, p < 0.01). Widespread juxtacortical axonal degeneration of corticospinal white matter tracts were detected in SBMA patients (premotor; motor; somatosensory; p < 0.05), relative to controls. Increased axial diffusivity was significantly correlated with total neuropathy score in SBMA patients across left premotor (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59, p < 0.01), motor (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.63, p < 0.01), and somatosensory (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.61, p < 0.01) tracts. The present series has identified involvement of motor and sensory brain regions in SBMA, associated with disease duration and increasing severity of peripheral neuropathy.

We report on two patients with SMA type 1, weighing 20 kg, previously treated with Nusinersen, who received OA infusion at 7 years of age. To our knowledge, these two patients are the heaviest treated in the real-world and we describe their different courses after gene therapy, including liver impairment requiring long-term steroid treatment and additional immunosuppression, with only transitory improvement in functional outcomes. Our cases illustrate how careful risk-benefit consideration is required in treating older and heavier SMA patients with OA, especially in view of the multiple treatment choices available for older patients with SMA."

There is no treatment for FD or SMA-PME. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and gene therapy strategies for the treatment of ACDase deficiency are being investigated. We have previously generated and characterized mouse models of both FD and SMA-PME that recapitulate the symptoms described in patients. Here, we show that HSCT improves lifespan, behavior, hematopoietic system anomalies, and plasma cytokine levels and significantly reduces histiocytic infiltration and ceramide accumulation throughout the tissues investigated, including the CNS, in both models of ACDase-deficient mice. HSCT was also successful in preventing lesion development and significant demyelination of the spinal cord seen in SMA-PME mice. Importantly, we note that only early and generally pre-symptomatic treatment was effective, and kidney impairment was not improved in either model."

Patients who completed the primary study (NCT03921528) could enroll in an open-label extension, during which patients received apitegromab 20 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 4 weeks. Patients were assessed periodically via the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), World Health Organization (WHO) motor development milestones, Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) Daily Activities and Mobility domains, and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue questionnaire. Of the 58 patients enrolled in TOPAZ, 35 were nonambulatory (mean age 7.3 years).

This study seeks to assess the impact of nusinersen, when combined with standard care, on bulbar function, respiratory function, and the necessity for respiratory support among pediatric patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Prospective observational study, involving pediatric SMA patients (Types 1-3) undergoing nusinersen treatment at the Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocío in Spain over at least 24 months. The cohort included 11 SMA type 1 patients, comprising 6 type 1b and 5 type 1c, 12 SMA type 2 patients, and 5 SMA type 3 patients. Twenty-eight pediatric patients were enrolled with the majority being male (<i>n</i> = 20). Patients with type 1 were diagnosed and received treatment significantly earlier than those with types 2 and 3 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Additionally, there was a longer period between diagnosis and the start of treatment in types 2 and 3 (<i>p</i> = 0.002). Follow-up revealed statistically improved functional and respiratory outcomes associated with earlier initiation of nusinersen treatment at 6, 12, and 24 months in all phenotypes. The ability to swallow and feed correctly remained unchanged throughout the study, with SMA type 1c patients maintaining oral feeding in contrast to patients with SMA type 1b. Notably, no deaths were recorded. This study provides important insights into the real-world clinical progress of pediatric SMA patients and their response to nusinersen treatment, highlighting the significance of early intervention for better functional and respiratory outcomes."

Camptocormia is a unique abnormality most seen in PD, defined by a severe forward flexion of the trunk that completely resolves when supine. The condition presents a challenge due to an undefined pathophysiology and optimal therapeutic approach in a high-risk patient population. In this study, we systematically reviewed the literature regarding the use of spine surgery for the treatment of camptocormia in PD. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were systematically queried for studies involving spine surgery as treatment of PD-associated camptocormia. Studies involving nonsurgical management, involving deep brain stimulation, involving noncamptocormic PD patients undergoing surgery, or were out of scope were excluded. The search resulted in 5 studies, with a total of 19 patients with PD with camptocormia who underwent spine surgery (73.7% women). The mean age was 69.5 years (range, 59-83), and the mean PD duration was 69.5 months (range, 36-84). Of 19 patients, 11 required surgical revision (57.9%), with an average of 0.68 revisions per patient (range, 0-2). Radiographic and patient-reported outcomes were inconsistently reported yet showed improvement. Ultimately, 18 patients were reported to have positive outcomes. Despite an increased risk of complication and revision that is inherent to patients with PD, spine surgery has been proven as a reasonable alternative that should be prospectively studied further because 18 of 19 patients had favorable outcomes."

In this study, we show that the heterozygous loss of SYT13 is sufficient to trigger a neurodegenerative phenotype resembling those observed in ALS and SMA. SYT13<sup>+/-</sup> hiPSC-derived MNs displayed a progressive manifestation of typical neurodegenerative hallmarks such as loss of synaptic contacts and accumulation of aberrant aggregates. Moreover, analysis of the SYT13<sup>+/-</sup> transcriptome revealed a significant impairment in biological mechanisms involved in motoneuron specification and spinal cord differentiation. This transcriptional portrait also strikingly correlated with ALS signatures, displaying a significant convergence toward the expression of pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory genes, which are controlled by the transcription factor TP53. Our data show for the first time that the heterozygous loss of a single member of the synaptotagmin family, SYT13, is sufficient to trigger a series of abnormal alterations leading to MN sufferance, thus revealing novel insights into the selective vulnerability of this cell population."

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study, including adult ambulant patients with SMA3, data available on 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE) at baseline and at least at 6 months of treatment with nusinersen. We investigated fatigability, estimated as 10% or higher decrease in walked distance between the first and sixth minute of the 6MWT, at baseline and over the 14-month follow-up. Forty-eight patients (56% females) were included. The 6MWT improved after 6, 10, and 14 months of treatment (p < 0.05). Of the 27 patients who completed the entire follow-up, 37% improved (6MWT distance increase ≥30 m), 48.2% remained stable, and 14.8% worsened (6MWT distance decline ≥30 m). Fatigability was found at baseline in 26/38 (68%) patients and confirmed at subsequent time points (p < 0.05) without any significant change over the treatment period. There was no correlation between fatigability and SMN2 copy number, sex, age at disease onset, age at baseline, nor with 6MWT total distance and baseline HFMSE score. Fatigability was detected at baseline in approximately 2/3 of SMA3 walker patients, without any correlation with clinical features, included motor performance.

But if only 1 disease is treated while neglecting the other, the treatment effect will be compromised. Here, for the first time, we report a case from China diagnosed with both these diseases and treated properly. A boy was admitted to the Children's Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University (Jinan, China) due to \"limb weakness for 19 months\" when he was 22 months old. Considering that the child's motor function development is delayed, we made a comprehensive examinations including inherited metabolic diseases and found a significantly increase of phenylalanine concentration in the blood which indicating PKU. Combined with his typical clinical manifestations of SMA, target capture sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technologies were used for genetic confirmation. SMA and PKU was confirmed. The child was treated with risdiplam and low phenylalanine formula immediately when he was diagnosed with both SMA and PKU. The child showed remarkable improvement in motor function and significant decrease of blood phenylalanine concentration after treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of SMA combined with PKU. This case expands our understanding of diagnosis for synchronous SMA and PKU and highlights the importance of comprehensive examinations and the utilizing of various genetic testing methods to make an accurate diagnosis of genetic diseases, which may help avoiding the progressive damage caused by certain genetic disease with insidious clinical symptoms."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an intractable neuromuscular disorder primarily caused by homozygous deletions in exon 7 of the SMN1 gene. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of patients with SMA have a significant impact on prognosis, and several therapies have recently been developed. Current SMA screening tests require a significant turnaround time to identify patients with suspected SMA, due both to the interval between the birth of a newborn and the collection of blood for newborn mass screening and the difficulty in distinguishing between SMN1 and SMN2, a paralog gene that requires testing in specialized laboratories. The aim of this study was therefore to develop a novel SMA screening assay that can be rapidly performed in ordinary hospitals and clinics to overcome these issues. We designed over 100 combinations of forward and reverse primers with 3' ends targeting SMN1-specific sites around exon 7, and evaluated their specificity and amplification efficiency by quantitative PCR to identify the best primer pair. Furthermore, we performed a single-stranded tag hybridization assay after PCR. To evaluate the accuracy and practicality of the newly developed assay, we analyzed saliva specimens from five patients with SMA and two SMA carriers collected in an outpatient clinic and DNA specimens from three patients with SMA and four SMA carriers from a biobank, together with those from healthy individuals. DNA and raw saliva specimens from all patients with SMA demonstrated a biallelic loss of SMN1, whereas those from carriers and healthy individuals did not. The results of 50 independent experiments were consistent for all samples. The assay could be completed within one hour. This simple and convenient new screening tool has the potential to allow patients with SMA to receive disease-modifying therapies within a shorter timeframe."

A retrospective analysis was performed on 60 children who received onasemnogene abeparvovec. All these children received corticosteroids. They were followed up for up to 3 months. Motor function assessments were performed before and after the gene therapy. Comprehensive clinical evaluations, including pulmonary functions, were performed at baseline and the 3-month mark. Forty-three percent were male, and the mean age at the time of infusion was 29.6 months (SD ± 17.2). The mean weight was 10.1 kg (SD 2.6). All children demonstrated marked improvements in motor function within 3 months of gene therapy administration. No adverse effects attributable to corticosteroid therapy were observed. Positive clinical outcomes, including increased ventilator-free intervals, reduced antibiotic dependency, and fewer hospital admissions, were reported among children with invasive ventilation via tracheostomy. This study demonstrates the favorable tolerability and promising responses to onasemnogene abeparvovec in invasively ventilated pediatric patients. Early improvements in motor function, as observed within 3 months post-treatment, suggest its potential as a viable therapeutic option for this vulnerable patient population."

    "abstract": "A retrospective cross-sectional study. To evaluate the relationship between lumbar foraminal stenosis (LFS) and multifidus muscle atrophy. The multifidus muscle is an important stabilizer of the lumbar spine. In LFS, the compression of the segmental nerve can give rise to radicular symptoms and back pain. LFS can impede function and induce atrophy of the segmentally innervated multifidus muscle. Patients with degenerative lumbar spinal conditions who underwent posterior spinal fusion for degenerative lumbar disease from December 2014 to February 2024 were analyzed. Multifidus fatty infiltration (FI) and functional cross-sectional area (fCSA) were determined at the L4 upper endplate axial level on T2-weighted MRI scans using dedicated software. The severity of LFS was assessed at all lumbar levels and sides using the Lee classification (grade: 0-3). For each level, Pfirrmann and Weishaupt gradings were used to assess intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) and facet joint osteoarthritis (FJOA), respectively. Multivariable linear mixed models were run for the LFS grade of each level and side separately as the independent predictor of multifidus FI and fCSA. Each analysis was adjusted for age, sex, BMI, as well as FJOA and IVDD of the level corresponding to the LFS. A total of 216 patients (50.5% female) with a median age of 61.6 years (interquartile range=52.0-69.0) and a median BMI of 28.1 kg/m 2 (interquartile range=24.8-33.0) were included. Linear mixed model analysis revealed that higher multifidus FI [estimate (CI)=1.7% (0.1-3.3), P =0.043] and lower fCSA [-18.6 mm 2 (-34.3 to -2.6), P =0.022] were both significantly predicted by L2-L3 level LFS severity. The observed positive correlation between upper segment LFS and multifidus muscle atrophy points toward compromised innervation. This necessitates further research to establish the causal relationship and guide prevention efforts."

    "title": "U1 snRNA interactions with deep intronic sequences regulate splicing of multiple exons of spinal muscular atrophy genes.",
    "abstract": "The U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) forms ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) such as U1 snRNP and U1-TAF15 snRNP. U1 snRNP is one of the most studied RNPs due to its critical role in pre-mRNA splicing in defining the 5' splice site (5'ss) of every exon through direct interactions with sequences at exon/intron junctions. Recent reports support the role of U1 snRNP in all steps of transcription, namely initiation, elongation, and termination. Functions of U1-TAF15 snRNP are less understood, though it associates with the transcription machinery and may modulate pre-mRNA splicing by interacting with the 5'ss and/or 5'ss-like sequences within the pre-mRNA. An anti-U1 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that sequesters the 5' end of U1 snRNA inhibits the functions of U1 snRNP, including transcription and splicing. However, it is not known if the inhibition of U1 snRNP influences post-transcriptional regulation of pre-mRNA splicing through deep intronic sequences. We examined the effect of an anti-U1 ASO that sequesters the 5' end of U1 snRNA on transcription and splicing of all internal exons of the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) genes, <i>SMN1</i> and <i>SMN2</i>. Our study was enabled by the employment of a multi-exon-skipping detection assay (MESDA) that discriminates against prematurely terminated transcripts. We employed an SMN2 super minigene to determine if anti-U1 ASO differently affects splicing in the context of truncated introns. We observed substantial skipping of multiple internal exons of <i>SMN1</i> and <i>SMN2</i> triggered by anti-U1 treatment. Suggesting a role for U1 snRNP in interacting with deep intronic sequences, early exons of the <i>SMN2</i> super minigene with truncated introns were resistant to anti-U1 induced skipping. Consistently, overexpression of engineered U1 snRNAs targeting the 5'ss of early <i>SMN1</i> and <i>SMN2</i> exons did not prevent exon skipping caused by anti-U1 treatment. Our results uncover a unique role of the U1 snRNA-associated RNPs in splicing regulation executed through deep intronic sequences. Findings are significant for developing novel therapies for SMA based on deep intronic targets."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic progressive neuromuscular disease. Nusinersen is the first disease modifying drug approved to treat patients with SMA. Our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of nusinersen treatment on motor function in children with SMA. A retrospective analysis was conducted on the data of 52 genetically confirmed SMA patients from November 2020 to September 2023. Motor function was assessed based on standardized scales from baseline to 14 months of follow-up. Of patients in this study, the majority had SMA type 2 (40/52, 76.9%), 5 (9.6%) and 7 (13.5%) patients had SMA types 1 and 3, respectively. The median disease duration was 11 months (range 0-52), and the median age at initiation of treatment was 44.5 months (range 5-192). Motor function of all the patients with SMA improved from baseline to 14 months of follow-up. Mean increases of 4.6-point (<i>p</i> = 0.173), 4.7-point (<i>p</i> = 0.021) and 2.7-point (<i>p</i> = 0.013) were observed from baseline to 14 months of follow-up for the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders scores, the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) and the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), respectively. Increased disease duration and age of treatment initiation were negatively correlated with the changes in HFMSE scores (<i>r</i> = -0.567, <i>p</i> = 0.043; <i>r</i> = -0.771 and <i>p</i> = 0.002, respectively). Similar results were observed for the RULM scores (<i>r</i> = -0.714, <i>p</i> = 0.014; <i>r</i> = -0.638 and <i>p</i> = 0.035, respectively). Our study suggested that 14 months of treatment with nusinersen was effective and improved the motor function of children with SMA types 1, 2, or 3. In addition, disease duration and age at treatment initiation were negatively correlated with treatment outcome in the patients."

To translate, cross-culturally adapt and validate the HFMSE to Brazilian Portuguese. The translation process and cross-cultural adaptation followed international guidelines recommendations. The reliability and applicability of the Brazilian version consisted of the application of the HFMSE (in Brazilian Portuguese) to 20 patients with types 2 and 3 SMA. Two examiners assessed the participants for interrater reliability, through the analysis of Kappa reliability agreement (k) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The HFMSE was successfully translated and cross culturally adapted to Brazilian Portuguese. Twenty participants with types 2 and 3 SMA were enrolled in the study (type 2 = 6; type 3 = 14). The ICC for the total score showed very high reliability (ICC =1.00), and the reliability of each of the items individually was considered excellent (Kappa > 0.80). The Brazilian version of the HFMSE proved to be valid and reliable for the evaluation of SMA patients older than 2 years with the ability to sit and/or walk."

    "abstract": "Senataxin is an RNA:DNA helicase that plays an important role in the resolution of RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) formed during transcription. R-loops are involved in the regulation of biological processes such as immunoglobulin class switching, gene expression and DNA repair. Excessive accumulation of R-loops results in DNA damage and loss of genomic integrity. Senataxin is critical for maintaining optimal levels of R-loops to prevent DNA damage and acts as a genome guardian. Within the nucleus, senataxin interacts with various RNA processing factors and DNA damage response and repair proteins. Senataxin interactors include survival motor neuron and zinc finger protein 1, with whom it co-localizes in sub-nuclear bodies. Despite its ubiquitous expression, mutations in senataxin specifically affect neurons and result in distinct neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 4 and ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2, which are attributed to the gain-of-function and the loss-of-function mutations in senataxin, respectively. In addition, low levels of senataxin (loss-of-function) in spinal muscular atrophy result in the accumulation of R-loops causing DNA damage and motor neuron degeneration. Senataxin may play multiple functions in diverse cellular processes; however, its emerging role in R-loop resolution and maintenance of genomic integrity is gaining attention in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we highlight the role of senataxin in R-loop resolution and its potential as a therapeutic target to treat neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "Neuralgic amyotrophy, also known as Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS), is characterized by severe pain and muscle wasting affecting the anterior body, including the head, shoulder, upper limb, and chest wall. Often triggered by an antecedent event, such as infection, PTS encompasses various conditions historically identified as separate entities. In 1948, Parsonage and Turner unified these conditions under the term neuralgic amyotrophy based on shared features of intense pain and muscular atrophy. Recent studies have highlighted PTS as a spectrum disorder with diverse manifestations, including pure sensory neuropathy, extensive neuropathy, spinal accessory nerve involvement, and diaphragmatic palsy. We reviewed 26 documented cases of PTS following SARS-CoV-2 infection, emphasizing the importance of considering PTS in individuals with a history of COVID-19 due to varied clinical presentations. Standardized diagnostic methods and comprehensive evaluations are crucial for accurate diagnosis and management. Future research should focus on consistent evaluation methods and employing a comprehensive differential diagnosis approach."

    "abstract": "Whether neurodevelopmental defects underlie postnatal neuronal death in neurodegeneration is an intriguing hypothesis only recently explored. Here, we focus on spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neuromuscular disorder caused by reduced survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein levels leading to spinal motor neuron (MN) loss and muscle wasting. Using the first isogenic patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model and a spinal cord organoid (SCO) system, we show that SMA SCOs exhibit abnormal morphological development, reduced expression of early neural progenitor markers, and accelerated expression of MN progenitor and MN markers. Longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing reveals marked defects in neural stem cell specification and fewer MNs, favoring mesodermal progenitors and muscle cells, a bias also seen in early SMA mouse embryos. Surprisingly, SMN2-to-SMN1 conversion does not fully reverse these developmental abnormalities. These suggest that early neurodevelopmental defects may underlie later MN degeneration, indicating that postnatal SMN-increasing interventions might not completely amend SMA pathology in all patients."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> In recent years, rapid advances in diagnosis and treatment have been observed in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients. The introduction of modern therapies and screening tests has significantly changed the clinical picture of the disease. The previous classification has, therefore, been replaced by new phenotypes: non-sitters, sitters, and walkers, defined by the patient's functional level. However, despite the change in the clinical picture of the disease, patients still suffer from accompanying structural disorders such as scoliosis or joint contractures. Their presence also significantly affects the acquisition of subsequent motor skills. Due to this, monitoring structural changes and ensuring therapists are aware of improvements or declines in patient functionality are essential components of clinical practice. This study aims to compare the assessment of structural and functional changes after a 12-month follow-up in SMA patients who have already experienced the effects of the disease and are now receiving modern therapy. <b>Methods:</b> We present a study of 34 SMA patients being treated with modern therapies and tested twice 12 months apart. The participants were tested using structural measurements and validated scales such as The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) and Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE). <b>Results:</b> During the 12-month follow-up, patients showed deteriorating, non-statistically significant structural changes. We also proved that patients showed a trend toward functional improvement. Analyzing the individual scale items, we distinguished which participants obtained the maximum score for a given parameter and no longer had an opportunity to improve during the second examination. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our study proved that most patients improved overall motor function. The examination of structural measurements should become a standard in the evaluation of SMA patients."

In our study, we aimed to compare quality of life (QoL) outcomes in patients with SMA in relation to the degree of motor limitation and comorbidities, mainly internal medicine diseases. <b>Methods</b>: We included 35 adult patients with SMA and 36 healthy volunteers. Thorough medical histories were taken focusing on comorbidities, and neurological examinations incorporating assessments using functional motor scales were performed. QoL was assessed based on the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. <b>Results</b>: SMA patients and controls were comparable in terms of scores in the questionnaire's main domains. SMA patients presented significantly higher levels of satisfaction with their medical care than controls. Patients with more advanced SMA had significantly better scores on certain questions, e.g., those related to health satisfaction or leisure activities. A total of 71.4% of SMA patients had comorbidities, ranging from one to three in individual patients. SMA patients with comorbidities did not show worse QoL. Negative correlations were found between the number of comorbidities in SMA patients and individual questions on the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. <b>Conclusions</b>: Patients with SMA were satisfied with their medical care. Better scores on some questions in more advanced SMA may have been due to better adaptation to disease-related limitations. The presence of single comorbidities did not affect QoL, but a higher number of comorbidities negatively correlated with QoL."

    "abstract": "During the expanded neonatal screening program conducted in 2023, we analyzed samples obtained from 1,227,130 out of 1,256,187 newborns in the Russian Federation in order to detect 5q spinal muscular atrophy (5q SMA). Within the 253-sample risk group formed based on the results of the first screening stage, 5 samples showed a discrepancy between the examination results obtained via various screening methods and quantitative MLPA (used as reference). The discrepancy between the results was caused by the presence of either a c.835-18C>T intronic variant or a c.842G>C p.(Arg281Thr) missense variant in the <i>SMN1</i> gene, both of which are located in the region complementary to the sequences of annealing probes for ligation and real-time PCR. Three newborns had the c.835-18C>T variant in a compound heterozygous state with a deletion of exons 7-8 of the <i>SMN1</i> gene, one newborn with two copies of the <i>SMN1</i> gene had the same variant in a heterozygous state, and one newborn had both variants-c.835-18C>T and c.842G>C p.(Arg281Thr)-in a compound heterozygous state. Additional examination was carried out for these variants, involving segregation analysis in families, carriage analysis in population cohorts, and RNA analysis. Based on the obtained results, according to the ACMG criteria, the c.835-18C>T intronic variant should be classified as likely benign, and the c.842G>C p.(Arg281Thr) missense substitution as a variant of uncertain clinical significance. All five probands are under dynamic monitoring. No 5q SMA symptoms were detected in these newborns neonatally or during a 1-year follow-up period."

Understanding the impact of communicating the diagnosis of SMA on the mental health of patients and their families and the differences between the Northeast (endogamous region) and the other regions of Brazil (non-endogamous ones). Cross-sectional study obtained through a structured questionnaire about the moment of receiving the SMA diagnosis, containing the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. The sample consisted of 100 volunteers from all regions of Brazil, 47 patients diagnosed with SMA and 53 family members present at the time of the diagnosis. There was a predominance of females (83%) and homogeneity between the groups for the variables gender, age, color, education, religion, and SMA subtype (1, 2, 3, and 4). The Northeast region, representing 43% of the sample, despite being less economically favored, showed greater satisfaction with medical care and inclusion in health services, with less self-reported psychological trauma and fewer signs of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to the moment of receiving the diagnosis. The non-endogamous regions, in turn, reported the presence of strong waves of emotion, sleep problems, feelings of irritability, anger, and the presence of bad thoughts related to this situation. The feeling of inclusion in health services and satisfaction with medical care in the endogamous region had a positive impact on the mental health of those involved, reducing psychological trauma and signs of PTSD arising from the communication of the SMA diagnosis."

We conducted a cross-sectional online survey on SMA patients from June 9, 2023, to June 30, 2023, through the Meier Advocacy & Support Center using data from the Center's database and electronic questionnaires. The rehabilitation situation of the participants over the past 14 months were investigated. Logistic binary regression was used to analyze the relationship between Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory(PedsQL™) scores and rehabilitation. A total of 186 questionnaires were finally analyzed. Only 29 patients did not rehabilitated in the past 14 months. A significant correlation between age and type of rehabilitation, as well as between age and duration of rehabilitation.

This study included 30 family caregivers of children with SMA (SMA Type 1:12, SMA Type 2:10, and SMA Type 3:8) and 31 family caregivers of healthy peers. Sleep quality and daytime sleepiness of family caregivers were evaluated using the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (EPS), consecutively. Demographic characteristics of children with SMA and healthy peers were similar (p > 0.05). The mean ages of family caregivers of children with SMA and healthy peers were 36.07 ± 5.84 and 35.26 ± 5.02 years, respectively (p = 0.6). The PSQI scores of family caregivers of children with SMA (7.50 ± 3.90 points) were lower than those of healthy peers (4.09 ± 1.97 points) (p < 0.001). There was no difference in PSQI scores between SMA types (p = 0.8). Also, no difference was found between SMA types and between SMA and healthy peers in terms of EPS (p > 0.05). Family caregivers of children with SMA had poor sleep quality but similar daytime sleepiness compared with those of healthy peers. Among SMA types, family caregivers had similar sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. It was demonstrated that the sleep quality of family caregivers should be taken into consideration in the disease management of SMA."

    "abstract": "Various ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) often function in the form of membraneless organelles derived from multivalence-driven liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and arginine methylation, govern the assembly and disassembly of membraneless organelles. This study reveals that asymmetric dimethylation of arginine can create extra binding sites for multivalent Tudor domain-containing proteins like survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein, thereby lowering the threshold for LLPS of RNPs, such as fused in sarcoma (FUS). Accordingly, FUS hypomethylation or knockdown of SMN disrupts the formation and transport of neuronal granules in axons. Wild-type SMN, but not the spinal muscular atrophy-associated form of SMN, SMN-Δ7, rescues neuronal defects due to SMN knockdown. Importantly, a fusion of SMN-Δ7 to an exogenous oligomeric protein is sufficient to rescue axon length defects caused by SMN knockdown. Our findings highlight the significant role of arginine methylation-enabled multivalent interactions in LLPS and suggest their potential impact on various aspects of neuronal activities in neurodegenerative diseases."

This cross-sectional, retrospective, observational study was carried out on 12 patients harboring the c.794C>T (p.Ser265Phe) missense pathogenic variant in GARS1. The patients' clinical data, nerve conduction studies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and intraepidermal nerve fiber density in skin biopsies were reviewed. The mean age at onset was 9.5 years; the intrinsic hand muscles were affected before or at the same time as the distal leg musculature. The clinical examination revealed greater weakness of the distal muscles, with a more pronounced involvement of the thenar complex and the first dorsal interosseous in upper limbs. Electrophysiological studies were concordant with an exclusively motor axonal neuropathy. A pathologic split hand index was found in six patients. Muscle MRI showed predominant fatty infiltration and atrophy of the anterolateral and superficial posterior compartment of the legs. Most patients reported distal pinprick sensory loss. A reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density was evident in skin biopsies from proximal and distal sites in nine patients. GARS1 variants may produce a dHMN phenotype with \"split hand\" and sensory disturbances, even when sensory nerve conduction studies are normal. This could be explained by a dysfunction of sensory neurons in the dorsal ganglion that is reflected as a reduction of dermal nerve endings in skin biopsies without a distal gradient."

Clinical symptoms manifest in the first weeks to months of life in the most severe cases, resulting in progressive symmetrical weakness and atrophy of the proximal voluntary muscles. Approximately 95% of SMA patients present with homozygous deletion of the <i>SMN1</i> gene. With multiple available therapies preventing symptom development and slowing disease progression, newborn screening for SMA is essential to identify at-risk individuals. From 2018 to 2023, a total of 239,844 infants were screened. 13 positive screens were confirmed to have SMA. An additional case was determined to be a false positive. We are not aware of any false-negative cases. All patients were seen promptly, with diagnosis confirmed within 1 week of the initial clinical visit. Patients were treated with nusinersen or onasemnogene abeparvovec. Treated patients with two copies of <i>SMN2</i> are meeting important developmental milestones inconsistent with the natural history of type 1 SMA. Patients with 3-4 copies of <i>SMN2</i> follow normal developmental timelines. Newborn screening is an effective tool for the early identification and treatment of patients with SMA. Presymptomatic treatment dramatically shifts the natural history of SMA, with most patients meeting appropriate developmental milestones. Patients with two copies of <i>SMN2</i> identified through newborn screening constitute a neurogenetic emergency. Due to the complexities of follow-up, a multidisciplinary team, including close communication with the newborn screening program, is required to facilitate timely diagnosis and treatment."

In Phase 2, we developed quality assurance dried blood spot materials made with transduced lymphoblast cell lines established from de-identified SMA patients, carriers, and unaffected donors. In 2021, CDC implemented Phase 3, a proficiency testing program, that now supports 115 NBS labs around the world. We are currently completing Phase 4, which includes the implementation of an external SMA quality control material program. Also, during this time, CDC has provided individual technical assistance to NBS programs and bench training to NBS scientists during our annual molecular workshop.

Herein, we present the results of the SMA NBS during the one-year pilot project in Croatia and verify the suitability of the Targeted qPCR<sup>™</sup> SMA assay for SMA NBS. The pilot project started on 1 March 2023 in the Department for Laboratory Diagnostics of the University Hospital Center Zagreb. A total of 32,655 newborns were tested. Five SMA patients were detected, and their diagnoses were confirmed by the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay. There have been no false positive or false negative results, to our knowledge so far. The incidence of SMA determined during the pilot study is consistent with the SMA incidence data from other European countries."

    "title": "Systematic Review of Newborn Screening Programmes for Spinal Muscular Atrophy.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic neuromuscular disorder causing the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Recent studies suggest greater effectiveness of treatment in the presymptomatic stage. This systematic review synthesises findings from 37 studies (and 3 overviews) of newborn screening for SMA published up to November 2023 across 17 countries to understand the methodologies used; test accuracy performance; and timing, logistics and feasibility of screening. All studies screened for the homozygous deletion of <i>SMN1</i> exon 7. Most (28 studies) used RT-PCR as the initial test on dried blood spots (DBSs), while nine studies also reported second-tier tests on DBSs for screen-positive cases. Babies testing positive on DBSs were referred for confirmatory testing via a range of methods. Observed SMA birth prevalence ranged from 1 in 4000 to 1 in 20,000. Most studies reported no false-negative or false-positive cases (therefore had a sensitivity and specificity of 100%). Five studies reported either one or two false-negative cases each (total of six cases; three compound heterozygotes and three due to system errors), although some false-negatives may have been missed due to lack of follow-up of negative results. Eleven studies reported false-positive cases, some being heterozygous carriers or potentially related to heparin use. Time to testing and treatment varied between studies. In conclusion, several countries have implemented newborn screening for SMA in the last 5 years using a variety of methods. Implementation considerations include processes for timely initial and confirmatory testing, partnerships between screening and neuromuscular centres, and timely treatment initiation."

    "abstract": "Severe spinal deformities and previous spinal orthopedic instrumentation may result in substantial technical challenges for nusinersen delivery through lumbar puncture in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The aim of this paper was to review our experience with ultrasound-guided cervical puncture as an alternative approach for the intrathecal administration of nusinersen. This was a retrospective medical record review of transverse interlaminar ultrasound-guided C1-C2 puncture for nusinersen delivery in SMA patients. The details of puncture, complications, and success rate of the procedure were summarized. There were four patients who received a total of 13 cervical punctures for nusinersen delivery. All procedures were technically successful with no major complications. Full doses of nusinersen were delivered intrathecally. Transverse interlaminar ultrasound-guided C1-C2 puncture is an alternative approach for administering nusinersen if lumbar puncture fails. The success of the technique requires a thorough preprocedural evaluation of cervical spine imaging, sound knowledge of the cervical sonoanatomy and careful manipulation of the needle."

    "abstract": "Defect in the SMN1 gene causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which shows loss of motor neurons, muscle weakness and atrophy. While current treatment strategies, including small molecules or viral vectors, have shown promise in improving motor function and survival, achieving a definitive and long-term correction of SMA's endogenous mutations and phenotypes remains highly challenging. We have previously developed a CRISPR-Cas9 based homology-independent targeted integration (HITI) strategy, enabling unidirectional DNA knock-in in both dividing and non-dividing cells in vivo. In this study, we demonstrated its utility by correcting an SMA mutation in mice. When combined with Smn1 cDNA supplementation, it exhibited long-term therapeutic benefits in SMA mice. Our observations may provide new avenues for the long-term and efficient treatment of inherited diseases."

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that neuroinflammation may play a role in the progression of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and this may influence the efficacy of antisense oligonucleotide treatment. This study explored the biomarkers associated with SMA and the efficacy of nusinersen therapy. Fifteen patients with SMA were enrolled and their motor function (World Health Organization motor milestone, Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE), and Revised Upper Limb Module [RULM] scores, and 6-minute walking test) was evaluated before, during (63 days), and after (6 months) nusinersen treatment. The concentrations of monocyte chemoactive protein 1 (MCP1), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin (IL)-10 in the cerebrospinal fluid were measured at the indicated time points, and their correlations with motor function were analysed. A significant increase in MCP1 was observed after 6 month's treatment compared with that before treatment, while TNF-α gradually decreased over the course of treatment. IL-10 levels were negatively correlated with HFMSE scores before treatment, and reductions in IL-10 levels were correlated with improvements in RULM scores. This study suggests that neuroinflammation may be associated with the severity of SMA and with the therapeutic effects of nusinersen, which could have clinical implications in the treatment of SMA."

    "title": "AAV-NRIP gene therapy ameliorates motor neuron degeneration and muscle atrophy in ALS model mice.",
    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by progressive motor neuron (MN) degeneration, leading to neuromuscular junction (NMJ) dismantling and severe muscle atrophy. The nuclear receptor interaction protein (NRIP) functions as a multifunctional protein. It directly interacts with calmodulin or α-actinin 2, serving as a calcium sensor for muscle contraction and maintaining sarcomere integrity. Additionally, NRIP binds with the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) for NMJ stabilization. Loss of NRIP in muscles results in progressive motor neuron degeneration with abnormal NMJ architecture, resembling ALS phenotypes. Therefore, we hypothesize that NRIP could be a therapeutic factor for ALS. We used SOD1 G93A mice, expressing human SOD1 with the ALS-linked G93A mutation, as an ALS model. An adeno-associated virus vector encoding the human NRIP gene (AAV-NRIP) was generated and injected into the muscles of SOD1 G93A mice at 60 days of age, before disease onset. Pathological and behavioral changes were measured to evaluate the therapeutic effects of AAV-NRIP on the disease progression of SOD1 G93A mice. SOD1 G93A mice exhibited lower NRIP expression than wild-type mice in both the spinal cord and skeletal muscle tissues. Forced NRIP expression through AAV-NRIP intramuscular injection was observed in skeletal muscles and retrogradely transduced into the spinal cord. AAV-NRIP gene therapy enhanced movement distance and rearing frequencies in SOD1 G93A mice. Moreover, AAV-NRIP increased myofiber size and slow myosin expression, ameliorated NMJ degeneration and axon terminal denervation at NMJ, and increased the number of α-motor neurons (α-MNs) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) in SOD1 G93A mice. AAV-NRIP gene therapy ameliorates muscle atrophy, motor neuron degeneration, and axon terminal denervation at NMJ, leading to increased NMJ transmission and improved motor functions in SOD1 G93A mice. Collectively, AAV-NRIP could be a potential therapeutic drug for ALS."

    "abstract": "SMA is a hereditary neuromuscular disease that causes progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Several studies have shown that the burden of SMA is very high at many levels. Functional assessment tools currently used do not completely address the impact of the disease in patients' life. The objective of this qualitative study was to identify aspects of SMA that are relevant to patients and to design items useful for assessment purposes. Five focus group sessions were run during an annual SMA families meeting in Madrid, Spain. Focus groups were composed by parents of SMA type I children, sitter children type II-III, parents of sitter children type II-III, adult patients, and parents of walker children. Two trained facilitators conducted the focus groups using a semi-structured guideline to cover previously agreed topics based on the input of a Scientific and Patient Advisory Committee. The guideline was adapted for the different groups. According to what was communicated by participants, SMA entails a high burden of disease for both patients and their parents. Burden was perceived in physical, psychological, and social areas. Patient's physical domain was the most relevant for participants, especially for parents of non-ambulant children, followed by limitations of motor scales to capture all changes, parents psychological burden, treatment expectations and patient's psychological burden. Ten domains were the main areas identified as impacted by the disease: mobility and independence, fatigue and fatigability, infections and hospital consultations, scoliosis and contractures, vulnerability, pain, feeding, time spent in care, breathing, and sleep and rest. This study confirms the necessity of evaluating other aspects of the disease that are not assessed in the functional motor scale. Measures of other aspects of the disease, such as pain, fatigue, feeding, should be also considered. A patient-reported outcomes instrument measuring such aspects in a valid and reliable way would be very useful. This study generated a list of new items relevant to be systematically measured in the assessment of the impact of SMA on the patients' everyday life."

This study aimed to determine the feasibility and preliminary effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) using functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling on changes in thigh muscle volume and muscle strength, in patients with incomplete SCI. Eight incomplete SCI patients (mean age 50 years; 6 women) with stable SCI paraplegia (mean 6.75 years since injury) participated in the HIIT FES cycling (85%-90% peak Watts; 4 × 4-min intervals) three times a week (over 6 weeks). The main outcomes were adherence, participant acceptability, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were muscle strength (peak torque) and leg volume changes. Our findings revealed that the program was well-received by participants, with high levels of adherence, positive feedback, and satisfaction, suggesting that it could be a promising option for individuals seeking to enhance their lower body strength and muscle mass. Additionally, all participants successfully completed the training without any serious adverse events, indicating that the program is safe for use. Finally, we found that the 6-week HIIT FES leg cycling exercise program resulted in notable improvements in isometric peak torque of the quadriceps (range 13.9%-25.6%), hamstring muscle (18.2%-23.3%), and leg volume (1.7%-18.2%). This study highlights HIIT FES leg cycling exercise program potential as an effective intervention for improving lower limb muscle function."

    "title": "Complex <i>SMN</i> Hybrids Detected in a Cohort of 31 Patients With Spinal Muscular Atrophy.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by the loss or presence of point pathogenic variants in the <i>SMN1</i> gene. The main positive modifier of the SMA phenotype is the number of copies of the <i>SMN2</i> gene, a paralog of <i>SMN1</i>, which only produces around 10%-15% of functional SMN protein. The <i>SMN2</i> copy number is inversely correlated with phenotype severity; however, discrepancies between the SMA type and the <i>SMN2</i> copy number have been reported. The presence of <i>SMN2-SMN1</i> hybrids has been proposed as a possible modifier of SMA disease. We studied 31 patients with SMA, followed at a single center and molecularly diagnosed by Multiplex Ligand-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), with a specific next-generation sequencing protocol to investigate their <i>SMN2</i> genes in depth. Hybrid characterization also included bioinformatics haplotype phasing and specific PCRs to resolve each <i>SMN2-SMN1</i> hybrid structure. We detected <i>SMN2-SMN1</i> hybrid genes in 45.2% of the patients (14/31), the highest rate reported to date. This represents a total of 25 hybrid alleles, with 9 different structures, of which only 4 are detectable by MLPA. Of particular interest were 2 patients who presented 4 <i>SMN2-SMN1</i> hybrid copies each and no pure <i>SMN2</i> copies, an event reported here for the first time. No clear trend between the presence of hybrids and a milder phenotype was observed, although 5 of the patients with hybrid copies showed a better-than-expected phenotype. The higher hybrid detection rate in our cohort may be due to both the methodology applied, which allows an in-depth characterization of the <i>SMN</i> genes and the ethnicity of the patients, mainly of African origin. Although hybrid genes have been proposed to be beneficial for patients with SMA, our work revealed great complexity and variability between hybrid structures; therefore, each hybrid structure should be studied independently to determine its contribution to the SMA phenotype. Large-scale studies are needed to gain a better understanding of the function and implications of <i>SMN2-SMN1</i> hybrid copies, improving genotype-phenotype correlations and prediction of the evolution of patients with SMA."

Clinical data from children with clinically and genetically confirmed 5qSMA from a double center in western China (the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University and the Second Hospital of West China of Sichuan University). All children were younger than 18 years of age. Patients were assessed for motor function and underwent blood and fluid tests before each nusinersen injection. At 14-month follow-up, 100% of children had improved their HFMSE (Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded) score, 83.6% had improved their CHOP INTEND (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders) score, and 66.6% had improved their RULM (Revised Upper Limb Module) score by ≥3 points from baseline, and their 6MWT (6-min walk test) was 216.00 ± 52.08 m longer than at baseline. The age of the child at the start of treatment was negatively correlated with the clinical efficacy of nusinersen; the younger the child, the better the response to treatment. No significant adverse effects affecting the treatment and quality of life of the child were observed during the treatment of SMA with nusinersen. This study concluded that nusinersen is clinically beneficial for children with SMA in western China, with mild adverse effects."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Optimal health care for patients born with spinal muscular atrophy can only be achieved through neonatal screening. Neonatal screening for this incurable, progressive genetic disease that most often causes death in childhood has been introduced in many countries, and its usefulness has been proven with the outstanding results of early diagnosis and initiation of therapy. Objective: To evaluate the neonatal screening research program in Hungary, to examine the reliability, public demand, cost-effectiveness of the chosen screening method, and the health benefits of early treatment; in the case of success, proposing its automatic inclusion in the newborn screening panel. Method: Screening for spinal muscular atrophy from the blood sample taken for routine screenings with free and voluntary consent of the parents. In the case of a positive screening test, confirmatory molecular genetic test to check the screening test and to determine the copy number of the paralogous gene influencing the therapy of choice. The choice of the therapy and treatment center in the framework of genetic counseling, based on a joint decision made with the parents. After the examinations necessary to rule out contraindications of the chosen medicine and to assess the individual fairness of the financing, the drug treatment is carried out with the permission, and then the patients are followed up on a long-term basis. Results: During the 14 months of the program, the popularity of screening was outstanding, covering 75.45% of newborn infants. In 9 children, the disease was confirmed at newborn age and in the asymptomatic stage, and drug treatment took place at an average age of 36.2 days; 8 patients were asymptomatic, 1 was symptomatic. At an average age of 218.5 (93–346) days after the start of asymptomatic therapy, the children’s somato-mental development was appropriate for their age, technology dependence due to breathing or swallowing disorders did not occur, and they did not need aids. In 1 patient, partial respirator dependence occurred due to the symptoms that appeared before the start of therapy. The screening test proved to be reliable, there were no false-positive results during the research period, and we are not aware of any false-negative results. Discussion: The Hungarian screening program showed similar results to the international data, confirming the health benefits associated with spinal muscular atrophy. Conclusion: Based on the results, we consider it justified to automatically include newborn spinal muscular atrophy screening in the general newborn screening program in Hungary.

    "abstract": "5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a progressive autosomal recessive motor neuron disease. We aimed to assess the effects of nusinersen on motor function and electrophysiological parameters in adolescent and adult patients with 5q SMA. Patients with genetically confirmed 5q SMA were eligible for inclusion, and clinical data were collected at baseline (V1), 63 days (V4), 180 days (V5), and 300 days (V6). The efficacy of nusinersen was monitored by encompassing clinical assessments, including the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE), 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and percent-predicted Forced Vital Capacity in sitting position (FVC%) and Compound Muscle Action Potential (CMAP) amplitude. The patients were divided into \"sitter\" and \"walker\" subgroups according to motor function status. 54 patients were screened, divided into \"sitter\" (N = 22) and \"walker\" (N = 32), with the mean age at baseline of 27.03 years (range 13-53 years). The HFMSE in the walker subgroup increased significantly from baseline to V4 (mean change +2.32-point, P = 0.004), V5 (+3.09, P = 0.004) and V6 (+4.21, P = 0.005). The patients in both the sitter and walker subgroup had no significant changes in mean RULM between V1 and the following time points. Significant increases in CMAP amplitudes were observed in both upper and lower limbs after treatment. Also, patients with RULM ≥ 36 points showed significant CMAP improvements. Our analysis predicted that patients with CMAP amplitudes of trapezius ≥ 1.76 mV were more likely to achieve significant motor function improvements. Nusinersen effectively improves motor function and electrophysiological data in adolescent and adult patients with SMA. This is the first report on the CMAP amplitude changes in the trapezius after treatment in patients with SMA. The CMAP values effectively compensate for the ceiling effect observed in the RULM, suggesting that CMAP could serve as an additional biomarker for evaluating treatment efficacy."

On clinical examination, the animal was much smaller than expected and had hair similar to that of puppies and areas of hyperpigmentation on the head and dorsocervical and dorsothoracic cranial regions. Radiographic examination revealed fractures in both femurs and severe generalized osteoporosis. Given the unfavourable prognosis, the animal was euthanized. Necropsy revealed generalized pallor, muscular atrophy of the pelvic limbs and little reserve of subcutaneous adipose tissue. Both femurs had complete and closed diaphyseal fractures. The second lumbar vertebra was severely reduced in length as a result of a fracture, with dorsal displacement of the vertebral body towards the vertebral canal and compression of the spinal cord. Long bones and vertebrae had severe cortical thinning, enlargement of the medullary canal and reduced resistance. The thyroid gland was not in its normal anatomical location. A pale red nodule (1.0 × 0.4 cm) in the serosa of the middle third of the trachea, close to the thoracic entrance, was confirmed as ectopic thyroid tissue. Microscopically, the bones had evidence of growth arrest and severe osteoporosis. The ectopic thyroid nodule was hyperplastic with severe hypertrophy of follicular cells. The spinal cord was compressed by vertebral fractures and had focally extensive and severe myelomalacia. Based on the pathological features, the case was diagnosed as thyroid dysgenesis characterized by eutopic thyroid agenesis and ectopic thyroid tissue, associated with interruption of bone growth with dwarfism, osteoporosis and spontaneous secondary fractures with compression of the lumbar spinal cord."

Previous ultrasound-assisted techniques for lumbar puncture used the angle of the probe as the needle trajectory; however, reproducing the angle is difficult and increases the number of needle manipulations. In response, we developed a technique that eliminated both the craniocaudal and lateromedial angulation of the needle trajectory to overall improve this technique. We assessed the feasibility and safety of this method in patients with scoliosis and identify factors related to difficult lumbar puncture. Patients with spinal muscular atrophy and scoliosis who were referred to the anesthesia department for intrathecal nusinersen administrations were included. With a novel approach that utilized patient position and geometry, lumbar puncture was performed under ultrasound guidance. Success rates, performance times and adverse events were recorded. Clinical-demographic and spinal radiographic data pertaining to difficult procedures were analyzed. Success was achieved in all 260 (100%) lumbar punctures for 44 patients, with first pass and first attempt success rates of 70% (183/260) and 87% (226/260), respectively. Adverse events were infrequent and benign. Higher BMI, greater skin dural sac depth and smaller interlaminar size might be associated with greater difficulty in lumbar puncture. The novel ultrasound-assisted horizontal and perpendicular interlaminar needle trajectory approach is an effective and safe method for lumbar puncture in patients with spinal deformities. This method can be reliably performed at the bedside and avoids other more typical and complex imaging such as computed tomography guided procedure."

    "abstract": "Balloon dilation therapy (BDT) is used to treat pharyngeal dysphagia in patients with impaired upper esophageal sphincter (UES) relaxation due to cricopharyngeal dysfunction. However, the mechanism underlying this immediate effect remains unclear. Here, we present a case in which we investigated the immediate effects of BDT on UES dysfunction using high-resolution manometry (HRM). A 67-year-old man was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). He gradually developed dysphagia, and a gastrostomy was performed. Despite continuing oral intake of supplemental nutrition, the patient developed dysphagia. Videofluoroscopic (VF) examination of swallowing revealed pharyngeal residue, while HRM showed weak pharyngeal contractility and impaired UES opening. BDT was performed to address the UES dysfunction. Immediately following BDT, VF demonstrated improved pharyngeal bolus passage. As for the UES function during swallowing, HRM revealed that the UES relaxation duration was significantly longer and the UES nadir pressure was significantly decreased. The patient continued the BDT before oral intake. HRM revealed immediate and prolonged UES opening with decreased UES pressure during swallowing as an immediate effect of BDT. This suggests that these findings represent the mechanisms underlying dysphagia in this patient with SMA. BDT resulted in an immediate improvement in UES function, potentially leading to dysphagia improvement. BDT should be combined with conventional rehabilitation for impaired UES opening. However, further studies are needed to confirm the long-term effectiveness of BDT for dysphagia due to SMA."

Currently, the clinical manifestations and treatment regimens of patients with all types of AE exhibit similarities. However, the presence of immunological distinctions among different types of AE remains uncertain. In this study, we prospectively collected clinical data, as well as blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients diagnosed with MOG antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) or GFAP astrocytopathy (GFAP-A), in order to assess changes in inflammatory biomarkers such as immunoglobulin oligoclonal bands, cytokines in serum and CSF, as well as peripheral blood lymphocyte subtypes within different subsets. To further distinguish the immune response in patients with MOGAD and GFAP-A from that of healthy individuals, we prospectively recruited 20 hospitalized patients diagnosed with AE. Among them, 15 (75%) tested positive for MOG antibodies, 4 (20%) tested positive for GFAP antibodies, and 1 (5%) tested positive for both MOG and GFAP antibodies. These patients were then followed up for a period of 18 months. Compared to healthy controls (HC), AE patients exhibited elevated levels of MIP-1beta, SDF-1alpha, IL-12p70, IL-5, IL-1RA, IL-8 and decreased levels of IL-23, IL-31, IFN-alpha, IL-7, TNF-beta and TNF-alpha in serum. The CSF of AE patients showed increased levels of IL-1RA, IL-6 and IL-2 while decreased levels of RANTES, IL-18,IL-7,TNF-beta,TNF-alpha,RANTES,Eotaxin,and IL-9. The level of MCP-1 in the CSF of GFAP-A patients was found to be lower compared to that of MOGAD patients, while RANTES levels were higher. And the levels of IL-17A, Eotaxin, GRO-alpha, IL-8, IL-1beta, MIP-1beta were higher in the CSF of patients with epilepsy. The presence of intrathecal immune responses is also observed in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). However, no biomarker was found to be associated with disease severity in patients with AE. Among the 17 patients, recovery was observed, while 2 patients experienced persistent symptoms after an 18-month follow-up period. Additionally, within one year of onset, 8 patients had a single recurrence. Therefore, the immunological profiles of MOGAD and GFAP-A patients differ from those of normal individuals, and the alterations in cytokine levels may also exhibit a causal association with the clinical presentations, such as seizure."

    "abstract": "5q-Spinal muscular atrophy (5q-SMA) is one of the most common neuromuscular diseases due to homozygous mutations in the <i>SMN1</i> gene. This leads to a loss of function of the <i>SMN1</i> gene, which in the end determines lower motor neuron degeneration. Since the generation of the first mouse models of SMA neuropathology, a complex degenerative involvement of the neuromuscular junction and peripheral axons of motor nerves, alongside lower motor neurons, has been described. The involvement of the neuromuscular junction in determining disease symptoms offers a possible parallel therapeutic target. This narrative review aims at providing an overview of the current knowledge about the pathogenesis and significance of neuromuscular junction dysfunction in SMA, circulating biomarkers, outcome measures and available or developing therapeutic approaches."

    "title": "Polyglutamine (PolyQ) Diseases: Navigating the Landscape of Neurodegeneration.",
    "abstract": "Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats encoding proteins with abnormally expanded polyglutamine tract. A total of nine polyQ disorders have been identified, including Huntington's disease, six spinocerebellar ataxias, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). The diseases of this class are each considered rare, yet polyQ diseases constitute the largest group of monogenic neurodegenerative disorders. While each subtype of polyQ diseases has its own causative gene, certain pathologic molecular attributes have been implicated in virtually all of the polyQ diseases, including protein aggregation, proteolytic cleavage, neuronal dysfunction, transcription dysregulation, autophagy impairment, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although animal models of polyQ disease are available helping to understand their pathogenesis and access disease-modifying therapies, there is neither a cure nor prevention for these diseases, with only symptomatic treatments available. In this paper, we analyze data from the CAS Content Collection to summarize the research progress in the class of polyQ diseases. We examine the publication landscape in the area in effort to provide insights into current knowledge advances and developments. We review the most discussed concepts and assess the strategies to combat these diseases. Finally, we inspect clinical applications of products against polyQ diseases with their development pipelines. The objective of this review is to provide a broad overview of the evolving landscape of current knowledge regarding the class of polyQ diseases, to outline challenges, and evaluate growth opportunities to further efforts in combating the diseases."

    "title": "Smartphone-Based Assessment of Mobility and Manual Dexterity in Adult People with Spinal Muscular Atrophy.",
    "abstract": "More responsive, reliable, and clinically valid endpoints of disability are essential to reduce size, duration, and burden of clinical trials in adult persons with spinal muscular atrophy (aPwSMA). The aim is to investigate the feasibility of smartphone-based assessments in aPwSMA and provide evidence on the reliability and construct validity of sensor-derived measures (SDMs) of mobility and manual dexterity collected remotely in aPwSMA. Data were collected from 59 aPwSMA (23 walkers, 20 sitters and 16 non-sitters) and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HC). SDMs were extracted from five smartphone-based tests capturing mobility and manual dexterity, which were administered in-clinic and remotely in daily life for four weeks. Reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients, ICC) and construct validity (ability to discriminate between HC and aPwSMA and correlations with Revised Upper Limb Module, RULM and Hammersmith Functional Scale - Expanded HFMSE) were quantified for all SDMs. The smartphone-based assessments proved feasible, with 92.1% average adherence in aPwSMA. The SDMs allowed to reliably assess both mobility and dexterity (ICC > 0.75 for 14/22 SDMs). Twenty-one out of 22 SDMs significantly discriminated between HC and aPwSMA. The highest correlations with the RULM were observed for SDMs from the manual dexterity tests in both non-sitters (Typing, ρ= 0.78) and sitters (Pinching, ρ= 0.75). In walkers, the highest correlation was between mobility tests and HFMSE (5 U-Turns, ρ= 0.79). This exploratory study provides preliminary evidence for the usability of smartphone-based assessments of mobility and manual dexterity in aPwSMA when deployed remotely in participants' daily life. Reliability and construct validity of SDMs remotely collected in real-life was demonstrated, which is a pre-requisite for their use in longitudinal trials. Additionally, three novel smartphone-based performance outcome assessments were successfully established for aPwSMA. Upon further validation of responsiveness to interventions, this technology holds potential to increase the efficiency of clinical trials in aPwSMA."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) affects the nervous system. Symptoms appear in early childhood and include muscle weakness, difficulty walking, seizures, and cognitive decline. Despite introducing various therapies to restore acid ceramidase function or reduce ceramide accumulation and gene therapy to correct genetic mutations, there are still unknown underlying molecular mechanisms related to this disorder. This article reports a novel variant c.118G>C in the ASAH1 gene. The patient presented with clinical manifestations such as progressive muscle weakness and myoclonic convulsions. Clinical features and electrophysiological investigations revealed a motor neuron disease and generalized epileptic discharge. A significant temporal interval was observed between the initial diagnosis of SMA and the subsequent manifestation of myoclonic seizures. The proband was genetically assessed through whole exome sequencing (WES) followed by variant confirmation and bioinformatics analysis. According to this article's findings and previous research, further diagnostic testing and management are needed to determine the severity and progression of the patient's condition."

Therefore, thorough and comprehensive reports on the safety of nusinersen in large, real-world populations are necessary. This study aimed to mine the adverse event (AE) signals related to nusinersen through the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. We extracted reports of AEs with nusinersen as the primary suspect from FAERS between December 2016 and March 2023. Reporting odds ratio (ROR) and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) were used for AE signal detection. We extracted a total of 4807 suspected AE cases with nusinersen as the primary suspect from the FAERS database. Among them, 106 positive signals were obtained using the ROR and BCPNN. The highest frequency reported systemic organ class was general disorders and administration site conditions. Common clinical AEs of nusinersen were detected in the FAERS database, such as pneumonia, vomiting, back pain, headache, pyrexia, and post-lumbar puncture syndrome. In addition, we identified potential unexpected serious AEs through disproportionality analysis, including sepsis, seizure, epilepsy, brain injury, cardiorespiratory arrest, and cardiac arrest. Analyzing large amounts of real-world data from the FAERS database, we identified potential new AEs of nusinersen by disproportionate analysis. It is advantageous for health care professionals and pharmacists to concentrate on effectively managing high-risk AEs of nusinersen, improve medication levels in clinical settings, and uphold patient medication safety."

    "abstract": "Motor disability in children is evident in diagnoses such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, or spinal muscular atrophy, among others, due to altered movement and postural patterns. This becomes more evident as the child grows and can be treated with physical therapy. The effectiveness of early interventions in facilitating an improvement in daily life activities varies depending on the child's condition. In this context, the use of exoskeletons has emerged in recent years as a valuable resource for conducting more efficient therapy processes. This work describes the design (both structural and functional) and preliminary usability and functional validation of a 3D-printed passive upper limb exoskeleton. The goal is to provide clinicians with an efficient, low-cost device that is both easy to manufacture and assemble and, in a gamified environment, serves as an assistive device to physical therapy. The device features 5 degrees of freedom, enabling both a pro-gravity and an anti-gravity mode, controlled by a series of elastic bands. This gives rise to a dual operating mode, offering assistance or resistance to different arm, forearm, and shoulder-dependent movements. Usability validation conducted by exoskeleton users showed average results in all aspects rated above 3.8 out of 5, which implies levels of satisfaction between \"quite satisfied\" and \"very satisfied\". The analysis of metrics recorded during therapy, such as the Hand Path Ratio and Success Rate (capturing user movements using an inertial sensor in the gamified environment), as well as the range of motion, reveals quantifiable improvements which can be attributed to the use of the exoskeleton: the Hand Path Ratio tended to approach 1 throughout sessions in almost all the users, the Success Rate remained stable (as users consistently were capable of completing the assigned tasks), and the range of motion showed that all patients achieved improvements of more than 10 degrees in some of the tested movements). These functional validation processes involved the participation of 7 children with varying levels of upper limb neuro-motor impairments."

    "abstract": "To investigate the epidemiological characteristics and mutation spectrum of monogenic diseases in Chinese population through a large-scale, multicenter carrier screening. This study was conducted among a total of 33 104 participants (16 610 females) from 12 clinical centers across China.Carrier status for 223 genes was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing and different PCR methods. The overall combined carrier frequency was 55.58% for 197 autosomal genes and 1.84% for 26 X-linked genes in these participants.Among the 16 669 families, 874 at-risk couples (5.24%) were identified.Specifically, 584 couples (3.50%) were at risk for autosomal genes, 306(1.84%) for X-linked genes, and 16 for both autosomal and X-linked genes.The most frequently detected autosomal at-risk genes included GJB2(autosomal recessive deafness type 1A, 393 couples), HBA1/HBA2(α-thalassemia, 36 couples), PAH (phenylketonuria, 14 couples), and SMN1(spinal muscular atrophy, 14 couples).The most frequently detected X-linked at-risk genes were G6PD (G6PD deficiency, 236 couples), DMD (Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 23 couples), and FMR1(fragile X syndrome, 17 couples).After excluding GJB2 c.109G>A, the detection rate of at-risk couples was 3.91%(651/16 669), which was lowered to 1.72%(287/16 669) after further excluding G6PD.The theoretical incidence rate of severe monogenic birth defects was approximately 4.35‰(72.5/16 669).Screening for a battery of the top 22 most frequent genes in the at-risk couples could detect over 95% of at-risk couples, while screening for the top 54 genes further increased the detection rate to over 99%. This study reveals the carrier frequencies of 223 monogenic genetic disorders in the Chinese population and provides evidence for carrier screening strategy development and panel design tailored to the Chinese population.In carrier testing, genetic counseling for specific genes or gene variants can be challenging, and the couples need to be informed of these difficulties before testing and provided with options for not screening these genes or gene variants."

    "title": "Mutant androgen receptor induces neurite loss and senescence independently of ARE binding in a neuronal model of SBMA.",
    "abstract": "Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a slowly progressing neuromuscular disease caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ)-encoding CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, leading to AR aggregation, lower motor neuron death, and muscle atrophy. AR is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates neuronal architecture and promotes axon regeneration; however, whether AR transcriptional functions contribute to disease pathogenesis is not fully understood. Using a differentiated PC12 cell model of SBMA, we identified dysfunction of polyQ-expanded AR in its regulation of neurite growth and maintenance. Specifically, we found that in the presence of androgens, polyQ-expanded AR inhibited neurite outgrowth, induced neurite retraction, and inhibited neurite regrowth. This dysfunction was independent of polyQ-expanded AR transcriptional activity at androgen response elements (ARE). We further showed that the formation of polyQ-expanded AR intranuclear inclusions promoted neurite retraction, which coincided with reduced expression of the neuronal differentiation marker β-III-Tubulin. Finally, we revealed that cell death is not the primary outcome for cells undergoing neurite retraction; rather, these cells become senescent. Our findings reveal that mechanisms independent of AR canonical transcriptional activity underly neurite defects in a cell model of SBMA and identify senescence as a pathway implicated in this pathology. These findings suggest that in the absence of a role for AR canonical transcriptional activity in the SBMA pathologies described here, the development of SBMA therapeutics that preserve this activity may be desirable. This approach may be broadly applicable to other polyglutamine diseases such as Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxias."

    "abstract": "Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a slowly progressing disease with limited sensitive biomarkers that support clinical research. We analyzed plasma and serum samples from patients with SBMA and matched healthy controls in multiple cohorts, identifying 40 highly reproducible SBMA-associated proteins out of nearly 3,000 measured. These proteins were robustly enriched in gene sets of skeletal muscle expression and processes related to mitochondria and calcium signaling. Many proteins outperformed currently used clinical laboratory tests (e.g., creatine kinase [CK]) in distinguishing patients from controls and in their correlations with clinical and functional traits in patients. Two of the 40 proteins, Ectodysplasin A2 receptor (EDA2R) and Repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMA), were found to be associated with decreased survival and body weight in a mouse model of SBMA. In summary, we identified what we believe to be a robust and novel set of fluid protein biomarkers in SBMA that are linked with relevant disease features in patients and in a mouse model of disease. Changes in these SBMA-associated proteins could be used as an early predictor of treatment effects in clinical trials."

This study investigated how different HTA bodies address this uncertainty in their assessments. A total of 49 HTA reports from 6 national HTA bodies, assessing 9 medicines for spinal muscular atrophy, cystic fibrosis, and hypercholesterolemia, were included. In these reports, 81 relative effectiveness assessments and 45 cost-effectiveness assessments were performed on an indication level. We collected information on included trials, assessment outcomes, uncertainty regarding the long-term effectiveness, proposed managed entry agreements, and reassessments. Uncertainty regarding the long-term effectiveness was an important consideration in almost all cost-effectiveness assessments (91%) and three-quarters of relative effectiveness assessments (74%), despite differences in methodologies among HTA bodies. There were considerable differences in the amount and type of long-term effectiveness data included by HTA bodies due to timing and inclusion criteria. In total 23 managed entry agreements were proposed of which 14 were linked to uncertainty regarding the long-term effectiveness. In addition, 13 reassessments were performed of which 4 led to an increase in patient access because of more available long-term effectiveness data. Uncertainty regarding the long-term effectiveness is an important challenge for HTA bodies. There are large differences in the acceptance of evidence among HTA bodies, which leads to heterogeneity in the inclusion of available long-term effectiveness data for decision making. In cases with large uncertainty regarding the long-term effectiveness, outcome-based agreements and reassessments are used by HTA bodies, but differently between HTA bodies and indications."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a disease that results from mutations in the Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) gene 1, leading to muscle atrophy due to motor neurons degeneration. SMN plays a crucial role in the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes via binding to the arginine-glycine rich C-terminal tails of Sm proteins recognized by SMN Tudor domain. E134K Tudor mutation, cause of the more severe type I SMA, compromises the SMN-Sm interaction without a perturbation of the domain fold. By molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the mechanism of Tudor-SmD1 interaction, and the effects on it of E134K mutation. It was observed that E134 is crucial to catch the positive dimethylated arginines (DMRs) of the SmD1 tail that, wrapping around the acidic Tudor surface, enters a central DMR into an aromatic cage. The flexible cage residue Y130 must be blocked from the wrapped tail to assure a stable binding. The charge inversion in E134K mutation causes the loss of a critical anchor point, disfavoring the tail wrapping and leaving Y130 free to swing, leading to DMR detachments and exposition of the C-terminal region of the tail. This could suggest new hypotheses regarding a possible autoimmune response by anti-Sm autoantibodies."

Evidence on real-world healthcare resource use (HRU) and costs among patients taking nusinersen remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate real-world HRU and costs associated with nusinersen use through US claims databases. <b>Patients & methods:</b> Using the Merative™ MarketScan<sup>®</sup> Research Databases, patients with SMA receiving nusinersen were identified from commercial (January 2017 to June 2020) and Medicaid claims (January 2017 to December 2019). Those likely to have complete information on the date of nusinersen initiation and continuous enrollment 12 months pre- and post-index (first record of nusinersen treatment) were retained. Number and costs (US$ 2020) of inpatient admissions and emergency department (ED) visits, unrelated to nusinersen administration, were evaluated for 12 months pre- and post-nusinersen initiation and stratified by age: pediatric (<18 years) and adult (≥18 years). <b>Results:</b> Overall, 103 individuals treated with nusinersen were retained: 59 were pediatric (mean age [range]: 9 [1-17] years), and 44 were adults (30 [18-63] years). Inpatient admissions decreased by 41% for pediatrics and 67% for adults in the 12 months post-treatment versus the 12 months pre-treatment. Average inpatient admission costs per patient for the pediatric cohort decreased by 63% ($22,903 vs $8466) and by 79% ($13,997 vs $2899) for the adult cohort when comparing the 12 months pre-index with the 12 months post-index period. Total ED visits and ED visit costs decreased by 8% and 35%, respectively, for the overall cohort over the 12-month period pre- and post-index. <b>Conclusion:</b> Using US claims databases, nusinersen treatment in pediatric and adult patients was associated with reductions in HRU and costs over a 12-month period post-treatment initiation relative to the pre-treatment period."

Fourteen consecutive patients who underwent C2 recapping laminoplasty around C1-2 level were enrolled. To evaluate muscle preservation effect, the authors conducted a morphological measurement of extensor muscles between the operated and nonoperated side. Two surgeons measured the cross-sectional area (CSA) of obliquus capitis inferior (OCI) and semispinalis cervicis (SSC) muscle before and after surgery to determine atrophy rates (ARs). Additionally, we examined range of motion (ROM), sagittal vertical axis (SVA), neck visual analogue scale (VAS), Neck Disability Index (NDI), and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score to assess potential changes in alignment and consequent clinical outcomes following posterior cervical surgery. We measured the CSA of OCI and SSC before surgery, and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Based on these measurements, the AR of the nonoperated SSC was 0.1% ± 8.5%, the AR of the operated OCI was 2.0% ± 7.2%, and the AR of the nonoperated OCI was -0.7% ± 5.1% at the 12 months after surgery. However, the AR of the operated side's SSC was 11.2% ± 12.5%, which is a relatively higher value than other measurements. Despite the atrophic change of SSC on the operated side, there were no prominent changes observed in SVA, C0-2 ROM, and C2-7 ROM between preoperative and 12 months postoperative measurements, which were 11.8 ± 10.9 mm, 16.3° ± 5.9°, and 48.7° ± 7.7° preoperatively, and 14.1 ± 11.6 mm, 16.1° ± 7.2°, and 44.0° ± 10.3° at 12 months postoperative, respectively. Improvement was also noted in VAS, NDI, and JOA scores after surgery with JOA recovery rate of 77.3% ± 29.6%.

A failed drug candidate could be repurposed if a receptor, such as an aptamer, were created that binds the compound with high specificity.

Here, we report the development of a small (48-nucleotide) RNA aptamer for branaplam with a dissociation constant of ∼150 nM. Starting with a combinatorial RNA pool integrating the secondary and tertiary structural scaffold of a Guanine-I riboswitch aptamer interspersed with regions of random sequence, in vitro selection yielded aptamer candidates for branaplam. Reselection and rational design were employed to improve binding of a representative branaplam aptamer candidate. A resulting variant retains the pseudoknot and two of the paired elements (P2 and P3) from the scaffold but lacks the enclosing paired element (P1) that is essential for the function of the natural Guanine-I riboswitch aptamer. A second combinatorial RNA pool based on the scaffold for TPP (thiamin pyrophosphate) riboswitches also yielded a candidate offering additional opportunities for branaplam aptamer development."

Of the 132 patients, 62.9% experienced adverse events (AEs). Two patients experienced mild AEs (aseptic meningitis and myalgia) considered to be related to nusinersen by the investigator, with no sequelae. These data underscore the significance of nusinersen in Chinese pediatric patients with SMA regarding motor function improvement or stability, and support recommendations on nusinersen treatment by Chinese SMA guidelines and continuous coverage of nusinersen by basic medical insurance."

Data were extracted into a predefined template and a descriptive summary of these data was provided. Ninety-one publications were included: 43 reported data on respiratory, swallowing, feeding, and/or speech function outcomes. Data highlighted early loss of respiratory function for patients with Type 1 SMA, with ventilatory support typically required by 12 months of age. Patients with Type 2 or 3 SMA were at risk of losing respiratory function over time, with ventilatory support initiated between the first and fifth decades of life. Swallowing and feeding difficulties, including choking, chewing problems, and aspiration, were reported in patients across the SMA spectrum. Swallowing and feeding difficulties, and a need for non-oral nutritional support, were reported before 1 year of age in Type 1 SMA, and before 10 years of age in Type 2 SMA. Limited data relating to other bulbar functions were collated. Natural history data demonstrate that untreated patients with SMA experience respiratory and bulbar function deterioration, with a more rapid decline associated with greater disease severity. This study provides a comprehensive repository of natural history data on bulbar function in SMA, and it highlights that consistent assessment of outcomes in this area is necessary to benefit understanding and approval of new treatments."

    "title": "Quality considerations and major pitfalls for high throughput DNA-based newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency and spinal muscular atrophy.",
    "abstract": "Many newborn screening programs worldwide have introduced screening for diseases using DNA extracted from dried blood spots (DBS). In Germany, DNA-based assays are currently used to screen for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and sickle cell disease (SCD). This study analysed the impact of pre-analytic DNA carry-over in sample preparation on the outcome of DNA-based newborn screening for SCID and SMA and compared the efficacy of rapid extraction versus automated protocols. Additionally, the distribution of T cell receptor excision circles (TREC) on DBS cards, commonly used for routine newborn screening, was determined. Contaminations from the punching procedure were detected in the SCID and SMA assays in all experimental setups tested. However, a careful evaluation of a cut-off allowed for a clear separation of true positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications. Our rapid in-house extraction protocol produced similar amounts compared to automated commercial systems. Therefore, it can be used for reliable DNA-based screening. Additionally, the amount of extracted DNA significantly differs depending on the location of punching within a DBS. Newborn screening for SMA and SCID can be performed reliably. It is crucial to ensure that affected newborns are not overlooked. Therefore a carefully consideration of potential contaminating factors and the definition of appropriate cut-offs to minimise the risk of false results are of special concern. It is also important to note that the location of punching plays a pivotal role, and therefore an exact quantification of TREC numbers per μl may not be reliable and should therefore be avoided."

The data used in this study were obtained via a web-based cross-sectional survey. Parents of pediatric patients with SMA completed the proxy-reported EQ-5D-Y-3 L, PedsQL 4.0, and PROMIS-25 measures. Information about socioeconomic and health status was also obtained. The ceiling and floor effects, factorial structure, convergent validity, and known-group validity of the three measures were assessed. Three hundred and sixty-three parents of children aged from 5 to 12 completed the questionnaires. Strong floor effects were observed for the physical function components of the PROMIS-25 (41.3%) and PedsQL 4.0 (67.8%). For EQ-5D-Y-3 L, 84.6% of the respondents reported having \"a lot of\" problems with the dimensions \"walking\" and \"looking after myself.\" Minimal ceiling or floor effects were observed for the EQ-5D-Y-3 L index value. The confirmatory factor analysis supported a six-factor structure for the PROMIS-25, but did not support a four-factor structure for the PedsQL 4.0. All hypothesized correlations of the dimensions among the three measures were confirmed, with coefficients ranging from 0.28 to 0.68. Analysis of variance showed that EQ-5D-Y-3 L demonstrated better known-group validity than the other two measures in 14 out of 16 comparisons. The EQ-5D-Y-3 L showed better discriminant power than the other two measures. The physical health dimensions of all three measures showed the significant floor effects. These findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of these measures at capturing and quantifying the impact of SMA on patients' health-related quality of life."

    "abstract": "Several studies have shown the efficacy of new disease-modifying therapies in slowing down type II SMA progression using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE). This research aims to enhance understanding of activity changes across age groups post-nusinersen treatment using shift analysis, compared with untreated individuals. Retrospective data from the, international SMA consortium (iSMAc) dataset were analyzed, assessing individual item changes over 12 months. Shift analysis was used to determine the gain or loss of abilities, defining \"gain\" as a positive change between scores from 0 to either 1 or 2 and \"loss\" as a negative change from either 2 or 1 to 0. The cohort included 130 SMA II patients who underwent 12-month assessments from their first nusinersen dose, with age range between 0.6 and 49.6 years. One-third of the entire cohort experienced at least a loss in one activity, while 60% experienced a gain, particularly notable in children aged 2.5 to 5 years and 5 to 13 years. Overall, the study demonstrates a positive impact of nusinersen treatment on SMA II patients, showing a trend of increased activity gains and decreased probability of ability loss across different age groups."

The mutant androgen receptor protein, characterized by polyglutamine expansion, is prone to misfolding and forms aggregates in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in the brain in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy patients. These aggregates alter protein-protein interactions and compromise transcriptional activity. In this study, we reported that in both cultured N2a cells and mouse brain, mutant androgen receptor with polyglutamine expansion causes reduced expression of mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor. Overexpression of mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor ameliorated the neurotoxicity of mutant androgen receptor through the inhibition of mutant androgen receptor aggregation. Conversely, knocking down endogenous mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor in the mouse brain exacerbated neuronal damage and mutant androgen receptor aggregation. Our findings suggest that inhibition of mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor expression by mutant androgen receptor is a potential mechanism underlying neurodegeneration in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy."

We also describe recent advancements in research and the clinical significance of molecular biomarkers for spinal muscular atrophy, which are classified as either specific or non-specific biomarkers. This review provides new insights into the pathogenesis of spinal muscular atrophy, the mechanism of biomarkers in response to drug-modified therapies, the selection of biomarker candidates, and would promote the development of future research. Furthermore, the successful utilization of biomarkers may facilitate the implementation of gene-targeting treatments for patients with spinal muscular atrophy."

    "abstract": "Nusinersen has shown significant functional motor benefit in the milder types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Less is known on the respiratory outcomes in patients with nusinersen-treated SMA. The aim of this study was to describe changes in respiratory function in pediatric patients with SMA type 2 and 3 on regular treatment with nusinersen within the iSMAc international cohort and to compare their trajectory with the natural history (NH) data published by the consortium in 2020. This is a 5-year retrospective observational study of pediatric SMA type 2 and nonambulant type 3 (age ≤18 years) treated with nusinersen. The primary objective was to compare the slopes of decline in forced vital capacity % predicted (FVC% pred.), FVC, and age when FVC dropped below 60% between the treated patients and a control group from the natural history cohort. Data on peak cough flow and the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and cough assist were collected. Data were available for 69 treated patients, 53 were SMA type 2 and 16 type 3. The mean (SD) age at first injection was 8.5 (3.2) and 9.7 (3.7) years, respectively. The median (interquartile range) treatment duration was 1 (0.7; 1.9) and 1.2 (0.9; 1.9) years, respectively. At the time of the first nusinersen injection, 24 of 52 (46%) patients with SMA type 2 and 2 of 16 (13%) patients with SMA type 3 were on NIV. Forty-three of 53 (81%) and 4 of 16 (25%) patients used cough device. FVC% pred. in treated patients with SMA type 2 declined annually by 2.3% vs 3.9% in NH (<i>p</i> = 0.08) and in treated patients with type 3 by 2.6% vs 3.4% NH (<i>p</i> = 0.59). Patients treated reached FVC <60% later than untreated (12.1 vs 10 years, <i>p</i> = 0.05). A higher percentage of treated vs untreated patients maintained FVC% pred. equal/above their baseline after 12 (65% vs 36%) and 24 (50% vs 24%) months, respectively. NIV use among treated did not significantly change throughout 1-year follow-up. This study included the largest real-world cohort of pediatric patients with milder SMA types. The results suggest a positive role of nusinersen in delaying the respiratory decline in patients treated longer than 1 year when compared with natural history. Larger cohorts and longer observation are planned. This study provided Class III evidence that nusinersen slows progression for patients with SMA types 2 and 3 compared with a natural history cohort."

    "title": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy Scoliosis in the Era of Background Therapies-A Review of the Literature.",
    "abstract": "Spinal deformities are considered an important complication of neuromuscular disorders such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA patients typically develop progressive early-onset scoliosis, which is associated with increased functional decline, discomfort, and respiratory dysfunction. Over the second decade of the twenty-first century, a lot has changed in terms of the therapeutic options available to people with SMA. Specifically, the use of pharmaceutical agents such as nusinersen (Spinraza), onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma), and risdiplam (Evrysdi) has dramatically changed the landscape for SMA patients. These medications significantly alter motor- and respiratory functioning, as well as the natural progression of spinal deformities. When evaluating these agents and their impact on the development of scoliosis and motor functioning, it is important to consider the timing of treatment initiation. In patients treated after they had already developed symptoms, a shift of phenotype to a less severe subtype has been observed. This results in a delay in the onset of scoliosis for the less severe SMA types and an increase in early-onset scoliosis for the severe types in patients who would typically not live to develop scoliosis. Patients who receive treatment before they develop symptoms achieve almost normal motor functioning and will likely have a significant decrease in scoliosis prevalence or at least delay its onset."

The aim of this research is to evaluate the perception of treatments and their benefit by patients considered as responders or non-responders. <b>Methods:</b> In this non-commercial multicenter study, 99 post-symptomatically treated SMA type I-III patients with a median age of 11.2 (0.39-57.4) years at treatment initiation were stratified into three groups based on their treatment outcomes, i.e., those exhibiting clinically significant improvement (N = 41), those with non-clinically significant improvement (N = 18), or those showing no improvement (N = 40). Fifteen months after treatment, the initiation patients or patients' caregivers were assessed using a patient-rated scoring system based on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale, comprising 22 questions targeting important aspects and tasks in the daily life of patients with SMA. <b>Results:</b> We found no statistical difference in the patient perception of treatment benefits in 17 out of 22 domains across patient groups. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our results suggest that functional motor scales do not recapitulate patients' and patients' caregivers' experience of the effect of nusinersen treatment in SMA."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an orphan disease characterized by the progressive degeneration of spinal alpha motor neurons. In recent years, nusinersen and several other drugs have been approved for the treatment of this disease. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) modulates spinal neuronal networks, resulting in changes in locomotion and posture in patients with severe spinal cord injury and stroke. We hypothesize that tSCS can activate motor neurons that are intact and restored by medication, slow the decline in motor activity, and contribute to the development of motor skills in SMA patients. Thirty-seven children and adults with SMA types 2 and 3 participated in this study. The median duration of drug treatment was over 20 months. The application of tSCS was performed during physical therapy for 20-40 min per day for ~12 days. Outcome measures were specific SMA motor scales, goniometry of contractured joints, and forced vital capacity. Significant increases in motor function, improved respiratory function, and decreased contracture were observed in both type 2 and 3 SMA participants. The magnitude of functional changes was not associated with participant age. Further studies are needed to elucidate the reasons for the beneficial effects of spinal cord electrical stimulation on SMA."

This study introduces a customized method utilizing four inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors for continuous recording of the camptocormia angle (CA), incorporating both the consensual malleolus and perpendicular assessment methods. The setup is wearable and mobile and allows measurements outside the laboratory environment. The practicality for measuring CA across various activities is evaluated for both the malleolus and perpendicular method in a mimicked Parkinson disease posture. Multiple activities are performed by a healthy volunteer. Measurements are compared against a camera-based reference system. Results show an overall root mean squared error (RMSE) of 4.13° for the malleolus method and 2.71° for the perpendicular method. Furthermore, patient-specific calibration during the standing still with forward lean activity significantly reduced the RMSE to 2.45° and 1.68° respectively. This study presents a novel approach to continuous CA monitoring outside the laboratory setting. The proposed system is suitable as a tool for monitoring the progression of camptocormia and for the first time implements the malleolus method with IMU. It holds promise for effectively monitoring camptocormia at home."

Periodic limb movements (PLMs) have an increased prevalence in adults with NMD and may contribute to sleep disturbance in this population. We assessed the prevalence of PLMs in children with NMD or CP. Retrospective review of polysomnography (PSG) with leg electromyography in children age 1-18 years with NMD (including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy) or CP performed at a paediatric sleep centre 2004-2022. Leg electromyography was available in at least 1 PSG in 239 children (125 NMD, 114 CP), and in 2 PSGs in 105 children (73 NMD, 32 CP). At initial PSG, 72 (30 %) were female with a median age 9y and respiratory disturbance index 3.5/h (interquartile range 1.3-9.9/h). Elevated PLM index (PLMI; >5/h) occurred in 9.6 % of each of the CP and NMD groups, quantified by initial PSG. Overall, PLMI increased from baseline (median 0, maximum 33/h) to follow-up (median 0, maximum 55.8/h; p < 0.05). In those with an elevated PLMI, arousal percentage attributable to PLMs was up to 25 % (median 7.5 %). Elevated PLMI occurred at a higher prevalence in children with NMD and CP than reported in other clinic-referred paediatric populations. It is important that PLMs are not overlooked as identification and treatment may help improve sleep outcomes. Further research is required to understand the pathophysiology and consequences of PLMs specifically in this population."

The included conditions are mostly autosomal recessive or X-linked with infantile or early-childhood onset. Cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and hemoglobinopathies are now recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) for universal screening. Recommendations for further RGCS remain ethnicity based. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the National Society of Genetic Counselors in recent years have recommended universal expanded-panel RGCS and moving towards a more equitable approach. ACOG guidelines state that offering RGCS is an acceptable option, however it has not provided clear guidance on standard of care. Positive results on RGCS can significantly impact reproductive plans for couples, including pursuing <i>in vitro</i> fertilization with preimplantation genetic testing, prenatal genetic testing, specific fetal or neonatal treatment, or adoption. RGCS is a superior approach compared to ethnicity-based carrier screening and moves away from single race-based medical practice. We urge the obstetrics and gynecology societies to adopt the guidelines for RGCS put forward by multiple societies and help reduce systemic inequalities in medicine in our new genetic age. Having national societies such as ACOG and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine officially recommend and endorse RGCS would bolster insurance coverage and financial support by employers for RGCS.

Neurofilament light chain was measured in cerebrospinal fluid at each drug administration with a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); PFN-1 concentrations were tested in serum sampled at the same time points with commercial ELISA assays. Functional motor scores were evaluated at baseline, at the end of the loading phase and at each maintenance dose and correlated to biomarker levels. The concurrent effect of age and clinical phenotype was studied. Neurofilament light chain levels were included in the reference ranges at baseline; a significant increase was measured during loading phase until 1 month. PFN-1 was higher at baseline than in controls and then decreased during therapy until reaching control levels. Age had an effect on NfL but not on PFN-1. NfL was partially correlated to functional scores at baseline and at last time point, whilst no correlation was found for PFN-1. Cerebrospinal fluid NfL levels did not qualify as an optimal surrogate treatment biomarker in adult spinal muscular atrophy patients with a long disease duration, whilst PFN-1 might to a greater extent represent lower motor neuron pathological processes. The observed biomarker level variation during the first 2 months of nusinersen treatment might suggest a limited effect on axonal remodeling or rearrangement."

Gene editing technology repairs the conversion of the 6th base T to C in exon 7 of the paralogous SMN2 gene, compensating for the SMN protein expression and promoting the survival and function of motor neurons. However, low editing efficiency and unintended off-target effects limit the application of this technology. Here, we optimized a TaC9-adenine base editor (ABE) system by combining Cas9 nickase with the transcription activator-like effector (TALE)-adenosine deaminase fusion protein to effectively and precisely edit SMN2 without detectable Cas9 dependent off-target effects in human cell lines. We also generated human SMA-induced pluripotent stem cells (SMA-iPSCs) through the mutation of the splice acceptor or deletion of the exon 7 of SMN1. TaC9-R10 induced 45% SMN2 T6 > C conversion in the SMA-iPSCs. The SMN2 T6 > C splice-corrected SMA-iPSCs were directionally differentiated into motor neurons, exhibiting SMN protein recovery and antiapoptosis ability. Therefore, the TaC9-ABE system with dual guides from the combination of Cas9 with TALE could be a potential therapeutic strategy for SMA with high efficacy and safety."

    "abstract": "Dominant missense mutations of the calcium-permeable cation channel TRPV4 cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 2C and two forms of distal spinal muscular atrophy. These conditions are collectively referred to as TRPV4-related neuromuscular disease and share features of motor greater than sensory dysfunction and frequent vocal fold weakness. Pathogenic variants lead to gain of ion channel function that can be rescued by TRPV4 antagonists in cellular and animal models. As small molecule TRPV4 antagonists have proven safe in trials for other disease indications, channel inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for TRPV4 patients. However, the current knowledge of the clinical features and natural history of TRPV4-related neuromuscular disease is insufficient to enable rational clinical trial design. To address these issues, we developed a TRPV4 patient database and administered a TRPV4-specific patient questionnaire. Here, we report demographic and clinical information, including CMT Examination Scores (CMTES), from 68 patients with known pathogenic TRPV4 variants, 40 of whom also completed the TRPV4 patient questionnaire. TRPV4 patients showed a bimodal age of onset, with the largest peak occurring in the first 2 years of life. Compared to CMT type 1A (CMT1A) patients, TRPV4 patients showed distinct symptoms and signs, manifesting more ambulatory difficulties and more frequent involvement of proximal arm and leg muscles. Although patients reported fewer sensory symptoms, sensory dysfunction was often detected clinically. Many patients were affected by vocal fold weakness (55%) and shortness of breath (55%), and 11% required ventilatory support. Skeletal abnormalities were common, including scoliosis (64%), arthrogryposis (33%) and foot deformities. Strikingly, patients with infantile onset of disease showed less sensory involvement and less progression of symptoms. These results highlight distinctive clinical features in TRPV4 patients, including motor-predominant disease, proximal arm and leg weakness, severe ambulatory difficulties, vocal fold weakness, respiratory dysfunction and skeletal involvement. In addition, patients with infantile onset of disease appeared to have a distinct phenotype with less apparent disease progression based on CMTES. These collective observations indicate that clinical trial design for TRPV4-related neuromuscular disease should include outcome measures that reliably capture non-length dependent motor dysfunction, vocal fold weakness and respiratory disease."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by abnormalities of the survival motor neuron (SMN) 1 gene, leading to deficiency in SMN protein and loss of spinal cord alpha motor neurons. Newer disease-modifying agents (DMA) targeting the involved genes, including nusinersen and gene replacement therapies, have improved gross motor and respiratory function, but their impact on scoliosis development has not been established. This study aimed to determine risk factors for scoliosis development in SMA, specifically genetic severity and DMA use. In this retrospective cohort study, children with SMA and minimum 2-year follow-up were included. The primary outcome was the prevalence of clinically relevant scoliosis. Secondary outcomes included SMA type, SMN2 copy number, Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale (HFMS), ambulatory status [functional mobility scale at 50m (FMS 50 )], DMA use, and hip displacement as risk factors. Univariate/multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify dependent/independent risk factors. One hundred sixty-five patients (51% female) with SMA types I-III met the inclusion criteria, with total follow-up of 9.8 years. The prevalence of scoliosis was 79%; age of onset 7.9 years. The major curve angle for the entire cohort at first assessment and final follow-up was 37 degrees (SD: 27 degrees) and 62 degrees (SD: 31 degrees) ( P <0.0001), respectively. Significant risk factors for scoliosis by univariate analysis were SMA type (I/II, P =0.02), HFMS (>23, P <0.001), nonambulatory status (FMS 50 =1, P <0.0001), DMA treatment ( P =0.02), and hip displacement ( P <0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that HFMS >23 ( P =0.02) and DMA ( P =0.05) treatment were independent (protective) risk factors. The development of scoliosis in SMA is high, with risk factors associated with proxy measures of disease severity, including SMA type, nonambulatory status, hip displacement, and most notably, gross motor function (by HFMS). DMA use and HFMS >23 were associated with a decreased risk of scoliosis development. Identified risk factors can be used in the development of surveillance programs for early detection of scoliosis in SMA. Level III."

The most recent SMA best practice recommendations were published in 2018 shortly after the approval of the first SMN-enhancing treatment. The availability of disease-modifying therapies for 5q SMA and implementation of SMA newborn screening (NBS) has led to urgency to update the SMA best practice recommendations for diagnosis and to reevaluate the current classification of SMA. In addition, the availability of disease-modifying therapies has opened the door to explore improved diagnosis of adult-onset SMA. A systematic literature review was conducted on SMA NBS. An SMA working group of American and European health care providers developed recommendations through a modified Delphi technique with serial surveys and virtual meeting feedback on SMA diagnosis to fill information gaps for topics with limited evidence. A community working group of an individual with SMA and caregivers provided insight and perspective on SMA diagnosis and support through a virtual meeting to guide recommendations. The health care provider working group achieved consensus that SMA NBS is essential to include in the updated best practice for SMA diagnosis (100%). Recommendations for the following are described: characterizing NBS-identified infants before treatment; minimum recommendations for starting or offering SMA NBS in a state or country; recommendations for activities and services to be provided by an SMA specialty care center accepting SMA NBS referrals; and recommendations for partnership with individuals with SMA and caregivers to support NBS-identified infants and their caregivers. Limited data are available to advance efficient diagnosis of adult-onset SMA. Updating best practice recommendations for SMA diagnosis to include SMA NBS implementation is essential to advancing care for individuals with SMA. In addition to testing, processes for the efficient management of positive newborn screen with access to knowledgeable and skilled health care providers and access to treatment options is critical to successful early diagnosis. Additional evidence is required to improve adult-onset SMA diagnosis."

    "title": "Mechanisms of Action of the US Food and Drug Administration-Approved Antisense Oligonucleotide Drugs.",
    "abstract": "Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are single stranded nucleic acids that target RNA. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved ASOs for several diseases. ASOs utilize three principal modes of action (MOA). The first MOA is initiated by base-pairing between the ASO and its target mRNA, followed by RNase H-dependent mRNA degradation. The second MOA is triggered by ASOs that occlude splice acceptor sites in pre-mRNAs leading to skipping of a mutation-bearing exon. The third MOA involves ASOs that sterically hinder mRNA function, often inhibiting translation. ASOs contain a variety of modifications to the sugar-phosphate backbone and bases that stabilize the ASO or render them resistant to RNase activity. RNase H-dependent ASOs include inotersen and eplontersen (for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis), fomiversen (for opportunistic cytomegalovirus infection), mipomersen (for familial hypercholesterolemia), and tofersen [for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]. Splice modulating ASOs include nursinersen (for spinal muscular atrophy) and eteplirsen, golodirsen, viltolarsen, and casimersen (all for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy). In addition, a designer ASO, milasen, was used to treat a single individual afflicted with Batten disease. Since ASO design relies principally upon knowledge of mRNA sequence, the bench to bedside pipeline for ASOs is expedient compared with protein-directed drugs. [Graphical abstract available.]."

    "abstract": "Variability in disease onset and progression is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), both in sporadic and genetic forms. Recently, we found that SOD1-G93A transgenic mice expressing the same amount of mutant SOD1 but with different genetic backgrounds, C57BL/6JOlaHsd and 129S2/SvHsd, show slow and rapid muscle wasting and disease progression, respectively. Here, we investigated the different molecular mechanisms underlying muscle atrophy. Although both strains showed similar denervation-induced degradation of muscle proteins, only the rapidly progressing mice exhibited early and sustained STAT3 activation that preceded atrophy in gastrocnemius muscle. We therefore investigated the therapeutic potential of sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor known to inhibit STAT3 and prevent cancer-induced muscle wasting. Although sunitinib treatment reduced STAT3 activation in the gastrocnemius muscle and lumbar spinal cord, it did not preserve spinal motor neurons, improve neuromuscular impairment, muscle atrophy and disease progression in the rapidly progressing SOD1-G93A mice. Thus, the effect of sunitinib is not equally positive in different diseases associated with muscle wasting. Moreover, given the complex role of STAT3 in the peripheral and central compartments of the neuromuscular system, the present study suggests that its broad inhibition may lead to opposing effects, ultimately preventing a potential positive therapeutic action in ALS."

    "abstract": "Survival data for Thai patients with 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the leading cause of infant mortality worldwide, are lacking. This study aimed to determine the survival rates and life expectancies of pediatric patients with SMA types 1, 2, and 3. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of genetically confirmed 5q SMA patients aged 0-18 years who were treated between 1999 and 2021 at the pediatric neuromuscular clinic of Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Mortality data were sourced from the Civil Registration Office. The study included 113 patients: 37 with SMA type 1, 53 with type 2, and 23 with type 3. Life expectancy varied significantly by SMA type: 2.2 years for type 1, 11 years for type 2, and 16.5 years for type 3. The median survival times for SMA type 1 and 2 were 1.9 and 19 years, respectively. In SMA type 2, early onset (<1 year) correlated with a shorter median survival than later onset (≥1 year) (log-rank test <i>P</i> = 0.009). Early onset SMA type 2 had a median survival time of 15.9 years, while 75 % of those with later onset SMA type 2 survived until the age of 19 years. Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that each month's delay in disease onset reduced the annual mortality risk by 17 % for type 1 patients and by 20 % for type 2 patients. Compared with female patients, male patients with type 2 disease had a 12-fold increased mortality risk. Age at onset is a significant predictor of survival and life expectancy in patients with SMA types 1 and 2. These insights are crucial for genetic counseling and prognostic discussions in clinical settings."

    "abstract": "The neurodevelopmental disorders Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS) both arise from genomic alterations within human chromosome 15q11-q13. A deletion of the SNORD116 cluster, encoding small nucleolar RNAs, or frameshift mutations within MAGEL2 result in closely related phenotypes in individuals with PWS or SYS, respectively. By investigation of their subcellular localization, we observed that in contrast to a predominant cytoplasmic localization of wild-type (WT) MAGEL2, a truncated MAGEL2 mutant was evenly distributed between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. To elucidate regulatory pathways that may underlie both diseases, we identified protein interaction partners for WT or mutant MAGEL2, in particular the survival motor neuron protein (SMN), involved in spinal muscular atrophy, and the fragile-X-messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), involved in autism spectrum disorders. The interactome of the non-coding RNA SNORD116 was also investigated by RNA-CoIP. We show that WT and truncated MAGEL2 were both involved in RNA metabolism, while regulation of transcription was mainly observed for WT MAGEL2. Hence, we investigated the influence of MAGEL2 mutations on the expression of genes from the PWS locus, including the SNORD116 cluster. Thereby, we provide evidence for MAGEL2 mutants decreasing the expression of SNORD116, SNORD115, and SNORD109A, as well as protein-coding genes MKRN3 and SNRPN, thus bridging the gap between PWS and SYS."

    "abstract": "This systematic review provides an update on outcomes for patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 to 4 treated with approved therapeutics, including the most recent, risdiplam, for an observation period of up to 48 months. A systematic literature search was conducted in July 2023 in four databases. Selected publications were assessed for internal validity and risk of bias by two authors and relevant data were extracted into standardised tables. Results were summarised narratively as substantial heterogeneity of studies prevents meaningful quantitative analysis. Twenty observational studies and one RCT were included in the analysis, fifteen studies on nusinersen, one on onasemnogene abeparvovec and two on risdiplam. Evidence supports the effectiveness of the therapies in motor function improvement for up to 48 months of follow-up in the SMA types specified in their respective indications. Better results were observed with earlier treatment initiation and higher baseline function. Whilst motor improvement was consistently observed, regardless of SMA type or treatment used, we noted no significant improvements in respiratory and nutritional outcomes. Quality of life endpoints were rarely investigated. Adverse events were common but seldom classified as treatment-related except for post-lumbar puncture syndrome, which was frequently reported across nusinersen studies. The treatment of SMA with the new therapies changes the disease phenotype with changes in motor function far exceeding any improvement in respiratory and nutritional function. Questions persist on long-term efficacy, potential regressions, impact on quality of life and social functioning, therapy duration, and discontinuation indicators."

    "abstract": "Molecular chaperones and co-chaperones are highly conserved cellular components that perform variety of duties related to the proper three-dimensional folding of the proteome. The web of factors that carries out this essential task is called the proteostasis network (PN). Ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) represent an underexplored area in terms of the connections they make with the PN. The Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) complex is an RNP assembly chaperone and serves as a paradigm for studying how specific small nuclear (sn)RNAs are identified and paired with their client substrate proteins. SMN protein is the eponymous component of a large complex required for the biogenesis of uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U-snRNPs) and localizes to distinct membraneless organelles in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of animal cells. SMN forms the oligomeric core of this complex, and missense mutations in its YG box self-interaction domain are known to cause Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). The basic framework for understanding how snRNAs are assembled into U-snRNPs is known, the pathways and mechanisms used by cells to regulate their biogenesis are poorly understood. Given the importance of these processes to normal development as well as neurodegenerative disease, we set out to identify and characterize novel SMN binding partners. Here, we carried out affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) of SMN using stable fly lines exclusively expressing either wildtype or SMA-causing missense alleles. Bioinformatic analyses of the pulldown data, along with comparisons to proximity labeling studies carried out in human cells, revealed conserved connections to at least two other major chaperone systems including heat shock folding chaperones (HSPs) and histone/nucleosome assembly chaperones. Notably, we found that heat shock cognate protein Hsc70-4 and other HspA family members preferentially interacted with SMA-causing alleles of SMN. Hsc70-4 is particularly interesting because its mRNA is aberrantly sequestered by a mutant form of TDP-43 in mouse and <i>Drosophila</i> ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) disease models. Most important, a missense allele of Hsc70-4 (HspA8 in mammals) was recently identified as a bypass suppressor of the SMA phenotype in mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that chaperone-related dysfunction lies at the etiological root of both ALS and SMA."

Patients underwent Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) or Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) before treatment, and approximately every 4 months thereafter. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND) or Children's Hospital of Philadelphia - Adult Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP ATEND), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), and Motor Function Measure (MFM) were performed based on baseline functional status. Narrative interviews were conducted to explore post-treatment physical improvement regarding activities of daily living (ADLs) and fatigue after ADLs. Based on HFMSE results, 9 patients achieved minimum clinically important differences. Average rates of change (slopes) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for all assessment tools were in a positive direction. CHOP-INTEND showed the most prominent improvement in children and adolescents followed by HFMSE. Improvements in CHOP-ATEND were most noticeable in adults. Improvements were accompanied by changes in ADLs as observed in the narrative interviews. It is necessary to consider various functional aspects to determine the effectiveness of Nusinersen therapy. The objective assessment of the therapeutic effect of Nusinersen in non-ambulatory SMA requires consideration of functional aspects and the related ADLs."

The transformative potentials of recently approved gene therapies for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and active cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy are encouraging further development of this approach. However, most attempts to translate gene therapy to the clinic have failed to make it to market. There is an urgent need not only to tailor the genes that are targeted to the pathology of interest but to also address delivery challenges and thereby maximize the utility of genetic tools. In this Review, we provide an overview of gene therapy modalities for CNS diseases, emphasizing the interconnectedness of different delivery strategies and routes of administration. Important gaps in understanding that could accelerate the clinical translatability of CNS genetic interventions are addressed, and we present lessons learned from failed clinical trials that may guide the future development of gene therapies for the treatment and management of CNS disorders."

Advancements in gene therapy, such as treatments for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), have introduced novel therapeutic options, but the high costs, exemplified by Zolgensma® at US$2.1 million, present significant financial barriers. This scoping review aimed to compare the funding approaches for rare disease treatments across high-performing health systems in Australia, Singapore, South Korea, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US), aiming to identify best practices and areas for future research. In accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines and the methodological framework by Arksey and O'Malley and ensuing recommendations, a comprehensive search of electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane) and grey literature from health department websites and leading national organizations dedicated to rare diseases in these countries was conducted. Countries selected for comparison were high-income countries with advanced economies and high-performing health systems: Australia, Singapore, South Korea, the UK, and the US. The inclusion criteria focused on studies detailing drug approval processes, reimbursement decisions and funding mechanisms, and published from 2010 to 2024. Based on a thorough review of 18 published papers and grey literature, various strategies are employed by countries to balance budgetary constraints and access to rare disease treatments. Australia utilizes the Life Saving Drugs Program and risk-sharing agreements. Singapore depends on the Rare Disease Fund, which matches public donations. South Korea's National Health Insurance Service covers specific orphan drugs through risk-sharing agreements. The UK relies on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to evaluate treatments for cost-effectiveness, supported by the Innovative Medicines Fund. In the US, a combination of federal and state programs, private insurance and non-profit support is used. Outcome-based risk-sharing agreements present a practical solution for managing the financial strain of costly treatments. These agreements tie payment to actual treatment efficacy, thereby distributing financial risk and promoting ongoing data collection. Countries should consider adopting and expanding these agreements to balance immediate expenses with long-term benefits, ultimately ensuring equitable access to crucial treatments for patients afflicted by rare diseases."

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, resulting from the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord. A critical aspect of SMA is its impact on respiratory function. As the disease progresses, respiratory muscles, in particular intercostal muscles, become increasingly affected, leading to breathing difficulties and respiratory failure. Without intervention, many children with SMA type 1 die from respiratory failure before their second year of life. While assisted ventilation has improved survival, it often results in ventilator dependence. The development of new SMN-augmenting therapies has renewed optimism, but their long-term impact on respiratory function is uncertain, and non-invasive respiratory support remains an important part of SMA management. Despite the importance of respiratory support in SMA, knowledge regarding sleep disorders in this population is limited. This review aims to synthesize existing literature on sleep and sleep-related breathing disorders in patients with SMA, with a focus on SMA type 1. We summarize evidence of sleep-disordered breathing and respiratory failure in SMA, as well as outcomes and survival benefits associated with non-invasive or invasive ventilation with or without pharmacological therapies. We also discuss current knowledge regarding the effects of novel disease-modifying therapies for SMA on respiratory function and sleep. In conclusion, optimal care for children with SMA requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes neurology and respiratory specialists. This review highlights the importance of monitoring sleep and respiratory function in SMA, as well as the potential benefits and challenges associated with assisted ventilation combined with new therapies."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder due to deletion or mutation of survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Although survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene is still present in SMA patients, the production of full-length survival motor neuron (SMN) protein is insufficient owing to missing or mutated SMN1. No current disease-modifying therapies can cure SMA. The aim of this study was to explore microRNA (miRNA)-based therapies that may serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in delaying SMA progression or as treatment. The study screened for potentially dysregulated miRNAs in SMA fibroblast-derived iPSCs using miRNA microarray. Results from the miRNA microarray were validated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Bioinformatics analysis using various databases was performed to predict the potential putative gene targeted by hsa-miR-663a. The findings showed differential expression of hsa-miR-663a in SMA patients in relation to a healthy control. Bioinformatics analysis identified GNG7, IGF2, and TNN genes that were targeted by hsa-miR-663a to be involved in the PI3K-AKT pathway, which may be associated with disease progression in SMA. Thus, this study suggests the potential role of hsa-miR-663a as therapeutic target for the treatment of SMA patients in the near future."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe neuromuscular disorder that is caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (<i>SMN1</i>) gene, hindering the production of functional survival motor neuron (SMN) proteins. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), a versatile DNA-like drug, are adept at binding to target RNA to prevent translation or promote alternative splicing. Nusinersen is an FDA-approved ASO for the treatment of SMA. It effectively promotes alternative splicing in pre-mRNA transcribed from the <i>SMN2</i> gene, an analog of the <i>SMN1</i> gene, to produce a greater amount of full-length SMN protein, to compensate for the loss of functional protein translated from <i>SMN1</i>. Despite its efficacy in ameliorating SMA symptoms, the cellular uptake of these ASOs is suboptimal, and their inability to penetrate the CNS necessitates invasive lumbar punctures. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), which can be conjugated to ASOs, represent a promising approach to improve the efficiency of these treatments for SMA and have the potential to transverse the blood-brain barrier to circumvent the need for intrusive intrathecal injections and their associated adverse effects. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of ASO therapies, their application for the treatment of SMA, and the encouraging potential of CPPs as delivery systems to improve ASO uptake and overall efficiency."

This study aimed to determine the effect of spinal deformity correction surgery on nusinersen administration. Pediatric patients with SMA, operated by a single surgeon, either via magnetically controlled growing rod (MCGR) or definitive fusion (DF) with skip instrumentation, were evaluated retrospectively in terms of safety and feasibility of intrathecal injections. Patients' and their parents' perspectives were evaluated through a questionnaire regarding any shift in the setting of injections. Fourteen patients with 15 spinal surgeries (10 MCGR and 5 DF) were included. Eleven patients received intrathecal treatment both before and after the surgery. Preoperative (n=3) and postoperative (n=9) fluoroscopic guidance was required leading to a shift in the application settings in 6 patients. Of 106 preoperative injections, 15% required fluoroscopy and 2% required anesthesia. Postoperatively, of 88 injections, 73% required fluoroscopy and 26% required anesthesia. No patients discontinued intrathecal injections due to technical difficulties associated with the spinal surgery. This study demonstrates that spinal surgery does not prevent safe and successful intrathecal nusinersen injections. In the DF group, the skip instrumentation technique provided access to interlaminal space for intrathecal injections. In either surgical group, no further auxillary approach was required. Modifications in the injection technique require an institutional approach, and concerns of patients and their families should be addressed accordingly. IV."

This study aimed to use individual-level morphological brain network analysis to explore the brain neural network mechanisms in SMA. Individual-level gray matter (GM) networks were constructed by estimating the interregional similarity of GM volume distribution using both Kullback-Leibler divergence-based similarity (KLDs) and Jesen-Shannon divergence-based similarity (JSDs) measurements based on Automated Anatomical Labeling 116 and Hammersmith 83 atlases for 38 individuals with SMA types 2 and 3 and 38 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). The topological properties were analyzed by the graph theory approach and compared between groups by a nonparametric permutation test. Additionally, correlation analysis was used to assess the associations between altered topological metrics and clinical characteristics. Compared with HCs, although global network topology remained preserved in individuals with SMA, brain regions with altered nodal properties mainly involved the right olfactory gyrus, right insula, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, right amygdala, right thalamus, left superior temporal gyrus, left cerebellar lobule IV-V, bilateral cerebellar lobule VI, right cerebellar lobule VII, and vermis VII and IX. Further correlation analysis showed that the nodal degree of the right cerebellar lobule VII was positively correlated with the disease duration, and the right amygdala was negatively correlated with the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) scores. Our findings demonstrated that topological reorganization may prioritize global properties over nodal properties, and disrupted topological properties in the cortical-limbic-cerebellum circuit in SMA may help to further understand the network pathogenesis underlying SMA."

Motor neuron degeneration and skeletal muscle atrophy are hallmarks of SMA, but it is unknown whether other mechanisms contribute to the spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Here, through a combination of physiological and morphological studies in mouse models and SMA patients, we identify dysfunction and loss of proprioceptive sensory synapses as key signatures of SMA pathology. We demonstrate that SMA patients exhibit impaired proprioception, and their proprioceptive sensory synapses are dysfunctional as measured by the neurophysiological test of the Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex). We further show that loss of excitatory afferent synapses and altered potassium channel expression in SMA motor neurons are conserved pathogenic events found in both severely affected patients and mouse models. Lastly, we report that improved motor function and fatigability in ambulatory SMA patients and mouse models treated with SMN-inducing drugs correlate with increased function of sensory-motor circuits that can be accurately captured by the H-reflex assay. Thus, sensory synaptic dysfunction is a clinically relevant event in SMA, and the H-reflex is a suitable assay to monitor disease progression and treatment efficacy of motor circuit pathology."

SMA incidence has not been well-characterized in most Arab countries where rates of consanguinity are high. Understanding SMA disease epidemiology has important implications for screening, prevention, and treatment in those populations. We perform SMA diagnostic testing in a clinical multi-national patient cohort (N = 171) referred for hypotonia and/or muscle weakness. In addition, we carry out genetic newborn screening for SMA on 1502 healthy Emirati newborns to estimate the carrier frequency and incidence of the disease in the United Arab Emirates. Patients referred for SMA genetic testing are mostly Arabs (82%) representing 18 countries. The overall diagnostic yield is 33.9%, which is higher (>50%) for certain nationalities. Most patients (71%) has two SMN2 copies and earlier disease onset. For the first time, we estimate SMA carrier frequency (1.3%) and incidence of the disease (1 in 7122 live births) in the United Arab Emirates. Using birth and marriage rates in two Arab populations (United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia), as well as disease incidence in both countries, we show that, besides preventing new cases, premarital genetic screening could potentially result in around $8 to $324 million annual cost savings, respectively, relative to postnatal treatment. The SMA carrier frequency and incidence we document suggests high potential benefit for universal implementation of premarital genomic screening for a wide range of recessive disorders in Arab populations."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy for hemophilia is a groundbreaking treatment approach with promising results and potential to reduce the burden of the disease. However, uncertainties remain, particularly regarding the liver side effects of AAV gene therapy, which are more common in hemophilia A. Unlike some other diseases, such as spinal muscular atrophy, where the target cell for gene therapy is different from the one affected by side effects, hemophilia gene therapy operates within the same cellular domain-the hepatocyte. This overlap is challenging and requires a targeted strategy to mitigate the risks associated with liver injury, which often requires temporary immunosuppressive therapy. A comprehensive approach is essential to increase the efficacy of gene therapy and reduce the likelihood of hepatocyte damage. Key components of this strategy include a thorough pre-gene therapy assessment of liver health, careful post-gene therapy liver monitoring, and prompt therapeutic intervention for loss of transgene expression and liver injury. Collaboration between hematologists and hepatologists is essential to ensure a well-coordinated management plan for patients undergoing hemophilia gene therapy. This review addresses the critical aspect of hepatic comorbidities in patients with hemophilia, emphasizing the need to identify and address these issues prior to initiating gene therapy. It examines the known mechanisms of liver damage and emphasizes the importance of liver monitoring after gene therapy. In addition, the review draws insights from experiences with other AAV-based gene therapies, providing valuable lessons that can guide hemophilia centers in effectively managing liver damage associated with hemophilia gene therapy."

While this broad indication provides flexibility in patient selection, it also raises concerns about the risk-benefit ratio for patients with limited or no evidence supporting treatment. In 2020, we convened a European neuromuscular expert working group to support the rational use of onasemnogene abeparvovec, employing a modified Delphi methodology. After three years, we have assembled a similar yet larger group of European experts who assessed the emerging evidence of onasemnogene abeparvovec's role in treating older and heavier SMA patients, integrating insights from recent clinical trials and real-world evidence. This effort resulted in 12 consensus statements, with strong consensus achieved on 9 and consensus on the remaining 3, reflecting the evolving role of onasemnogene abeparvovec in treating SMA."

    "title": "Treatment Options in Spinal Muscular Atrophy: A Pragmatic Approach for Clinicians.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare neurodegenerative neuromuscular disorder with a wide phenotypic spectrum of severity. SMA was previously life limiting for patients with the most severe phenotype and resulted in progressive disability for those with less severe phenotypes. This has changed dramatically in the past few years with the approvals of three disease-modifying treatments. We review the evidence supporting the use of currently approved SMA treatments (nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec, and risdiplam), focusing on mechanisms of action, side effect profiles, published clinical trial data, health economics, and pending questions. Whilst there is robust data from clinical trials of efficacy and side effect profile for individual drugs in select SMA populations, there are no comparative head-to-head clinical trials. This presents a challenge for clinicians who need to make recommendations on the best treatment option for an individual patient and we hope to provide a pragmatic approach for clinicians across each SMA profile based on current evidence."

    "title": "Relationship between facet joint osteoarthritis and lumbar paraspinal muscle atrophy: a cross-sectional study.",
    "abstract": "The paraspinal muscles play an essential role in the stabilization of the lumbar spine. Lumbar paraspinal muscle atrophy has been linked to chronic back pain and degenerative processes within the spinal motion segment. However, the relationship between the different paraspinal muscle groups and facet joint osteoarthritis (FJOA) has not been fully explored. In this cross-sectional study, the authors analyzed adult patients who underwent lumbar spinal surgery between December 2014 and March 2023 for degenerative spinal conditions and had preoperative MRI and CT scans. The fatty infiltration (FI) and functional cross-sectional area (fCSA) of the psoas, erector spinae, and multifidus muscles were assessed on axial T2-weighted MR images at the level of the upper endplate of L4 based on established studies and calculated using custom-made software. Intervertebral disc degeneration at each lumbar level was evaluated using the Pfirrmann grading system. The grades from each level were summed to report the cumulative lumbar Pfirrmann grade. Weishaupt classification (0-3) was used to assess FJOA at all lumbar levels (L1 to S1) on preoperative CT scans. The total lumbar FJOA score was determined by adding the Weishaupt grades of both sides at all 5 levels. Correlation and linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between FJOA and paraspinal muscle parameters. A total of 225 patients (49.7% female) with a median age of 61 (IQR 54-70) years and a median BMI of 28.3 (IQR 25.1-33.1) kg/m2 were included. After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and the cumulative lumbar Pfirrmann grade, only multifidus muscle fCSA (estimate -4.69, 95% CI -6.91 to -2.46; p < 0.001) and FI (estimate 0.64, 95% CI 0.33-0.94; p < 0.001) were independently predicted by the total FJOA score. A similar relation was seen with individual Weishaupt grades of each lumbar level after controlling for age, sex, BMI, and the Pfirrmann grade of the corresponding level. Atrophy of the multifidus muscle is significantly associated with FJOA in the lumbar spine. The absence of such correlation for the erector spinae and psoas muscles highlights the unique link between multifidus muscle quality and the degeneration of the spinal motion segment. Further research is necessary to establish the causal link and the clinical implications of these findings."

We assessed metabolic syndrome (MetS) prevalence in adults with SMA and its association with motor function, quality of life (QoL), fatigue, and depression. MetS was diagnosed using 2009 consensus criteria. Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were recorded and correlations between muscle function, depression, fatigue, QoL, and MetS were analyzed. We included 36 individuals (18 males; mean age: 38.7 ± 14.6 years). MetS was present in 25.0%. The most common component of MetS was central obesity (69.7%). Nearly half of the SMA individuals exhibited at least one abnormal lipid level result. Individuals with MetS more frequently were SMA type 3 (77.8% vs. 37.0%, p = .02) and had higher levels of fatigue (48.4 ± 6.7 vs. 39.5 ± 11.6, p = .03) than those without MetS. No associations of the presence of MetS with ambulatory status or HFMSE/RULM scores were observed. SMA individuals with MetS scored significantly lower in mental and social domains of QoL and total SF-36 score (p = .04). We observed weak to moderate correlations between the presence of MetS and SMA type, presence of comorbidities, QoL, and fatigue. The frequency of MetS was modestly higher among adults with SMA than in the general population, particularly in SMA type 3. MetS was associated with reduced QoL and increased fatigue. Larger studies are needed to fully understand the significance of MetS in adults with SMA."

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a neurodegenerative disorder, extends its impact beyond the nervous system. The central protein implicated in SMA, Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein, is ubiquitously expressed and functions in fundamental processes such as alternative splicing, translation, cytoskeletal dynamics and signaling. These processes are relevant for all cellular systems, including cells of the immune system such as macrophages. Macrophages are capable of modulating their splicing, cytoskeleton and expression profile in order to fulfil their role in tissue homeostasis and defense. However, less is known about impairment or dysfunction of macrophages lacking SMN and the subsequent impact on the immune system of SMA patients. We aimed to review the potential overlaps between SMN functions and macrophage mechanisms highlighting the need for future research, as well as the current state of research addressing the role of macrophages in SMA."

    "abstract": "The Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE) is a validated outcome measure for monitoring changes in functional strength in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The objective of this study was to explore changes in HFMSE item-scores in children with SMA types 2 and 3a treated with nusinersen over a period of six to twenty months. We stratified patients according to motor ability (sitting and walking), and calculated numbers and percentages for each specific improvement (positive score change) or decrease (negative score change) for the total group and each subgroup and calculated frequency distributions of specific score changes. Ninety-one percent of the children showed improvement in at least 1 item, twenty-eight percent showed a score decrease in 1 or more items. In the first six to twenty months of nusinersen treatment motor function change was characterized by the acquisition of the ability to perform specific tasks with compensation strategies (score changes from 0 to 1). Children with the ability to sit were most likely to improve in items that assess rolling, whilst children with the ability to walk most likely improved in items that assess half-kneeling. The ability most frequently lost was hip flexion in supine position."

This study aimed to develop a rapid and comprehensive method for the diagnosis of SMA. A total of 292 children with clinically suspected SMA and 394 family members were detected by the amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction-capillary electrophoresis (ARMS-PCR-CE) method, which targeted 19 reported mutations, and the results were compared with those in multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Individuals with identified point mutations were further confirmed by <i>SMN1</i> long-range PCR and Sanger sequencing. A total of 202 children with SMA, 272 carriers, and 212 normal individuals were identified in this study. No difference was found in the R-value distribution of exons 7 and 8 in <i>SMN1</i> and <i>SMN2</i> among these cohorts, with coefficients of variation consistently below 0.08. To detect exon 7 and 8 copy numbers in <i>SMN1</i> and <i>SMN2</i>, the ARMS-PCR-CE results were concordant with those of MLPA. Approximately 4.95 % (10/202) of the study patients had compound heterozygous mutations. The ARMS-PCR-CE assay is a comprehensive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic method for SMA that simultaneously detects copy numbers of exons 7 and 8 in <i>SMN1</i>/<i>SMN2</i>, as well as 19 point mutations in <i>SMN1</i> and 2 enhancers in <i>SMN2</i>. This approach can effectively reduce the time frame for diagnosis, facilitating early intervention and preventing birth defects."

    "title": "Novel Gene Therapy Approaches for Targeting Neurodegenerative Disorders: Focusing on Delivering Neurotrophic Genes.",
    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative illnesses (NDDs) like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and Huntington's disease have demonstrated considerable potential for gene therapy as a viable therapeutic intervention. NDDs are marked by the decline of neurons, resulting in changes in both behavior and pathology within the body. Strikingly, only symptomatic management is available without a cure for the NDDs. There is an unmet need for a permanent therapeutic approach. Many studies have been going on to target the newer therapeutic molecular targets for NDDs including gene-based therapy. Gene therapy has the potential to provide therapeutic benefits to a large number of patients with NDDs by offering mechanisms including neuroprotection, neuro-restoration, and rectification of pathogenic pathways. Gene therapy is a medical approach that aims to modify the biological characteristics of living cells by controlling the expression of specific genes in certain neurological disorders. Despite being the most complex and well-protected organ in the human body, there is clinical evidence to show that it is possible to specifically target the central nervous system (CNS). This provides hope for the prospective application of gene therapy in treating NDDs in the future. There are several advanced techniques available for using viral or non-viral vectors to deliver the therapeutic gene to the afflicted region. Neurotrophic factors (NTF) in the brain are crucial for the development, differentiation, and survival of neurons in the CNS, making them important in the context of various neurological illnesses. Gene delivery of NTF has the potential to be used as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurological problems in the brain. This review primarily focuses on the methodologies employed for delivering the genes of different NTFs to treat neurological disorders. These techniques are currently being explored as a viable therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases. The article exclusively addresses gene delivery approaches and does not cover additional therapy strategies for NDDs. Gene therapy offers a promising alternative treatment for NDDs by stimulating neuronal growth instead of solely relying on symptom relief from drugs and their associated adverse effects. It can serve as a long-lasting and advantageous treatment choice for the management of NDDs. The likelihood of developing NDDs increases with age as a result of neuronal degradation in the brain. Gene therapy is an optimal approach for promoting neuronal growth through the introduction of nerve growth factor genes."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an uncommon disorder associated with genes characterized by the gradual weakening and deterioration of muscles, often leading to substantial disability and premature mortality. Over the past decade, remarkable strides have been made in the field of SMA therapeutics, revolutionizing the landscape of patient care. One pivotal advancement is the development of gene-targeted therapies, such as nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec and risdiplam which have demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in slowing disease progression. These therapies aim to address the root cause of SMA by targeting the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene, effectively restoring deficient SMN protein levels. The advent of these innovative approaches has transformed the prognosis for many SMA patients, offering a glimmer of hope where there was once limited therapeutic recourse. Furthermore, the emergence of small molecule compounds and RNA-targeting strategies has expanded the therapeutic arsenal against SMA. These novel interventions exhibit diverse mechanisms of action, including SMN protein stabilization and modulation of RNA splicing, showcasing the multifaceted nature of SMA treatment research. Collective efforts of pharmaceutical industries, research centers, and patient advocacy groups have played an important role in expediting the translation of scientific discoveries into visible clinical benefits. This review not only highlights the remarkable progress achieved in SMA therapeutics but also generates the ray of hope for the ongoing efforts required to enhance accessibility, optimize treatment strategies, rehabilitation (care and therapies) and ultimately pave the way for an improved quality of life for individuals affected by SMA."

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is an age-dependent cell type-selective degenerative disease. Genetic studies indicate that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is part of a spectrum of disorders, ranging from spinal muscular atrophy to frontotemporal dementia that share common pathological mechanisms. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Type 8 is a familial disease caused by mis-sense mutations in <i>VAPB</i>. VAPB is localized to the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it serves as a docking point for cytoplasmic proteins and mediates inter-organelle interactions with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. A gene knock-in model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Type 8 based on the <i>VapB<sup>P56S</sup></i> mutation and <i>VapB</i> gene deletion has been generated in rats. These animals display a range of age-dependent phenotypes distinct from those previously reported in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Type 8. A loss of motor neurones in <i>VapB<sup>P56S/+</sup></i> and <i>VapB<sup>P56S/P56S</sup></i> animals is indicated by a reduction in the number of large choline acetyl transferase-staining cells in the spinal cord. <i>VapB<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals exhibit a relative increase in cytoplasmic TDP-43 levels compared with the nucleus, but no large protein aggregates. Concomitant with these spinal cord pathologies <i>VapB<sup>P56S/+</sup></i> , <i>VapB<sup>P56S/P56S</sup></i> and <i>VapB<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals exhibit age-dependent changes in paw placement and exerted pressures when traversing a CatWalk apparatus, consistent with a somatosensory dysfunction. Extramotor dysfunction is reported in half the cases of motor neurone disease, and this is the first indication of an associated sensory dysfunction in a rodent model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Different rodent models may offer complementary experimental platforms with which to understand the human disease."

Nusinersen, Food and Drug Administration-approved spinal muscular atrophy therapy, extends survival and enhances motor function. However, its influence on spinal and hip deformities remains unclear. In a retrospective study, 29 spinal muscular atrophy type 1 patients born between 2017 and 2021, confirmed by genetic testing, treated with intrathecal nusinersen, and had registered to the national electronic health database were included. Demographics, age at the first nusinersen dose, total administrations, and Children's of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders scores were collected. Radiological assessments included parasol rib deformity, scoliosis, pelvic obliquity, and hip subluxation. Mean age was 3.7 ± 1.1 (range, 2-6), and average number of intrathecal nusinersen administration was 8.9 ± 2.9 (range, 4-19). There was a significant correlation between Children's of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders score and the number of nusinersen administration (<i>r</i> = 0.539, <i>p</i> = 0.05). The correlation between Children's of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders score and patient age (<i>r</i> = 0.361) or the time of first nusinersen dose (<i>r</i> = 0.39) was not significant (<i>p</i> = 0.076 and <i>p</i> = 0.054, respectively). While 93.1% had scoliosis, 69% had pelvic obliquity, and 60.7% had hip subluxation, these conditions showed no significant association with patient age, total nusinersen administrations, age at the first dose, or Children's of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders scores. Disease-modifying therapy provides significant improvements in overall survival and motor function in spinal muscular atrophy type 1. However, progressive spine deformity and hip subluxation still remain significant problems in the majority of cases which would potentially need to be addressed."

Umbilical vein injection led to widespread biodistribution of vector genomes in all examined lamb tissues and in maternal uteruses at harvest (E96 or E140; term = E150). There was robust GFP expression in brain, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), without DRG toxicity and excellent transduction of diaphragm and quadriceps muscles. However, we found evidence of systemic toxicity (fetal growth restriction) and maternal exposure to the viral vector (transient elevation of total bilirubin and a trend toward elevation in anti-AAV9 antibodies). There were no antibodies against GFP in ewes or lambs. Analysis of fetal gonads demonstrated GFP expression in female (but not male) germ cells, with low levels of integration-specific reads, without integration in select proto-oncogenes. These results suggest potential therapeutic benefit of AAV9 PSCGT for neuromuscular disorders, but warrant caution for exposure of female germ cells."

We report on the frequency of STAC3 c.851 G > C in a cohort of 127 patients presenting with congenital hypotonia that tested negative for spinal muscular atrophy and/or Prader-Willi syndrome. We present a clinical retrospective, descriptive review on 31 Southern African patients homozygous for STAC3 c.851 G > C. The frequencies of various phenotypic characteristics were calculated. In total, 25/127 (20%) laboratory-based samples were homozygous for STAC3 c.851 G > C. A carrier rate of 1/56 and a predicted birth rate of 1/12 500 was estimated from a healthy cohort.

The novel finding that STAC3 disorder is a common African myopathy has important clinical implications for the diagnosis, treatment and genetic counselling of individuals, with neonatal and/or childhood hypotonia with or without arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, and their families. The spread of this variant worldwide and the allele frequency higher in the African/African-American ancestry than the Admixed Americans, strongly indicates that the STAC3 c.851 G > C variant has an African origin which may be due to an ancient mutation with migration and population bottlenecks."

Eighteen newborns with biallelic SMN1 deletions and two SMN2 copies were treated preemptively with monotherapy (n = 11) or dual therapy (n = 7) and followed for a median of 3 years. Primary outcomes were independent sitting and walking. Biomarkers were serial muscle ultrasonography (efficacy) and sensory action potentials (safety). Gene therapy was administered by 7-43 postnatal days; dual therapy with risdiplam (n = 6) or nusinersen (n = 1) was started by 15-39 days. Among 18 children enrolled, 17 sat, 15 walked, and 44% had motor delay (i.e., delay or failure to achieve prespecified milestones). Those on dual therapy sat but did not walk at an earlier age. 91% of muscle ultrasounds conducted within 60 postnatal days were normal but by 3-61 months, 94% showed echogenicity and/or fasciculation of at least one muscle group; these changes were indistinguishable between monotherapy and dual therapy cohorts. Five children with three SMN2 copies were treated with monotherapy in parallel: all sat and walked on time and had normal muscle sonograms at all time points. No child on dual therapy experienced treatment-associated adverse events. All 11 participants who completed sensory testing (including six on dual therapy) had intact sural sensory responses. Preemptive dual therapy is well tolerated and may provide modest benefit for children at risk for severe spinal muscular atrophy but does not prevent widespread degenerative changes."

Two patients were referred for further management due to clinical suspicion of type-3 SMA. The definitive diagnosis was confirmed through the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique, as well as whole-exome sequencing (WES). The analysis revealed deletions in exon-7 and 8 of SMN1 in the first patient and a likely pathogenic mutation (NM_001376.5(DYNC1H1):c.1867 T > C (NP_001367.2: p.Phe623Leu)) in DYNC1H1 in the second patient.

    "abstract": "Limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is a debilitating disease and the fourth most common muscular dystrophy. This study describes the development of the LGMD-Health Index (LGMD-HI). Participants were aged >18 years and recruited from three LGMD registries and GRASP-LGMD consortium. The initial instrument, comprised of 16 thematic subscales and 161 items, underwent expert review resulting in item removal as well as confirmatory factor analysis followed by inter-rater reliability and internal consistency of the subscales. Following expert review, one subscale and 59 items were eliminated. Inter-rater reliability was assessed and five items were removed due to Cohen's kappa <0.5. The final subscales had high internal consistencies with an average Cronbach alpha of 0.92. Test re-test reliability of the final instrument was high (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.97). Known groups validity testing showed a statistically significant difference in LGMD-HI scores amongst subjects based on ambulation status (28.7 vs 50.0, p < 0.0001), but not sex, employment status, or genetic subtype. The final instrument is comprised of 15 subscales and 97 items. The LGMD-HI is a disease-specific, patient-reported outcome measure designed in compliance with published FDA guidelines. This instrument is capable of measuring burden of disease with no significant variation based on LGMD subtype."

    "title": "Chronic Pain in Patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy in Switzerland: A Query to the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Registry.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background and Objectives:</b> Chronic pain is a common symptom in various types of neuromuscular disorders. However, for patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the literature regarding chronic pain is scarce. Thus, this study assessed the prevalence of chronic pain in children, adolescents, and adults with SMA and investigated the influence of clinical characteristics on chronic pain. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> This study used data from 141 patients, which were collected by the Swiss Registry for Neuromuscular Disorders. Extracted data included information on pain (present yes/no, pain location, and pain medication) and clinical characteristics, such as SMA type, motor function, wheelchair use, scoliosis, and contractures. <b>Results:</b> The analyses revealed that the highest prevalence of chronic pain was observed in adolescents with 62%, followed by adults with 48%, children (6-12 years) with 39%, and children < 6 years with 10%. The legs, back, and hips were most frequently reported as pain locations. Sex (females), age (adolescents), and the presence of contractures and scoliosis (with surgery) were factors that were associated with chronic pain. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings contribute to a better understanding of pain in SMA, shedding light on its prevalence and characteristics in different age groups, which underscores the importance of assessing and managing pain in patients with SMA."

A functional copy of the human <i>SMN1</i> gene was inserted into the target motor neuron cells via a viral vector, AAV9. In clinical trials, OA was infused through a peripheral venous catheter, and no data are available on central catheter use. Recently, we had a case where OA was administered directly into the right atrium via a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) instead of a peripheral line, as recommended. The patient was a female child aged 4 months, diagnosed as SMA type I. For practical reasons, a dose of OA according to the weight of the patient (1.1 × 10<sup>14</sup> vectorial genomes/kg) was administered via PICC in 1 h, as the product information recommends. The drug was well tolerated, with no hypersensitivity reactions or initial elevation of transaminases or other adverse effects. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported where OA was administered via a central line. This type of administration is not contraindicated, but it is not specifically contemplated or recommended. It is unknown whether central line administration could have any implications for transduction efficiency and immunogenicity. Future studies should clarify these aspects, as each gene therapy has a specific optimal dose recorded that depends on the site and route of administration of the drug, the AAV variant and the transgene."

    "abstract": "Measurement of muscle strength and motor function is recommended in clinical trials of neuromuscular diseases, but the loss of hand strength at which motor function is impacted is not documented. To establish the relationship between hand strength and function, and to determine the strength threshold that differentiates normal and abnormal hand function in individuals with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) or Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). Maximal handgrip and key pinch strength were measured with the MyoGrip and MyoPinch dynamometers, respectively. Hand function was assessed using the MoviPlate, the Motor Function Measure items for distal upper limb (MFM-D3-UL) and the Cochin Hand Function Scale (CHFS). Data from 168 participants (91 DMD and 77 SMA, age 6-31 years) were analyzed. Relationships between strength and function were significant (P < 0.001). Hand function was generally preserved when strength was above the strength threshold determined by Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis: For MFM-D3-UL, the calculated handgrip strength thresholds were 41 and 13% of the predicted strength for a healthy subject (% pred) and the key pinch strength thresholds were 42 and 26% pred for DMD and SMA, respectively. For the MoviPlate, handgrip strength thresholds were 11 and 8% pred and key pinch strength thresholds were 21 and 11% pred for DMD and SMA, respectively. For participants with sub-threshold strength, hand function scores decreased with decreasing strength. At equal % pred strength, individuals with SMA had better functional scores than those with DMD. Hand function is strength-dependent for most motor tasks. It declines only when strength falls below a disease-specific threshold. Therefore, therapies capable of maintaining strength above this threshold should preserve hand function."

    "abstract": "5q-spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder (NMD) that has become one of the first 5% treatable rare diseases. The efficacy of new SMA therapies is creating a dynamic SMA patient landscape, where disease progression and scoliosis development play a central role, however, remain difficult to anticipate. New approaches to anticipate disease progression and associated sequelae will be needed to continuously provide these patients the best standard of care. Here we developed an interpretable machine learning (ML) model that can function as an assistive tool in the anticipation of SMA-associated scoliosis based on disease progression markers. We collected longitudinal data from 86 genetically confirmed SMA patients. We selected six features routinely assessed over time to train a random forest classifier. The model achieved a mean accuracy of 0.77 (SD 0.2) and an average ROC AUC of 0.85 (SD 0.17). For class 1 'scoliosis' the average precision was 0.84 (SD 0.11), recall 0.89 (SD 0.22), F1-score of 0.85 (SD 0.17), respectively. Our trained model could predict scoliosis using selected disease progression markers and was consistent with the radiological measurements. During post validation, the model could predict scoliosis in patients who were unseen during training. We also demonstrate that rare disease data sets can be wrangled to build predictive ML models. Interpretable ML models can function as assistive tools in a changing disease landscape and have the potential to democratize expertise that is otherwise clustered at specialized centers."

The aim was to assess the feasibility and reproducibility of NBS for SMA5q in diverse populations and estimate the real prevalence of 5q-SMA in Russia as well as the distribution of patients with different number of SMN2 copies. The pilot project of NBS here was based on data, involving the analysis of 202,908 newborns. SMA screening assay was performed using a commercially available real-time polymerase chain reaction kit, the Eonis SCID-SMA. In one year, 202,908 newborns were screened, identifying 26 infants with homozygous deletion of SMN1 exon 7, yielding an estimated 5q-SMA incidence of 1:7804 newborns. It was found that 38.46% had two SMN2 copies, 42.31% had three copies, 15.38% had four copies, and 3.85% had five copies of SMN2. Immediate treatment was proposed for patients with two or three SMN2 copies. Infants with four or more SMN2 copies warranted further investigation on management and treatment. Short-term monitoring after gene therapy showed motor function improvements. Delays in treatment initiation were observed, including the testing for adeno-associated virus 9 antibodies and nonmedical factors. The study emphasizes the need for a standardized algorithm for early diagnosis and management through NBS to benefit affected families. Overall, the NBS program for 5q-SMA in Russia demonstrated the potential to improve outcomes and transform SMA from a devastating disease to a chronic condition with evolving medical requirements."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease, causing progressive muscle weakness due to loss of lower motoneurons. Since 2017, three therapies, two modifying gene transcription and one adding the defective gene, have been approved with comparable efficacy on motor outcome. Data on cognitive outcomes of treated SMA type 1 patients is limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate cognitive function in symptomatic and presymptomatic SMA type 1 patients with two or three SMN2 copies who received SMN-modifying or gene-addition therapy in the first year of life. Cognitive testing was performed in 20 patients, including 19 symptomatic SMA type 1 patients with up to three SMN2 copies and 1 pre-symptomatically treated patient. Children were tested using Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) at the age of 2 or 3 years or the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPSII-IV) at the of age of 5 years. 11/20 patients showed subnormal cognitive development. Boys had significantly lower cognitive scores. Patients requiring assisted ventilation or feeding support were more likely to have cognitive deficits. Achieving more motor milestones was associated with a better cognitive outcome. Treated patients with SMA type 1 have heterogeneous cognitive function with 55 % of patients showing deficits. Risk factors for cognitive impairment in our cohort were male gender and need for assisted ventilation or feeding support. Therefore, cognitive assessment should be included in the standard of care to allow early identification of deficits and potential therapeutic interventions."

At the first visit, his exam was unremarkable, except for a mild paresis of the right elbow extension and reduced right bicipital and tricipital reflexes. Electromyography revealed chronic motor neuronopathy and the genetic study confirmed a diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy. At the follow-up visit his complains improved and his neurologic exam returned to normal. To our knowledge, this patient is the oldest asymptomatic SMA individual ever reported. This case highlights the need to exclude late onset spinal muscular atrophy in patients with indolent motor neuronopathy."

Using Medicaid State Drug Utilization Data, we examined Medicaid spending and utilization of rare disease gene and RNA therapies. Between 2017 and 2022, the number of available gene and RNA therapies increased from 3 to 13, yearly Medicaid spending increased from $148.3 million to $879.7 million, and the number of yearly treatments (a proxy for number of patients) increased from 327 to 1638. Nearly all spending was attributed to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy drugs. States participating in Medicaid pooled purchasing initiatives had 39% higher treatments per 100 000 enrollees with no differences in spending. Compared to states without a carve-out, states that carved SMA drugs out of managed Medicaid contracts had higher utilization (54%). Spending among carve-out states varied according to managed care enrollment, being higher for those with <80% of enrollees in managed care as compared with those with ≥80% of enrollees in managed care. This suggests that multi-state purchasing initiatives and managed care carve-outs can help increase access to gene and RNA therapies among Medicaid beneficiaries, but it is unclear if these strategies are effective at managing spending."

Methodology Patient Advocates for Clinical Research (PACER) is a tiered program to share information and education about clinical research with PAGs. Tier one is a self-paced online learning course, followed by workshops on clinical research, Good Clinical Practice, research consent, case studies, and group discussions. Results A total of 20 PAGs represented by 48 participants, active in areas of pediatric cancer, breast cancer, multiple myeloma, type I diabetes, spinal muscular atrophy, sickle cell disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases, participated. Among 48 participants 30 successfully completed the online course (multiple-choice question evaluation score cut-off >70%), attaining an average score of 23.9 ± 2.1 out of 30. Overall, 48 participants attended workshop 1 and 45 workshop 2, with 140 participants joining the focus group discussion (FGD). An overall improvement of 9.4% (𝜒<sup>2</sup> = 46.173; p < 0.001) for workshop 1 and 8.2% (𝜒<sup>2</sup> = 25.412; p < 0.001) for workshop 2 was seen in knowledge gain about clinical research. The FGD raised issues such as misleading information from research teams, unethical recruitment, incomprehensible information sheets, and limited trial-related knowledge fostering fear of participation in clinical research. Conclusions Multimodal and tiered learning of clinical research such as that used by PACER has a good participatory and learning response from PAGs and may be further explored."

    "title": "Transcriptomics reveals transient and dynamic muscle fibrosis and atrophy differences following spinal cord injury in rats.",
    "abstract": "The rate and magnitude of skeletal muscle wasting after severe spinal cord injury (SCI) exceeds most other disuse conditions. Assessing the time course of molecular changes can provide insight into the progression of muscle wasting post-SCI. The goals of this study were (1) to identify potential targets that may prevent the pathologic features of SCI in soleus muscles and (2) to establish therapeutic windows for treating these pathologic changes. Four-month-old Sprague-Dawley male rats received T9 laminectomy (SHAM surgery) or severe contusion SCI. Hindlimb locomotor function was assessed weekly, with soleus muscles obtained 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months post-surgery (n = 6-7 per group per timepoint). RNA was extracted from muscles for bulk RNA-sequencing analysis (n = 3-5 per group per timepoint). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were evaluated between age-matched SHAM and SCI animals. Myofiber size, muscle fibre type and fibrosis were assessed on contralateral muscles. SCI produced immediate and persistent hindlimb paralysis, with Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor scores remaining below 7 throughout the study, contributing to a progressive 25-50% lower soleus mass and myofiber atrophy versus SHAM (P < 0.05 at all timepoints). Transcriptional comparisons of SCI versus SHAM resulted in 184 DEGs (1 week), 436 DEGs (2 weeks), 133 DEGs (1 month) and 1200 DEGs (3 months). Upregulated atrophy-related genes included those associated with cell senescence, nuclear factor kappa B, ubiquitin proteasome and unfolded protein response pathways, along with upregulated genes that negatively influence muscle growth through the transforming growth factor beta pathway and inhibition of insulin-like growth factor-I/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin and p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling. Genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM), including collagens, collagen crosslinkers, proteoglycans and those regulating ECM integrity, were enriched within upregulated DEGs at 1 week but subsequently downregulated at 2 weeks and 3 months and were accompanied by >50% higher ECM areas and hydroxyproline levels in SCI muscles (P < 0.05). Myofiber remodelling genes were enriched in upregulated DEGs at 2 weeks and 1 month and were downregulated at 3 months. Genes that regulate neuromuscular junction remodelling were evident in muscles post-SCI, along with slow-to-fast fibre-type shifts: 1 week and 2 weeks SCI muscles were composed of 90% myosin heavy chain (MHC) type I fibres, which decreased to only 16% at 3 months and were accompanied by 50% fibres containing MHC IIX (P < 0.05). Metabolism genes were enriched in upregulated DEGs at 1 month and were further enriched at 3 months. Our results substantiate many known pathologic features of SCI-induced wasting in rat skeletal muscle and identify a progressive and dynamic transcriptional landscape within the post-SCI soleus. Future studies are warranted to consider these therapeutic treatment windows when countering SCI muscle pathology."

    "abstract": "Biomarkers capable of reflecting disease onset and short- and long-term therapeutic effects in individuals with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are still an unmet need and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNF-H) holds significant promise. We conducted a longitudinal prospective study to evaluate pNF-H levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of 29 individuals with childhood-onset SMA treated with Nuinersen (SMA type 1: <i>n</i> = 6, 2: <i>n</i> = 17, 3: <i>n</i> = 6). pNF-H levels before and during treatment were compared with the levels of controls (<i>n</i> = 22), patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (<i>n</i> = 17), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (<i>n</i> = 11), untreated SMA individuals with chronic type 3 disease (<i>n</i> = 8), and children with presymptomatic SMA (<i>n</i> = 3). SMA type 1 showed the highest mean CSF pNF-H levels before treatment initiation. All Nusinersen-treated individuals (types 1, 2, and 3) showed significantly elevated mean baseline CSF pNF-H compared to controls, which inversely correlated with age at disease onset, age at first dose, disease duration and the initial CHOP INTEND result (SMA type 1 and 2). During 22 months of treatment, CSF pNF-H levels declined during loading doses, stabilizing at reduced levels from the initial maintenance dose in all individuals. Baseline plasma pNF-H levels in type 1 and 2 SMA were significantly increased compared to other cohorts and decreased notably in type 1 after 2 months of treatment and type 2 after 14 months. Conversely, SMA type 3, characterized by lower baseline pNF-H levels, did not show significant fluctuations in plasma pNF-H levels after 14 months of treatment. Our findings suggest that CSF pNF-H levels in untreated SMA individuals are significantly higher than in controls and that monitoring of CSF pNF-H levels may serve as an indicator of rapid short-term treatment response in childhood-onset SMA individuals, irrespective of the subtype of the disease, while also suggesting its potential for assessing long-term suppression of neurodegeneration. Plasma pNF-H may serve as an appropriate outcome measure for disease progression and/or response to treatment in types 1 and 2 but not in type 3. Presymptomatic infants with SMA may show elevated pNF-H levels, confirming early neuronal degeneration."

    "abstract": "In the nucleus, the VRK1 Ser-Thr kinase is distributed in nucleoplasm and chromatin, where it has different roles. VRK1 expression increases in response to mitogenic signals. VRK1 regulates cyclin D1 expression at G0 exit and facilitates chromosome condensation at the end of G2 and G2/M progression to mitosis. These effects are mediated by the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Thr3 by VRK1, and later in mitosis by haspin. VRK1 regulates the apigenetic patterns of histones in processes requiring chromating remodeling, such as transcription, replication and DNA repair. VRK1 is overexpressed in tumors, facilitating tumor progression and resistance to genotoxic treatments. VRK1 also regulates the organization of Cajal bodies assembled on coilin, which are necessary for the assembly of different types of RNP complexes. VRK1 pathogenic variants cuase defects in Cajal bodies, functionally altering neurons with long axons and leading to neurological diseases, such as amyotrophic laterla sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, distal hereditay motor neuropathies and Charcot-Marie-Tooth."

The objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adults with SMA in Germany in the era of disease-modifying therapy. Adults with SMA were recruited via the German national TREAT-NMD SMA patient registry. HRQoL was measured using the EQ-5D-5L, the Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI), and the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36). Estimates were stratified by current best motor function of the lower limb and trunk (i.e., non-sitter, sitter, and walker) and SMA type (i.e., type I, II, and III). A total of 82 adults with SMA (mean age: 42 years, 51% female) self-completed the study questionnaire. The mean EQ-5D-5L utility was estimated at 0.5135 (range across subgroups: 0.31-0.99), mean EQ-VAS at 69.71 (64.67-90.00), mean HUI-derived utility at 0.3171 ( - 0.02-0.96), mean SF-6D utility at 0.6308 (0.58-0.65), and mean SF-36 Physical Component Summary and Mental Health Component Summary scores at 33.78 (9.92-53.10) and 53.49 (21.02-72.25), respectively. We show that adults with SMA experience considerable impairment across a wide range of health dimensions, including mobility, dexterity, pain, and emotional well-being. However, our results exhibit non-trivial variability across clinical subgroups and HRQoL measures.

The objective of this research was to develop a novel, disease-specific caregiver-reported outcome measure for use in FRDA research and clinical care. In prior work, we conducted qualitative interviews and a cross-sectional study of FRDA caregivers and patients to determine the symptoms of greatest importance to individuals with FRDA. We designed the Friedreich Ataxia Caregiver-Reported Health Index (FACR-HI) to serially measure the symptoms of greatest importance to patients and utilized factor analysis, beta testing, reliability testing, and cross-sectional subgroup analysis to further evaluate and optimize this disease-specific outcome measure. The FACR-HI was designed to measure total disease burden and disease burden in 18 symptomatic domains. The FACR-HI total score demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.98) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.96). Beta interview participants found the FACR-HI to be highly relevant, comprehensive, and easy to use. FACR-HI total and subscale scores were associated with functional staging for ataxia scores and speech impairment. Initial evaluation of the FACR-HI supports its content validity, test-retest reliability, and construct validity as a caregiver-reported outcome measure for assessing how pediatric individuals with FRDA feel and function. The FACR-HI provides a potential mechanism to quantify changes in multifactorial FRDA disease burden during future clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Activating signal co-integrator complex 1 (ASCC1) acts with ASCC-ALKBH3 complex in alkylation damage responses. ASCC1 uniquely combines two evolutionarily ancient domains: nucleotide-binding K-Homology (KH) (associated with regulating splicing, transcriptional, and translation) and two-histidine phosphodiesterase (PDE; associated with hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotide phosphate bonds). Germline mutations link loss of ASCC1 function to spinal muscular atrophy with congenital bone fractures 2 (SMABF2). Herein analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) suggests ASCC1 RNA overexpression in certain tumors correlates with poor survival, Signatures 29 and 3 mutations, and genetic instability markers. We determined crystal structures of Alvinella pompejana (Ap) ASCC1 and Human (Hs) PDE domain revealing high-resolution details and features conserved over 500 million years of evolution. Extending our understanding of the KH domain Gly-X-X-Gly sequence motif, we define a novel structural Helix-Clasp-Helix (HCH) nucleotide binding motif and show ASCC1 sequence-specific binding to CGCG-containing RNA. The V-shaped PDE nucleotide binding channel has two His-Φ-Ser/Thr-Φ (HXT) motifs (Φ being hydrophobic) positioned to initiate cyclic phosphate bond hydrolysis. A conserved atypical active-site histidine torsion angle implies a novel PDE substrate. Flexible active site loop and arginine-rich domain linker appear regulatory. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) revealed aligned KH-PDE RNA binding sites with limited flexibility in solution. Quantitative evolutionary bioinformatic analyses of disease and cancer-associated mutations support implied functional roles for RNA binding, phosphodiesterase activity, and regulation. Collective results inform ASCC1's roles in transactivation and alkylation damage responses, its targeting by structure-based inhibitors, and how ASCC1 mutations may impact inherited disease and cancer."

SMN protein is produced by cells throughout the body, and evidence suggests that low SMN protein can have systemic implications, including in male reproductive organs. However, a paucity of research exists on this important topic. This article will discuss findings from non-clinical studies on the role of SMN in the male reproductive system; additionally, real-world observational reports of individuals with SMA will be examined. Furthermore, we will review the non-clinical reproductive findings of risdiplam, a small-molecule SMN2 splicing modifier approved for the treatment of SMA, which has widespread distribution in both the central nervous system and peripheral organs. Specifically, the available non-clinical evidence of the effect of risdiplam on male reproductive organs and spermatogenesis is examined. Lastly, the article will highlight available capabilities to assess male fertility as well as the advanced reproductive technologies utilized to treat male infertility. This article demonstrates the need for further research to better understand the impacts of SMA on male fertility and reproduction."

Mitochondrial abnormalities are widespread in patients with SMA. Disease carriers for SMA (i.e., the parents of patients with SMA) are viewed as asymptomatic for SMA disease. As far as we are aware, mitochondria have not been previously examined in SMA carriers, yet as they are maternally inherited, mitochondrial function in SMA carriers has putative implications for disease pathogenesis. Fibroblast cell lines derived from SMA carriers and controls were obtained from two different sources and cultured under standard conditions. The mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, citrate synthase activity, and bioenergetic analysis were examined as measures of mitochondrial function. The mitochondrial genome was also sequenced in a subset of the fibroblast cell lines to identify any mitochondrial DNA variants. Here, we show a depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, increased levels of reactive oxygen species, and reduced citrate synthase activity in SMA carriers compared with controls. A likely pathogenic variant in the MT-CO3 gene (which encodes subunit III of cytochrome c oxidase) was also identified in a paternal carrier. This study was conducted as a preliminary investigation of mitochondrial function in SMA carriers. Our findings suggest that disease carriers of SMA show differences in mitochondrial function, indicative of a subclinical mitochondrial phenotype. Further investigation in a larger sample set is warranted."

Adaptive immunity may contribute to SMA as described in other motoneuron diseases, yet mechanisms remain elusive. Nusinersen, an antisense treatment, enhances SMN2 expression, benefiting SMA patients. Here we have longitudinally investigated SMA and nusinersen effects on local immune responses in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) - a surrogate of central nervous system parenchyma. Single-cell transcriptomics (SMA: N = 9 versus Control: N = 9) reveal NK cell and CD8+ T cell expansions in untreated SMA CSF, exhibiting activation and degranulation markers. Spatial transcriptomics coupled with multiplex immunohistochemistry elucidate cytotoxicity near chromatolytic motoneurons (N = 4). Post-nusinersen treatment, CSF shows unaltered protein/transcriptional profiles. These findings underscore cytotoxicity's role in SMA pathogenesis and propose it as a therapeutic target. Our study illuminates cell-mediated cytotoxicity as shared features across motoneuron diseases, suggesting broader implications."

    "title": "Polysomnography findings and respiratory muscle function in infants with early onset spinal muscular atrophy after gene replacement as monotherapy: A prospective study.",
    "abstract": "Gene replacement therapy (onasemnogene abeparvovec) is associated with an improvement of the prognosis of children with spinal muscular atrophy, but information on long-term respiratory outcome is scarce. The aim of this study was to report the polysomnography findings and respiratory muscle function of infants with treatment-naive spinal muscular atrophy type 1 and 2 up to 24 months after onasemnogene abeparvovec monotherapy. A clinical and motor evaluation, respiratory muscle function testing, and polysomnography were performed repeatedly. Fifteen spinal muscular atrophy patients (1 presymptomatic, 7 type 1b, 6 type 1c, and 1 type 2) were included at a median age of 8.6 months (range 3.8-12.6) and followed for 24 months. The thoracic over head circumference ratio was close to normal at baseline (median 1.00 (range 0.90-1.05)) and increased significantly over time. All polysomnography and nocturnal gas exchange parameters were within normal ranges at baseline (median apnea-hypopnea index 2.5 events/hour (range 0.4-5.3)) and follow-up. The inspiratory muscle strength was normal at baseline but tended to slightly decrease over time and the expiratory muscle strength was low at any time especially for patients with recurrent respiratory infections (median (range) at baseline in cmH<sub>2</sub>O: crying esophageal pressure 54 (30-110), crying transdiaphragmatic pressure 65 (35-107), gastric pressure during maximal cough 26 (10-130), esophageal pressure during maximal cough 61 (38-150)). Only 3 patients required noninvasive ventilation. A continuous respiratory monitoring of spinal muscular atrophy patients during the first years of life following onasemnogene abeparvovec monotherapy seems recommended despite the normality of polysomnography parameters."

    "title": "Efficient systemic CNS delivery of a therapeutic antisense oligonucleotide with a blood-brain barrier-penetrating ApoE-derived peptide.",
    "abstract": "Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for treating central nervous system (CNS) disorders by modulating gene expression with high selectivity and specificity. However, the poor permeability of ASO across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) diminishes its therapeutic success. Here, we designed and synthesized a series of BBB-penetrating peptides (BPP) derived from either the receptor-binding domain of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) or a transferrin receptor-binding peptide (THR). The BPPs were conjugated to phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) that are chemically analogous to the 2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl) (MOE)-modified ASO approved by the FDA for treating spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The BPP-PMO conjugates significantly increased the level of full-length SMN2 in the patient-derived SMA fibroblasts in a concentration-dependent manner with minimal to no toxicity. Furthermore, the systemic administration of the most potent BPP-PMO conjugates significantly increased the expression of full-length SMN2 in the brain and spinal cord of SMN2 transgenic adult mice. Notably, BPP8-PMO conjugate showed a 1.25-fold increase in the expression of full-length functional SMN2 in the brain. Fluorescence imaging studies confirmed that 78% of the fluorescently (Cy7)-labelled BPP8-PMO reached brain parenchyma, with 11% uptake in neuronal cells. Additionally, the BPP-PMO conjugates containing retro-inverso (RI) D-BPPs were found to possess extended half-lives compared to their L-counterparts, indicating increased stability against protease degradation while preserving the bioactivity. This delivery platform based on BPP enhances the CNS bioavailability of PMO targeting the SMN2 gene, paving the way for the development of systemically administered neurotherapeutics for CNS disorders."

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the ability of laboratories to perform spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) genetic testing in newborns based on dried blood spot (DBS) samples, and to provide reference data and advance preparation for establishing the pilot external quality assessment (EQA) scheme for SMA genetic testing of newborns in China. The pilot EQA scheme contents and evaluation principles of this project were designed by National Center for Clinical Laboratories (NCCL), National Health Commission. Two surveys were carried out in 2022, and 5 batches of blood spots were submitted to the participating laboratory each time. All participating laboratories conducted testing upon receiving samples, and test results were submitted to NCCL within the specified date. The return rates were 75.0% (21/28) and 95.2% (20/21) in the first and second surveys, respectively. The total return rate of the two examinations was 83.7% (41/49). Nineteen laboratories (19/21, 90.5%) had a full score passing on the first survey, while in the second survey twenty laboratories (20/20, 100%) scored full. This pilot EQA survey provides a preliminary understanding of the capability of SMA genetic testing for newborns across laboratories in China. A few laboratories had technical or operational problems in testing. It is, therefore, of importance to strengthen laboratory management and to improve testing capacity for the establishment of a national EQA scheme for newborn SMA genetic testing."

    "abstract": "Natural history and mechanisms for persistent cognitive symptoms (\"brain fog\") following acute and often mild COVID-19 are unknown. In a large prospective cohort of people who underwent testing a median of 9 months after acute COVID-19 in the New York City/New Jersey area, we found that cognitive dysfunction is common; is not influenced by mood, fatigue, or sleepiness; and is correlated with MRI changes in very few people. In a subgroup that underwent cerebrospinal fluid analysis, there are no changes related to Alzheimer's disease or neurodegeneration. Single-cell gene expression analysis in the cerebrospinal fluid shows findings consistent with monocyte recruitment, chemokine signaling, cellular stress, and suppressed interferon response-especially in myeloid cells. Longitudinal analysis shows slow recovery accompanied by key alterations in inflammatory genes and increased protein levels of CXCL8, CCL3L1, and sTREM2. These findings suggest that the prognosis for brain fog following COVID-19 correlates with myeloid-related chemokine and interferon-responsive genes."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by degeneration of lower motor neurons, resulting in progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. However, little is known regarding the cardiac function of children with SMA. We recruited SMA patients younger than 18 years of age from January 1, 2022, to April 1, 2022, in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. All patients underwent a comprehensive cardiac evaluation before treatment, including history taking, physical examination, blood tests of cardiac biomarkers, assessment of echocardiography and electrocardiogram. Age/gender-matched healthy volunteers were recruited as controls. A total of 36 SMA patients (26 with SMA type 2 and 10 with SMA type 3) and 40 controls were enrolled in the study. No patient was clinically diagnosed with heart failure. Blood tests showed elevated values of creatine kinase isoenzyme M and isoenzyme B (CK-MB) mass and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients. Regarding echocardiographic parameters, SMA children were detected with lower global left and right ventricular longitudinal strain, abnormal diastolic filling velocities of trans-mitral and trans-tricuspid flow. The results revealed no clinical heart dysfunction in SMA patients, but subclinical ventricular dysfunction was seen in SMA children including the diastolic function and myocardial performance. Some patients presented with elevated heart rate and abnormal echogenicity of aortic valve or wall. Among these SMA patients, seven patients (19.4%) had scoliosis. The Cobb's angles showed a significant negative correlation with LVEDd/BSA, but no correlation with other parameters, suggesting that mild scoliosis did not lead to significant cardiac dysfunction. Our findings warrant increased attention to the cardiac status and highlight the need to investigate cardiac interventions in SMA children."

    "abstract": "Risdiplam is a once-daily oral, survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) splicing modifier approved for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). JEWELFISH (NCT03032172) investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship of risdiplam in non-treatment-naïve patients with SMA. JEWELFISH enrolled adult and pediatric patients (N = 174) with confirmed diagnosis of 5q-autosomal recessive SMA who had previously received treatment with nusinersen (n = 76), onasemnogene abeparvovec (n = 14), olesoxime (n = 71), or were enrolled in the MOONFISH study (NCT02240355) of the splicing modifier RG7800 (n = 13). JEWELFISH was an open-label study with all participants scheduled to receive risdiplam. The most common adverse event (AE) was pyrexia (42 patients, 24%) and the most common serious AE (SAE) was pneumonia (5 patients, 3%). The rate of AEs and SAEs decreased by > 50% from the first to the second year of treatment, and there were no treatment-related AEs that led to withdrawal from treatment. An increase in SMN protein in blood was observed following risdiplam treatment and sustained over 24 months of treatment irrespective of previous treatment. Exploratory efficacy assessments of motor function showed an overall stabilization in mean total scores as assessed by the 32-item Motor Function Measure, Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded, and Revised Upper Limb Module. The safety profile of risdiplam in JEWELFISH was consistent with previous clinical trials of risdiplam in treatment-naïve patients. Exploratory efficacy outcomes are reported but it should be noted that the main aim of JEWELFISH was to assess safety and PK/PD, and the study was not designed for efficacy analysis.

ASOs can modulate pre-mRNA splicing, increase levels of functional proteins, and decrease levels of toxic proteins. ASOs are being developed for the treatment of motor neuron diseases (MNDs), including spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). The biggest success has been the ASO known as nusinersen, the first effective therapy for SMA, able to improve symptoms and slow disease progression. Another success is tofersen, an ASO designed to treat ALS patients with <i>SOD1</i> gene mutations. Both ASOs have been approved by the FDA and EMA. On the other hand, ASO treatment in ALS patients with the <i>C9orf72</i> gene mutation did not show any improvement in disease progression. The aim of this review is to provide an up-to-date overview of ASO research in MNDs, from preclinical studies to clinical trials and, where available, regulatory approval. We highlight the successes and failures, underline the strengths and limitations of the current ASO research, and suggest possible approaches that could lead to more effective treatments."

The development of contractures is common and negatively impacts function. Clinically, joint hypermobility (JH) is observed but is poorly described, and its relationship with function is unknown. <b>Methods</b><i>:</i> Lower-limb ROM (range of motion) assessments of extension and flexion at the hip, knee, and ankle were performed. ROMs exceeding the published norms were included in the analysis. The functional assessments performed included the six-minute walk test (6 MWT) and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE). <b>Results:</b> Of the 143 participants, 86% (<i>n</i> = 123) had at least one ROM measure that was hypermobile, and 22% (<i>n</i> = 32) had three or more. The HFMSE scores were inversely correlated with hip extension JH (r = -0.60, <i>p</i> = 0.21; <i>n</i> = 6) and positively correlated with knee flexion JH (r = 0.24, <i>p</i> = 0.02, <i>n</i> = 89). There was a moderate, inverse relationship between the 6 MWT distance and ankle plantar flexion JH (r = -0.73, <i>p</i> = 0.002; <i>n</i> = 15). <b>Conclusions:</b> JH was identified in nearly all participants in at least one joint in this study. Hip extension, knee flexion and ankle plantar flexion JH was associated with function.

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by deficiency of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Although SMA is a genetic disease, environmental factors contribute to disease progression. Common pathogen components such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are considered significant contributors to inflammation and have been associated with muscle atrophy, which is considered a hallmark of SMA. In this study, we used the SMNΔ7 experimental mouse model of SMA to scrutinize the effect of systemic LPS administration, a strong pro-inflammatory stimulus, on disease outcome. Systemic LPS administration promoted a reduction in SMN expression levels in CNS, peripheral lymphoid organs, and skeletal muscles. Moreover, peripheral tissues were more vulnerable to LPS-induced damage compared to CNS tissues. Furthermore, systemic LPS administration resulted in a profound increase in microglia and astrocytes with reactive phenotypes in the CNS of SMNΔ7 mice. In conclusion, we hereby show for the first time that systemic LPS administration, although it may not precipitate alterations in terms of deficits of motor functions in a mouse model of SMA, it may, however, lead to a reduction in the SMN protein expression levels in the skeletal muscles and the CNS, thus promoting synapse damage and glial cells' reactive phenotype."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is typically characterized as a motor neuron disease, but extraneuronal phenotypes are present in almost every organ in severely affected patients and animal models. Extraneuronal phenotypes were previously underappreciated, as patients with severe SMA phenotypes usually died in infancy; however, with current treatments for motor neurons increasing patient lifespan, impaired function of peripheral organs may develop into significant future comorbidities and lead to new treatment-modified phenotypes. Fatty liver is seen in SMA animal models, but generalizability to patients and whether this is due to hepatocyte-intrinsic survival motor neuron (SMN) protein deficiency and/or subsequent to skeletal muscle denervation is unknown. If liver pathology in SMA is SMN dependent and hepatocyte intrinsic, this suggests SMN-repleting therapies must target extraneuronal tissues and motor neurons for optimal patient outcome. Here, we showed that fatty liver is present in SMA patients and that SMA patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells were susceptible to steatosis. Using proteomics, functional studies, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we confirmed that fatty liver in SMA is a primary SMN-dependent hepatocyte-intrinsic liver defect associated with mitochondrial and other hepatic metabolism implications. These pathologies require monitoring and indicate the need for systematic clinical surveillance and additional and/or combinatorial therapies to ensure continued SMA patient health."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare, autosomal recessive, neuromuscular disease that leads to progressive muscular weakness and atrophy. Nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide, was approved for SMA in China in February 2019. We report interim results from a post-marketing surveillance phase 4 study, PANDA (NCT04419233), that collects data on the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of nusinersen in children with SMA in routine clinical practice in China. Participants enrolled in PANDA will be observed for 2 years following nusinersen treatment initiation. The primary endpoint is the incidence of adverse events (AEs)/serious AEs (SAEs) during the treatment period. Efficacy assessments include World Health Organization (WHO) Motor Milestones assessment, the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE), and ventilation support. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of nusinersen are measured at each dose visit. Fifty participants were enrolled as of the January 4, 2023, data cutoff: 10 with infantile-onset (≤ 6 months) and 40 with later-onset (> 6 months) SMA. All 50 participants have received at least one dose of nusinersen; 6 have completed the study. AEs were experienced by 45 (90%) participants and were mostly mild/moderate; no AEs led to nusinersen discontinuation or study withdrawal. Eleven participants experienced SAEs, most commonly pneumonia (n = 9); none were considered related to study treatment. Stability or gain of WHO motor milestone was observed and mean HINE-2 scores improved in both subgroups throughout the study. No serious respiratory events occurred, and no permanent ventilation support was initiated during the study. Pre-dose nusinersen CSF concentrations increased steadily through the loading-dose period, with no accumulation in plasma after multiple doses. Nusinersen was generally well tolerated with an acceptable overall safety profile, consistent with the known safety of nusinersen. Efficacy, safety, and nusinersen exposure are consistent with prior observations. These results support continuing PANDA and evaluation of nusinersen in Chinese participants with SMA.

    "abstract": "X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a rare, life-threatening congenital disease, which is not well-defined. To our knowledge, no studies characterizing the XLMTM disease burden have been conducted in Brazil. We identified and described patients with suspected XLMTM using administrative claims data from the Brazilian public healthcare system. Data from 2015 to 2019 were extracted from the DATASUS database. As no XLMTM-specific ICD-10 code was available, a stepwise algorithm was applied to identify patients with suspected XLMTM by selecting male patients with a congenital myopathies code (G71.2), aged < 18 years at index date (first claim of G71.2), with an associated diagnostic procedure (muscle biopsy/genetic test) and without spinal muscular atrophy or Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We attempted to identify patients with suspected severe XLMTM based on use of both respiratory and feeding support, which are nearly universal in the care of XLMTM patients. Analyses were performed for the overall cohort and stratified by age at index date < 5 years old and ≥ 5 years old. Of 173 patients with suspected XLMTM identified, 39% were < 5 years old at index date. Nearly all (N = 166) patients (96%) were diagnosed by muscle biopsy (91% of patients < 5 years old and 99% of patients ≥ 5 years old), six (3.5%) were diagnosed by clinical evaluation (8% of patients < 5 years old and 1% of patients ≥ 5 years old), and one was diagnosed by a genetic test. Most patients lived in Brasilia (n = 55), São Paulo (n = 33) and Minas Gerais (n = 27). More than 85% of patients < 5 years old and approximately 75% of patients ≥ 5 years old had physiotherapy at the index date. In both age groups, nearly 50% of patients required hospitalization at some point and 25% required mobility support. Respiratory and feeding support were required for 3% and 12% of patients, respectively, suggesting that between 5 and 21 patients may have had severe XLMTM. In this real-world study, genetic testing for XLMTM appears to be underutilized in Brazil and may contribute to underdiagnosis of the disease. Access to diagnosis and care is limited outside of specific regions with specialized clinics and hospitals. Substantial use of healthcare resources included hospitalization, physiotherapy, mobility support, and, to a lesser extent, feeding support and respiratory support."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) genes, SMN1 and SMN2 (hereinafter referred to as SMN1/2), produce multiple circular RNAs (circRNAs), including C2A-2B-3-4 that encompasses early exons 2A, 2B, 3 and 4. C2A-2B-3-4 is a universally and abundantly expressed circRNA of SMN1/2. Here we report the transcriptome- and proteome-wide effects of overexpression of C2A-2B-3-4 in inducible HEK293 cells. Our RNA-Seq analysis revealed altered expression of ~ 15% genes (4172 genes) by C2A-2B-3-4. About half of the affected genes by C2A-2B-3-4 remained unaffected by L2A-2B-3-4, a linear transcript encompassing exons 2A, 2B, 3 and 4 of SMN1/2. These findings underscore the unique role of the structural context of C2A-2B-3-4 in gene regulation. A surprisingly high number of upregulated genes by C2A-2B-3-4 were located on chromosomes 4 and 7, whereas many of the downregulated genes were located on chromosomes 10 and X. Supporting a cross-regulation of SMN1/2 transcripts, C2A-2B-3-4 and L2A-2B-3-4 upregulated and downregulated SMN1/2 mRNAs, respectively. Proteome analysis revealed 61 upregulated and 57 downregulated proteins by C2A-2B-3-4 with very limited overlap with those affected by L2A-2B-3-4. Independent validations confirmed the effect of C2A-2B-3-4 on expression of genes associated with chromatin remodeling, transcription, spliceosome function, ribosome biogenesis, lipid metabolism, cytoskeletal formation, cell proliferation and neuromuscular junction formation. Our findings reveal a broad role of C2A-2B-3-4, and expands our understanding of functions of SMN1/2 genes."

However, determining promising targets is hampered by the challenge of systematically mapping splicing-regulatory elements (SREs) in their native sequence context. Here, we use the catalytically inactive CRISPR-RfxCas13d RNA-targeting system (dCas13d/gRNA) as a programmable platform to bind SREs and modulate splicing by competing against endogenous splicing factors. SpliceRUSH, a high-throughput screening method, was developed to map SREs in any gene of interest using a lentivirus gRNA library that tiles the genetic region, including distal intronic sequences. When applied to SMN2, a therapeutic target for spinal muscular atrophy, SpliceRUSH robustly identifies not only known SREs but also a previously unknown distal intronic SRE, which can be targeted to alter exon 7 splicing using either dCas13d/gRNA or ASOs. This technology enables a deeper understanding of splicing regulation with applications for RNA-based drug discovery."

Conduct a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of onasemnogene abeparvovec in patients diagnosed with SMA type 1, based on the available evidence. This article results from searches conducted on databases up to November 2022. Outcomes of interest were global survival and event-free survival, improvement in motor function and treatment-related adverse events. Risk of bias assessment and certainty of evidence were performed for each outcome. Proportional meta-analysis models were performed when applicable. Four reports of three open-label, non-comparative clinical trials covering 67 patients were included. Meta-analyses of data available in a 12-month follow-up estimate a global survival of 97.56% (95%CI: 92.55 to 99.86, I2 = 0%, n = 67), an event-free survival of 96.5% (95%CI: 90.76 to 99.54, I2 = 32%, n = 66) and a CHOP-INTEND score ≥ 40 points proportion of 87.28% (95%CI: 69.81 to 97.83, I2 = 69%, n = 67).

The first products have already been licensed in the European Union for the treatment of immune deficiency, spinal muscular atrophy, hemophilia, retinal dystrophy, a rare neurotransmitter disorder and some hematological cancers, while many more are being assessed in preclinical and clinical trials. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the core principles of gene therapy along with information on challenges and risks. Benefits, adverse effects and potential risks are illustrated based on the examples of hemophilia and spinal muscular atrophy. At present, in-vitro and in-vivo gene addition or gene augmentation is the most commonly established type of gene therapy. More recently, more sophisticated and precise approaches such as in situ gene editing have moved into focus. However, all types of gene therapy require long-term observation of treated patients to ensure safety, efficacy, predictability and durability. Important safety concerns include immune reactions to the vector, the foreign DNA or the new protein resulting from gene therapy, and a remaining low cancer risk based on insertional mutagenesis. Ethical and regulatory issues need to be addressed, and new reimbursement models are called for to ease the financial burden that this new treatment poses for the health care system. Gene therapy holds great promise for considerable improvement or even cure of genetic diseases with serious clinical consequences. However, a number of questions and issues need to be clarified to ensure broad accessibility of safe and efficacious products."

Risdiplam, the first and only oral SMN2 pre-mRNA splicing modifier, is US Food and Drug Administration-approved for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with SMA. For patients with SMA, long-term adherence to and persistence with an SMA treatment may be important for achieving maximum clinical benefits. However, real-world evidence on patient adherence to and persistence with risdiplam is limited. This retrospective study examined real-world adherence and persistence with risdiplam from a specialty pharmacy in patients with SMA over a 12-month period. Adherence was estimated by using proportion of days covered (PDC) and was calculated over variable (time between first and last fill) and fixed (time from first fill to study period end) intervals. Persistence was defined as no gap in supply ≥ 90 days. Patients were included if the time between the index date and study observation period was ≥ 12 months, if they initiated risdiplam between August 2020 and September 2022, received ≥ 2 risdiplam fills, and had an SMA diagnosis associated with a risdiplam fill. Subgroup analyses of risdiplam adherence and persistence were performed by age and primary payer type. The proportion of patients (N = 1636) adherent at 12 months based on variable and fixed interval PDC was 93% and 79%, respectively. Adherence was high among patients on commercial insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare (range 86-96%). Mean persistence was 330.4 days. The highest proportion of patients who were persistent were on Medicaid (81%). These findings demonstrate that patient adherence to and persistence with risdiplam treatment were high, including across all subgroups tested."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by a loss of motor neurons and progressive muscle weakness. Children with untreated type 1 SMA never sit independently and require increasing levels of ventilatory support as the disease progresses. Without intervention, and lacking ventilatory support, death typically occurs before the age of 2 years. There are currently no head-to-head trials comparing available treatments in SMA. Indirect treatment comparisons are therefore needed to provide information on the relative efficacy and safety of SMA treatments for healthcare decision-making. The long-term efficacy and safety of risdiplam versus nusinersen in children with type 1 SMA was evaluated using indirect treatment comparison methodology to adjust for differences between population baseline characteristics, to reduce any potential bias in the comparative analysis. An unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison was conducted using risdiplam data from 58 children in FIREFISH (NCT02913482) and published aggregate nusinersen data from 81 children obtained from the ENDEAR (NCT02193074) and SHINE (NCT02594124) clinical trials with at least 36 months of follow-up. Children with type 1 SMA treated with risdiplam had a 78% reduction in the rate of death, an 81% reduction in the rate of death or permanent ventilation, and a 57% reduction in the rate of serious adverse events compared with children treated with nusinersen. Children treated with risdiplam also had a 45% higher rate of achieving a Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination, Module 2 motor milestone response and a 186% higher rate of achieving a ≥ 4-point improvement in Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders compared with children treated with nusinersen. Long-term data supported risdiplam as a superior alternative to nusinersen in children with type 1 SMA. Video abstract available for this article. Video abstract (MP4 184542 KB)."

    "title": "From data to discovery: AI-guided analysis of disease-relevant molecules in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).",
    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy is caused by partial loss of survival of motoneuron (SMN) protein expression. The numerous interaction partners and mechanisms influenced by SMN loss result in a complex disease. Current treatments restore SMN protein levels to a certain extent, but do not cure all symptoms. The prolonged survival of patients creates an increasing need for a better understanding of SMA. Although many SMN-protein interactions, dysregulated pathways, and organ phenotypes are known, the connections among them remain largely unexplored. Monogenic diseases are ideal examples for the exploration of cause-and-effect relationships to create a network describing the disease-context. Machine learning tools can utilize such knowledge to analyze similarities between disease-relevant molecules and molecules not described in the disease so far. We used an artificial intelligence-based algorithm to predict new genes of interest. The transcriptional regulation of 8 out of 13 molecules selected from the predicted set were successfully validated in an SMA mouse model. This bioinformatic approach, using the given experimental knowledge for relevance predictions, enhances efficient targeted research in SMA and potentially in other disease settings."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic neuromuscular disease caused by lack of survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein, is characterized by muscular atrophy and respiratory and bulbar dysfunction. While swallowing disorders are common, they remain poorly studied. Our study aimed to explore 1) intraoral pressure measurements with the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument system and the reliability of a Swallowing Function Assessment Questionnaire (SFAQ) in healthy controls, and 2) evaluate their use as swallowing function biomarkers and the evolution of swallowing function over time in children with SMA. We recruited 53 healthy children and 27 SMA patients all treated with SMN gene modulator therapy. Participants completed the SFAQ and underwent at least one measurement of maximal oral pressures (lingual, labial, and masseter). Mean oral normalized pressure index were lower (all sites p < 0.001) and mean SFAQ scores were higher (p < 0.001) in patients compared with healthy controls. Pressure evolution over 1 year in SMA patients for all three oral sites did not show significant differences. SFAQ scores correlated negatively with oral pressures at all three sites in patients. Both tools provided new insights on the oral and pharyngeal phase of swallowing in SMA patients. In SMA patients, muscle strength in certain crucial anatomical regions during swallowing is weaker than in healthy children."

    "abstract": "Rare diseases, defined by their low prevalence, present significant challenges, including delayed detection, expensive treatments, and limited research. This study delves into the genetic basis of two noteworthy rare diseases in Saudi Arabia: Phenylketonuria (PKU) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). PKU, resulting from mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, exhibits geographical variability and impacts intellectual abilities. SMA, characterized by motor neuron loss, is linked to mutations in the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Recognizing the importance of unveiling signature genomics in rare diseases, we conducted a quantitative study on PAH and SMN1 proteins of multiple organisms by employing various quantitative techniques to assess genetic variations. The derived signature-genomics contributes to a deeper understanding of these critical genes, paving the way for enhanced diagnostics for disorders associated with PAH and SMN1."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease. Nusinersen sodium (NS) is the world's first antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) drug for SMA precise targeted therapy. However, the limited half-life of oligonucleotides and their tendency to accumulate in hepatic and renal tissues presented significant challenges for clinical investigation and therapeutic drug monitoring. In this study, we proposed an analytical strategy based on the specific capture of oligonucleotide functionalized fluorescent probes by single stranded binding proteins (SSB) for ultra-sensitive and high-throughput detection of nusinersen sodium in human serum. The magnetic nanoparticles modified with single-strand binding protein (MNPs-SSB) selectively bonded to the red fluorescent quantum dots functionalized with oligonucleotides (RQDs-ssDNA) that were complementary to nusinersen sodium. Upon interaction with nusinersen sodium, RQDs-ssDNA formed a double-stranded complex (RQDs-ssDNA-NS), resulting in enhanced red fluorescence after magnetic separation as it was no longer captured by MNPs-SSB but remained in the supernatant. A quantitative analysis of nusinersen sodium in biological samples was successfully achieved by establishing a relationship between fluorescence intensity and its concentration. The detection signal F/F0 exhibited a linear correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9871) over a wide range from 0.1 nM to 200 nM, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.03 nM, demonstrating the high specificity and rapid analysis time (only 30 min). This method provided a novel approach for sensitive, high-throughput, and specific analysis of nusinersen sodium and similar ASO drugs."

    "abstract": "We report changes in the natural history of hip instability with nusinersen treatment among patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type II after onset of weakness, historically wheelchair-bound but now potentially ambulatory in the era of disease-modifying therapy. Patients with genetically confirmed diagnoses of SMA type II who received intrathecal nusinersen from January 1, 2018, to June 30, 2022, were screened for inclusion. Patients with less than 6 months of follow-up, or prior hip surgeries were excluded. Primary clinical outcome measures included scores from Hammersmith motor functional scale expanded (HMFSE), revised upper limb module (RULM), 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and ambulatory status. Radiographic outcomes, including Reimer migration index, the presence of scoliosis, and pelvic obliquity, were also assessed. Secondary outcomes involved comparisons with a historical cohort of SMA type II patients treated at our institution who never received nusinersen. Twenty hips from 5 boys and 5 girls were included in the analysis, with a mean follow-up of 3 years and 8 months. The median age at time of nusinersen initiation was 6.8 years old, ranging between 2.5 and 10.3 years. All patients developed lower limb motor weakness before nusinersen initiation. After treatment with nusinersen, 1 previously stable hip (5%) developed subluxation, 15 hips (75%) remain subluxated, 3 hips (15%) remain dislocated, and 1 hip (5%) remained stable, with a statistically significant difference between the pretreatment and posttreatment groups ( P <0.01). Six patients (60%) were ambulatory at latest follow-up. Six patients (60%) had improved ambulatory ability; 2 had static ambulatory ability (20%); and 2 had deterioration in their walking ability. The median HFMSE score improved from 18.5 (range 0 to 46) to 22 (range 0 to 49) ( P =0.813), whereas the median RULM score improved from 17 (range 2 to 28) to 21.5 (range 5 to 37), which was statistically significant ( P =0.007). Hip instability persists despite treatment with nusinersen among patients with SMA type II who received nusinersen after onset of lower limb weakness. Therapeutic Level IV."

Currently, new methods of pathogenetic therapy with nusinersen and risdiplam, as well as etiological therapy with onasemnogene abeparvovec, are available in the Russia. Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide that modifies splicing of the <i>SMN2</i> gene to increase production of normal full-length motor neuron survival protein, which is deficient in SMA. The mechanism of action of Nusinersen is based on the activation of the disabled exon 7 of the <i>SMN2</i> gene. The article describes an example of long-term effective treatment using pathogenetic therapy of a patient diagnosed with SMA type 3."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) is a fatal childhood motoneuron disease caused by mutations in the <i>IGHMBP2</i> gene. It is characterized by muscle weakness, initially affecting the distal extremities due to the degeneration of spinal α-motoneurons, and respiratory distress, due to the paralysis of the diaphragm. Infantile forms with a severe course of the disease can be distinguished from juvenile forms with a milder course. Mutations in the <i>IGHMBP2</i> gene have also been found in patients with peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2S (CMT2S). IGHMBP2 is an ATP-dependent 5'→3' RNA helicase thought to be involved in translational mechanisms. In recent years, several animal models representing both SMARD1 forms and CMT2S have been generated to initially study disease mechanisms. Later, the models showed very well that both stem cell therapies and the delivery of the human <i>IGHMBP2</i> cDNA by AAV9 approaches (AAV9-<i>IGHMBP2)</i> can lead to significant improvements in disease symptoms. Therefore, the SMARD1 animal models, in addition to the cellular models, provide an inexhaustible source for obtaining knowledge of disease mechanisms, disease progression at the cellular level, and deeper insights into the development of therapies against SMARD1."

    "abstract": "This study aims to systematically collect data on cost-effectiveness analyses that assess technologies to treat type I and II spinal muscular atrophy and evaluate their recommendations. A structured electronic search was conducted in 4 databases. Additionally, a complementary manual search was conducted. Complete economic studies that evaluated nusinersen, risdiplam, onasemnogene abeparvovec (OA), and the best support therapy (BST) from the health system's perspective were selected. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were compared with various thresholds for the analysis. The review was registered a priori in PROSPERO (CRD42022365391). Twenty studies were included in the analyses. They were all published between 2017 and 2022 and represent the recommendations in 8 countries. Most studies adopted 5, 6, or 10-state Markov models. Some authors took part in multiple studies. Four technologies were evaluated: BST (N = 14), nusinersen (N = 19), risdiplam (N = 5), and OA (N = 9). OA, risdiplam, and nusinersen were considered inefficient compared with the BST. Risdiplam and OA were generally regarded as cost-effective when compared with nusinersen. Because nusinersen is not a cost-effective drug, no recommendation can be derived from this result. Risdiplam and OA were compared in 2 studies that presented opposite results. Nusinersen, risdiplam, and OA are being adopted worldwide as a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy. Despite that, the pharmacoeconomic analyses show that the technologies are not cost-effective compared with the BST. The lack of controlled studies for risdiplam and OA hamper any conclusions about their face-to-face comparison."

    "title": "Dysregulation of innate immune signaling in animal models of spinal muscular atrophy.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating neuromuscular disease caused by hypomorphic loss of function in the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMA presents across a broad spectrum of disease severity. Unfortunately, genetic models of intermediate SMA have been difficult to generate in vertebrates and are thus unable to address key aspects of disease etiology. To address these issues, we developed a Drosophila model system that recapitulates the full range of SMA severity, allowing studies of pre-onset biology as well as late-stage disease processes. Here, we carried out transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of mild and intermediate Drosophila models of SMA to elucidate molecules and pathways that contribute to the disease. Using this approach, we elaborated a role for the SMN complex in the regulation of innate immune signaling. We find that mutation or tissue-specific depletion of SMN induces hyperactivation of the immune deficiency (IMD) and Toll pathways, leading to overexpression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and ectopic formation of melanotic masses in the absence of an external challenge. Furthermore, the knockdown of downstream targets of these signaling pathways reduced melanotic mass formation caused by SMN loss. Importantly, we identify SMN as a negative regulator of a ubiquitylation complex that includes Traf6, Bendless, and Diap2 and plays a pivotal role in several signaling networks. In alignment with recent research on other neurodegenerative diseases, these findings suggest that hyperactivation of innate immunity contributes to SMA pathology. This work not only provides compelling evidence that hyperactive innate immune signaling is a primary effect of SMN depletion, but it also suggests that the SMN complex plays a regulatory role in this process in vivo. In summary, immune dysfunction in SMA is a consequence of reduced SMN levels and is driven by cellular and molecular mechanisms that are conserved between insects and mammals."

Here, we present a precise and programmable method called prime editor-mediated correction of nucleotide repeat expansion (PE-CORE) for correcting pathogenic nucleotide repeat expansion. PE-CORE leverages a prime editor and paired pegRNAs to achieve targeted correction of repeat sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PE-CORE in HEK293T cells and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Specifically, we focus on spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and spinocerebellar ataxia type, two diseases associated with nucleotide repeat expansion. Our results demonstrate the successful correction of pathogenic expansions in iPSCs and subsequent differentiation into motor neurons. Specifically, we detect distinct downshifts in the size of both the mRNA and protein, confirming the functional correction of the iPSC-derived motor neurons. These findings highlight PE-CORE as a precision tool for addressing the intricate challenges of nucleotide repeat expansion disorders, paving the way for targeted therapies and potential clinical applications."

Drugs like risdiplam and branaplam change how U1 snRNP recognizes particular 5' splice sites (5'SS) and promote U1 snRNP binding and splicing at these locations. Despite the therapeutic potential of 5'SS modulators, the complexity of their interactions and snRNP substrates have precluded defining a mechanism for 5'SS modulation. We have determined a sequential binding mechanism for modulation of -1A bulged 5'SS by branaplam using a combination of ensemble kinetic measurements and colocalization single molecule spectroscopy (CoSMoS). Our mechanism establishes that U1-C protein binds reversibly to U1 snRNP, and branaplam binds to the U1 snRNP/U1-C complex only after it has engaged a -1A bulged 5'SS. Obligate orders of binding and unbinding explain how reversible branaplam interactions cause formation of long-lived U1 snRNP/5'SS complexes. Branaplam is a ribonucleoprotein, not RNA duplex alone, targeting drug whose action depends on fundamental properties of 5'SS recognition."

The aim of the study was to calculate minimal clinically important difference (MCID), minimal detectable change (MDC), and values for the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) in an untreated international SMA cohort. The study employed two distinct methods. MDC was calculated using distribution-based approaches to consider standard error of measurement and effect size change in a population of 321 patients (176 SMA II and 145 SMA III), allowing for stratification based on age and function. MCID was assessed using anchor-based methods (receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve analysis and standard error) on 76 patients (52 SMA II and 24 SMA III) for whom the 12-month HFMSE could be anchored to a caregiver-reported clinical perception questionnaire. With both approaches, SMA type II and type III patients had different profiles. The MCID, using ROC analysis, identified optimal cutoff points of -2 for type II and -4 for type III patients, whereas using the standard error we found the optimal cutoff points to be 1.5 for improvement and -3.2 for deterioration. Furthermore, distribution-based methods uncovered varying values across age and functional status subgroups within each SMA type. These results emphasize that the interpretation of a single MCID or MDC value obtained in large cohorts with different functional status needs to be made with caution, especially when these may be used to assess possible responses to new therapies."

Little is known about sleep quality in spinal muscular atrophy. The aims of this study were to evaluate occurrence and characteristics of sleep-disordered breathing and subjective sleep quality among adolescent and adult patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 2 or 3. Twenty patients aged 33.9 ± 15.2 years were studied. They underwent nocturnal cardiorespiratory monitoring, lung and muscular function evaluation, and were administered the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. Nineteen patients showed sleep-disordered breathing, with obstructive events in seven subjects and non-obstructive events in the remaining 12. In the latter group, 10 patients showed pseudo-obstructive hypopneas. Patients with non-obstructive sleep-disordered breathing were younger (p = 0.042), had a lower body mass index (p = 0.0001), were more often affected by spinal muscular atrophy type 2 (p = 0.001), and showed worse impairment of respiratory function than patients with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing. Ten patients were classified as poor sleepers and 10 patients good sleepers. In the whole sample, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure proved to be the only independent predictor of sleep quality (p = 0.009). In conclusion, sleep-disordered breathing is common even among adult patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 2 and 3, and may show either obstructive or different types on non-obstructive features. A worse respiratory muscle function is associated to non-obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and poorer sleep quality. Sleep quality should receive greater attention especially in patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 2, who have a poorer respiratory muscle function, as it could affect their quality of life."

Patients identified by newborn screening often require lifelong medical management and community support to achieve the best possible outcome. To advance the long-term follow-up of infants identified through newborn screening (NBS), the Long-Term Follow-up Cares and Check Initiative (LTFU-Cares and Check) designed, implemented, and evaluated a system of longitudinal data collection and annual reporting engaging parents, clinical providers, and state NBS programs. The LTFU-Cares and Check focused on newborns identified with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) through NBS and the longitudinal health information prioritized by parents and families. Pediatric neurologists who care for newborns with SMA entered annual data, and data tracking and visualization tools were delivered to state NBS programs with a participating clinical center. In this publication, we report on the development, use of, and preliminary results from the LTFU-Cares and Check Initiative, which was designed as a comprehensive model of LTFU.

However, clinical trials of Zolgensma have raised two major concerns: insufficient therapeutic effects and adverse events. In a recent clinical trial, 30% of patients failed to achieve motor milestones despite pre-symptomatic treatment. In addition, more than 20% of patients showed hepatotoxicity due to excessive virus dosage, even after the administration of an immunosuppressant. Here, we aimed to test whether a ubiquitination-resistant variant of survival motor neuron (SMN), SMN<sup>K186R</sup>, has improved therapeutic effects for SMA compared with wild-type SMN (SMN<sup>WT</sup>). A severe SMA mouse model, SMA type 1.5 (Smn<sup>-/-</sup>; SMN2<sup>+/+</sup>; SMN∆7<sup>+/-</sup>) mice, was used to compare the differences in therapeutic efficacy between AAV9-SMN<sup>WT</sup> and AAV9-SMN<sup>K186R</sup>. All animals were injected within Postnatal Day (P) 1 through a facial vein or cerebral ventricle. AAV9-SMN<sup>K186R</sup>-treated mice showed increased lifespan, body weight, motor neuron number, muscle weight and functional improvement in motor functions as compared with AAV9-SMN<sup>WT</sup>-treated mice. Lifespan increased by more than 10-fold in AAV9-SMN<sup>K186R</sup>-treated mice (144.8 ± 26.11 days) as compared with AAV9-SMN<sup>WT</sup>-treated mice (26.8 ± 1.41 days). AAV9-SMN<sup>K186R</sup>-treated mice showed an ascending weight pattern, unlike AAV9-SMN<sup>WT</sup>-treated mice, which only gained weight until P20 up to 5 g on average. Several motor function tests showed the improved therapeutic efficacy of SMN<sup>K186R</sup>. In the negative geotaxis test, AAV9-SMN<sup>K186R</sup>-treated mice turned their bodies in an upward direction successfully, unlike AAV9-SMN<sup>WT</sup>-treated mice, which failed to turn upwards from around P23. Hind limb clasping phenotype was rarely observed in AAV9-SMN<sup>K186R</sup>-treated mice, unlike AAV9-SMN<sup>WT</sup>-treated mice that showed clasping phenotype for more than 20 out of 30 s. At this point, the number of motor neurons (1.5-fold) and the size of myofibers (2.1-fold) were significantly increased in AAV9-SMN<sup>K186R</sup>-treated mice compared with AAV9-SMN<sup>WT</sup>-treated mice without prominent neurotoxicity. AAV9-SMN<sup>K186R</sup> had fewer liver defects compared with AAV9-SMN<sup>WT</sup>, as judged by increased proliferation of hepatocytes (P < 0.0001) and insulin-like growth factor-1 production (P < 0.0001). Especially, low-dose AAV9-SMN<sup>K186R</sup> (nine-fold) also reduced clasping time compared with SMN<sup>WT</sup>. SMN<sup>K186R</sup> will provide improved therapeutic efficacy in patients with severe SMA with insufficient therapeutic efficacy. Low-dose treatment of SMA patients with AAV9-SMN<sup>K186R</sup> can reduce the adverse events of Zolgensma. Collectively, SMN<sup>K186R</sup> has value as a new treatment for SMA that improves treatment effectiveness and reduces adverse events simultaneously."

    "abstract": "To establish a haplotype-based noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) workflow for single-gene recessive disorders that adapt to dizygotic (DZ) twin pregnancies. Twin pregnancies at risk of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, hemophilia B, spinal muscular atrophy, phenylketonuria, and nonsyndromic hearing loss were recruited. For subsequent analysis, capture sequencing targeting highly heterozygotic single nucleotide polymorphism sites was conducted. Paternal-specific alleles were used to calculate the total and individual fetal fractions and determine zygosity. A two-step Bayes Factor model was applied to clarify the complex genomic landscape in the maternal plasma: the first step involved determining whether the twins inherited the same haplotype, and the second step involved estimating their individual genotypes. NIPT results were subsequently confirmed by invasive diagnosis. Nine twin pregnancies were recruited, including five DZ and four monozygotic (MZ) twins. The earliest gestational age was 8<sup>+0</sup> weeks, and the minimum fetal fraction was 4.6%. Three twin pregnancies were reported with one affected fetus, while the remaining six were reported without affected fetuses. Two dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies were confirmed to be MZ twins. The NIPT results were 100% consistent with those of invasive procedures or diagnostic genetic testing after birth. This study is the first to perform NIPT for single-gene disorders in twin pregnancies and preliminarily confirm its clinical feasibility. Acknowledging the twins' genotypes in the first trimester is valuable as it empowers obstetric care providers and parents to have adequate time for pregnancy management and decision-making."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare, progressive, neuromuscular disorder. Recent advances in treatment require an updated assessment of burden to inform reimbursement decisions. To quantify healthcare resource utilisation (HCRU) and cost of care for patients with SMA. Cohort study of patients with SMA identified in the Swedish National Patient Registry (2007-2018), matched to a reference cohort grouped into four SMA types (1, 2, 3, unspecified adult onset [UAO]). HCRU included inpatient admissions, outpatient visits, procedures, and dispensed medications. Direct medical costs were estimated by multiplying HCRU by respective unit costs. Average annual HCRU and medical costs were modelled for SMA versus reference cohorts to estimate differences attributable to the disease (i.e., average treatment effect estimand). The trajectory of direct costs over time were assessed using synthetic cohorts. We identified 290 SMA patients. Annualised HCRU was higher in SMA patients compared with reference cohorts. Highest risk ratios were observed for inpatient overnight stays for type 1 (risk ratio [RR]: 29.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.0, 53.5) and type 2 (RR: 23.3; 95% CI: 16.4,33.1). Mean annual direct medical costs per patient for each year since first diagnosis were greatest for type 1 (€114,185 and SMA-attributable: €113,380), type 2 (€61,876 and SMA-attributable: €61,237), type 3 (€45,518 and SMA-attributable: €44,556), and UAO (€4046 and SMA-attributable: €2098). Costs were greatest in the 2-3 years after the first diagnosis for all types. The economic burden attributable to SMA is significant. Further research is needed to understand the burden in other European countries and the impact of new treatments."

    "abstract": "Stasimon/Tmem41b is a transmembrane protein with phospholipid scrambling activity that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and has been implicated in autophagy, lipid metabolism, and viral replication. Stasimon/Tmem41b has also been linked to the function of sensory-motor circuits and the pathogenesis of spinal muscular atrophy. However, the early embryonic lethality of constitutive knockout in mice has hindered the analysis of spatial and temporal requirements of Stasimon/Tmem41b in vivo. To address this, we developed a novel mouse line harboring a conditional knockout allele of the Stasimon/Tmem41b gene in which exon 4 has been flanked by loxP sites (Stas/Tmem41b<sup>CKO</sup>). Cre-mediated recombination of Stas/Tmem41b<sup>CKO</sup> generates a functionally null allele (Stas/Tmem41b<sup>Δ4</sup>) resulting in loss of protein expression and embryonic lethality in the homozygous mouse mutant. Here, using a ubiquitously expressed, tamoxifen inducible Cre recombinase in the homozygous Stas/Tmem41b<sup>CKO</sup> mice, we demonstrate that postnatal depletion of Stasimon/Tmem41b rapidly arrests weight gain in adult mice and causes motor dysfunction and death approximately three weeks after tamoxifen treatment. Moreover, we show that depletion of Stasimon/Tmem41b severely affects cell proliferation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. This study provides new insights into the essential requirement of Stasimon/Tmem41b for cellular and organismal fitness and expands the experimental toolkit to investigate its functions in the mammalian system."

    "abstract": "Anesthesia for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients undergoing spinal deformity surgery is challenging. We report an unusual case of an SMA girl who developed severe intraoperative hypoxemia and hypotension during posterior spinal fusion related with surgical positioning. A 13-yr-old girl diagnosed with SMA type 2, severe kyphoscoliosis and thoracic deformity was scheduled for elective posterior spinal fusion. She developed severe hypoxemia and profound hypotension intraoperatively in the prone position with surgical table tilted 45° to the right. Though transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) could not be performed due to limited mouth opening, her preoperative computed tomography revealed a severely distorted thoracic cavity with much reduced volume of the right side. A reasonable explanation was when the surgeons performed surgical procedure with the tilted surgical table, the pressure was directly put on the shortest diameter of the significantly deformed thoracic cavity, causing severe compression of the pulmonary artery, resulting in both hypoxemia and hypotension. The patient stabilized when the surgical table was tilted back and successfully went through the surgery in the leveled prone position. Spinal fusion surgery is beneficial for SMA patients in preventing scoliosis progression and improving ventilation. However, severe scoliosis and thoracic deformities put them at risk of both hemodynamic and respiratory instability during surgical positioning. When advanced monitoring like TEE is not practical intraoperatively, preoperative imaging may help with differential diagnosis, and guide the surgical positioning to minimize mechanical compression of the thoracic cavity, thereby helping the patient complete the surgery safely."

Thus, improvement or stabilization of respiratory function by disease-modifying therapies (DMT) is a very important issue. We examined respiratory function using forced vital capacity (FVC) in 42 adult SMA patients (2 SMA type 1, 15 SMA type 2, 24 SMA type 3, 1 SMA type 4, median age 37 years, range 17-61 years) treated with nusinersen for a median of 22.1 months (range 2.1 to 46.7 months). Change in FVC was assessed using mixed effects linear regression models. Baseline FVC differed significantly between SMA type 1 (4.0, 8.0%), 2 (median 22.0%, IQR 18.0-44.0), 3 (median 81.0%, IQR 67.0-90.8) and, respectively, type 4 (84.0%) patients reflecting the heterogeneity of respiratory impairment based on the SMA type in adulthood (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). FVC remained stable during follow-up (mean -0.047, 95% CI -0.115 to 0.020, <i>p</i> = 0.17); however, subgroup analysis showed an increase in FVC of type 2 patients (mean 0.144, 95% CI 0.086 to 0.202, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and a decrease in FVC of type 3/4 patients (-0.142, 95% CI -0.239 to -0.044, <i>p</i> = 0.005). The observed improvement in FVC in patients with SMA type 2 can be seen as a therapeutic response differing from the progressive decline typically seen in the spontaneous course.

    "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) subsequent to differential expression analysis is a standard step in transcriptomics and proteomics data analysis. Although many tools for this step are available, the results are often difficult to reproduce because set annotations can change in the databases, that is, new features can be added or existing features can be removed. Finally, such changes in set compositions can have an impact on biological interpretation. <b>Methods:</b> We present bootGSEA, a novel computational pipeline, to study the robustness of GSEA. By repeating GSEA based on bootstrap samples, the variability and robustness of results can be studied. In our pipeline, not all genes or proteins are involved in the different bootstrap replicates of the analyses. Finally, we aggregate the ranks from the bootstrap replicates to obtain a score per gene set that shows whether it gains or loses evidence compared to the ranking of the standard GSEA. Rank aggregation is also used to combine GSEA results from different omics levels or from multiple independent studies at the same omics level. <b>Results:</b> By applying our approach to six independent cancer transcriptomics datasets, we showed that bootstrap GSEA can aid in the selection of more robust enriched gene sets. Additionally, we applied our approach to paired transcriptomics and proteomics data obtained from a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disease associated with multi-system involvement. After obtaining a robust ranking at both omics levels, both ranking lists were combined to aggregate the findings from the transcriptomics and proteomics results. Furthermore, we constructed the new R-package \"bootGSEA,\" which implements the proposed methods and provides graphical views of the findings. Bootstrap-based GSEA was able in the example datasets to identify gene or protein sets that were less robust when the set composition changed during bootstrap analysis. <b>Discussion:</b> The rank aggregation step was useful for combining bootstrap results and making them comparable to the original findings on the single-omics level or for combining findings from multiple different omics levels."

This study aimed to identify metabolic markers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children with SMA types II and III. CSF samples were collected from 40 patients with SMA (27 with type II and 13 with type III) and analyzed for metabolites. We identified 135 metabolites associated with SMA types II and III. These were associated with lysine degradation and arginine, proline, and tyrosine metabolism. We identified seven metabolites associated with the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale: 4-chlorophenylacetic acid, adb-chminaca,(+/-)-, dodecyl benzenesulfonic acid, norethindrone acetate, 4-(undecan-5-yl) benzene-1-sulfonic acid, dihydromaleimide beta-d-glucoside, and cinobufagin. Potential typing biomarkers, N-cyclohexylformamide, cinobufagin, cotinine glucuronide, N-myristoyl arginine, 4-chlorophenylacetic acid, geranic acid, 4-(undecan-5-yl) benzene, and 7,8-diamino pelargonate, showed good predictive performance. Among these, N-myristoyl arginine was unaffected by the gene phenotype. This study identified metabolic markers are promising candidate prognostic factors for SMA. We also identified the metabolic pathways associated with the severity of SMA. These assessments can help predict the outcomes of screening SMA classification biomarkers."

They include spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), and Huntington's disease (HD). At the root of these neurodegenerative diseases are trinucleotide repeat mutations in coding regions of different genes, which lead to the production of proteins with elongated polyQ tracts. While the causative proteins differ in structure and molecular mass, the expanded polyQ domains drive pathogenesis in all these diseases. PolyQ tracts mediate the association of proteins leading to the formation of protein complexes involved in gene expression regulation, RNA processing, membrane trafficking, and signal transduction. In this review, we discuss commonalities and differences among the nine polyQ proteins focusing on their structure and function as well as the pathological features of the respective diseases. We present insights from AlphaFold-predicted structural models and discuss the biological roles of polyQ-containing proteins. Lastly, we explore reported protein-protein interaction networks to highlight shared protein interactions and their potential relevance in disease development."

Biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders were assessed in plasma and CSF samples obtained from a total of 30 healthy older adult controls and 31 patients with adult SMA type 2 and 3. The samples were collected before and during nusinersen treatment at various time points, approximately at 2, 6, 10, and 22 months. Using ELISA technology, the levels of total tau, pNF-H, NF-L, sAPPβ, Aβ40, Aβ42, and YKL-40 were evaluated in CSF samples. Additionally, plasma samples were used to measure NF-L and total tau levels using SIMOA technology. SMA patients showed improvements in clinical outcomes after nusinersen treatment, which were statistically significant only in walkers, in RULM (<i>p</i> = 0.04) and HFMSE (<i>p</i> = 0.05) at 24 months. A reduction in sAPPβ levels was found after nusinersen treatment, but these levels did not correlate with clinical outcomes. Other neurodegeneration biomarkers (NF-L, pNF-H, total tau, YKL-40, Aβ40, and Aβ42) were not found consistently changed with nusinersen treatment. The slow progression rate and mild treatment response of adult SMA types 2 and 3 may not lead to detectable changes in common markers of axonal degradation, inflammation, or neurodegeneration, since it does not involve large pools of damaged neurons as observed in pediatric forms. However, changes in biomarkers associated with the APP processing pathway might be linked to treatment administration. Further studies are warranted to better understand these findings."

DNA samples extracted from dried blood spot (DBS) from newborns in Apulia region were analysed for SMA screening by using a real-time PCR-based assay. Infants harbouring homozygous deletion of SMN1 exon 7 confirmed by diagnostic molecular tests underwent clinical and neurophysiological assessment and received a timely treatment. Over the first 20 months since regional NBS introduction, four out of 42,492 (0.009%) screened children were found to carry a homozygous deletion in the exon 7 of SMN1 gene, with an annual incidence of 1:10,623. No false negatives were present. Median age at diagnosis was 7 days and median age at treatment was 20.5 days. Three of them had two copies of SMN2 and received gene therapy, while the one with three SMN2 copies was treated with nusinersen. All but one were asymptomatic at birth, showed no clinical signs of disease after a maximum follow-up of 16 months and reached motor milestones appropriate with their age. The minimum interval between diagnosis and the treatment initiation was 9 days. The timely administration of disease-modifying therapies prevented presymptomatic subjects to develop disease symptoms. Mandatory NBS for SMA should be implemented on a national scale."

Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a noninvasive diagnostic tool for muscle quality assessment, primarily utilized for patients with neuromuscular diseases. However, EIM's accuracy for paraspinal muscle assessment remains understudied. In this study, we investigated the correlation between EIM readings and MRI-derived muscle parameters, as well as the influence of dermal and subcutaneous parameters on these readings. We retrospectively analyzed patients with lumbar spinal degeneration who underwent paraspinal EIM assessment between May 2023 to July 2023. Paraspinal muscle fatty infiltration (FI) and functional cross-sectional area (fCSA), as well as the subcutaneous thickness were assessed on MRI scans. Skin ultrasound imaging was assessed for dermal thickness and the echogenicities of the dermal and subcutaneous layers. All measurements were performed on the bilaterally. The correlation between EIM readings were compared with ultrasound and MRI parameters using Spearman's correlation analyses. A total of 20 patients (65.0% female) with a median age of 69.5 years (IQR, 61.3-73.8) were analyzed. The fCSA and FI did not significantly correlate with the EIM readings, regardless of frequency. All EIM readings across frequencies correlated with subcutaneous thickness, echogenicity, or dermal thickness. With the current methodology, paraspinal EIM is not a valid alternative to MRI assessment of muscle quality, as it is strongly influenced by the dermal and subcutaneous layers. Further studies are required for refining the methodology and confirming our results."

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neuromuscular disease characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons that leads to muscle wasting and atrophy. Epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests a causal relationship between ALS and physical activity (PA). However, the impact of PA on motor neuron loss and sarcopenia is still debated, probably because of the heterogeneity and intensities of the proposed exercises. With this study, we aimed to clarify the effect of intense endurance exercise on the onset and progression of ALS in the SOD1-G93A mouse model. We randomly selected four groups of twelve 35-day-old female mice. SOD1-G93A and WT mice underwent intense endurance training on a motorized treadmill for 8 weeks, 5 days a week. During the training, we measured muscle strength, weight, and motor skills and compared them with the corresponding sedentary groups to define the disease onset. At the end of the eighth week, we analyzed the skeletal muscle-motor neuron axis by histological and molecular techniques. Intense endurance exercise anticipates the onset of the disease by 1 week (age of the onset: trained SOD1-G93A = 63.17 ± 2.25 days old; sedentary SOD1-G93A = 70.75 ± 2.45 days old). In SOD1-G93A mice, intense endurance exercise hastens the muscular switch to a more oxidative phenotype and worsens the denervation process by dismantling neuromuscular junctions in the tibialis anterior, enhancing the Wallerian degeneration in the sciatic nerve, and promoting motor neuron loss in the spinal cord. The training exacerbates neuroinflammation, causing immune cell infiltration in the sciatic nerve and a faster activation of astrocytes and microglia in the spinal cord. Intense endurance exercise, acting on skeletal muscles, worsens the pathological hallmarks of ALS, such as denervation and neuroinflammation, brings the onset forward, and accelerates the progression of the disease. Our findings show the potentiality of skeletal muscle as a target for both prognostic and therapeutic strategies; the preservation of skeletal muscle health by specific intervention could counteract the dying-back process and protect motor neurons from death. The physiological characteristics and accessibility of skeletal muscle further enhance its appeal as a therapeutic target."

However, data from controlled studies that reliably confirm the benefits of newborn screening are lacking. To compare data obtained on patients with SMA diagnosed through newborn screening and those diagnosed after clinical symptom onset. This nonrandomized controlled trial used data from the SMARTCARE registry to evaluate all children born between January 2018 and September 2021 with genetically confirmed SMA and up to 3 SMN2 copies. The registry includes data from 70 participating centers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Data analysis was performed in February 2023 so that all patients had a minimal follow-up of 18 months. Patients born in 2 federal states in Germany underwent screening in a newborn screening pilot project. All other patients were diagnosed after clinical symptom onset. All patients received standard care within the same health care system. The primary end point was the achievement of motor milestones. A total of 234 children (123 [52.6%] female) were identified who met inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis: 44 (18.8%) in the newborn screening cohort and 190 children (81.2%) in the clinical symptom onset cohort. The mean (SD) age at start of treatment with 1 of the approved disease-modifying drugs was 1.3 (2.2) months in the newborn screening cohort and 10.7 (9.1) months in the clinical symptom onset cohort. In the newborn screening cohort, 40 of 44 children (90.9%) gained the ability to sit independently vs 141 of 190 (74.2%) in the clinical symptom onset cohort. For independent ambulation, the ratio was 28 of 40 (63.6%) vs 28 of 190 (14.7%). This nonrandomized controlled trial demonstrated effectiveness of newborn screening for infants with SMA in the real-world setting.

    "abstract": "Hereditary proximal 5q Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a severe neuromuscular disorder with onset mainly in infancy or childhood. The underlying pathogenic mechanism is the loss of alpha motor neurons in the anterior horns of spine, due to deficiency of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein as a consequence of the deletion of the SMN1 gene. Clinically, SMA is characterized by progressive loss of muscle strength and motor function ranging from the extremely severe, the neonatal onset type 1, to the mild type 4 arising in the adult life. All the clinical variants share the same molecular defect, the difference being driven mainly by the copy number of SMN2 gene, a centromeric gene nearly identical to SMN1 with a unique C to T transition in Exon 7 that results in exclusion of Exon 7 during post-transcriptional processing. In all the types of SMA the clinical picture is characterized by hypotonia, weakness and areflexia. Clinical severity can vary a lot between the four main recognized types of SMA. As for the most of patients affected by different neuromuscular disorders, also in SMA fatigability is a major complaint as it is frequently reported in common daily activities and negatively impacts on the overall quality of life. The increasing awareness of fatigability as an important dimension of impairment in Neuromuscular Disorders and particularly in SMA, is making it both a relevant subject of study and identifies it as a fundamental therapeutic target. In this review, we aimed to overview the current literature articles concerning this problem, in order to highlight what is known and what deserves further research."

Patients with severe symptoms may suffer respiratory failure, leading to death. The homozygous deletion of exon 7 in the SMN1 gene accounts for nearly 95% of all cases. Population carrier screening for SMA and prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis for high-risk couples can assist in identifying the risk of fetal disease. We provided the SMA carrier screening process to 55,447 pregnant women in Yancheng from October 2020 to December 2022. Among them, 8185 participated in this process, with a participation rate of around 14.76% (95% CI 14.47-15.06%). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to detect deletions of SMN1 exons 7 and 8 (E7, E8) in screened pregnant women. 127 were identified as carriers (111 cases of E7 and E8 heterozygous deletions, 15 cases of E7 heterozygous deletions, and 1 case of E7 heterozygous deletions and E8 homozygous deletions), resulting in a carrying rate of around 1.55% (95% CI 1.30-1.84%). After genetic counseling, 114 spouses of pregnant women who tested positive underwent SMA carrier screening; three of them were screened as SMA carriers. Multiplexed ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was used for the prenatal diagnosis of the fetuses of high-risk couples. Two of them exhibited two copies of SMN1 exon 7 (normal), and the pregnancy was continued; one exhibited no copies of SMN1 exon 7 and exon 8 (SMA patient), and the pregnancy was terminated.

    "title": "Exploring variability in cognitive functioning in patients with spinal muscular atrophy: a scoping review.",
    "abstract": "The cognitive functioning of individuals with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is not well understood, prompting a call for more research to better grasp cognitive involvement in SMA. This study aims to explore recent findings regarding cognitive outcomes in SMA patients, including correlations between clinical features and cognitive abilities. The investigation seeks to identify commonly used measures for assessing cognitive function in this patient population. A scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology examined literature until December 2023. Two databases were searched along with relevant article references using specific terms such as \"spinal muscular atrophy,\" \"SMA,\" \"cognitive,\" \"abilities,\" \"functions,\" \"intellective,\" or \"intellectual.\" Screening focused on titles and abstracts from English language peer-reviewed journals. After the initial research, 1452 articles were identified. Subsequent screening and selection led to the inclusion of 13 articles in the review. Among these studies, four indicated a cognitive trend within the normal range for SMA patients. In four other studies, the majority of patients fell within the normal range. However, smaller proportions were observed to be either above or below the norm compared to the controls. Three studies reported noted cognitive performance below the average, while two showed above-average scores. The scoping review suggests that most SMA patients have cognitive abilities similar to the general population, with types II and III showing even lesser impact. However, certain cognitive domains may be affected in type I patients, highlighting the need for further research to fully understand cognitive involvement in SMA."

    "abstract": "Evaluation of spinal muscle morphology may be critical because of its impact on segmental stability and control of the lumbar spine in the subset of patients with clinical lumbar segmental instability (LSI). The purpose of this study was to compare lumbar muscle morphology in CNLBP patients with clinical LSI, CNLBP patients without clinical LSI. This case-control study included 30 patients with CNLBP (15 with clinical LSI and 15 without clinical LSI) and 15 subjects without LBP. Axial magnetic resonance images from the L2 to S1 lumbar levels were used to evaluate the morphology of the lumbar muscles. A significant increase in the muscle-to-fat infiltration index and a significant decrease in the relative muscle cross-sectional area (rmCSA) of the multifidus muscle at the L3-L4 to L5-S1 levels were observed in both CNLBP groups compared to the control group (p<0.05). The mean erector spinae mean rmCSA was significantly greater in the clinical LSI group compared to the control group (SMD = 0.853, 95% CI = 0.105 to -1.6, P = 0.044) and also compared to the CNLBP without clinical LSI (SMD = 0.894, 95% CI = -1.645 to -0.144, P = 0.030) at the L4-L5 level. The atrophic changes of the multifidus muscle, in CNLBP patients with or without clinical LSI was observed. However, hypertrophic changes of the erector spinae muscle at the L4-L5 lumbar level were observed only in the clinical LSI group. Psaos major did not show significant atrophic or hypertrophic changes."

    "abstract": "Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (DLS) is a prevalent spinal condition that can result in significant disability. DLS is thought to result from a combination of disc and facet joint degeneration, as well as various biological, biomechanical, and behavioral factors. One hypothesis is the progressive degeneration of segmental stabilizers, notably the paraspinal muscles, contributes to a vicious cycle of increasing slippage. To examine the correlation between paraspinal muscle status on MRI and severity of slippage in patients with symptomatic DLS. Retrospective cross-sectional study at an academic tertiary care center. Patients who underwent surgery for DLS at the L4/5 level between 2016-2018 were included. Those with multilevel DLS or insufficient imaging were excluded. The percentage of relative slippage (RS) at the L4/5 level evaluated on standing lateral radiographs. Muscle morphology measurements including functional cross-sectional area (fCSA), body height normalized functional cross-sectional area (HI) of Psoas, erector spinae (ES) and multifidus muscle (MF) and fatty infiltration (FI) of ES and MF were measured on axial MR. Disc degeneration and facet joint arthritis were classified according to Pfirrmann and Weishaupt, respectively. Descriptive and comparative statistics, univariable and multivariable linear regression models were utilized to examine the associations between RS and muscle parameters, adjusting for confounders sex, age, BMI, segmental degeneration, and back pain severity and symptom duration. The study analyzed 138 out of 183 patients screened for eligibility. The median age of all patients was 69.5 years (IQR 62 to 73), average BMI was 29.1 (SD±5.1) and average preoperative ODI was 46.4 (SD±16.3). Patients with Meyerding-Grade 2 (M2, N=25) exhibited higher Pfirrmann scores, lower MF<sub>fCSA</sub> and MF<sub>HI</sub>, and lower BMI, but significantly more fatty infiltration in the MF and ES muscles compared to those with Meyerding Grade 1 (M1). Univariable linear regression showed that each cm<sup>2</sup> decrease in MF<sub>fCSA</sub> was associated with a 0.9%-point increase in RS (95% CI -1.4 to - 0.4, p<.001), and each cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> decrease in MF<sub>HI</sub> was associated with an increase in slippage by 2.2%-points (95% CI -3.7 to -0.7, p=.004). Each 1%-point rise in ES<sub>FI</sub> and MF<sub>FI</sub> corresponded to 0.17%- (95% CI 0.05-0.3, p=.01) and 0.20%-point (95% CI 0.1-0.3 p<.001) increases in relative slippage, respectively. Notably, after adjusting for confounders, each cm<sup>2</sup> increase in Psoas<sub>fCSA</sub> and cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> in Psoas<sub>HI</sub> was associated with an increase in relative slippage by 0.3% (95% CI 0.1-0.6, p=.004) and 1.1%-points (95% CI 0.4-1.7, p=.001). While MF<sub>fCSA</sub> tended to be negatively associated with slippage, this did not reach statistical significance (p=.105). However, each 1%-point increase in MF<sub>FI</sub> and ES<sub>FI</sub> corresponded to increases of 0.15% points (95% CI 0.05-0.24, p=.002) and 0.14% points (95% CI 0.01-0.27, p=.03) in relative slippage, respectively. This study found a significant association between paraspinal muscle status and severity of slippage in DLS. Whereas higher degeneration of the ES and MF correlate with a higher degree of slippage, the opposite was found for the psoas. These findings suggest that progressive muscular imbalance between posterior and anterior paraspinal muscles could contribute to the progression of slippage in DLS."

This single-center retrospective case-control study collected clinical data and peripheral motor nerve CMAP parameters from 42 5qSMA patients and 42 healthy controls at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University (January 2021 to December 2022). It evaluated changes in motor function and CMAP amplitude before and after Nusinersen treatment. Our investigation encompassed all symptomatic and genetically confirmed SMA patients, consisting of 32 type II and 10 type III cases, with a median age of 57 months (29.5 to 96 months). Comparative analysis with healthy controls revealed substantial reductions in CMAP amplitudes across various nerves in both type II and type III patients. Despite the administration of Nusinersen treatment for 6 or 14 months to the entire cohort, discernible alterations in motor nerve amplitudes were not observed, except for a significant improvement in younger patients (≤36 months) at the 14-month mark. Further scrutiny within the type II subgroup unveiled that individuals with a disease duration ≤12 months experienced a noteworthy upswing in femoral nerve amplitude, a statistically significant difference when compared to those with >12 months of disease duration. Motor nerve amplitudes were significantly decreased in type II and type III 5q SMA patients compared to healthy controls. Nusinersen treatment showed better improvement in motor nerve amplitudes in younger age groups and those with shorter disease duration, indicating a treatment-time dependence."

It is characterized by progressive weakness in distal motor function and atrophy of muscles, without accompanying sensory impairment. Presently, there is limited literature on this condition, and accurate epidemiological data regarding its incidence remains unavailable. We report a paediatric case of distal hereditary motor, type VIII that is caused by a heterozygous missense mutation in the <i>TRPV4</i> gene (NM_021625): c.805C>T. The proband is a 7-year-old male child. During pregnancy, his mother had prenatal ultrasound revealing \"inward turning of the feet\", a condition persisting after birth. The proband is currently unable to stand independently, exhibiting bilateral clubfoot deformity. Although possessing normal cognitive function, he cannot walk unaided. Computed radiography findings reveal pelvic tilt, bilateral knee joint valgus, and bilateral clubfoot. The patient underwent familial exome sequencing, revealing a mutation in the <i>TRPV4</i> gene (NM_021625): c.805C>T (p.Arg269Cys). Considering the patient's medical history, clinical manifestations, imaging studies, and genetic test results, the diagnosis for this individual is Neuronopathy, distal hereditary motor, type VIII.

The carrier rate of single gene disease, the detection rate of high-risk parents, and the clinical outcome of high-risk parents were statistically analyzed. A total of 1372 Chinese Han ethnicity patients underwent PECS, among which 458 patients underwent the extended 108-gene test, their overall carrier rate was 31.7%, and the detection rate of high-risk parents was 0.3%. The highest carrier rates were SLC22A (2.4%), ATP7B (2.4%), MMACHC (2.2%), PAH (1.8%), GALC (1.8%), MLC1 (1.3%), UNC13D (1.1%), CAPN3 (1.1%), and PKHD1 (1.1%). There were 488 women with fragile X syndrome-FMR1 gene detection, and 6 patients (1.2%) had FMR1 gene mutation. A total of 426 patients were screened for spinal muscular atrophy-SMN1, and the carrier rate was 3.5%, and the detection rate of parents' co-carrier was 0.5%. Monogenic recessive hereditary diseases had a high carrier rate in the population. Pre-pregnancy screening could provide good prenatal and postnatal care guidance for patients and preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic/single gene disorders (PGT-M) and prenatal diagnosis could provide more precise reproductive choices for high-risk parents."

    "title": "Administration of adipose-derived stem cells extracellular vesicles in a murine model of spinal muscular atrophy: effects of a new potential therapeutic strategy.",
    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal-recessive neuromuscular disease affecting children. It is caused by the mutation or deletion of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene resulting in lower motor neuron (MN) degeneration followed by motor impairment, progressive skeletal muscle paralysis and respiratory failure. In addition to the already existing therapies, a possible combinatorial strategy could be represented by the use of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) that can be obtained easily and in large amounts from adipose tissue. Their efficacy seems to be correlated to their paracrine activity and the production of soluble factors released through extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are important mediators of intercellular communication with a diameter between 30 and 100 nm. Their use in other neurodegenerative disorders showed a neuroprotective effect thanks to the release of their content, especially proteins, miRNAs and mRNAs. In this study, we evaluated the effect of EVs isolated from ASCs (ASC-EVs) in the SMNΔ7 mice, a severe SMA model. With this purpose, we performed two administrations of ASC-EVs (0.5 µg) in SMA pups via intracerebroventricular injections at post-natal day 3 (P3) and P6. We then assessed the treatment efficacy by behavioural test from P2 to P10 and histological analyses at P10. The results showed positive effects of ASC-EVs on the disease progression, with improved motor performance and a significant delay in spinal MN degeneration of treated animals. ASC-EVs could also reduce the apoptotic activation (cleaved Caspase-3) and modulate the neuroinflammation with an observed decreased glial activation in lumbar spinal cord, while at peripheral level ASC-EVs could only partially limit the muscular atrophy and fiber denervation. Our results could encourage the use of ASC-EVs as a therapeutic combinatorial treatment for SMA, bypassing the controversial use of stem cells."

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a severe motor neuronal disorder with high morbidity and mortality. Securinine has shown the potential to treat SMA; however, its anti-SMA role remains unclear. This study aims to reveal the anti-SMA mechanisms of securinine. Securinine-associated targets were acquired from Herbal Ingredients' Targets (HIT), Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA), and SuperPred. SMA-associated targets were obtained from GeneCards and Dis- GeNET. Protein-protein Interaction (PPI) network was constructed using GeneMANIA, and hug targets were screened using cytoHubba. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed using ClusterProfifiler. Molecular docking was conducted using Pymol and Auto- Dock. In vitro assays were used to verify the anti-SMA effects of securinine. Twenty-six intersection targets of securinine and SMA were obtained. HDAC1, HDAC2, TOP2A, PIK3R1, PRMT5, JAK2, HSP90AB1, TERT, PTGS2, and PAX8 were the core targets in PPI network. GO analysis demonstrated that the intersecting targets were implicated in the regulation of proteins, steroid hormones, histone deacetylases, and DNA transcription. KEGG analysis, pathway-pathway, and hub target-pathway networks revealed that securinine might treat SMA through TNF, JAK-STAT, Ras, and PI3K-Akt pathways. Securinine had a favorable binding affinity with HDAC1, HSP90AB, JAK2, PRMT5, PTGS2, and TERT. Securinine rescued viability suppression, mitochondria damage, and SMN loss in the SMA cell model. Furthermore, securinine increased HDAC1 and PRMT5 expression, decreased PTGS2 expression, suppressed the JAK2-STAT3 pathway, and promoted the PI3K-Akt pathway. Securinine might alleviate SMA by elevating HDAC1 and PRMT5 expression and reducing PTGS2 via JAK2-STAT3 suppression and PI3K-Akt activation."

According to whether restoring the ideal Roussouly classification after surgery, the patients were divided into R group(recovery group) (<i>n</i>=51) and N group(non-recovery group) (<i>n</i>=21). According to whether mechanical complications occurred after operation within two years, the patients were divided into MC (mechanical complications)group (<i>n</i>=24) and NMC(non-mechanical complications) group (<i>n</i>=48). The RM group (<i>n</i>=14) experienced mechanical complications in the R group, while the RN group (<i>n</i>=37) did not. The NM group (<i>n</i>=10) experienced mechanical complications in the N group, while the NN group (<i>n</i>=11) did not.Radiographic assessment included Sagittal parameters of spine and pelvis, standardized cross-sectional area (SCSA) and fat infiltration rate (FI%) of paraspinal muscle at each lumbar disc level. <b>Results:</b> The age of DS patients in this study was (61.4±6.2) years.The incidence of MC was 33.33%(<i>n</i>=24)in all patients. The incidence of MC was 27.45%(<i>n</i>=14)in group R and 47.62%(<i>n</i>=10) in group N.

    "abstract": "Intracellular retrograde transport in eukaryotic cells relies exclusively on the molecular motor cytoplasmic dynein 1. Unlike its counterpart, kinesin, dynein has a single isoform, which raises questions about its cargo specificity and regulatory mechanisms. The precision of dynein-mediated cargo transport is governed by a multitude of factors, including temperature, phosphorylation, the microtubule track, and interactions with a family of activating adaptor proteins. Activating adaptors are of particular importance because they not only activate the unidirectional motility of the motor but also connect a diverse array of cargoes with the dynein motor. Therefore, it is unsurprising that dysregulation of the dynein-activating adaptor transport machinery can lead to diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity, and dominant. Here, we discuss dynein motor motility within cells and in in vitro, and we present several methodologies employed to track the motion of the motor. We highlight several newly identified activating adaptors and their roles in regulating dynein. Finally, we explore the potential therapeutic applications of manipulating dynein transport to address diseases linked to dynein malfunction."

    "abstract": "Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neuromuscular degenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the androgen receptor (AR). This mutation causes AR to misfold and aggregate, contributing to toxicity in and degeneration of motor neurons and skeletal muscle. There is currently no effective treatment or cure for this disease. The role of an interdomain interaction between the amino- and carboxyl-termini of AR, termed the N/C interaction, has been previously identified as a component of androgen receptor-induced toxicity in cell and mouse models of SBMA. However, the mechanism by which this interaction contributes to disease pathology is unclear. This work seeks to investigate this mechanism by interrogating the role of AR homodimerization- a unique form of the N/C-interaction- in SBMA. We show that, although the AR N/C-interaction is reduced by polyglutamine-expansion, homodimers of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-bound AR are increased. Additionally, blocking homodimerization results in decreased AR aggregation and toxicity in cell models. Blocking homodimerization results in the increased degradation of AR, which likely plays a role in the protective effects of this mutation. Overall, this work identifies a novel mechanism in SBMA pathology that may represent a novel target for the development of therapeutics for this disease."

    "abstract": "Rare recessive variants in the human VRK1 gene are associated with several motor neuron diseases (MND), such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, or distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMN). A case with dHMN carrying two novel VRK1 gene variants, expressing Leu200Pro (L200P) and Arg387His (R387H) variant proteins, identified that these protein variants are functionally different. The Leu200Pro variant shares with several variants in the catalytic domain the loss of the kinase activity on different substrates, such as histones, p53, or coilin. However, the distal Arg387His variant and the distal Trp375* (W375X) chinese variant, both located at the end of the low complexity C-terminal region and proximal to the termination codon, retain their catalytic activity on some substrates, and mechanistically their functional impairment is different. The L200P variant, as well as most VRK1 pathogenic variants, impairs the phosphorylation of BAF and histone H4K16 acetylation, which are required for DNA attachment to the nuclear envelope and chromatin accessibility to DNA repair mechanisms, respectively. The R387H variant impairs phosphorylation of H2AX, an early step in different types of DNA damage responses. The functional variability of VRK1 protein variants and their different combinations are a likely contributor to the clinical phenotypic heterogeneity of motor neuron and neurological diseases associated with rare VRK1 pathogenic variants. KEY MESSAGES: VRK1 variants implicated in motor neuron diseases are functionally different. The L200P variant is kinase inactive, and the R387H variant is partially active. VRK1 variants alter H4K16 acetylation and loss of coilin and BAF phosphorylation. VRK1 variants alter Cajal bodies and DNA damage responses. VRK1 variant combination determines the neurological phenotype heterogeneity."

We aimed to assess different distal muscles in pediatric and adult SMA5q patients, further evaluating clinical-electrophysiological correlations. We analyzed MScanFit parameters reflecting the extent of denervation (MUNE; N50) and parameters of collateral reinnervation in APB, abductor digiti minimi (ADM), and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. SMA patients were clinically evaluated using standardized motor function clinical scales, including the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale - Expanded and the Revised Upper Limb Module. A total of 23 SMA5q (9 SMA type 2 and 14 SMA type 3) and 12 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. SMA patients showed lower MUNE and N50 values and higher parameters of collateral sprouting in all muscles compared to HC (p < .001). SMA type 2 patients demonstrated lower MUNE and higher collateral reinnervation values in APB and TA compared to SMA type 3 (p < .05). Walker patients showed higher values of MUNE and N50, and lower parameters of reinnervation in all muscles compared to sitters (p < .05). MScanFit parameters showed strong correlations (Rho-values ranging from .72 to .83) with clinical measurements. MUNE values were abnormal in muscles that were not clinically affected.

    "title": "Disruption of Neuromuscular Junction Following Spinal Cord Injury and Motor Neuron Diseases.",
    "abstract": "The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a crucial structure that connects the cholinergic motor neurons to the muscle fibers and allows for muscle contraction and movement. Despite the interruption of the supraspinal pathways that occurs in spinal cord injury (SCI), the NMJ, innervated by motor neurons below the injury site, has been found to remain intact. This highlights the importance of studying the NMJ in rodent models of various nervous system disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). The NMJ is also involved in myasthenic disorders, such as myasthenia gravis (MG), and is vulnerable to neurotoxin damage. Thus, it is important to analyze the integrity of the NMJ in rodent models during the early stages of the disease, as this may allow for a better understanding of the condition and potential treatment options. The spinal cord also plays a crucial role in the functioning of the NMJ, as the junction relays information from the spinal cord to the muscle fibers, and the integrity of the NMJ could be disrupted by SCI. Therefore, it is vital to study SCI and muscle function when studying NMJ disorders. This review discusses the formation and function of the NMJ after SCI and potential interventions that may reverse or improve NMJ dysfunction, such as exercise, nutrition, and trophic factors."

    "title": "Switching from Nusinersen to Risdiplam: A Croatian Real-World Experience on Effectiveness and Safety.",
    "abstract": "(1) Background: Data on combination or sequential treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) are missing and the latter field is poorly understood. The currently available data of patients on risdiplam previously treated with nusinersen are coming from exploratory research mainly focused on safety. Our aim was to investigate the real-world effectiveness (hypothesising non-inferiority) and safety profile of risdiplam in a paediatric-and-adult nusinersen-risdiplam spinal muscular atrophy switch cohort. (2) Methods: A retrospective and anonymous collection of relevant demographic and clinical data for all Croatian SMA patients switched from nusinersen to risdiplam up to September 2023 (reimbursed by Croatian Health Insurance Fund-CHIF) was performed using the CHIF database and associated reimbursement documentation. Patients were included in effectiveness and safety analysis if they met the following inclusion criteria: (i) risdiplam was reimbursed by the CHIF; (ii) the patient received at least six doses of nusinersen before the switch to risdiplam; (iii) there was no relevant pause between the latter disease-modifying drugs; (iv) availability of all prespecified studied data and parameters. (3) Results: In total, 17 patients met the inclusion criteria (58.9% female; median age 12.75 (3.0-44.5) years). In our 'switch' cohort, we demonstrated a non-inferiority of risdiplam to nusinersen in the SMA 1 (+1.0 in CHOP INTEND; <i>p</i> = 0.067), SMA 3p (+0.7 in HFMSE; <i>p</i> = 0.897), and SMA 3a (+0.8 in RHS; <i>p</i> = 0.463) subpopulations, during a one-year follow-up period. There were no reports on respiratory function worsening, feeding worsening, and no lethal events. No new safety concerns were identified, except for the weight gain that arose as a new potential adverse drug reaction 'signal' in two patients. (4) Conclusions: We have reported pivotal real-world findings on switching SMA patients from nusinersen to risdiplam and demonstrated its effectiveness (non-inferiority), safety, and tolerability in a heterogenous paediatric-and-adult 'switch' cohort; this will further increase the quality and standards of care as well as safety of a notable portion of SMA patients, especially for those who demand the switch from nusinersen to other DMDs for clinical or personal reasons."

    "abstract": "In newborn screening (NBS), it is important to consider the availability of multiplex assays or other tests that can be integrated into existing systems when attempting to implement NBS for new target diseases. Recent developments in innovative testing technology have made it possible to simultaneously screen for severe primary immunodeficiency (PID) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. We describe our experience of optional NBS for severe PID and SMA in Osaka, Japan. A multiplex TaqMan qPCR assay was used for the optional NBS program. The assay was able to quantify the levels of T-cell receptor excision circles and kappa-deleting recombination excision circles, which is useful for severe combined immunodeficiency and B-cell deficiency screening, and can simultaneously detect the homozygous deletion of SMN1 exon 7, which is useful for NBS for SMA. In total, 105,419 newborns were eligible for the optional NBS program between 1 August 2020 and 31 August 2023. A case each of X-linked agammaglobulinemia and SMA were diagnosed through the optional NBS and treated at early stages (before symptoms appeared). Our results show how multiplex PCR-based NBS can benefit large-scale NBS implementation projects for new target diseases."

    "abstract": "<b><i>Background:</i></b> Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular life-threatening disorder. Owing to high carrier frequency, population-wide SMA screening to quantify the copy number of <i>SMN</i> gene is recommended by American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. An accurate, reliable, short runaround time and cost-effective method may be helpful in mass population screening for SMA. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is a gold standard to estimate the copy number variation (CNV) for <i>SMN1</i> and <i>SMN2</i> genes. In this study, we validated droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) for the determination of CNV for both <i>SMN1</i> and <i>SMN2</i> exon 7 for a diagnostic purpose. In total, 66 clinical samples were tested using ddPCR, and results were compared with the MLPA as a reference test. <b><i>Results:</i></b> For all samples, CNV for <i>SMN1</i> and <i>SMN2</i> exon 7 was consentaneous between ddPCR and MLPA test results (κ = 1.000, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). In addition, ddPCR also showed a significant acceptable degree of test repeatability, coefficient of variation < 4%. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> ddPCR is expected to be utilitarian for CNV detection for carrier screening and diagnosis of SMA. ddPCR test results for CNV detection for <i>SMN1</i>/<i>SMN2</i> exon 7 are concordant with the gold standard. ddPCR is a more cost-effective and time-saving diagnostic test for SMA than MLPA. Furthermore, it can be used for population-wide carrier screening for SMA."

    "title": "Characterization of sensory and motor dysfunction and morphological alterations in late stages of type 2 diabetic mice.",
    "abstract": "Diabetic neuropathy is the most common complication of diabetes and lacks effective treatments. Although sensory dysfunction during the early stages of diabetes has been extensively studied in various animal models, the functional and morphological alterations in sensory and motor systems during late stages of diabetes remain largely unexplored. In the current work, we examined the influence of diabetes on sensory and motor function as well as morphological changes in late stages of diabetes. The obese diabetic Lepr<sup>db/db</sup> mice (db/db) were used for behavioral assessments and subsequent morphological examinations. The db/db mice exhibited severe sensory and motor behavioral defects at the age of 32 weeks, including significantly higher mechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal latency of hindpaws compared with age-matched nondiabetic control animals. The impaired response to noxious stimuli was mainly associated with the remarkable loss of epidermal sensory fibers, particularly CGRP-positive nociceptive fibers. Unexpectedly, the area of CGRP-positive terminals in the spinal dorsal horn was dramatically increased in diabetic mice, which was presumably associated with microglial activation. In addition, the db/db mice showed significantly more foot slips and took longer time during the beam-walking examination compared with controls. Meanwhile, the running duration in the rotarod test was markedly reduced in db/db mice. The observed sensorimotor deficits and motor dysfunction were largely attributed to abnormal sensory feedback and muscle atrophy as well as attenuated neuromuscular transmission in aged diabetic mice. Morphological analysis of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) demonstrated partial denervation of NMJs and obvious fragmentation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Intrafusal muscle atrophy and abnormal muscle spindle innervation were also detected in db/db mice. Additionally, the number of VGLUT1-positive excitatory boutons on motor neurons was profoundly increased in aged diabetic mice as compared to controls. Nevertheless, inhibitory synaptic inputs onto motor neurons were similar between the two groups. This excitation-inhibition imbalance in synaptic transmission might be implicated in the disturbed locomotion. Collectively, these results suggest that severe sensory and motor deficits are present in late stages of diabetes. This study contributes to our understanding of mechanisms underlying neurological dysfunction during diabetes progression and helps to identify novel therapeutic interventions for patients with diabetic neuropathy."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a progressive genetic disorder characterized by muscle weakness ultimately leading to pulmonary impairments that can be fatal. The recent approval of nusinersen, a disease-modifying therapy, substantially changed the prognosis for patients, particularly in children. However, real-world evidence about its long-term effectiveness in adults remains limited. This study aimed to document longitudinal data on motor function, pulmonary function and patient-reported outcome measures of Canadian adults with SMA type 2 and 3 treated with nusinersen. Outcomes from 17 patients were collected at the Institut de réadaptation en déficience physique de Québec during routine clinical visits over 36 months post nusinersen treatment, using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded for SMA (HFMSE), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Adult Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-ATEND), SMA functional rating scale (SMAFRS), pulmonary function testing and subjective changes reported by patients. After 36 months, 9 patients showed motor function improvement. Changes beyond the minimal clinically important difference were seen for four patients on the HFMSE, four patients on the RULM and five patients on the 6MWT. Pulmonary function remained stable for most subjects. Subjective positive changes were reported in 88% of patients and five patients showed improvement in the SMAFRS. This real-world study demonstrates the positive effects of nusinersen in adults with SMA types 2 and 3. Although stabilizing the patient's condition is considered therapeutic success, this study shows an improvement in motor function and subjective gains in several patients."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy is a progressive neuromuscular disorder and among the most frequent genetic causes of infant mortality. While recent advancements in gene therapy provide the potential to ameliorate the disease severity, there is currently no modality in clinical use to visualize dynamic pathophysiological changes in disease progression and regression after therapy. In this prospective diagnostic clinical study, ten pediatric patients with spinal muscular atrophy and ten age- and sex-matched controls have been examined with three-dimensional optoacoustic imaging and clinical standard examinations to compare the spectral profile of muscle tissue and correlate it with motor function (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04115475). We observed a reduced optoacoustic signal in muscle tissue of pediatric patients with spinal muscular atrophy. The reduction in signal intensity correlated with disease severity as assessed by grayscale ultrasound and standard motor function tests. In a cohort of patients who received disease-modifying therapy prior to the study, the optoacoustic signal intensity was similar to healthy controls. This translational study provides early evidence that three-dimensional optoacoustic imaging could have clinical implications in monitoring disease activity in spinal muscular atrophy. By visualizing and quantifying molecular changes in muscle tissue, disease progression and effects of gene therapy can be assessed in real time. The project was funded by ELAN Fonds (P055) at the University Hospital of the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität (FAU) Erlangen-Nurnberg to A.P.R."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which results from the deletion or/and mutation in the SMN1 gene, is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder that leads to weakness and muscle atrophy. SMN2 is a paralogous gene of SMN1. SMN2 copy number affects the severity of SMA, but its role in patients treated with disease modifying therapies is unclear. The most appropriate individualized treatment for SMA has not yet been determined. Here, we reported a case of SMA type I with normal breathing and swallowing function. We genetically confirmed that this patient had a compound heterozygous variant: one deleted SMN1 allele and a novel splice mutation c.628-3T>G in the retained allele, with one SMN2 copy. Patient-derived sequencing of 4 SMN1 cDNA clones showed that this intronic single transversion mutation results in an alternative exon (e)5 3' splice site, which leads to an additional 2 nucleotides (AG) at the 5' end of e5, thereby explaining why the patient with only one copy of SMN2 had a mild clinical phenotype. Additionally, a minigene assay of wild type and mutant SMN1 in HEK293T cells also demonstrated that this transversion mutation induced e5 skipping. Considering treatment cost and goals of avoiding pain caused by injections and starting treatment as early as possible, risdiplam was prescribed for this patient. However, the patient showed remarkable clinical improvements after treatment with risdiplam for 7 months despite carrying only one copy of SMN2. This study is the first report on the treatment of risdiplam in a patient with one SMN2 copy in a real-world setting. These findings expand the mutation spectrum of SMA and provide accurate genetic counseling information, as well as clarify the molecular mechanism of careful genotype-phenotype correlation of the patient."

Bulbar dysfunction, including limited mouth opening, is present in the majority of patients with SMA but it is unknown if and how these problems change during disease course. In this prospective, observational, longitudinal natural history study we aimed to study bulbar dysfunction in patients with SMA types 2 and 3. We included 44 patients with SMA types 2 and 3 (mean age was 33.6 (95% CI 28.4;38.9) and re-examined them after on average 4 years. None were treated with SMN-modulating treatments before or during the course of this study. Longitudinal assessments included a questionnaire on mandibular and bulbar function, the Mandibular Function Impairment Questionnaire (MFIQ), and a clinical examination of masticatory performance, maximum voluntary bite force, and mandibular movements including the active maximal mouth opening. We found significant higher MFIQ scores and a significant decrease of all mandibular movements in patients with SMA type 2 (p < 0.001), but not in SMA type 3. Masticatory performance and maximum voluntary bite force did not change significantly. Mean reduction of active maximal mouth opening at follow-up was 3.5 mm in SMA type 2 (95% CI: 2.3; 4.7, p < 0.001). SMA type 2 was an independent predictor for a more severe reduction of the mouth opening (β= -2.0 mm (95% CI: -3.8; -0.1, p = 0.043)). Bulbar functions such as mandibular mobility and active maximum mouth opening decrease significantly over the course of four years in patients with SMA type 2."

An updated consensus for the diagnosis and management of SMA was published in 2018. However, clinicians should remain alert to some pitfalls of genetic testing that can occur when following a routine diagnosis. In this study, we report the diagnosis of three unrelated individuals who were initially misdiagnosed as carrying a homozygous deletion of <i>SMN1</i> exon 7. MLPA (P060 and P021) and qPCR were used to detect the copy number of <i>SMN</i>. <i>SMN1</i> variants were identified by <i>SMN1</i> clone and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Transcription of <i>SMN1</i> variants was detected using qRT-PCR and ex vivo splicing analysis. Among the three individuals, one was identified as a patient with SMA carrying a heterozygous deletion and a pathogenic variant (c.835-17_835-14delCTTT) of <i>SMN1</i>, one was a healthy carrier only carrying a heterozygous deletion of <i>SMN1</i> exon 7, and the third was a patient with nemaline myopathy 2 carrying a heterozygous deletion of <i>SMN1</i> exon 7. The misdiagnosis of these individuals was attributed to the presence of the c.835-17_835-14delCTTT or c.835-17C > G variants in <i>SMN1</i> intron 6, which affect the amplification of <i>SMN1</i> exon 7 during MLPA-P060 and qPCR testing. However, MLPA-P021 and NGS analyses were unaffected by these variants. These results support that additional detection methods should be employed in cases where the <i>SMN1</i> copy number is ambiguous to minimize the misdiagnosis of SMA."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most common childhood muscular dystrophy, is caused by dystrophin deficiency. Preclinical and phase 2 study data have suggested that givinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, might help to counteract the effects of this deficiency. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of givinostat in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 41 tertiary care sites in 11 countries. Eligible participants were ambulant, male, and aged at least 6 years, had a genetically confirmed diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, completed two four-stair climb assessments with a mean of 8 s or less (≤1 s variance), had a time-to-rise of at least 3 s but less than 10 s, and had received systemic corticosteroids for at least 6 months. Participating boys were randomly assigned (2:1, allocated according to a list generated by the interactive response technology provider) to receive either oral givinostat or matching placebo twice a day for 72 weeks, stratified by concomitant steroid use. Boys, investigators, and site and sponsor staff were masked to treatment assignment. The dose was flexible, based on weight, and was reduced if not tolerated. Boys were divided into two groups on the basis of their baseline vastus lateralis fat fraction (VLFF; measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy): group A comprised boys with a VLFF of more than 5% but no more than 30%, whereas group B comprised boys with a VLFF of 5% or less, or more than 30%. The primary endpoint compared the effects of givinostat and placebo on the change in results of the four-stair climb assessment between baseline and 72 weeks, in the intention-to-treat, group A population. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned boys who received at least one dose of study drug. When the first 50 boys in group A completed 12 months of treatment, an interim futility assessment was conducted, after which the sample size was adapted using masked data from the four-stair climb assessments. Furthermore, the starting dose of givinostat was reduced following a protocol amendment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02851797, and is complete. Between June 6, 2017, and Feb 22, 2022, 359 boys were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 179 were enrolled into the study (median age 9·8 years [IQR 8·1-11·0]), all of whom were randomly assigned (118 to receive givinostat and 61 to receive placebo); 170 (95%) boys completed the study. Of the 179 boys enrolled, 120 (67%) were in group A (81 givinostat and 39 placebo); of these, 114 (95%) completed the study. For participants in group A, comparing the results of the four-stair climb assessment at 72 weeks and baseline, the geometric least squares mean ratio was 1·27 (95% CI 1·17-1·37) for boys receiving givinostat and 1·48 (1·32-1·66) for those receiving placebo (ratio 0·86, 95% CI 0·745-0·989; p=0·035). The most common adverse events in the givinostat group were diarrhoea (43 [36%] of 118 boys vs 11 [18%] of 61 receiving placebo) and vomiting (34 [29%] vs 8 [13%]); no treatment-related deaths occurred. Among ambulant boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, results of the four-stair climb assessment worsened in both groups over the study period; however, the decline was significantly smaller with givinostat than with placebo. The dose of givinostat was reduced after an interim safety analysis, but no new safety signals were reported. An ongoing extension study is evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of givinostat in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Italfarmaco."

ALD affects patients through a variety of physical, emotional, social, and other disease-specific factors that collectively contribute to disease burden. To facilitate clinical care and research, it is important to identify which symptoms are most common and relevant to individuals with any subtype of ALD. We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews and an international cross-sectional study to determine the most prevalent and important symptoms of ALD. Our study included adult participants with a diagnosis of ALD who were recruited from national and international patient registries. Responses were categorized by age, sex, disease phenotype, functional status, and other demographic and clinical features. Seventeen individuals with ALD participated in qualitative interviews, providing 1709 direct quotes regarding their symptomatic burden. One hundred and nine individuals participated in the cross-sectional survey study, which inquired about 182 unique symptoms representing 24 distinct symptomatic themes. The symptomatic themes with the highest prevalence in the overall ALD sample cohort were problems with balance (90.9%), limitations with mobility or walking (87.3%), fatigue (86.4%), and leg weakness (86.4%). The symptomatic themes with the highest impact scores (on a 0-4 scale with 4 being the most severe) were trouble getting around (2.35), leg weakness (2.25), and problems with balance (2.21). A higher prevalence of symptomatic themes was associated with functional disability, employment disruption, and speech impairment. There are many patient-relevant symptoms and themes that contribute to disease burden in individuals with ALD. These symptoms, identified by those having ALD, present key targets for further research and therapeutic development."

However, elevated concentrations have been demonstrated in numerous neuromuscular disorders, pointing to the skeletal muscle as a possible extracardiac origin. The aim of this study was to determine disease-related changes of TNT in 5q-associated spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and to screen for its biomarker potential in SMA. We therefore included 48 pediatric and 45 adult SMA patients in this retrospective cross-sequential observational study. Fluid muscle integrity and cardiac markers were analyzed in the serum of treatment-naïve patients and subsequently under disease-modifying therapies. We found a TNT elevation in 61% of SMA patients but no elevation of the cardiospecific isoform Troponin I (TNI). TNT elevation was more pronounced in children and particularly infants with aggressive phenotypes. In adults, TNT correlated to muscle destruction and decreased under therapy only in the subgroup with elevated TNT at baseline. In conclusion, TNT was elevated in a relevant proportion of patients with SMA with emphasis in infants and more aggressive phenotypes. Normal TNI levels support a likely extracardiac origin. Although its stand-alone biomarker potential seems to be limited, exploring TNT in SMA underlines the investigation of skeletal muscle integrity markers."

In recent years, reports of sex differences in SMA patients have become noticeable. The SMNΔ7 mouse model is commonly used to investigate pathologies and treatments in SMA. However, studies on sex as a contributing biological variable are few and dated. Here, we rigorously investigated the effect of sex on a series of characteristics in SMA mice of the SMNΔ7 model. Incidence and lifespan of 23 mouse litters were tracked and phenotypic assessments were performed at 2-day intervals starting at postnatal day 6 for every pup until the death of the SMA pup(s) in each litter. Brain weights were also collected post-mortem. We found that male and female SMA incidence does not differ significantly, survival periods are the same across sexes, and there was no phenotypic difference between male and female SMA pups, other than for females exhibiting lesser body weights at early ages. Overall, this study ensures that sex is not a biological variable that contributes to the incidence ratio or disease severity in the SMNΔ7 mouse model."

This study assesses the diagnostic potential of long-read sequencing (LRS) in three patients with SMA. For Patient 1, who has a heterozygous SMN1 deletion, LRS unveiled a missense mutation in SMN1 exon 5. In Patient 2, an Alu/Alu-mediated rearrangement covering the SMN1 promoter and exon 1 was identified through a blend of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, LRS, and PCR across the breakpoint. The third patient, born to a consanguineous family, bore four copies of hybrid SMN genes. LRS determined the genomic structures, indicating two distinct hybrids of SMN2 exon 7 and SMN1 exon 8. However, a discrepancy was found between the SMN1/SMN2 ratio interpretations by LRS (0:2) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (0:4), which suggested a limitation of LRS in SMA diagnosis. In conclusion, this newly adapted long PCR-based third-generation sequencing introduces an additional avenue for SMA diagnosis."

The PedsQL™ 3.0 NM-TR total score shows excellent reliability. The Cronbach's α values for the PedsQL™ 3.0 NM ranged between 0.871 and 0.906, while those for the PedsQL™ 4.0 GCS ranged between 0.843 and 0.897. Test-retest ICC values for the PedsQL™ 3.0 NM-TR ranged between 0.812 and 0.917, and for the PedsQL™ 4.0 GCS ranged between 0.773 and 0.899. The relationship between the PedsQL™ 3.0 NM-TR and the subscores of the PedsQL™ 4.0 GCS demonstrated a range of correlations from excellent to fair, indicating the interplay between two scales. This study established the PedsQL™ 3.0 NM-TR as reliable, valid, and feasible for use in children aged 2 to 4 years with SMA."

    "title": "Serum myostatin as a candidate disease severity and progression biomarker of spinal muscular atrophy.",
    "abstract": "The identification of biomarkers for spinal muscular atrophy is crucial for predicting disease progression, severity, and response to new disease-modifying therapies. This study aimed to investigate the role of serum levels of myostatin and follistatin as biomarkers for spinal muscular atrophy, considering muscle atrophy secondary to denervation as the main clinical manifestation of the disease. The study evaluated the differential gene expression of myostatin and follistatin in a lesional model of <i>gastrocnemius</i> denervation in mice, as well as in a meta-analysis of three datasets in transgenic mice models of spinal muscular atrophy, and in two studies involving humans with spinal muscular atrophy. Subsequently, a case-control study involving 27 spinal muscular atrophy patients and 27 controls was conducted, followed by a 12-month cohort study with 25 spinal muscular atrophy cases. Serum levels of myostatin and follistatin were analysed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at a single centre in southern Brazil. Skeletal muscle gene expression of myostatin decreased and of follistatin increased following lesional muscle denervation in mice, consistent with findings in the spinal muscular atrophy transgenic mice meta-analysis and in the <i>iliopsoas</i> muscle of five patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 1. Median serum myostatin levels were significantly lower in spinal muscular atrophy patients (98 pg/mL; 5-157) compared to controls (412 pg/mL; 299-730) (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Lower myostatin levels were associated with greater disease severity based on clinician-rated outcomes (Rho = 0.493-0.812; <i>P</i> < 0.05). After 12 months, there was a further reduction in myostatin levels among spinal muscular atrophy cases (<i>P</i> = 0.021). Follistatin levels did not differ between cases and controls, and no significant changes were observed over time. The follistatin:myostatin ratio was significantly increased in spinal muscular atrophy subjects and inversely correlated with motor severity. Serum myostatin levels show promise as a novel biomarker for evaluating the severity and progression of spinal muscular atrophy. The decrease in myostatin levels and the subsequent favourable environment for muscle growth may be attributed to denervation caused by motor neuron dysfunction."

We conducted a literature search in October 2022 to identify English-language clinical research on SMA that included <i>SMN2</i> copy number according to PRISMA guidelines. Our search identified 44 studies examining the impact of three <i>SMN2</i> copies on clinical characteristics (21 on phenotype, 13 on natural history, and 15 on functional status and other signs/symptoms). In children with type I SMA or presymptomatic infants with an <i>SMN1</i> deletion, three <i>SMN2</i> copies was associated with later symptom onset, slower decline in motor function and longer survival compared with two <i>SMN2</i> copies. In patients with SMA type II or III, three <i>SMN2</i> copies is associated with earlier symptom onset, loss of ambulation, and ventilator dependence compared with four <i>SMN2</i> copies. Eleven studies examined treatment effects with nusinersen (nine studies), onasemnogene abeparvovec (one study), and a range of treatments (one study) in patients with three <i>SMN2</i> copies. In presymptomatic infants, early treatment delayed the onset of symptoms and maintained motor function in those with three <i>SMN2</i> copies. The impact of copy number on treatment response in symptomatic patients is still unclear. <i>SMN2</i> copy number is strongly correlated with SMA phenotype in patients with <i>SMN1</i> deletion, while no correlation was found in patients with an <i>SMN1</i> mutation. Patients with three <i>SMN2</i> copies show a highly variable clinical phenotype. Early initiation of treatment is highly effective in presymptomatic patients with three <i>SMN2</i> copies."

He had widespread fasciculation and was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, and treated with nocturnal hypoventilation. Based on this diagnosis, he made significant personal and financial decisions including retiring and selling his house. He subsequently developed a lump in his right breast and was found to have gynaecomastia. This triggered genetic testing for Kennedy's disease leading to the correct diagnosis. This case highlights an unusual presentation of a rare disease leading to misdiagnosis and major repercussions for the patient. Recent genetic analysis from the 100 000 genome project suggests Kennedy's disease may be four times more prevalent in the population than previously thought, highlighting the need to consider genetic testing, especially if there is a suggestion of multisystem disease."

The most common medium to deliver genetic material to cells is via viral vectors; and with respect to the central nervous system, adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are a popular choice. The most successful example of AAV-based gene therapy for neurodegenerative disorders is Zolgensma© which is a transformative intravenous therapy given to babies with spinal muscular atrophy. However, the field has stalled in achieving safe drug delivery to the central nervous system in adults for which treatments for disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are desperately needed. Surgical gene therapy delivery has been proposed as a potential solution to this problem. While the field of the so-called regenerative neurosurgery has yielded pre-clinical optimism, several challenges have emerged. This review seeks to explore the field of regenerative neurosurgery with respect to AAV-based gene therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, its progress so far and the challenges that need to be overcome."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by recessive pathogenic variants affecting the survival of motor neuron (SMN1) gene (localized on 5q). In consequence, cells lack expression of the corresponding protein. This pathophysiological condition is clinically associated with motor neuron (MN) degeneration leading to severe muscular atrophy. Additionally, vulnerability of other cellular populations and tissues including skeletal muscle has been demonstrated. Although the therapeutic options for SMA have considerably changed, treatment responses may differ thus underlining the persistent need for validated biomarkers. To address this need and to identify novel marker proteins for SMA, we performed unbiased proteomic profiling on cerebrospinal fluid derived (CSF) from genetically proven SMA type 1-3 cases and afterwards performed ELISA studies on CSF and serum samples to validate the potential of a novel biomarker candidates in both body fluids. To further decipher the pathophysiological impact of this biomarker, immunofluorescence studies were carried out on spinal cord and skeletal muscle derived from a 5q-SMA mouse model. Proteomics revealed increase of LARGE1 in CSF derived from adult patients showing a clinical response upon treatment with nusinersen. Moreover, LARGE1 levels were validated in CSF samples of further SMA patients (type 1-3) by ELISA. These studies also unveiled a distinguishment between groups in improvement of motor skills: adult patients do present with lowered level per se at baseline visit while no elevation upon treatment in the pediatric cohort can be observed. ELISA-based studies of serum samples showed no changes in the pediatric cohort but unraveled elevated level in adult patients responding to future intervention with nusinersen, while non-responders did not show a significant increase. Additional immunofluorescence studies of LARGE1 in MN and skeletal muscle of a SMA type 3 mouse model revealed an increase of LARGE1 during disease progression. Our combined data unraveled LARGE1 as a protein dysregulated in serum and CSF of SMA-patients (and in MN and skeletal muscle of SMA mice) holding the potential to serve as a disease marker for SMA and enabling to differentiate between patients responding and non-responding to therapy with nusinersen."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary neuromuscular disease caused by survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene deletion or mutation. Homozygous deletions of exon 7 in SMN1 result in 95% of SMA cases, while the remaining 5% are caused by other pathogenic variants of SMN1. We analyzed two SMA-suspected cases that were collected, with no SMN1 gene deletion and point mutation in whole-exome sequencing. Exon 1 deletion of the SMN gene was detected using Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) P021. We used long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to isolate the SMN1 template, optimized-MLPA P021 for copy number variation (CNV) analysis within SMN1 only, and validated the findings via third-generation sequencing. Two unrelated families shared a genotype with one copy of exon 7 and a novel variant, g.70919941_70927324del, in isolated exon 1 of the SMN1 gene. Case F1-II.1 demonstrated no exon 1 but retained other exons, whereas F2-II.1 had an exon 1 deletion in a single SMN1 gene. The read coverage in the third-generation sequencing results of both F1-II.1 and F2-II.1 revealed a deletion of approximately 7.3 kb in the 5' region of SMN1. The first nucleotide in the sequence data aligned to the 7385 bp of NG_008691.1. Remarkably, two proband families demonstrated identical SMN1 exon 1 breakpoint sites, hinting at a potential novel mutation hotspot in Chinese SMA, expanding the variation spectrum of the SMN1 gene and corroborating the specificity of isolated exon 1 deletion in SMA pathogenesis. The optimized-MLPA P021 determined a novel variant (g.70919941_70927324del) in isolated exon 1 of the SMN1 gene based on long-range PCR, enabling efficient and affordable detection of SMN gene variations in patients with SMA, providing new insight into SMA diagnosis to SMN1 deficiency and an optimized workflow for single exon CNV testing of the SMN gene."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating disease that is the leading genetic cause of death in infants and young children. It includes a broad spectrum of phenotypes that are classified into clinical groups based on the age of onset and maximum motor function achieved. The most common form of SMA is due to a defect in the survival motor neuron 1 gene (<i>SMN1</i>) localized to 5q11.2-q13.3. The development of clinical symptoms and disease progression is thought to be due to decreased levels of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMA type 1 results in almost inevitable mortality within the first 2 years of life. The first two drugs approved globally for the treatment of SMA were the antisense oligonucleotide nusinersen (Spinraza), and the gene therapy onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (Zolgensma). Both interventions have approval and restrictions on use in different countries around the world. Despite these approved therapies, the medical unmet need in SMA (the majority of patients with SMA are not on a disease-modifying therapy) remains high with therapies in the pipeline to address some of the remaining limitations. The third and more recently approved drug for SMA is risdiplam (Evrysdi), an orally administered, centrally and peripherally distributed small molecule that modulates SMN2 pre-mRNA splicing toward the production of full-length SMN2 mRNA to increase functional SMN protein levels. In Russia the drug risdiplam was approved for use on November 26, 2020 with indications for the treatment of SMA in patients aged 2 months and older, and in 2023 the indications were expanded - use is allowed starting from the birth. Risdiplam is widely distributed into the CNS and peripheral tissues including muscles. Following risdiplam administration, SMN protein levels compared with baseline levels increase between 2- and 6-fold depending on the SMA phenotype treated. The risdiplam clinical development program currently has four ongoing clinical trials assessing its safety and efficacy. Clinical trials included more than 450 patients receiving risdiplam to date, has been well tolerated and no treatment-related safety findings leading to study withdrawal have been observed. Data from real clinical practice - more than 11.000 patients worldwide receive therapy with risdiplam, also confirm the safety and good tolerability of the drug."

The incidence is exceptionally rare, commonly manifesting as slowly progressive muscular weakness and atrophy of lower limbs. As per our existing knowledge, this is the first case of SMA associated with hyperlordosis in a patient. Hyperlordosis is a deformity in spinal curvature characterized by an excessive forward spinal curve in the region of the lower back, forming the characteristic C-shape curvature in the lumbar region, just above the buttocks. Parents brought an 11-year-old male child with complaints of inability to get up from a sitting position along with difficulty in walking for the past six months. Upon physical examination, deep tendon reflexes were absent; there was severe hyperlordosis, proximal limb weakness, and notable hypotonia. In our study, we aim to understand the clinical presentation, impact, and association of hyperlordosis in a child diagnosed with SMA. This case report describes the complaints and successful diagnosis of a patient of survivor motor neuron (SMN) gene-related SMA along with severe hyperlordosis backed by evidences of electrophysiology and neuropathology. However, a complete cure and normal lifestyle are not possible due to the lack of affordable and easily accessible therapies."

Here we report the transcriptome- and proteome-wide effects of overexpression of C2A-2B-3-4 in inducible HEK293 cells. Our RNA-Seq analysis revealed altered expression of ~ 15% genes (4,172 genes) by C2A-2B-3-4. About half of the affected genes by C2A-2B-3-4 remained unaffected by L2A-2B-3-4, a linear transcript encompassing exons 2A, 2B, 3 and 4 of <i>SMN1/SMN2</i>. These fifindings underscore the unique role of the structural context of C2A-2B-3-4 in gene regulation. A surprisingly high number of upregulated genes by C2A-2B-3-4 were located on chromosomes 4 and 7, whereas many of the downregulated genes were located on chromosomes 10 and X. Supporting a cross-regulation of <i>SMN1/SMN2</i> transcripts, C2A-2B-3-4 and L2A-2B-3-4 upregulated and downregulated <i>SMN1/SMN2</i> mRNAs, respectively. Proteome analysis revealed 61 upregulated and 57 downregulated proteins by C2A-2B-3-4 with very limited overlap with those affected by L2A-2B-3-4. Independent validations confirmed the effect of C2A-2B-3-4 on expression of genes associated with chromatin remodeling, transcription, spliceosome function, ribosome biogenesis, lipid metabolism, cytoskeletal formation, cell proliferation and neuromuscular junction formation. Our findings reveal a broad role of C2A-2B-3-4, a universally expressed circRNA produced by <i>SMN1/SMN2</i>."

However, research and development efforts worldwide have led to the development of long-lasting, highly efficient, and safe gene therapy for a wide range of hereditary diseases. Improved viral vectors are now able to evade the preexisting immunity and more efficiently target and transduce therapeutically relevant cells, ensuring genome maintenance and expression of transgenes at the relevant levels. Hematological, ophthalmological, neurodegenerative, and metabolic therapeutic areas have witnessed successful treatment of hemophilia and muscular dystrophy, restoration of immune system in children with immunodeficiencies, and restoration of vision. This review focuses on three leading vector platforms of the past two decades: adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), adenoviruses (AdVs), and lentiviruses (LVs). Special attention is given to successful preclinical and clinical studies that have led to the approval of gene therapies: six AAV-based (Glybera® for lipoprotein lipase deficiency, Luxturna® for retinal dystrophy, Zolgensma® for spinal muscular atrophy, Upstaza® for AADC, Roctavian® for hemophilia A, and Hemgenix® for hemophilia B) and three LV-based (Libmeldy® for infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy, Zynteglo® for β-thalassemia, and Skysona® for ALD).

    "abstract": "The local disruptions caused by the genes of one disease can influence the pathways associated with the other diseases resulting in comorbidity. For gene therapies, it is necessary to prioritize the key genes that regulate common biological mechanisms to tackle the issues caused by overlapping diseases. This work proposes a clustering-based computational approach for prioritising the comorbid genes within the overlapping disease modules by analyzing Protein-Protein Interaction networks. For this, a sub-network with gene interactions of the disease pair was extracted from the interactome. The edge weights are assigned by combining the pairwise gene expression correlation and betweenness centrality scores. Further, a weighted graph clustering algorithm is applied and dominant nodes of high-density clusters are ranked based on clustering coefficients and neighborhood connectivity. Case studies based on neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis- Spinal Muscular Atrophy (ALS-SMA) pair and cancers such as Ovarian Carcinoma-Invasive Ductal Breast Carcinoma (OC-IDBC) pair were conducted to examine the efficacy of the proposed method. To identify the mechanistic role of top-ranked genes, we used Functional and Pathway enrichment analysis, connectivity analysis with leave-one-out (LOO) method, analysis of associated disease-related protein complexes, and prioritization tools such as TOPPGENE and Heml2.0. From pathway analysis, it was observed that the top 10 genes obtained using the proposed method were associated with 10 pathways in ALS-SMA comorbidity and 15 in the case of OC-IDBC, while that in similar methods like SAPDSB and S2B were 4, 6 respectively for ALS-SMA and 9, 10 respectively for OC-IDBC. In both case studies, 70 % of the disease-specific benchmark protein complexes were linked to top-ranked genes of the proposed method while that of SAPDSB and S2B were 55 % and 60 % respectively. Additionally, it was found that the removal of the top 10 genes disconnect the network into 14 distinct components in the case of ALS-SMA and 9 in the case of OC-IDBC. The experimental results shows that the proposed method can be effectively used for identifying key genes in comorbidity and can offer insights about the intricate molecular relationship driving comorbid diseases."

The ongoing global risdiplam Compassionate Use Program (CUP), initiated in November 2019, is the largest CUP in SMA, currently providing access to risdiplam for >2000 patients with type 1 or 2 SMA in 59 countries. Here, the challenges and learnings from the risdiplam CUP are presented. Enrolled patients (aged ≥2 months) had type 1 or 2 SMA and no alternative treatment options (ie, they were not medically eligible for approved SMA treatments, were unable to continue their SMA treatment due to medical reasons, were at risk for lack/loss of SMA treatment efficacy, or did not qualify for/had no access to SMA treatment within a clinical trial). Requests were made by the treating physicians via an end-to-end system. The risdiplam CUP highlighted the importance of collaborating with patient advocacy groups early to learn about patients' perspectives on unmet medical needs, understanding the sometimes-unique nature of local regulations and requirements, and adapting physician- and patient-eligibility criteria. Key learnings were obtained from enrolling patients from low- to middle-income countries and from countries without dedicated Compassionate Use regulations, and from operating the CUP during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The risdiplam CUP experience was successful in many ways and may help to design and implement future CUPs in rare diseases, as well as patients living in countries or in circumstances in which access to innovative treatments is a challenge."

By initiating the splicing reaction and modulating 3'-end processing, U1 snRNP exerts precise control over RNA metabolism and gene expression. This ribonucleoparticle is abundantly present, and its complex biogenesis necessitates shuttling between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Over the past three decades, extensive research has illuminated the crucial connection between disrupted U snRNP biogenesis and several prominent human diseases, notably various neurodegenerative conditions. The perturbation of U1 snRNP homeostasis has been firmly established in diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and FUS-mediated Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Intriguingly, compelling evidence suggests a potential correlation in Fronto-temporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease as well. Although the U snRNP biogenesis pathway is conserved across all eukaryotic cells, neurons, in particular, appear to be highly susceptible to alterations in spliceosome homeostasis. In contrast, other cell types exhibit a greater resilience to such disturbances. This vulnerability underscores the intricate relationship between U1 snRNP dynamics and the health of neuronal cells, shedding light on potential avenues for understanding and addressing neurodegenerative disorders."

    "abstract": "The manifestation of bulbar symptoms, especially swallowing, is important for evaluating disease-modifying therapies for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Due to the lack of instruments, the topic is still underrepresented in research. This study aimed to develop a tool to monitor swallowing development in children aged 0 to 24 months with SMA. The method was guided by the COSMIN guidelines and followed a multi-stage Delphi process. The first step was a rapid review of swallowing outcomes in children with SMA younger than 24 months. In the second step, online group interviews with experts (n = 7) on dysphagia in infants were conducted, followed by an anonymous online survey among experts in infants with SMA (n = 19). A predefined consensus threshold for nominal scaled voting was set at≥75 % and for 5-point Likert scale voting at 1.25 of the interquartile range. The third step was the pilot test of the instrument, performed with three groups (healthy controls n = 8; pre-symptomatic n = 6, symptomatic n = 6). Based on the multi-level interprofessional consensus, the DySMA comprises two parts (history and examination), ten categories, with 36 items. Implementation and scoring are clearly articulated and easy to implement. The pilot test showed that swallowing development could be recorded in all groups. The DySMA is well suited for monitoring swallowing development in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic treated infants with SMA. It can be performed in a time-efficient and interprofessional manner. The resulting score is comparable to results from other instruments measuring other domains, e.g., motor function."

    "abstract": "Prior studies showed that polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor (AR) is aberrantly acetylated and that deacetylation of the mutant AR by overexpression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent (NAD+-dependent) sirtuin 1 is protective in cell models of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). Based on these observations and reduced NAD+ in muscles of SBMA mouse models, we tested the therapeutic potential of NAD+ restoration in vivo by treating postsymptomatic transgenic SBMA mice with the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR). NR supplementation failed to alter disease progression and had no effect on increasing NAD+ or ATP content in muscle, despite producing a modest increase of NAD+ in the spinal cords of SBMA mice. Metabolomic and proteomic profiles of SBMA quadriceps muscles indicated alterations in several important energy-related pathways that use NAD+, in addition to the NAD+ salvage pathway, which is critical for NAD+ regeneration for use in cellular energy production. We also observed decreased mRNA levels of nicotinamide riboside kinase 2 (Nmrk2), which encodes a key kinase responsible for NR phosphorylation, allowing its use by the NAD+ salvage pathway. Together, these data suggest a model in which NAD+ levels are significantly decreased in muscles of an SBMA mouse model and intransigent to NR supplementation because of decreased levels of Nmrk2."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (<i>SMN1</i>) gene. In clinical studies, gene replacement therapy with onasemnogene abeparvovec (formerly AVXS-101, Zolgensma<sup>®</sup>, Novartis) was efficacious in improving motor functioning in children with SMA. However, its effects on cognitive and language skills are largely unknown. This longitudinal observational study evaluated changes in motor and neurocognitive functioning over a 1-year period after administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec in 12 symptomatic SMA type 1 patients with two copies of <i>SMN2</i> aged 1.7-52.6 months at administration. Motor functioning was measured using the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test for Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) while neurocognitive assessment was measured using Griffiths III. Motor milestones and language ability were also assessed at each timepoint. Statistically significant increases in median CHOP-INTEND scores from baseline were observed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after onasemnogene abeparvovec administration (all <i>p</i> ≤ 0.005). Most (91.7%) patients were able to roll over or sit independently for >1 min at 12 months. Significant increases in the Griffiths III <i>Foundations of Learning, Language and Communication, Eye and Hand Coordination</i>, and <i>Personal-Social-Emotional</i> subscale scores were observed at 12-months, but not in the <i>Gross Motor</i> subscale. Speech and language abilities progressed in most patients. Overall, most patients showed some improvement in cognitive and communication performance after treatment with onasemnogene abeparvovec in addition to significant improvement in motor functioning and motor milestones. Evaluation of neurocognitive function should be considered when assessing the global functioning of patients with SMA."

A special SMA family presented at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University on October 19, 2020 was selected as the study subject. Multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and molecular tagging linkage analysis were carried out to identify the SMN1 genotype of the couple and their fetus. Subsequently, next-generation sequencing (NGS), molecular tagging linkage analysis, and chromosomal microarray analysis were employed to determine the haplotypes and validate the result of PGT-M on the 11 embryos derived for the couple. The female partner was identified as a carrier of the rare SMN1[2+0] variant, and prenatal diagnosis confirmed the fetus to be affected by SMA. Ultimately, PGT-M has successfully selected four embryos free from the pathogenic SMN1 variants and X chromosome deletion. PGT-M can effectively prevent the transmission of rare genetic variants such as the SMA 2+0 subtype in the families. Above finding has provided guidance for genetic counseling and family planning for the couple."

In this study, 15 patients with HD who underwent ACDF operation between March 2022 and March 2023 with complete data were retrospectively analyzed. Following the diagnosis, conservative treatment was ineffective, and thus, disease progression severely affected the quality of life (QOL) of patients. ACDF was performed in the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, and patients were regularly followed up postoperatively. The cervical range of motion (ROM), the anteroposterior and transverse diameter of the spinal cord, and their ratio was measured before and after the operation. The neurologic function of patients before and after the last follow-up was evaluated using the selected brief-Michigan Hand Questionnaire (sb-MHQ), whilst the overall therapeutic effect after the operation was evaluated using Odom's criteria. All patients were followed up for an average of 12 ± 4.5 (6-18) months. Dynamic X-ray displayed that the ROM of cervical vertebrae decreased from 72.73 ± 12.72° (53-97°) to 33.53° ± 10.34° (15-54°) (P < 0.001). Moreover, flexion cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed after the operation revealed that spinal cord compression was markedly relieved, and the ratio of the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal cord to the transverse diameter increased from 0.27 ± 0.09 to 0.43 ± 0.03 (P < 0.001). At the last follow-up visit, finger extension tremor symptoms were alleviated, although they did not completely disappear. Contrastingly, muscle atrophy showed no significant improvement. Finally, the sb-MHQ score significantly increased from 17.33±1.76 preoperatively to 24.80±1.78 at the last follow-up (P<0.001). Our results collectively highlighted the efficacy of ACDF for the treatment of HD. This procedure can limit excessive cervical flexion and repeated compression of the spinal cord during cervical movement and considerably improve upper limb functions."

Despite growing awareness and potential similarities between both conditions, the relationship between \"generalized\" and \"spine-specific\" sarcopenia is unclear. To investigate the association between generalized and spine-specific sarcopenia. Retrospective cross-sectional study. Patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion surgery for degenerative spinal pathologies. Generalized sarcopenia was evaluated with the short physical performance battery (SPPB), grip strength, and the psoas index, while spine-specific sarcopenia was evaluated by measuring fatty infiltration (FI) of the PM. We used custom software written in MATLAB® to calculate the FI of the PM. The correlation between FI of the PM and assessments of generalized sarcopenia was calculated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho). The strength of the correlation was evaluated according to established cut-offs: negligible: 0-0.3, low: 0.3-0.5, moderate: 0.5-0.7, high: 0.7-0.9, and very high≥0.9. In a Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of sarcopenia assessments to predict severe multifidus atrophy (FI≥50%) was calculated. In a secondary analysis, factors associated with severe multifidus atrophy in nonsarcopenic patients were analyzed. A total of 125 (43% female) patients, with a median age of 63 (IQR 55-73) were included. The most common surgical indication was lumbar spinal stenosis (79.5%). The median FI of the multifidus was 45.5% (IQR 35.6-55.2). Grip strength demonstrated the highest correlation with FI of the multifidus and erector spinae (rho=-0.43 and -0.32, p<.001); the other correlations were significant (p<.05) but lower in strength. In the AUC analysis, the AUC was 0.61 for the SPPB, 0.71 for grip strength, and 0.72 for the psoas index. The latter two were worse in female patients, with an AUC of 0.48 and 0.49. Facet joint arthropathy (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.11-1.47, p=.001) and foraminal stenosis (OR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.10-2.23, p=.015) were independently associated with severe multifidus atrophy in our secondary analysis. Our study demonstrates a low correlation between generalized and spine-specific sarcopenia. These findings highlight the risk of misdiagnosis when relying on screening tools for general sarcopenia and suggest that general and spine-specific sarcopenia may have distinct etiologies."

Clinical trial data suggest early diagnosis and treatment are critical. The purpose of this study was to evaluate neurology appointment wait times for newborn screening identified infants, pediatric cases mirroring SMA symptomatology, and cases in which SMA is suspected by the referring physician. Approaches for triaging and expediting referrals in the US were also explored. Cure SMA surveyed healthcare professionals from two cohorts: (1) providers affiliated with SMA care centers and (2) other neurologists, pediatric neurologists, and neuromuscular specialists. Surveys were distributed directly and via Medscape Education, respectively, between July 9, 2020, and August 31, 2020. Three hundred five total responses were obtained (9% from SMA care centers and 91% from the general recruitment sample). Diagnostic journeys were shorter for infants eventually diagnosed with SMA Type 1 if they were referred to SMA care centers versus general sample practices. Appointment wait times for infants exhibiting \"hypotonia and motor delays\" were significantly shorter at SMA care centers compared to general recruitment practices (p = 0.004). Furthermore, infants with SMA identified through newborn screening were also more likely to be seen sooner if referred to a SMA care center versus a general recruitment site. Lastly, the majority of both cohorts triaged incoming referrals. The average wait time for infants presenting at SMA care centers with \"hypotonia and motor delay\" was significantly shorter when initial referrals were triaged using a set of \"key emergency words\" (p = 0.036). Infants directly referred to a SMA care center versus a general sample practice were more likely to experience shorter SMA diagnostic journeys and appointment wait times. Triage guidelines for referrals specific to \"hypotonia and motor delay\" including use of \"key emergency words\" may shorten wait times and support early diagnosis and treatment of SMA."

However, pharmacovigilance analyses are necessary to objectively evaluate its safety-a crucial step in preventing severe adverse events (AEs). Accordingly, the primary objective of the current study was to examine the AEs associated with risdiplam use based on real-world data obtained from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. More specifically, we examined incidents reported between the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2023. The imbalance of risdiplam-related AEs was evaluated by computing the reporting odds ratio. A total of 5,406,334 reports were thoroughly reviewed. By removing duplicate reports, we identified 1588 reports in which risdiplam was the main suspected drug whose use was accompanied by 3470 associated AEs. Among the included AEs, 703 were categorized as serious and 885 as non-serious. Risdiplam use induced AEs across 18 organ systems, resulting in 130 positive signals. Notably, we detected new AE signals, including cardiac arrest, nephrolithiasis, tachycardia, loss of libido, and elevated hepatic enzyme activities; however, no ophthalmologic toxicity was reported. Although these new adverse reaction signals associated with risdiplam have been defined, long-term clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings. Nevertheless, our findings provide a valuable reference for improving the clinical management of SMA."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder characterised by progressive motor function decline. Motor function is assessed using several functional outcome measures including the Revised Hammersmith Scale (RHS). In this study, we present longitudinal trajectories for the RHS in an international cohort of 149 untreated paediatric SMA 2 and 3 patients (across 531 assessments collected between March 2015 and July 2019). We contextualise these trajectories using both the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) and Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM). At baseline, this cohort included 50% females and 15% of patients had undergone spinal fusion surgery. Patient trajectories were modelled using a natural cubic spline with age, sex, and random effects for each patient. RHS and HFMSE scores show similar trends over time in this cohort not receiving disease modifying therapies. The results confirm the strong correlation between the RHS and RULM previously observed in SMA types 2 and 3a. Scoliosis surgery is associated with a reduction of 3 points in the RHS, 4.5 points in the HFMSE for the SMA 2 population, and a reduction of 11.8 points in the RHS, and 13.4 points in the HFMSE for the SMA 3a populations. When comparing the RHS and RULM, there is a lower correlation in the type 3a's than the type 2 patients. In the SMA 2 population, there is no significant difference between the sexes in either the RHS or HFMSE trajectories. There is no significant difference in the RULM trajectory in the SMA 2 or 3a participants by sex. This study demonstrates that the RHS could be used in conjunction with other functional measures such as the RULM to holistically detect SMA disease progression. This will assist with fully understanding changes that occur with treatments, further defining trajectories and therapy outcomes."

Here we introduce mechanistically interpretable quantitative models for the sequence-specific and concentration-dependent behavior of splice-modifying drugs. Using massively parallel splicing assays, RNA-seq experiments, and precision dose-response curves, we obtain quantitative models for two small-molecule drugs, risdiplam and branaplam, developed for treating spinal muscular atrophy. The results quantitatively characterize the specificities of risdiplam and branaplam for 5' splice site sequences, suggest that branaplam recognizes 5' splice sites via two distinct interaction modes, and contradict the prevailing two-site hypothesis for risdiplam activity at SMN2 exon 7. The results also show that anomalous single-drug cooperativity, as well as multi-drug synergy, are widespread among small-molecule drugs and antisense-oligonucleotide drugs that promote exon inclusion. Our quantitative models thus clarify the mechanisms of existing treatments and provide a basis for the rational development of new therapies."

Even though he was able to eat orally, he required a long time to eat and faced difficulty while swallowing saliva, resulting in frequent spitting. Instructions regarding vacuum swallowing to eliminate pharyngeal residue were provided, and a reduction in meal duration and improved saliva swallowing were observed. High-resolution manometry revealed a significant increase in pharyngeal contractile integral and a significant decrease in esophageal pressure with vacuum swallowing, which enabled the passage of a bolus through the pharynx compared with non-vacuum swallowing. Furthermore, an increase in the lower esophageal sphincter pressure, reflecting diaphragmatic contraction, was also observed. Therefore, this case report elucidates that a patient with neuromuscular disorders could acquire vacuum swallowing with proper instructions."

SMA is characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. One of three currently available treatments is onasemnogene abeparvovec, an AAV9-based gene replacement therapy. Despite its effectiveness in improving motor function in SMA patients, its long-term safety profile remains unclear and adverse events such as liver toxicity are common. This may be caused by high vector dose or supraphysiological levels of SMN, driven by its strong, ubiquitous promoter. In this issue of <i>EMBO Molecular Medicine</i>, Xie et al addressed this by replacing the promoter of a benchmark virus—equivalent to onasemnogene abeparvovec—by an endogenous <i>SMN1</i> promoter. In a common mouse model of SMA, treatment with this 2nd generation vector restored SMN expression close to physiological levels across tissues, resulting in improved safety and efficacy.

This creates exciting opportunities for research and treatment development, and a few genetic disorders (e.g., spinal muscular atrophy) have recently been treated with gene-based therapies. <i>MECP2</i> is found on the X chromosome and regulates the transcription of thousands of genes. Loss of <i>MECP2</i> gene product leads to Rett Syndrome, a disease found primarily in females, and is characterized by developmental regression, motor dysfunction, midline hand stereotypies, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, epilepsy, scoliosis, and autistic-like behavior. Duplication of <i>MECP2</i> causes MECP2 Duplication Syndrome (MDS). MDS is found mostly in males and presents with developmental delay, hypotonia, autistic features, refractory epilepsy, and recurrent respiratory infections. While these two disorders share several characteristics, their differences (e.g., affected sex, age of onset, genotype/phenotype correlations) are important to distinguish in the light of gene-based therapy because they require opposite solutions.

However, limited data exist on the outcomes of individuals with 4 copies of SMN2, and there is no consensus within the SMA treatment community regarding early treatment initiation in this subgroup. To provide evidence-based insights into disease progression, we performed a retrospective analysis of 268 patients with 4 copies of SMN2 from the SMArtCARE registry in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Inclusion criteria required comprehensive baseline data and diagnosis outside of newborn screening. Only data prior to initiation of disease-modifying treatment were included. The median age at disease onset was 3.0 years, with a mean of 6.4 years. Significantly, 55% of patients experienced symptoms before the age of 36 months. 3% never learned to sit unaided, a further 13% never gained the ability to walk independently and 33% of ambulatory patients lost this ability during the course of the disease. 43% developed scoliosis, 6.3% required non-invasive ventilation and 1.1% required tube feeding. In conclusion, our study, in line with previous observations, highlights the substantial phenotypic heterogeneity in SMA. Importantly, this study provides novel insights: the median age of disease onset in patients with 4 SMN2 copies typically occurs before school age, and in half of the patients even before the age of three years. These findings support a proactive approach, particularly early treatment initiation, in this subset of SMA patients diagnosed pre-symptomatically. However, it is important to recognize that the register will not include asymptomatic individuals."

However, whether hnRNP R also modulates axonal mitochondria is currently unknown. Here, we show that axonal mitochondria exhibit altered function and motility in hnRNP R-deficient motoneurons. Motoneurons lacking hnRNP R show decreased anterograde and increased retrograde transport of mitochondria in axons. Furthermore, hnRNP R-deficiency leads to mitochondrial hyperpolarization, caused by decreased complex I and reversed complex V activity within the respiratory chain. Taken together, our data indicate a role for hnRNP R in regulating transport and maintaining functionality of axonal mitochondria in motoneurons."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder that causes progressive degeneration of lower motor neurons and the subsequent loss of muscle function throughout the body. It is the second most common recessive disorder in individuals of European descent and is present in all populations. Accurate tools exist for diagnosing SMA from genome sequencing data. However, there are no publicly available tools for GRCh38-aligned data from panel or exome sequencing assays which continue to be used as first line tests for neuromuscular disorders. This deficiency creates a critical gap in our ability to diagnose SMA in large existing rare disease cohorts, as well as newly sequenced exome and panel datasets. We therefore developed and extensively validated a new tool - SMA Finder - that can diagnose SMA not only in genome, but also exome and panel sequencing samples aligned to GRCh37, GRCh38, or T2T-CHM13. It works by evaluating aligned reads that overlap the c.840 position of <i>SMN1</i> and <i>SMN2</i> in order to detect the most common molecular causes of SMA. We applied SMA Finder to 16,626 exomes and 3,911 genomes from heterogeneous rare disease cohorts sequenced at the Broad Institute Center for Mendelian Genomics as well as 1,157 exomes and 8,762 panel sequencing samples from Tartu University Hospital. SMA Finder correctly identified all 16 known SMA cases and reported nine novel diagnoses which have since been confirmed by clinical testing, with another four novel diagnoses undergoing validation. Notably, out of the 29 total SMA positive cases, 23 had an initial clinical diagnosis of muscular dystrophy, congenital myasthenic syndrome, or myopathy. This underscored the frequency with which SMA can be misdiagnosed as other neuromuscular disorders and confirmed the utility of using SMA Finder to reanalyze phenotypically diverse neuromuscular disease cohorts. Finally, we evaluated SMA Finder on 198,868 individuals that had both exome and genome sequencing data within the UK Biobank (UKBB) and found that SMA Finder's overall false positive rate was less than 1 / 200,000 exome samples, and its positive predictive value (PPV) was 97%. We also observed 100% concordance between UKBB exome and genome calls. This analysis showed that, even though it is located within a segmental duplication, the most common causal variant for SMA can be detected with comparable accuracy to monogenic disease variants in non-repetitive regions. Additionally, the high PPV demonstrated by SMA Finder, the existence of treatment options for SMA in which early diagnosis is imperative for therapeutic benefit, as well as widespread availability of clinical confirmatory testing for SMA, warrants the addition of <i>SMN1</i> to the ACMG list of genes with reportable secondary findings after genome and exome sequencing."

Here we report the biochemical mechanisms of IGHMBP2 disease-causing mutations D565N and H924Y, and their potential impact on therapeutic strategies. The IGHMBP2-D565N mutation has been identified in SMARD1 patients, while the IGHMBP2-H924Y mutation has been identified in CMT2S patients. For the first time, we demonstrate a correlation between the altered IGHMBP2 biochemical activity associated with the D565N and H924Y mutations and disease severity and pathology in patients and our Ighmbp2 mouse models. We show that IGHMBP2 mutations that alter the association with activator of basal transcription (ABT1) impact the ATPase and helicase activities of IGHMBP2 and the association with the 47S pre-rRNA 5' external transcribed spacer. We demonstrate that the D565N mutation impairs IGHMBP2 ATPase and helicase activities consistent with disease pathology. The H924Y mutation alters IGHMBP2 activity to a lesser extent while maintaining association with ABT1. In the context of the compound heterozygous patient, we demonstrate that the total biochemical activity associated with IGHMBP2-D565N and IGHMBP2-H924Y proteins is improved over IGHMBP2-D565N alone. Importantly, we demonstrate that the efficacy of therapeutic applications may vary based on the underlying IGHMBP2 mutations and the relative biochemical activity of the mutant IGHMBP2 protein."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the long-term effects and functional outcomes of androgen suppression therapy using leuprorelin among Korean patients with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). This observational study enrolled patients with genetically confirmed SBMA who provided informed consent. Leuprorelin was administered via subcutaneous injection every 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the change in total Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy Functional Rating Scale (SBMAFRS) scores. A total of 48 SBMA patients were evaluated in this study. Among them, 39 patients underwent androgen suppression therapy over a 3-year period. The total SBMAFRS score decreased from 41.72 ± 5.55 to 36.74 ± 7.74 (p < 0.001) in patients who completed their treatment. The subgroup with a baseline SBMAFRS score of ≥ 42 had a significantly lower decline in SBMAFRS score than did those with a baseline SBMAFRS score of ≤ 41. We determined that at a baseline, SBMAFRS cutoff value of 41.5 could predict good prognosis, with a corresponding area under the curve of 0.689. Despite androgen suppression therapy, all enrolled participants exhibited a decrease in the overall SBMAFRS score. However, those with a baseline SBMAFRS of ≥ 42 showed a mild decrease in scores, indicating a more favorable prognosis. These findings suggest that a higher baseline motor function was a key prognostic indicator in SBMA treatment and that initiating early leuprorelin treatment in patients with high baseline function may lead to good clinical outcomes."

Providers and the SMA community should be aware of the presence of and likely expectations for the existence of caregiver burden. <b>Methods</b>: The Assessment of Caregiver Experience with Neuromuscular Disease (ACEND) quantifies caregivers' perceptions of function and quality of life pertaining to time, finance and emotion. Analyses were conducted among SMA types and ambulatory and ventilatory status. Participants with SMA had varying ranges of function and were on pharmaceutical treatment. Total ACEND score, longitudinal change in total ACEND score, total quality of life (QOL) score, change in total QOL score and subdomains for QOL, including time, emotion and finance, were all explored. <b>Results</b>: Overall, the ACEND demonstrated discriminant validity and some observed trends. Total ACEND scores improved for caregivers of those with SMA 2, remained stable longitudinally for caregivers of those with SMA 1 and 3 and were not influenced by ventilation status. The caregivers of individuals with SMA 1 had the lowest total quality of life (QOL) score, as did the caregivers of non-ambulatory individuals and those requiring assisted ventilation. Longitudinally, there were no changes in total QOL between caregivers of individuals with different SMA types or ambulatory or ventilation status. There were some differences in emotional needs, but no differences in financial impact between the caregivers of individuals with different types of SMA or ambulatory and ventilatory status. <b>Conclusions</b>: With this information enlightening the presence of caregiver burden and expected changes in burden with pharmaceutical treatment, providers, third party payors and the SMA community at large can better assist, equip and empower those providing the necessary assistance to enable the lives of those with SMA."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by degeneration of lower motor neurons (LMNs), causing muscle weakness, atrophy, and paralysis. SMA is caused by mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (<i>SMN1</i>) gene and can be classified into four subgroups, depending on its severity. Even though the genetic component of SMA is well known, the precise mechanisms underlying its pathophysiology remain elusive. Thus far, there are three FDA-approved drugs for treating SMA. While these treatments have shown promising results, their costs are extremely high and unaffordable for most patients. Thus, more efforts are needed in order to identify novel therapeutic targets. In this context, zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) stands out as an ideal animal model for investigating neurodegenerative diseases like SMA. Its well-defined motor neuron circuits and straightforward neuromuscular structure offer distinct advantages. The zebrafish's suitability arises from its low-cost genetic manipulation and optical transparency exhibited during larval stages, which facilitates in vivo microscopy. This review explores advancements in SMA research over the past two decades, beginning with the creation of the first zebrafish model. Our review focuses on the findings using different SMA zebrafish models generated to date, including potential therapeutic targets such as U snRNPs, Etv5b, PLS3, CORO1C, Pgrn, Cpg15, Uba1, Necdin, and Pgk1, among others. Lastly, we conclude our review by emphasizing the future perspectives in the field, namely exploiting zebrafish capacity for high-throughput screening. Zebrafish, with its unique attributes, proves to be an ideal model for studying motor neuron diseases and unraveling the complexity of neuromuscular defects."

Gene editing systems can potentially alter disease trajectory by correcting dysfunctional mutations or therapeutically altering gene expression. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches are attractive gene therapy platforms to personalize treatments because of their specificity, ease of design, versatility, and cost. However, many such approaches remain in the early stages of development, with ongoing efforts to optimize editing efficiency, minimize unintended off-target effects, and mitigate pathologic immune responses. Given the rapid evolution of CRISPR-based therapies, it is prudent for the clinically based child neurologist to have a conceptual understanding of what such therapies may entail, including both benefits and risks and how such therapies may be clinically applied. In this review, we describe the fundamentals of CRISPR-based therapies, discuss the opportunities and challenges that have arisen, and highlight preclinical work in several pediatric neurological diseases."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy is a neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in both copies of the survival motor neuron gene 1 (<i>SMN1</i>), which lead to reduction in the production of the SMN protein. Currently, there are several therapies that have been approved for SMA, with many more undergoing active research. While various biomarkers have been proposed for assessing the effectiveness of SMA treatment, a universally accepted one still has not been identified. This study aimed to describe a fast and reliable method using the number of gems in cell nuclei as a potential tool for assessment of splicing correction of oligonucleotide efficacy in SMA cells. To gain insight into whether the number of gems in cell nuclei varies based on their <i>SMN</i> genotype and whether the increase in gem number is associated with therapeutic response, we utilized fibroblast cell cultures obtained from a patient with SMA type II and from a healthy individual. We discovered a remarkable difference in the number of gems found in the nuclei of these cells, specifically when counting gems per 100 nuclei. The SMA fibroblasts treated with antisense oligonucleotide showed beneficial effects in correcting the abnormal splicing of <i>SMN2</i> exon 7. It was observed that there was a significant increase in the number of gems in the treated cells compared to the intact SMA cells. The results obtained significantly correlate with an increase of full-length SMN transcript sharing. Based on our findings, we propose using the quantity of gems as a reliable biomarker for SMA drug development."

The specific effects of SMN protein loss and the resulting pathological alterations are not fully understood. Given the crucial roles of the SMN protein in snRNP biogenesis and its interactions with ribosomes and translation-related proteins and mRNAs, a decrease in SMN levels below a specific threshold in SMA is expected to affect translational control of gene expression. This review covers both direct and indirect SMN interactions across various translation-related cellular compartments and processes, spanning from ribosome biogenesis to local translation and beyond. Additionally, it aims to outline deficiencies and alterations in translation observed in SMA models and patients, while also discussing the implications of the relationship between SMN protein and the translation machinery within the context of current and future therapies."

With aim of providing an early diagnosis, newborn screening (NBS) for SMA using a real-time PCR assay with dried blood spots (DBS) was performed from January 2022 through November 2022 in Saint Petersburg, which is a representative Russian megapolis. Here, 36,140 newborns were screened by the GenomeX real-time PCR-based screening test, and three genotypes were identified: homozygous deletion carriers (4 newborns), heterozygous carriers (772 newborns), and wild-type individuals (35,364 newborns). The disease status of all four newborns that screened positive for the homozygous <i>SMN1</i> deletion was confirmed by alternate methods. Two of the newborns had two copies of <i>SMN2</i>, and two of the newborns had three copies. We determined the incidence of spinal muscular atrophy in Saint Petersburg to be 1 in 9035 and the SMA carrier frequency to be 1 in 47. In conclusion, providing timely information regarding <i>SMN1</i>, confirmation of disease status, and <i>SMN2</i> copy number as part of the SMA newborn-screening algorithm can significantly improve clinical follow-up, testing of family members, and treatment of patients with SMA."

Genomic alterations including survival motor neuron (SMN) copy number as well as deletions in SMN and Neuronal Apoptosis Inhibitory Protein (NAIP) are greatly implicated in the emergence of SMA. However, the association of such alterations with the severity of the disease is yet to be investigated. This study was directed to elucidate the molecular assessment of NAIP and SMN genomic alterations as a useful tool in predicting the severity of SMA among patients. This study included 65 SMA pediatric patients (30 type I and 35 type II) and 65 healthy controls. RFLP-PCR was employed to determine the genetic polymorphisms of the SMN1, SMN2, and NAIP genes. In addition, qRT-PCR was used to identify the expression of the SMN1 and SMN2 genes, and serum levels of creatine kinase were measured using a colorimetric method. DNA sequencing was performed on some samples to detect any single nucleotide polymorphisms in SMN1, SMN2, and NAIP genes. All SMA patients had a homozygous deficiency of SMN1 exon 7. The homozygous deficiency of SMN1 exons 7 and 8, with the deletion of NAIP exon 5 was found among the majority of Type I patients. In contrast, patients with the less severe condition (type II) had SMN1 exons 7 and 8 deleted but did not have any deletions in NAIP, additionally; 65.7% of patients had multiple copies of SMN2. Analysis of NAIP deletion alongside assessing SMN2 copy number might enhance the effectiveness of the diagnosis that can predict severity among Spinal Muscular Atrophy patients."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular, rare genetic disorder caused due to loss-of-function mutations in the survival motor neuron-1 (<i>SMN1</i>) gene, leading to deficiency of the SMN protein. The severity of the disease phenotype is inversely proportional to the copy number of another gene, <i>SMN2</i>, that differs from <i>SMN1</i> by a few nucleotides. The current diagnostic methods for SMA include symptom-based diagnosis, biochemical methods like detection of serum creatine kinase, and molecular detection of disease-causing mutations using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and exome or next-generation sequencing (NGS). Along with detection of the disease-causing mutation in the <i>SMN1</i> gene, it is crucial to identify the copy number of the <i>SMN2</i> gene, which is a disease modifier. Therapeutic options like gene therapy, antisense therapy, and small molecules are available for SMA, but, the costs are prohibitively high. This review discusses the prevalence, diagnosis, available therapeutic options for SMA, and their clinical trials in the Indian context, and highlights the need for measures to make indigenous diagnostic and therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Rare muscular disorders (RMDs) are disorders that affect a small percentage of the population. The disorders which are attributed to genetic mutations often manifest in the form of progressive weakness and atrophy of skeletal and heart muscles. RMDs includes disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), GNE myopathy, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), limb girdle muscular dystrophy, and so on. Due to the infrequent occurrence of these disorders, development of therapeutic approaches elicits less attention compared with other more prevalent diseases. However, in recent times, improved understanding of pathogenesis has led to greater advances in developing therapeutic options to treat such diseases. Exon skipping, gene augmentation, and gene editing have taken the spotlight in drug development for rare neuromuscular disorders. The recent innovation in targeting and repairing mutations with the advent of CRISPR technology has in fact opened new possibilities in the development of gene therapy approaches for these disorders. Although these treatments show satisfactory therapeutic effects, the susceptibility to degradation, instability, and toxicity limits their application. So, an appropriate delivery vector is required for the delivery of these cargoes. Viral vectors are considered potential delivery systems for gene therapy; however, the associated concurrent immunogenic response and other limitations have paved the way for the applications of other non-viral systems like lipids, polymers, cellpenetrating peptides (CPPs), and other organic and inorganic materials. This review will focus on non-viral vectors for the delivery of therapeutic cargoes in order to treat muscular dystrophies."

Currently available therapies have multiple shortcomings, including poor body-wide distribution, invasive delivery, and potential negative consequences due to high doses needed for clinical efficacy. Here we test the effects of a combination treatment of a splice-correcting antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) Anti-N1 with the small compounds risdiplam and branaplam. We show that a low-dose treatment of Anti-N1 with either compound produces a synergistic effect on the inclusion of <i>SMN2</i> exon 7 in SMA patient fibroblasts. Using RNA-Seq, we characterize the transcriptomes of cells treated with each compound as well as in combination. Although high doses of each individual treatment trigger widespread perturbations of the transcriptome, combination treatment of Anti-N1 with risdiplam and branaplam results in minimal disruption of gene expression. For individual genes targeted by the 3 compounds, we observe little to no additive effects of combination treatment. Overall, we conclude that the combination treatment of a splice-correcting ASO with small compounds represents a promising strategy for achieving a high level of SMN expression while minimizing the risk of off-target effects."

We determined the ability of a novel non-ionizing, non-volitional method to measure and quantify bell-shaped chests in SMA. A 3D depth camera and a chest x-ray (CXR) were used to capture chest images in 14 SMA patients and 28 controls. Both methods measure the distance between two points, but measurements performed by 3D analysis allow for the consideration of the curve of a surface (geodesic measurements), whereas the CXR allows solely for the determination of the shortest path between two points, with no regard for the surface (Euclidean measurements). The ratio of the upper to lower chest distances was quantified to distinguish chest shape in imaging by both the 3D depth camera and the CXR, and the ratios were compared between healthy and SMA patients. The mean 3D Euclidean ratio of distances measured by 3D imaging was 1.00 in the control group and 0.92 in the SMA group (<i>p</i> = 0.01), the latter indicative of a bell-shaped chest. This result repeated itself in the ratio of geodesic measurements (0.99 vs. 0.89, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.03). The herein-described novel, noninvasive 3D method for measuring the upper and lower chest distances was shown to distinguish the bell-shaped chest configuration in patients with SMA from the chests of controls. This method bears several advantages over CXR and may be readily applicable in clinical settings that manage children with SMA."

RegistrAME is a self-reported specific disease registry with an accurate curation system. It has collected data on SMA patients in Spain since 2015, gathering demographic, clinical, and patient-reported outcome data, all of which are patient-relevant. RegistrAME is part of the TREAT NMD network. This study aims to describe the advantages and disadvantages of a self-reported SMA registry, as well as the different variables of interest in the health status of RegistrAME patients. In total, 295 living patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SMA-5q were included (aged 1 to 77 years; mean 20.28). Half of the patients (50.2%) were ≥ 16 years old; 22.03% were type 1, 48.47% were type 2, 28.82% were type 3, and 0.7% were type 4. All functional statuses (non-sitter, sitter, and walkers) could be observed in each SMA type. Adult patients harbored the least aggressive SMA types, however, they presented the greatest level of disability. Patients with SMA type 1 had scoliosis surgery about five years earlier than patients with SMA type 2. None of the type 1 patients who achieved ambulation were wheelchair-free outdoors. This was also evident in 62.5% of type 2 walker patients and 44% of type 3 walker patients. Of the SMA type 1 patients, 40% had a gastrostomy (of which 84% had two SMN2 copies). One in five children with SMA type 1 (one to seven years of age) were ventilation-free.

    "abstract": "RNA helicases constitute a large protein family implicated in cellular RNA homeostasis and disease development. Here, we show that the RNA helicase IGHMBP2, linked to the neuromuscular disorder spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1), associates with polysomes and impacts translation of mRNAs containing short, GC-rich, and structured 5' UTRs. The absence of IGHMBP2 causes ribosome stalling at the start codon of target mRNAs, leading to reduced translation efficiency. The main mRNA targets of IGHMBP2-mediated regulation encode for components of the THO complex (THOC), linking IGHMBP2 to mRNA production and nuclear export. Accordingly, failure of IGHMBP2 regulation of THOC causes perturbations of the transcriptome and its encoded proteome, and ablation of THOC subunits phenocopies these changes. Thus, IGHMBP2 is an upstream regulator of THOC. Of note, IGHMBP2-dependent regulation of THOC is also observed in astrocytes derived from patients with SMARD1 disease, suggesting that deregulated mRNA metabolism contributes to SMARD1 etiology and may enable alternative therapeutic avenues."

Search of Medline/PubMed for publications of paediatric surveys on HMV from 2000 to 2023. Data from 32 international reports, representing 8815 children (59% boys) using HMV, were analysed. A substantial number of children had neuromuscular disorders (NMD; 37%), followed by cardiorespiratory (Cardio-Resp; 16%), central nervous system (CNS; 16%), upper airway (UA; 13%), other disorders (Others; 10%), central hypoventilation (4%), thoracic (3%) and genetic/congenital disorders (Gen/Cong; 1%). Mean age±SD (range) at HMV initiation was 6.7±3.7 (0.5-14.7) years. Age distribution was bimodal, with two peaks around 1-2 and 14-15 years. The number and proportion of children using NIV was significantly greater than that of children using IMV (n=6362 vs 2453, p=0.03; 72% vs 28%, p=0.048), with wide variations among countries, studies and disorders. NIV was used preferentially in the preponderance of children affected by UA, Gen/Cong, Thoracic, NMD and Cardio-Resp disorders. Children with NMD still receiving primary invasive HMV were mainly type I spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Mean age±SD at initiation of IMV and NIV was 3.3±3.3 and 8.2±4.4 years (p<0.01), respectively. The rate of children receiving additional daytime HMV was higher with IMV as compared with NIV (69% vs 10%, p<0.001). The evolution of paediatric HMV over the last two decades consists of a growing number of children using HMV, in parallel to an increasing use of NIV in recent years (2020-2023). There is no clear trend in the profile of children over time (age at HMV). However, an increasing number of patients requiring HMV were observed in the Gen/Cong, CNS and Others groups. Finally, the estimated prevalence of paediatric HMV was calculated at 7.4/100 000 children. Patients with NMD represent the largest group of children using HMV.

This study aimed to assess the progression of scoliosis in pediatric patients with SMA undergoing nusinersen treatment. In this prospective study, data were systematically collected from Hong Kong pediatric SMA patients receiving nusinersen between 2018 and 2023. All patients had longitudinal radiographic studies pre-nusinersen, and at half-yearly or yearly intervals during treatment based on the scoliosis severity. Motor function evaluations were conducted pre-nusinersen, and after starting treatment at 6- and 12-month intervals. Twenty-three patients ((SMA type 1 (SMA1) = 8, SMA type 2 (SMA2) = 7, SMA type 3 (SMA3) = 8)) with a median age of 5.8 years (range: 0.4-17.5 years) at nusinersen initiation, and median follow-up duration of 3.4 years (range: 1.1-5.2 years) were included. During the study period, motor scores remained stable or improved in 83% of patients. However, scoliosis progressed across all subtypes, with mean annual progression rates of 5.2, 11.9, and 3.6 degrees in SMA1, SMA2, and SMA3 respectively. Patients initiating nusinersen between ages 5 and 11 years exhibited the most rapid progression, with rates of 11.8, 16.5, and 7.3 degrees per year in SMA1, SMA2, and SMA3 respectively. Positive correlations were observed between the difference in CHOP-INTEND score post-nusinersen and scoliosis progression in SMA1 (rs = 0.741, p = 0.041). Conversely, negative correlations were found between the difference in HFMSE score post-nusinersen and scoliosis progression in SMA2 (rs =-0.890, p = 0.012) and SMA3 (rs =-0.777, p = 0.028). This study reveals that nusinersen treatment in symptomatic pediatric SMA patients with motor improvement is linked to increased scoliosis progression in SMA1, whereas it is associated with decreased progression in SMA2 and SMA3. Age, baseline Cobb angle, and motor milestone improvement are influential factors in scoliosis progression."

    "title": "The socioeconomic burden of spinal muscular atrophy in Saudi Arabia: a cross-sectional pilot study.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare debilitating condition with a significant burden for patients and society. However, little is known about how it affects Saudi Arabia's population. The socioeconomic and medical characteristics of affected SMA patients and their caregivers are lacking. This study aimed to describe the socioeconomic and medical characteristics of SMA patients and caregivers in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted using snowball sampling. Assessment tools including EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L) and visual analog scale (EQ-VAS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Costs for Patients Questionnaire (CoPaQ) were used to assess the quality of life (QoL), anxiety, depression, and out-of-pocket expenditures. Sixty-four caregivers of SMA patients participated. Type I patients had higher sibling concordance, ICU hospitalization, and mechanical support needs. Type III patients had better QoL. Type I patients' caregivers had higher depression scores. Type III patients' caregivers had higher out-of-pocket expenditures. Forty-eight percent received supportive care, while others received SMA approved therapies. SMA imposes a significant socioeconomic burden on patients and caregivers, requiring more attention from the healthcare system. Access to innovative therapies varied across SMA types. Pre-marital screening and early detection are crucial to reduce disease incidence and ensure timely treatment."

    "abstract": "Evidence for the efficacy of nusinersen in adults with 5q-associated spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has been demonstrated up to a period of 16 months in relatively large cohorts but whereas patients reach a plateau over time is still to be demonstrated. We investigated the efficacy and safety of nusinersen in adults with SMA over 38 months, the longest time period to date in a large cohort of patients from multiple clinical sites. Our prospective, observational study included adult patients with SMA from Germany, Switzerland, and Austria (July 2017 to May 2022). All participants had genetically-confirmed, 5q-associated SMA and were treated with nusinersen according to the label. The total Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) and Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) scores, and 6-min walk test (6 MWT; metres), were recorded at baseline and 14, 26, and 38 months after treatment initiation, and pre and post values were compared. Adverse events were also recorded. Overall, 389 patients were screened for eligibility and 237 were included. There were significant increases in all outcome measures compared with baseline, including mean HFMSE scores at 14 months (mean difference 1.72 [95% CI 1.19-2.25]), 26 months (1.20 [95% CI 0.48-1.91]), and 38 months (1.52 [95% CI 0.74-2.30]); mean RULM scores at 14 months (mean difference 0.75 [95% CI 0.43-1.07]), 26 months (mean difference 0.65 [95% CI 0.27-1.03]), and 38 months (mean difference 0.72 [95% CI 0.25-1.18]), and 6 MWT at 14 months (mean difference 30.86 m [95% CI 18.34-43.38]), 26 months (mean difference 29.26 m [95% CI 14.87-43.65]), and 38 months (mean difference 32.20 m [95% CI 10.32-54.09]). No new safety signals were identified. Our prospective, observational, long-term (38 months) data provides further real-world evidence for the continuous efficacy and safety of nusinersen in a large proportion of adult patients with SMA.

    "title": "Shared and distinct mechanisms of UBA1 inactivation across different diseases.",
    "abstract": "Most cellular ubiquitin signaling is initiated by UBA1, which activates and transfers ubiquitin to tens of E2 enzymes. Clonally acquired UBA1 missense mutations cause an inflammatory-hematologic overlap disease called VEXAS (vacuoles, E1, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome. Despite extensive clinical investigation into this lethal disease, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, by dissecting VEXAS-causing UBA1 mutations, we discovered that p.Met41 mutations alter cytoplasmic isoform expression, whereas other mutations reduce catalytic activity of nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms by diverse mechanisms, including aberrant oxyester formation. Strikingly, non-p.Met41 mutations most prominently affect transthioesterification, revealing ubiquitin transfer to cytoplasmic E2 enzymes as a shared property of pathogenesis amongst different VEXAS syndrome genotypes. A similar E2 charging bottleneck exists in some lung cancer-associated UBA1 mutations, but not in spinal muscular atrophy-causing UBA1 mutations, which instead, render UBA1 thermolabile. Collectively, our results highlight the precision of conformational changes required for faithful ubiquitin transfer, define distinct and shared mechanisms of UBA1 inactivation in diverse diseases, and suggest that specific E1-E2 modules control different aspects of tissue differentiation and maintenance."

    "abstract": "Diabetes is an ongoing global problem as it affects health of more than 537 million people around the world. Diabetes leaves many serious complications that affect patients and can cause death if not detected and treated promptly. Some of the complications of diabetes include impaired vascular system, increased risk of stroke, neurological diseases that cause pain and numbness, diseases related to the retina leading to blindness, and other complications affecting kidneys, heart failure, muscle weakness, muscle atrophy. All complications of diabetes seriously affect the health of patients. Recently, gene therapy has emerged as a viable treatment strategy for various diseases. DNA and RNA are among the target molecules that can change the structure and function of proteins and are effective methods of treating diseases, especially genetically inherited diseases. RNA therapeutics has attracted deep interest as it has been approved for application in the treatment of functional system disorders such as spinal muscular atrophy, and muscular dystrophy. In this review, we cover the types of RNA therapies considered for treatment of diabetes. In particular, we delve into the mechanism of action of RNA therapies for diabetes, and studies involving testing of these RNA therapies. Finally, we have highlighted the limitations of the current understanding in the mechanism of action of RNA therapies."

    "abstract": "5q-associated spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons with consecutive weakness and atrophy of the limb, respiratory, and bulbar muscles. While trunk and limb motor function improve or stabilize in adults with SMA under nusinersen and risdiplam treatment, the efficacy on bulbar function in this age group of patients remains uncertain. However, it is important to assess bulbar dysfunction, which frequently occurs in the disease course and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Bulbar function was evaluated prospectively in 25 non-ambulatory adults with type 2 and 3 SMA before and 4 and 12 months after risdiplam treatment initiation using the Sydney Swallow Questionnaire (SSQ) and the bulbar subscore of the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale Revised (b-ALSFRS-R). Extremity function was assessed using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) and Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM). Subjective swallowing quality, measured with the SSQ, improved after 12 months of therapy with risdiplam. For the b-ALSFRS-R, a non-significant trend towards improvement was observed. The RULM score improved after 12 months of risdiplam therapy, but not the HFMSE score. HFMSE and RULM scores did not correlate with the SSQ but the b-ALSFRS-R score at baseline. The improvement in subjective swallowing quality under risdiplam treatment, despite an advanced disease stage with severe motor deficits, strengthens the importance of a standardized bulbar assessment in addition to established motor scores. This may reveal relevant treatment effects and help individualize treatment decisions in the future."

Literature regarding swallowing safety and efficiency is scarce in patients with SMA, particularly in the era of newborn screening programs and disease-modifying therapies. To describe the longitudinal changes of swallowing safety and efficiency in children with SMA who received one or more disease modifying therapies METHODS: Case series of patients with SMA followed at the University of Florida from 1 May 2019 to 31 December 2022 who had two or more videofluoroscopy swallowing studies (VFSS), with the first being within 30 days of their first treatment. Data extracted from the electronic health record included: neuromotor outcomes, VFSS penetration aspiration scores (PAS), presence of abrnormal oral or pharyngeal residue, clinical history, and timing of disease-modifying therapies administration. Seven subjects were included (five male); three were diagnosed via newborn screen. Median age at diagnosis was 10 days (range: 4-250). Median age at initial VFSS was 29 days (range: 9-246), and age at the last VFSS was 26.1 months (range: 18.2-36.2). All subjects received onasemnogene-abeparvovec (OA); four received additional therapies. PAS at diagnosis was abnormal in four subjects. Six subjects required feeding modifications after VFSS results. Of these, three had silent aspiration (PAS 8) and three of them improved after treatment. Swallowing safety and efficiency can be impaired in patients with SMA despite early treatment. Larger, prospective studies are needed to define optimal timiing of longitudinal instrumental evaluations."

While recruiting older SA adults into a brain health study, we encountered unexpected hesitancy toward structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis and stigmatizing attitudes related to internal locus of control (LoC) for future dementia risks. We hypothesized that support for MRI-related research was influenced by these attitudes as well as personal MRI experience, perceived MRI safety, and concerns for personal risk for future dementia/stroke. We developed a brief cross-sectional survey to assess older adults' MRI experiences and perceptions, desire to learn of six incidental findings of increasing impact on health, and attitudes related to dementia (including LoC) and research participation. We recruited a convenience sample of 256 respondents (74% reporting as 50+) from the New Jersey/New York City area to complete the survey (offered in English, Chinese, Korean, and Spanish) and modeled the proportional odds (PO) for favorable attitudes toward research activities. Seventy-seven SA and 84 EA respondents were analyzed alongside 95 White, Black, or Hispanic adults. White (PO = 2.54, <i>p</i> = 0.013) and EA (PO = 2.14, <i>p</i> = 0.019) respondents were both more likely than SA respondents to endorse healthy volunteers' participation in research, and the difference between White and SA respondents was mediated by the latter's greater internal LoC for dementia risks. EA respondents had more worries for future dementia/stroke than SA respondents (<i>p</i> = 0.006) but still shared SA respondents' lower wish (measured by proportion of total) to learn of incidental MRI findings. SA-and EA compared to SA-older adults had low desire to learn of incidental MRI findings but had different attitudes toward future dementia/stroke risks.

    "abstract": "To evaluate the safety of growth-friendly instrumentation for early-onset scoliosis (EOS) in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 who received disease-modifying treatment (DMT) and analyze short-term efficacy. Retrospective search was conducted between 2017 and 2023. Patients with genetically confirmed SMA type 1 who were surgically treated for spinal deformity and receiving DMTs (nusinersen, risdiplam, or onasemnogene abeparvovec) were included. SMA types 2 and 3 and patients who do not receive DMTs were excluded. Clinical and radiographic data were collected at preoperative, postoperative, and latest follow-up visits. Twenty-eight patients (mean follow-up: 16 months (range 2-41)) were included. The mean age at surgery was 60 months (range 29-96). Fifteen were treated with dual magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGR), four with unilateral MCGR and a contralateral guided growth system, three with Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Rib (VEPTR®) implants, five with self-distracting systems, and one with traditional dual growing rods. The mean amount of correction was 57% (44°± 17) for scoliosis and 83% (13°± 11) for pelvic obliquity. The mean T1-12 height gain during surgery was 31 mm (±16 mm), while the mean T1 S1 height gain was 51 mm (±24 mm), and instrumented growth was observed during follow-up. Five patients (18%) developed six serious adverse events: three surgical site infections, two anchor failures, and one rod fracture, and all required unplanned reoperations. No neurologic complication, difficulty during nusinersen injections, or respiratory decline was recorded. We report that spinal deformity in this population can be safely treated with growth-friendly instrumentation, with similar complication rates when compared with SMA type 2."

    "abstract": "Pontocerebellar hypoplasia is an umbrella term describing a heterogeneous group of prenatal neurodegenerative disorders mostly affecting the pons and cerebellum, with 17 types associated with 25 genes. However, some types of PCH lack sufficient information, which highlights the importance of investigating and introducing more cases to further elucidate the clinical, radiological, and biochemical features of these disorders. The aim of this study is to provide an in-depth review of PCH and to identify disease genes and their inheritance patterns in 12 distinct Iranian families with clinically confirmed PCH. Cases included in this study were selected based on their phenotypic and genetic information available at the Center for Comprehensive Genetic Services. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used to discover the underlying genetic etiology of participants' problems, and Sanger sequencing was utilized to confirm any suspected alterations. We also conducted a comprehensive molecular literature review to outline the genetic features of the various subtypes of PCH. This study classified and described the underlying etiology of PCH into three categories based on the genes involved. Twelve patients also were included, eleven of whom were from consanguineous parents. Ten different variations in 8 genes were found, all of which related to different types of PCH. Six novel variations were reported, including SEPSECS, TSEN2, TSEN54, AMPD2, TOE1, and CLP1. Almost all patients presented with developmental delay, hypotonia, seizure, and microcephaly being common features. Strabismus and elevation in lactate levels in MR spectroscopy were novel phenotypes for the first time in PCH types 7 and 9. This study merges previously documented phenotypes and genotypes with unique novel ones. Due to the diversity in PCH, we provided guidance for detecting and diagnosing these heterogeneous groups of disorders. Moreover, since certain critical conditions, such as spinal muscular atrophy, can be a differential diagnosis, providing cases with novel variations and clinical findings could further expand the genetic and clinical spectrum of these diseases and help in better diagnosis. Therefore, six novel genetic variants and novel clinical and paraclinical findings have been reported for the first time. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for PCH."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a growing clinical concern, necessitating higher awareness and early detection. This case study focuses on the difficulties and advances in detecting and treating SMA. It emphasizes the value of early detection, interdisciplinary care, genetic testing, and novel therapeutics in terms of improving outcomes. Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA Type 1) is a rare genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness. This case report presents the fatal outcome of a 1-year-old girl with delayed diagnosis of SMA Type 1. The child exhibited symptoms of muscle weakness and respiratory distress, which were initially overlooked. Despite a thorough examination and diagnostic tests, including genetic analysis, SMA Type 1 with a homozygous deletion in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene was confirmed. The child received supportive measures and physiotherapy but experienced a progressive deterioration of her condition and eventually succumbed to the disease. This case underscores the challenges of diagnosing SMA and highlights the importance of early identification for appropriate management. Improved awareness, diagnostic protocols, and access to treatment options, including pharmacological drugs and gene therapy, are essential to improve outcomes for SMA Type 1 patients, particularly in resource-limited settings. Early detection through newborn screening programs and timely intervention can significantly impact the prognosis and life expectancy of SMA Type 1 children, emphasizing the need for continued research and clinical trials to establish a definitive cure."

    "abstract": "A consanguineous couple was referred at 10 weeks of gestation (WG) for prenatal genetic investigations due to isolated cystic hygroma. Prenatal trio exome sequencing identified causative homozygous truncating variants in ASCC1 previously implicated in spinal muscular atrophy with congenital bone fractures. Prenatal manifestations in ASCC1 can usually include hydramnios, fetal hypo-/akinesia, arthrogryposis, contractures and limb deformities, hydrops fetalis and cystic hygroma. An additional truncating variant was identified in CSPP1 associated with Joubert syndrome. Presentations in CSPP1 include cerebellar and brainstem malformations with vermis hypoplasia and molar tooth sign, difficult to visualize in early gestation. A second pregnancy was marked by the recurrence of isolated increased nuchal translucency at 10 + 2 WG. Sanger prenatal diagnosis targeted on ASCC1 and CSPP1 variants showed the presence of the homozygous familial ASCC1 variant. In this case, prenatal exome sequencing analysis is subject to a partial ASCC1 phenotype and an undetectable CSPP1 phenotype at 10 weeks of gestation. As CSPP1 contribution is unclear or speculative to a potentially later in pregnancy or postnatal phenotype, it is mentioned as a variant of uncertain significance. The detection of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants involved in severe disorders but without phenotype-genotype correlation because the pregnancy is in the early stages or due to prenatally undetectable phenotypes, will encourage the clinical community to define future practices in molecular prenatal reporting."

We provide a comprehensive summary of the perioperative characteristics observed in patients with SMA and propose an optimized perioperative management strategy for anaesthesia. This study is a retrospective single-centre research. Twenty-six SMA patients with severe scoliosis underwent posterior spinal fusion surgery from September 2019 to September 2022 were enroled. The main outcomes were to show the patients' characteristics in anaesthesia, intra- and post-operative periods. Nineteen patients underwent awake transnasal/transairway intubation. The median anaesthesia time of 25 patients treated under total intravenous anaesthesia was 425 min. After operation, the Cobb angle and correction rate in the coronal plane were median 54.0° and 54.4%. The length of mechanical ventilation with endotracheal intubation in ICU was median 17.5 h in 8 patients. The ICU length of stay of postoperative hospital was median 19 days. Postoperative pneumonia developed in nine patients, atelectasis in two patients, and pleural effusion in six patients. All patients did not need special oxygen therapy after discharge. Multidisciplinary consultation, lung-protective ventilation strategy, appropriate anaesthetic drugs and reasonable blood transfusion scheme and postoperative monitoring were important in anaesthesia, intraoperative and postoperative periods in the patients of severe scoliosis with spinal muscular atrophy."

In order to provide individual recommendations for choice of treatment and therapy (dis-) continuation, objective outcome measures are needed. The purpose of this study was to determine whether maximum isometric voluntary grip and finger flexion strength is a useful sensitive outcome measure in children and adult patients with SMA. In this non-interventional, longitudinal pilot study, we assessed grip and finger flexion strength on 39 patients with SMA II and III (n = 16 children, mean age = 10.0; n = 23 adults, mean age = 38.4) using the Weber hand and finger dynamometer HFD 200. Grip and finger flexion strength, clinical examinations and motor function scores (Revised Upper Limb Module, Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded) were assessed over a 12-month treatment period concurrent with the nusinersen treatment. Grip and finger flexion strength was highly associated with motor function and disease severity, SMA type and SMN2 copy number. During nusinersen treatment, grip and finger flexion strength significantly increased in children and adults with SMA. Grip and finger flexion strength measured with the HFD 200 is a promising sensitive outcome measure for SMA."

We hypothesized that some obstructive events may in fact be pseudo-obstructive, reflecting the imbalance of chest wall weakness with preserved diaphragmatic function, rather than true upper airway obstruction. If confirmed, these events could represent SMA-specific outcome measures. We aimed to report on the pattern observed in respiratory polygraphies (PG) in paediatric patients with SMA type 2 resembling obstructive SDB. We defined pseudo-obstructive SDB and assessed its changes throughout disease progression. Retrospective review of 18 PG of 6 SMA type 2 patients naïve from DMT across 3 timepoints (first study, one-year follow-up, latest study). At first study patients aged 3-13 years. Four patients were self-ventilating in room air and one of them required non-invasive ventilation (NIV) after the 1-year study. Two patients were on NIV since the first study. The features of pseudo-obstructive SDB included a. paradoxical breathing before, after, and throughout the event, b. the absence of increased respiratory rate during the event, c. the absence of compensatory breath after the event with a return to baseline breathing. Pseudo-obstructive events were progressively more prevalent over time. The derived pseudo-obstructive AHI increased at each timepoint in all patients self-ventilating, whilst it dropped after NIV initiation/adjustments. Pseudo-obstructive SDB is prevalent in SMA type 2. Its number progresses along with the disease and is treatable with NIV. Prospective studies in larger SMA cohorts are planned."

Clinical examples from each category are provided to illustrate the spectrum of genetic myelopathies and their distinguishing features that aid in differentiating genetic myelopathies from potentially treatable acquired causes of myelopathy. Advances in genetic testing have vastly enhanced current knowledge of genetic myelopathies and the ability to diagnose and provide appropriate counseling to patients and their families. However, potential health care disparities in access to genetic testing is a topic that must be further explored. Although treatment for most of these conditions is typically supportive, there have been recent therapeutic breakthroughs in treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and Friedreich ataxia. Genetic myelopathies may present with chronic and progressive symptoms, a family history of similar symptoms, and involvement of other structures outside of the spinal cord. Imaging often shows spinal cord atrophy, but cord signal change is rare. Exclusion of reversible causes of myelopathy is a key step in the diagnosis. There are many different causes of genetic myelopathies, and in some cases, symptoms may overlap, which underscores the utility of genetic testing in confirming the precise underlying neurologic condition."

    "abstract": "Currently approved therapies for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) reverse the degenerative course, leading to better functional outcome, but they do not address the impairment arising from preexisting neurodegeneration. Apitegromab, an investigational, fully human monoclonal antibody, inhibits activation of myostatin (a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth), thereby preserving muscle mass. The phase 2 TOPAZ trial assessed the safety and efficacy of apitegromab in individuals with later-onset type 2 and type 3 SMA. In this study, designed to investigate potential meaningful combinations of eligibility and treatment regimen for future studies, participants aged 2-21 years received IV apitegromab infusions every 4 weeks for 12 months in 1 of 3 cohorts. Cohort 1 stratified ambulatory participants aged 5-21 years into 2 arms (apitegromab 20 mg/kg alone or in combination with nusinersen); cohort 2 evaluated apitegromab 20 mg/kg combined with nusinersen in nonambulatory participants aged 5-21 years; and cohort 3 blindly evaluated 2 randomized apitegromab doses (2 and 20 mg/kg) combined with nusinersen in younger participants ≥2 years of age. The primary efficacy measure was mean change from baseline using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale version appropriate for each cohort. Data were analyzed using a paired <i>t</i> test with 2-sided 5% type 1 error for the mean change from baseline for predefined cohort-specific primary efficacy end points. Fifty-eight participants (mean age 9.4 years) were enrolled at 16 trial sites in the United States and Europe. Participants had been treated with nusinersen for a mean of 25.9 months before enrollment in any of the 3 trial cohorts. At month 12, the mean change from baseline in Hammersmith scale score was -0.3 points (95% CI -2.1 to 1.4) in cohort 1 (n = 23), 0.6 points (-1.4 to 2.7) in cohort 2 (n = 15), and in cohort 3 (n = 20), the mean scores were 5.3 (-1.5 to 12.2) and 7.1 (1.8 to 12.5) for the 2-mg/kg (n = 8) and 20-mg/kg (n = 9) arms, respectively. The 5 most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were headache (24.1%), pyrexia (22.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (22.4%), cough (22.4%), and nasopharyngitis (20.7%). No deaths or serious adverse reactions were reported. Apitegromab led to improved motor function in participants with later-onset types 2 and 3 SMA. These results support a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of apitegromab in participants with SMA. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03921528). This study provides Class III evidence that apitegromab improves motor function in later-onset types 2 and 3 spinal muscular atrophy."

    "abstract": "Heterozygous carriers of the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene deletion in parents account for approximately 95% of neonatal spinal muscular atrophy cases. Given the severity of the disease, professional organizations have recommended periconceptional spinal muscular atrophy carrier screening to all couples, regardless of race or ethnicity. However, the prevalence of screening activities in mainland China remains suboptimal, mainly attributed to the limitations of the existing carrier screening methods. Herein, we aimed to develop a low-cost, accessible, and accurate carrier screening method based on duplex droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), to cover a wider population in developing countries, including China. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the cut-off value of SMN1 copy numbers. Performance validation was conducted for linearity, precision, and accuracy. In total, 482 cases were considered to validate the concordance between the developed ddPCR assay and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Linear correlations were excellent between the expected concentration of the reference gene and the observed values (R<sup>2</sup> > 0.99). Both the intra- and inter-assay precision of our ddPCR assays were less than 6.0%. The multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and ddPCR results were consistent in 480 of the 482 cases (99.6%). Two cases with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, suggestive of two copies of SMN1 exon 7, were classified into three copies by ddPCR analysis. The overall correct classification of the samples included in our ddPCR assay was 100%. This study demonstrates that an appropriate cut-off value is an important prerequisite for establishing a semi-quantitative method to determine the SMN1 copy numbers. Compared to conventional methods, our ddPCR assay is low-cost, highly accurate, and has full potential for application in population spinal muscular atrophy carriers screening."

    "abstract": "Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked recessive motor neuron disorder caused by the presence of ≥38 CAG repeats in the androgen receptor gene. Existing literature indicates a relationship between CAG repeat number and the onset age of some motor symptoms of SBMA. This review explores the effect of larger <i>versus</i> shorter CAG repeats on the age of weakness onset in male SBMA patients. Three databases (October 2021; MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Web of Science), Cambridge University Press, and Annals of Neurology were searched. 514 articles were initially identified, of which 13 were included for qualitative synthesis. Eleven of the thirteen articles identified a statistically significant inverse correlation between CAG repeat length and age of weakness onset in SBMA. Five studies indicated that SBMA patients with between 35 and 37 CAG repeats had an older age of weakness onset than patients with over 40 CAG repeats. The minimum number of CAG repeats associated with weakness was in the mid-to-late thirties. Identification of a relationship between CAG repeat number and age of weakness may enable earlier detection and intervention for SBMA. In the future, studies should use interviews, chart reviews, and standardized scoring methods to reduce effects of retrospective bias."

    "title": "Depletion of SMN protein in mesenchymal progenitors impairs the development of bone and neuromuscular junction in spinal muscular atrophy.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by the deficiency of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which leads to motor neuron dysfunction and muscle atrophy. In addition to the requirement for SMN in motor neurons, recent studies suggest that SMN deficiency in peripheral tissues plays a key role in the pathogenesis of SMA. Using limb mesenchymal progenitor cell (MPC)-specific SMN-depleted mouse models, we reveal that SMN reduction in limb MPCs causes defects in the development of bone and neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Specifically, these mice exhibited impaired growth plate homeostasis and reduced insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling from chondrocytes, rather than from the liver. Furthermore, the reduction of SMN in fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) resulted in abnormal NMJ maturation, altered release of neurotransmitters, and NMJ morphological defects. Transplantation of healthy FAPs rescued the morphological deterioration. Our findings highlight the significance of mesenchymal SMN in neuromusculoskeletal pathogenesis of SMA and provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting mesenchymal cells for the treatment of SMA."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy linked to chromosome 5 (SMA-5q) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in the <i>SMN1</i>. SMA-5q is characterized by progressive degeneration of the spinal cord and bulbar motor neurons, causing severe motor and respiratory impairment with reduced survival, especially in its more severe clinical forms. In recent years, highly effective disease-modifying therapies have emerged, either acting by regulating the splicing of exon 7 of the <i>SMN2</i> gene or adding a copy of the <i>SMN1</i> gene through gene therapy, providing a drastic change in the natural history of the disease. In this way, developing therapeutic guides and expert consensus becomes essential to direct the use of these therapies in clinical practice. This consensus, prepared by Brazilian experts, aimed to review the main available disease-modifying therapies, critically analyze the results of clinical studies, and provide recommendations for their use in clinical practice for patients with SMA-5q. This consensus also addresses aspects related to diagnosis, genetic counseling, and follow-up of patients under drug treatment. Thus, this consensus provides valuable information regarding the current management of SMA-5q, helping therapeutic decisions in clinical practice and promoting additional gains in outcomes."

    "abstract": "To explore the genetic etiology of two children with Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1), and prevent the recurrence of birth defects. Two unrelated families who had visited the Obstetrics and Gynecology Medical Center of Drum Tower Hospital from August to November 2021 were selected as the study subjects. Copy number of SMN1 gene exon 7 for the probands and their parents was detected by multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). and whole exome sequencing (WES) was carried out to screen the variants in the probands. Sanger sequencing was used to validate the variants within the families. Pathogenicity of the variants were predicted by bioinformatic analysis. Based on the results, prenatal diagnosis was performed for the fetuses. Both probands were found to harbor compound heterozygous variants of the IGHMBP2 gene, which were inherited from their parents. Among these, c.1144C>T, c.866delG and c.1666C>G were previously unreported and respectively classified as pathogenic variant (PVS1+PM2_Supporting+PP3+PP4), likely pathogenic variant (PM1+PM2_Supporting+PM4+PP3+PP4) and likely pathogenic variant (PM1+PM2_Supporting+PP2+PP3+PP4) based on the ACMG guidelines. Through preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic (PGT-M) and interventional prenatal diagnosis, transmission of the variants within the families was successfully blocked. The SMARD1 in both children may be attributed to the compound heterozygous variants of the IGHMBP2 gene, which has facilitated the genetic diagnosis and counselling, and provided reference for delineating the molecular pathogenesis of this disease."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the effect of 4 loading doses of nusinersen on motor function and quality of life (QoL) in adult patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Twenty-one adult patients with genetically confirmed SMA who were treated with 4 loading doses of nusinersen were included in this study. All patients were evaluated with the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE), and the Short Form Survey-36 (SF-36) at baseline (V1) and before the first nusinersen maintenance treatment, which was at the 15th month of treatment (V2). The SF-36 score was compared between the patients and 35 age-matched healthy controls. Of the twenty-one patients with a median age of 36 years, 10 were nonambulatory, and 11 were ambulatory. The physical component score and the mental component score of the SF-36 were significantly lower in the SMA patient group at baseline than in the healthy group. The median HFMSE scores significantly improved at V2 in both ambulatory and nonambulatory SMA patients (p < 0.05). The median MRC score significantly increased at V2 in the ambulatory SMA patient group (p = 0.04) but not in the nonambulatory SMA patient group (p = 0.19). There was a significant improvement in physical QoL in all the SMA patients at V2 (p = 0.02), but there was no significant improvement in mental QoL (p = 0.15). The loading nusinersen treatment significantly improved motor function scores, muscle strength, and physical QoL."

This study assessed Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) compared to Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) for detecting Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) through SMN1 gene copy number analysis in a Turkish cohort. We analyzed 249 DNA samples, previously tested for SMN1 and SMN2 gene deletion via MLPA, using qRT-PCR kits from three different companies. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of qRT-PCR in identifying deletions of SMN1 copy number variations. High accuracy (96.2-98.7%) achieved with qRT-PCR for detecting homozygous deletions, heterozygous deletions, and copy number variations in the SMN1 gene. Minor discrepancies between qRT-PCR and MLPA were observed, possibly due to single nucleotide polymorphisms affecting primer binding. The qRT-PCR method proved to be a rapid, cost-effective, and accurate technique, aligning well with the demands of routine SMA screening, suggesting its general suitability for application in SMA screening programs. This research highlights the importance of improving molecular methodologies and the value of collaborations between government and relevant sectors to overcome rare diseases, particularly through the enhancement of screening initiatives which is the first and most effective strategy to protect the public health."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of different types of poliovirus vaccines. A randomized, blinded, single-center, parallel-controlled design was employed, and 360 infants aged ≥ 2 months were selected as study subjects. They were randomly assigned to bOPV group (oral Sabin vaccine) and sIPV group (Sabin strain inactivated polio vaccine), with 180 infants in each group. Adverse reaction events in the vaccinated subjects were recorded. The micro-neutralization test using cell culture was conducted to determine the geometric mean titer (GMT) of neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus types I, II, and III in different groups, and the seroconversion rates were calculated. Both groups exhibited a 100% seropositivity rate after booster immunization. The titers of neutralizing antibodies for the three types were predominantly distributed within the range of 1:128 to 1:512. The fold increase of type I antibodies differed markedly between the two groups (P < 0.05). Moreover, the fold increase of type II and type III antibodies for poliovirus differed slightly between the two groups (P > 0.05). The fourfold increase rate in sIPV group was drastically superior to that in bOPV group (P < 0.05). When comparing the post-immunization GMT levels of type I antibodies in individuals who completed the full course of spinal muscular atrophy vaccination, bOPV group showed greatly inferior levels to sIPV group (P < 0.05). For type II and type III antibodies, individuals in bOPV group demonstrated drastically superior post-immunization GMT levels to those in sIPV group (P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions between the bOPV and sIPV groups differed slightly (P > 0.05). These findings indicated that both the oral vaccine and inactivated vaccine had good safety and immunogenicity in infants aged ≥ 2 months. The sIPV group generated higher levels of neutralizing antibodies in serum, particularly evident in the post-immunization GMT levels for types II and III."

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are well-suited to serve as gene transfer vectors. Onasemnogene abeparvovec uses AAV9 as virus vector. Previous exposure to wild-type AAVs or placental transfer of maternal AAV antibodies, however, can trigger an immune response to the vector virus which may limit the therapeutic effectiveness of gene transfer and impact safety. We present the case of a female patient with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and three survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene copies. The infant had elevated titers of AAV9 antibodies at diagnosis at 9 days of age. Being presymptomatic at diagnosis, it was decided to retest the patient's AAV9 antibody titer at two-weekly intervals. Six weeks after initial diagnosis, a titer of 1:12.5 allowed treatment with onasemnogene abeparvovec. The presented case demonstrates that, provided the number of SMN2 gene copies and the absence of symptoms allow, onasemnogene abeparvovec therapy is feasible in patients with initially exclusionary AAV9 antibody titers of >1:50."

    "abstract": "Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R1 (LGMDR1) calpain 3-related usually presents as a recessively transmitted weakness of proximal limb-girdle muscles due to pathogenic variants in the CAPN3 gene. Pathogenic variants in this gene have also been found in patients with an autosomal dominantly inherited transmission pattern (LGMDD4). The mechanism underlying this difference in transmission patterns has not yet been elucidated. Camptocormia, progressive limb weakness, myalgia, back pain, and increased CK levels are common clinical features associated with dominant forms. The p.Lys254del pathogenic variant was associated with camptocormia in two LGMDD4 families. This study aimed to present carriers found in recessively transmitted LGMDR1 families bearing the p.Lys254del variant that do not show muscle weakness. DNA sequencing was performed on exon 5 of CAPN3 in family members to establish the carrier status of the pathogenic variant. They were evaluated clinically and MRI was performed when available. Two families presented with the p.Lys254del pathogenic variant in a homozygous or compound heterozygous state. Family members carrying only the pathogenic variant in the heterozygous state did not demonstrate the myopathic characteristics described in dominant patients. Camptocormia and other severe clinical symptoms were not observed. We conclude that the p.Lys254del pathogenic variant per se cannot be solely responsible for camptocormia in dominant patients. Other undisclosed factors may regulate the phenotype associated with the dominant inheritance pattern in CAPN3 pathogenic variant carriers."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess early language acquisitions in treated individuals with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 and in infants identified by newborn screening (NBS). Parents of SMA individuals aged between 8 and 36 months were asked to fill in the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MB-CDI) that assesses comprehension, gesture and expressive skills. A follow-up assessment was performed in 21 of the 36. The MB-CDI was completed by parents of 24 type 1 and 12 infants identified by NBS. Comprehension skills were preserved in 81% of the type 1 SMA and in 87% infants identified by NBS. Gesture abilities were <5th centile in 55% of the type 1 SMA and in none of those identified by NBS. Lexical expressions were <5th centile in more than 80% type 1 SMA and in 50% of infants identified by NBS. At follow-up, despite an increase in lexical expression skills, the scores remained below the fifth centile in 43% type 1 SMA and in 86% of infants identified by NBS. These results suggest that language and communication development may follow a similar pattern to that observed in motor function with the possibility to develop skills (eg, ability to say clear words) that are not usually present in untreated infants but with a level of performance that does not reach that of their typically developing peers."

    "abstract": "Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked disorder that affects males who inherit the androgen receptor (AR) gene with an abnormal CAG triplet repeat expansion. The resulting protein contains an elongated polyglutamine (polyQ) tract and causes motor neuron degeneration in an androgen-dependent manner. The precise molecular sequelae of SBMA are unclear. To assist with its investigation and the identification of therapeutic options, we report here a new model of SBMA in Drosophila melanogaster. We generated transgenic flies that express the full-length, human AR with a wild-type or pathogenic polyQ repeat. Each transgene is inserted into the same safe harbor site on the third chromosome of the fly as a single copy and in the same orientation. Expression of pathogenic AR, but not of its wild-type variant, in neurons or muscles leads to consistent, progressive defects in longevity and motility that are concomitant with polyQ-expanded AR protein aggregation and reduced complexity in neuromuscular junctions. Additional assays show adult fly eye abnormalities associated with the pathogenic AR species. The detrimental effects of pathogenic AR are accentuated by feeding flies the androgen, dihydrotestosterone. This new, robust SBMA model can be a valuable tool toward future investigations of this incurable disease."

A staged screening procedure was used to perform carrier screening for SMA in 22,913 Chinese reproductive age women between 2019 and 2022 in Shenzhen area of China. First, the copy number of exon 7 in the SMN1 gene were detected in women of reproductive age using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. If SMA carriers were detected, their spouses were then recommended to test. Prenatal diagnosis was carried out in couples who were both carriers. A total of 389 women were found to be SMA carriers (1.70%, 95% CI: 1.53%-1.87%), indicating the carrier prevalence was approximately 1:59. Despite the proportion of nonpregnant women increased from 37.96% in 2019 to 58.18% in 2022 (p < 0.05) among the 22,913 reproductive age women, the recall rate of spouses was still not high (62.21%, 95% CI: 57.39%-67.03%). Eight partners were found to be SMA carriers and two fetuses were determined to have SMA with no copies of the SMN1 gene. Although the acceptability and awareness of SMA carrier screening in Chinese population has increased in recent years, it still fails to reach the ideal expectation. Our experience may provide a basis for and facilitate the popularization of SMA carrier screening in Shenzhen area."

SMA is prevalent in Ghanaian children, though not widely reported. Cases are likely missed or misdiagnosed due to lack of expertise and investigations. Newborn screening is not currently available in Ghana. The management remains supportive as newly approved genetic modifications therapies are currently not available. We present a retrospective folder review of children attending a tertiary pediatric neurology clinic who were diagnosed with SMA and confirmed by molecular genetic testing. Between January 2018 and August 2021, five (5) children from three families had molecular genetic tests confirming their diagnosis of SMA. Three (3) children had SMA I phenotype while 2 had SMA III phenotype. Two (2) of the 3 children with SMA I died from respiratory complications. The last surviving child with SMA I was diagnosed through newborn screening program overseas and received gene modification therapy. Careful history and physical examination remain the best approach to diagnosis as confirmatory genetic testing and supplemental investigations are not readily available. The current management of the children with SMA in Ghana include respiratory care, physiotherapy, and genetic counselling. Genetic modification therapies are currently not available."

Since the enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of serotonin and dopamine, its deficiency determines the lack of these neurotransmitters, but also of norepinephrine and epinephrine. Onset is early and the key signs are hypotonia, movement disorders (oculogyric crises, dystonia and hypokinesia), developmental delay and autonomic dysfunction. Taiwan is the site of a potential founder variant (IVS6+4A>T) with a predicted incidence of 1/32,000 births, while only 261 patients with this deficit have been described worldwide. Actually, the number of affected persons could be greater, given that the spectrum of clinical manifestations is broad and still little known. In our study we selected 350 unrelated patients presenting with different neurological disorders including heterogeneous neuromuscular disorders, cognitive deficit, behavioral disorders and autism spectrum disorder, for which the underlying etiology had not yet been identified. Molecular investigation of the <i>DDC</i> gene was carried out with the aim of identifying affected patients and/or carriers. Our study shows a high frequency of carriers (2.57%) in Sicilian subjects with neurological deficits, with a higher concentration in northern and eastern Sicily. Assuming these data as representative of the general Sicilian population, the risk may be comparable to some rare diseases included in the newborn screening programs such as spinal muscular atrophy, cystic fibrosis and phenylketonuria."

    "title": "Unilateral Biportal Endoscopy for Lumbar Spinal Stenosis and Lumbar Disc Herniation.",
    "abstract": "Unilateral biportal endoscopy (UBE) is a novel minimally invasive technique for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis and lumbar disc herniations. Uniportal endoscopy was utilized prior to the advent of UBE and has been considered the workhorse of endoscopic spine surgery (ESS) for lumbar discectomy and decompressive laminectomy. However, there are theoretical advantages to UBE compared with traditional uniportal endoscopy, including that the procedure utilizes typical spinal equipment that should be readily available, requires less capital cost and optical instrumentation, and provides greater operative flexibility as a result of utilizing both a working and a viewing portal<sup>7,8</sup>. A 0-degree arthroscope is typically utilized for discectomy and lumbar laminectomies. The use of a radiofrequency ablator is critical to help coagulate osseous and muscle bleeders. For irrigation, gravity or a low-pressure pump, typically <40 mm Hg, can be utilized<sup>9,10</sup>. Further details regarding irrigation pressure are provided in \"Important Tips.\" The use of a standard powered burr is typical to help osseous decompression, and Kerrison ronguers, pituitaries, osteotomes, and probes utilized in open or tubular cases suffice. Two incisions are made approximately 1 cm lateral to the midline. If working from the left side for a right-handed surgeon, the working portal is typically made at the lower laminar margin of the target level. The camera portal is then made typically 2 to 3 cm cephalad. A lateral radiograph is then utilized to confirm the portal placements. From the right side, the working portal is cephalad and the camera portal is caudal. Because of the switch, the portals may be shifted more distally.The first step is creating a working space because there is no true joint space in the spine. With use of radiofrequency ablation, a working space is created in the interlaminar space. Next, with use of a powered burr or a chiseled osteotomy, the base of the cephalad spinous process is thinned until the insertion of the ligamentum flavum is found. Next, the ipsilateral and contralateral laminae are thinned in a similar fashion. Once the osseous elements are removed, the ligamentum flavum is removed en bloc. The traversing nerve roots are checked under direct high-magnification visualization to ensure that they are decompressed. If a discectomy is necessary, standard nerve-root retractors can be utilized to retract the neural elements. With use of a blunt-tip elevator, the anular defect can be incised and the herniated disc can be removed under direct high-power visualization. In addition, a small curet can be utilized to create a defect in the weakened anulus or membrane covering the extruded disc material in order to help deliver the herniated disc material. Epidural veins are coagulated typically with use of a fine-point bipolar radiofrequency device. Nonoperative treatments include oral anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, and epidural injections; if these fail, alternative surgical treatments include open lumbar laminectomy and/or discectomy, tubular lumbar laminectomy and/or discectomy, and other minimally invasive techniques, such as microendoscopy, uniportal endoscopy, and microscopy-assisted decompression. UBE is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that better preserves osseous and muscular structure compared with open and tubular techniques. Conventional lumbar laminectomy involves dissection and retraction of the multifidus muscle from the spinous process to the facet joint. This exposure can damage the delicate posterior dorsal rami. Long retraction time can also lead to pressure-induced muscle atrophy and potentially increased chronic low back pain. Alternatively, smaller incisions and shorter hospital stays are possible with UBE.Similar to UBE, tubular surgery can minimize soft-tissue damage compared with open techniques; however, in a randomized trial assessing techniques for spinal stenosis surgery, Kang et al. found that UBE and tubular surgery had similarly favorable clinical outcomes at 6 months postoperatively but UBE resulted in decreased operative time, drain output, opiate use, and length of hospital stay<sup>5</sup>.Furthermore, the use of an endoscope in the biportal technique allows ultra-high magnification of the spinal pathology, decreased capital costs, and the ability to use 2 hands with freedom of movement. UBE provides clear visualization of the neural elements while keeping maximal ergonomic efficiency with the surgeon's head looking straight forward, the shoulders relaxed, and the elbows bent to 90°. Continuous irrigation through the endoscope also helps with bleeding and decreasing the risk of infection. Long-term outcomes do not differ substantially between discectomies performed with use of the presently described technique and procedures done with more traditional minimally invasive (i.e., tubular) techniques; however, visual analogue scale scores for back pain may be better in the short term, and there is evidence of a shorter hospital stay with UBE<sup>2</sup>. Complication rates did not differ from other minimally invasive techniques. When comparing UBE and stenosis, Aygun and Abdulshafi found that UBE was associated with decreased hospital stays, operative time, and blood loss and better clinical outcomes up to 2 years postoperatively compared with tubular laminectomy<sup>12</sup>. The optimal hydrostatic pressure is 30 to 50 mm Hg. Pressure is determined by the distance between the fluid source and the working space. Because the working space does not change, the height of the bag decides pressure. A simple formula for pressure is calculated by dividing the distance from the working field to the irrigation source by 1.36. A rule of thumb is that if the bag is 50 to 70 cm above the patient's back, the pressure should be adequate. The advantages of using gravity rather than a pressure pump are that excessive fluid solution pressure in the epidural space can cause neurological issues such as nuchal pain, headache, and seizure<sup>11</sup>. Additionally, if the intertransverse membrane or the lateral margins of the disc are violated, hydroperitoneum can occur unknowingly due to the high-pressure system.Gravity or pump pressure of >40 mm Hg may elevate epidural pressure and mask operative bleeding. When the pump is turned off at the end of the surgical procedure, a postoperative epidural hematoma may occur because the bleeding source may not have been recognized while the pump pressure was on.Excessive pump pressure may lead to an increase in intracranial pressure, causing headache or delayed recovery from general anesthesia with stiff posture and hyperventilation.Make sure fluid is emerging from the working portal and the muscle area is not swelling to prevent soft-tissue fluid extravasation.Epidural veins are coagulated typically with a fine-point bipolar radiofrequency device.Osseous bleeding can be controlled with bone wax or a high-speed burr.

    "abstract": "In 2017, a new treatment by nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide delivered by repeated intrathecal injections, became available for patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), whereas clinical trials had mainly involved children. Since 2020, the oral, selective SMN2-splicing modifier risdiplam has been available with restrictions evolving with time. In this peculiar context of lack of data regarding adult patients, many questions were raised to define the indications of treatment and the appropriate follow-up in this population. To homogenize access to treatment in France, a national multidisciplinary team meeting dedicated to adult SMA patients, named SMA multidisciplinary team meeting, (SMDTs) was created in 2018. Our objective was to analyze the value of SMDTs in the decision-making process in SMA adult patients and to provide guidelines about treatment. From October 2020 to September 2021, data extracted from the SMDT reports were collected. The primary outcome was the percentage of cases in which recommendations on validating treatment plans were given. The secondary outcomes were type of treatment requested, description of expectations regarding treatment and description of recommendations or follow-up and discontinuation. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Comparisons between the type of treatment requested were performed using Mann-Whitney test or the Student t test for quantitative data and the Fisher's exact test or the χ<sup>2</sup> test for qualitative data. Cases of 107 patients were discussed at the SMDTs with a mean age of 35.3 (16-62). Forty-seven were SMA type 2, and 57 SMA type 3. Twelve cases were presented twice. Out of 122 presentations to the SMDTs, most of requests related to the initiation of a treatment (nusinersen (n = 46), risdiplam (n = 54), treatment without mentioning preferred choice (n = 5)) or a switch of treatment (n = 12). Risdiplam requests concerned significantly older patients (p = 0.002), mostly SMA type 2 (p < 0.0001), with greater disease severity in terms of motor and respiratory function compared to requests for nusinersen. In the year prior to presentation to the SMDTs, most of the patients experienced worsening of motor weakness assessed by functional tests as MFM32 or other meaningful scales for the most severe patients. Only 12% of the patients discussed had a stable condition. Only 49/122 patients (40.1%) expressed clear expectations regarding treatment. The treatment requested was approved by the SMDTs in 72 patients (67.2%). The most common reasons to decline treatment were lack of objective data on the disease course prior discussion to the SMDTs or inappropriate patient's expectations. Treatment requests were more likely to be validated by the SMDTs if sufficient pre-therapeutic functional assessment had been performed to assess the natural history (55% vs. 32%) and if the patient had worsening rather than stable motor function (p = 0.029). In patients with approved treatment, a-priori criteria to define a further ineffectiveness of treatment (usually after 14 months of treatment) were proposed for 67/72 patients. In the context of costly treatments with few controlled studies in adults with SMA, in whom assessment of efficacy can be complex, SMDTs are 'real-world observatories' of great interest to establish national recommendations about indications of treatment and follow-up."

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy was the most common inherited cause of infant death until 2016, when three therapies became available: the antisense oligonucleotide nusinersen, gene replacement therapy with onasemnogene abeparvovec, and the small-molecule splicing modifier risdiplam. These drugs compensate for deficient survival motor neuron protein and have improved lifespan and quality of life in infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy. Given the lifelong implications of these innovative therapies, ways to detect and manage treatment-modified disease characteristics are needed. All three drugs are more effective when given before development of symptoms, or as early as possible in individuals who have already developed symptoms. Early subtle symptoms might be missed, and disease onset might occur in utero in severe spinal muscular atrophy subtypes; in some countries, newborn screening is allowing diagnosis soon after birth and early treatment. Adults with spinal muscular atrophy report stabilisation of disease and less fatigue with treatment. These subjective benefits need to be weighed against the high costs of the drugs to patients and health-care systems. Clinical consensus is required on therapeutic windows and on outcome measures and biomarkers that can be used to monitor drug benefit, toxicity, and treatment-modified disease characteristics."

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapies have shown promise as novel treatments for rare genetic disorders such as hemophilia A and spinal muscular atrophy. However, cellular immune responses mediated by cytotoxic (CD8<sup>+</sup>) and helper (CD4<sup>+</sup>) T cells may target vector-transduced cells as well as healthy immune cells, impacting safety and efficacy. In this study, we describe the optimization and reproducibility of interferon-γ (IFNγ)-based and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assays for measuring T cell responses against AAV peptide antigens. For method optimization, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy human donors and stimulated with commercially available major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II-specific peptides as positive controls. Peptide pools were designed from published AAV8 and AAV9 capsid protein sequences and then used to assess the presence of AAV-specific T cell responses. Our results demonstrate a measurable increase in IFNγ and IL-2-producing cells after AAV peptide presentation. Furthermore, there was an observed difference in the magnitude and specificity of response to peptide pools based on AAV serotype and donor. Finally, using individual peptides, we identified a region of the AAV9 capsid protein that can elicit an immunogenic response. This work shows the applicability of ELISpot in assessing anti-AAV immune responses and provides insight into how novel recombinant AAV vectors could be designed to reduce immunogenic potential."

    "title": "Autophagy in spinal muscular atrophy: from pathogenic mechanisms to therapeutic approaches.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating neuromuscular disorder caused by the depletion of the ubiquitously expressed survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. While the genetic cause of SMA has been well documented, the exact mechanism(s) by which SMN depletion results in disease progression remain elusive. A wide body of evidence has highlighted the involvement and dysregulation of autophagy in SMA. Autophagy is a highly conserved lysosomal degradation process which is necessary for cellular homeostasis; defects in the autophagic machinery have been linked with a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The pathway is particularly known to prevent neurodegeneration and has been suggested to act as a neuroprotective factor, thus presenting an attractive target for novel therapies for SMA patients. In this review, (a) we provide for the first time a comprehensive summary of the perturbations in the autophagic networks that characterize SMA development, (b) highlight the autophagic regulators which may play a key role in SMA pathogenesis and (c) propose decreased autophagic flux as the causative agent underlying the autophagic dysregulation observed in these patients."

    "title": "Aging, Neurodegenerative Disorders, and Cerebellum.",
    "abstract": "An important part of the central nervous system (CNS), the cerebellum is involved in motor control, learning, reflex adaptation, and cognition. Diminished cerebellar function results in the motor and cognitive impairment observed in patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), and multiple sclerosis (MS), and even during the normal aging process. In most neurodegenerative disorders, impairment mainly occurs as a result of morphological changes over time, although during the early stages of some disorders such as AD, the cerebellum also serves a compensatory function. Biological aging is accompanied by changes in cerebellar circuits, which are predominantly involved in motor control. Despite decades of research, the functional contributions of the cerebellum and the underlying molecular mechanisms in aging and neurodegenerative disorders remain largely unknown. Therefore, this review will highlight the molecular and cellular events in the cerebellum that are disrupted during the process of aging and the development of neurodegenerative disorders. We believe that deeper insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of the cerebellum during aging and the development of neurodegenerative disorders will be essential for the design of new effective strategies for neuroprotection and the alleviation of some neurodegenerative disorders."

    "title": "Immp2l Enhances the Structure and Function of Mitochondrial Gpd2 Dehydrogenase.",
    "abstract": "'Inner mitochondrial membrane peptidase 2 like' (IMMP2L) is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial peptidase that has been conserved through evolutionary history, as has its target enzyme, 'mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase 2' (GPD2). IMMP2L is known to cleave the mitochondrial transit peptide from GPD2 and another nuclear-encoded mitochondrial respiratory-related protein, cytochrome C1 (CYC1). However, it is not known whether IMMP2L peptidase activates or alters the activity or respiratory-related functions of GPD2 or CYC1. Previous investigations found compelling evidence of behavioural change in the <i>Immp2l<sup>KD</sup></i>-/- KO mouse, and in this study, EchoMRI analysis found that the organs of the <i>Immp2l<sup>KD</sup></i>-/- KO mouse were smaller and that the KO mouse had significantly less lean mass and overall body weight compared with wildtype littermates (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Moreover, all organs analysed from the <i>Immp2l<sup>KD</sup></i>-/- KO had lower relative levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitoROS). The kidneys of the <i>Immp2l<sup>KD</sup></i>-/- KO mouse displayed the greatest decrease in mitoROS levels that were over 50% less compared with wildtype litter mates. Mitochondrial respiration was also lowest in the kidney of the <i>Immp2l<sup>KD</sup></i>-/- KO mouse compared with other tissues when using succinate as the respiratory substrate, whereas respiration was similar to the wildtype when glutamate was used as the substrate. When glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) was used as the substrate for Gpd2, we observed ~20% and ~7% respective decreases in respiration in female and male <i>Immp2l<sup>KD</sup></i>-/- KO mice over time. Together, these findings indicate that the respiratory-related functions of mGpd2 and Cyc1 have been compromised to different degrees in different tissues and genders of the <i>Immp2l<sup>KD</sup></i>-/- KO mouse. Structural analyses using AlphaFold2-Multimer further predicted that the interaction between Cyc1 and mitochondrial-encoded cytochrome b (Cyb) in Complex III had been altered, as had the homodimeric structure of the mGpd2 enzyme within the inner mitochondrial membrane of the <i>Immp2l<sup>KD</sup></i>-/- KO mouse. mGpd2 functions as an integral component of the glycerol phosphate shuttle (GPS), which positively regulates both mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. Interestingly, we found that nonmitochondrial respiration (NMR) was also dramatically lowered in the <i>Immp2l<sup>KD</sup></i>-/- KO mouse. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines derived from the <i>Immp2l<sup>KD</sup></i>-/- KO mouse displayed a ~27% decrease in total respiration, comprising a ~50% decrease in NMR and a ~12% decrease in total mitochondrial respiration, where the latter was consistent with the cumulative decreases in substrate-specific mediated mitochondrial respiration reported here. This study is the first to report the role of Immp2l in enhancing Gpd2 structure and function, mitochondrial respiration, nonmitochondrial respiration, organ size and homeostasis."

    "abstract": "The inherited disease community in Sri Lanka has been widely neglected. This article aimed to present accumulated knowledge in establishing a pro bono cost-effective national, island-wide, free-of-charge molecular diagnostic service, suggesting a model for other developing countries. The project provided 637 molecular diagnostic tests and reports free of charge to a nation with limited resources. We pioneered the implementation of mobile clinics and home visits, where the research team acted as barefoot doctors with the concept of the doctor and the researcher at the patient's doorstep. Establishing pro bono, cost-effective molecular diagnostics is feasible in developing countries with limited resources and state funding through the effort of dedicated postgraduate students. This service could provide an accurate molecular diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Huntington's disease, Spinocerebellar ataxia, and Spinal muscular atrophy, a diagnostic yield of 54% (343/637), of which 43% (147/343) of the patients identified as amenable for available gene therapies. Initiated human resource development by double doctoral degree opportunities with international collaborations. Established a neurobiobank and a national registry in Sri Lanka, a rich and unique repository, wealth creation for translational collaborative research and sharing of information in neurological diseases, as well as a lodestar for aspiring initiatives from other developing countries."

We sought to describe patients with SMA treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec monotherapy in the real-world setting. RESTORE is a prospective, multicenter, multinational, observational registry that captures data from a variety of sources. Recruitment started in September 2018. As of May 23, 2022, data were available for 168 patients treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec monotherapy. Median (IQR) age at initial SMA diagnosis was 1 (0-6) month and at onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion was 3 (1-10) months. Eighty patients (47.6%) had two and 70 (41.7%) had three copies of SMN2, and 98 (58.3%) were identified by newborn screening. Infants identified by newborn screening had a lower age at final assessment (mean age 11.5 months) and greater mean final (SD) CHOP INTEND score (57.0 [10.0] points) compared with clinically diagnosed patients (23.1 months; 52.1 [8.0] points). All patients maintained/achieved motor milestones. 48.5% (n = 81/167) experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (AE), and 31/167 patients (18.6%) experienced at least one serious AE, of which 8/31 were considered treatment-related. These real-world outcomes support findings from the interventional trial program and demonstrate effectiveness of onasemnogene abeparvovec over a large patient population, which was consistent with initial clinical data and published 5-year follow-up data. Observed AEs were consistent with the established safety profile of onasemnogene abeparvovec."

    "abstract": "Dysphagia is common in adults living with neuromuscular disease (NMD). Increased life expectancy, secondary to improvements in standards of care, requires the recognition and treatment of dysphagia with an increased priority. Evidence to support the establishment of healthcare pathways is, however, lacking. The experiences of people living with NMD (pplwNMD) and their caregivers are valuable to guide targeted, value-based healthcare. To generate preliminary considerations for neuromuscular dysphagia care and future research in the United Kingdom, based on the experiences of those living with, or caring for, people with NMD. Two surveys (one for adults living with NMD and dysphagia, and a second for caregivers) were co-designed with an advisory group of people living with NMD. Surveys were electronically distributed to adults living with NMD and their caregivers between 18th May and 26th July 2020. Distribution was through UK disease registries, charity websites, newsletters, and social media. Adults living with NMD receive little information or education that they are likely to develop swallowing difficulties. Most respondents report wanting this information prior to developing these difficulties. Difficulties with swallowing food and medication are common in this group, and instrumental assessment is considered a helpful assessment tool. Both adults living with NMD and caregivers want earlier access to neuromuscular swallowing specialists and training in how best to manage their difficulties. Improvement is needed in the dysphagia healthcare pathway for adults living with NMD to help mitigate any profound physical and psychological consequences that may be caused by dysphagia. Education about swallowing difficulties and early referral to a neuromuscular swallowing specialist are important to pplwNMD and their caregivers. Further research is required to better understand the experiences of pplwNMD and their caregivers to inform the development of dysphagia healthcare pathways."

    "abstract": "Loss of the <i>Survival Motor Neuron (SMN)</i> gene inevitably leads to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), one of the most common fatal neuromuscular diseases in children with FDA and EMA approved therapies. However, the cellular mechanisms leading to neuromuscular junction (NMJ) dysfunction due to impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in the presynaptic compartment remain largely unexplained. In the last decade, the so-called SMA modifiers have gained attention. The F-actin bundler Plastin 3 (PLS3) is one of them and counteracts neurotransmission defects, including altered vesicle endocytosis, in Smn-deficient NMJs. Properly bundled F-actin is the basis for the translocation and arrangement of transmembrane proteins at the cell surface. Our recently published data by Hennlein et al., J Cell Biol. (2023) clearly showed that Smn deficiency impairs the F-actin dependent translocation of the high-affinity BDNF receptor TrkB to the cell surface resulting in reduced BDNF-mediated TrkB activation in motor axon terminals. Strikingly, the overexpression of PLS3 restores TrkB availability, and significantly improves the clustering of the active zone-associated voltage-gated calcium channel Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2 in growth cones of Smn-deficient motoneurons. These observations raise the question of how PLS3 mediates the proper cell surface localization and cluster-like formation of Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2 in motor axon terminals."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy holds promise as a life-changing option for individuals with genetic variants that give rise to disease. FDA-approved gene therapies for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, β-Thalassemia, hemophilia A/B, retinal dystrophy, and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy have generated buzz around the ability to change the course of genetic syndromes. However, this excitement risks over-expansion into areas of genetic disease that may not fit the current state of gene therapy. While in situ (targeted to an area) and ex vivo (removal of cells, delivery, and administration of cells) approaches show promise, they have a limited target ability. Broader in vivo gene therapy trials have shown various continued challenges, including immune response, use of immune suppressants correlating to secondary infections, unknown outcomes of overexpression, and challenges in driving tissue-specific corrections. Viral delivery systems can be associated with adverse outcomes such as hepatotoxicity and lethality if uncontrolled. In some cases, these risks are far outweighed by the potentially lethal syndromes for which these systems are being developed. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the field of genetic diseases to perform cost-benefit analyses for gene therapy. In this work, we present the current state while setting forth tools and resources to guide informed directions to avoid foreseeable issues in gene therapy that could prevent the field from continued success."

It can be caused by mutations in at least 12 genes, with the <i>nebulin</i> (<i>NEB</i>) gene being the most common. Here, we present the first case of a neonate with nemaline myopathy from Al-Qunfudhah, Saudi Arabia. A full-term baby boy was delivered via cesarean section due to decreased fetal movement. The baby was covered with a thick meconium stain. He was born with severe distress and underwent an endotracheal tube placement. The baby presented generalized muscle weakness, hypotonia, and areflexia. Examination revealed arthrogryposis, bilateral small chin, undescended testicle, joint deformity, hip dislocation, and clubfoot. Chest examination revealed conducting sound and bilateral equal air entry. Moreover, he experienced bilateral chest wheeze and conducting sound. All laboratory tests were normal, and whole-exome sequencing revealed pathogenic homozygous splice acceptor variant <i>NEB</i> gene c.8889+1G˃A. The patient was first suspected to have spinal muscular atrophy as there was no previous nemaline myopathy case reported from Al-Qunfudhah. However, the typical symptoms and genetic sequencing confirmed his condition. As the society in Al-Qunfudhah is known for consanguinity, as in our case, clinicians should identify other types of myopathy as it is expected to occur in further cases."

Our aim was to examine the relationship between motor function, strength, and hand/finger mobility of the upper limb in treatment-naïve children with SMA Types 2 and 3 to assess new methods to supplement current outcomes. The Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), grip and pinch strength, and hand/finger mobility data were collected from 19 children with SMA Types 2 and 3 aged 5.2-16.9 years over a year. A median loss between 0.5 and 2.5 points in the RULM was seen across all SMA subgroups with the biggest median loss recorded between 10 and 14 years of age. The grip strength loss was -0.06 kg (-4.69 to 3.49; IQR, 1.21); pinch improvement of 0.05 (-0.65 to 1.27; IQR, 0.48); hand/finger mobility test improvement of 4 points (-24 to 14; IQR, 6.75) for the whole cohort. Significant correlations were found between the RULM and grip strength (p < .001), RULM and pinch strength (p < .001), RULM and revised Brooke (p < .001), grip strength and pinch strength (p < .001). The combined use of the RULM, dynamometry, and hand mobility provide insight about correlations between function and strength in children with SMA. The RULM and grip strength assessments captured a significant decline in upper limb function, whereas the pinch and finger/hand mobility showed an improvement over the course of 1 year and these results should be considered for future studies."

    "abstract": "Until recently, the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) was limited to symptomatic treatment with no cure. Three innovative drugs, nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec (OA), and risdiplam have been developed to treat SMA. Although the clinical trials for these drugs have demonstrated their efficacy, there is limited information on real world treatment strategies. In this study, we present a case of a male infant with SMA type 1 who underwent OA treatment after nusinersen treatment. At 4 months of age, the patient was diagnosed with SMA type 1. At 6 months of age, nusinersen treatment was initiated. His motor function improved, but the effect was limited; therefore, his parents requested gene replacement therapy. During the preparation for OA treatment, anti-adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) antibody tests repeatedly showed non-specific reactions, which delayed initiation of treatment. The patient was put on ventilator management after he caught a common cold. During this management, the anti-AAV9 antibody test results were negative. Furthermore, the patient showed increased transaminase levels just before OA treatment; however, since these gradually decreased without signs of liver failure, we started OA treatment at 13 months of age. Four months later, the patient began to sit without support and was weaned from non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, although nasogastric tube feeding remained partially necessary. We believe that the management of unstable SMA type 1 symptoms, anti-AAV9 antibody testing, and changes in transaminase levels will be helpful for other patients with SMA who require treatment."

The pathophysiology remains not entirely understood, complicating standardized operative guidelines; however, some studies report favorable outcomes with internal fixation. We report a successful surgically treated case of pediatric Hirayama disease, supplemented by a systematic review and collation of reported cases in the literature. A review of the literature was performed by searching PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Full-length articles were included if they reported clinical data regarding the treatment of at least one patient with Hirayama disease and the neurologic outcome of that treatment. Articles were excluded if they did not provide information on treatment outcomes, were abstract-only publications, or were published in languages other than English.

    "abstract": "Complex locomotor patterns are generated by combination of muscle synergies. How genetic processes, early sensorimotor experiences, and the developmental dynamics of neuronal circuits contribute to the expression of muscle synergies remains elusive. We shed light on the factors that influence development of muscle synergies by studying subjects with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA, types II/IIIa), a disorder associated with degeneration and deafferentation of motoneurons and possibly motor cortical and cerebellar abnormalities, from which the afflicted would have atypical sensorimotor histories around typical walking onset. Muscle synergies of children with SMA were identified from electromyographic signals recorded during active-assisted leg motions or walking, and compared with those of age-matched controls. We found that the earlier the SMA onset age, the more different the SMA synergies were from the normative. These alterations could not just be explained by the different degrees of uneven motoneuronal losses across muscles. The SMA-specific synergies had activations in muscles from multiple limb compartments, a finding reminiscent of the neonatal synergies of typically developing infants. Overall, while the synergies shared between SMA and control subjects may reflect components of a core modular infrastructure determined early in life, the SMA-specific synergies may be developmentally immature synergies that arise from inadequate activity-dependent interneuronal sculpting due to abnormal sensorimotor experience and other factors. Other mechanisms including SMA-induced intraspinal changes and altered cortical-spinal interactions may also contribute to synergy changes. Our interpretation highlights the roles of the sensory and descending systems to the typical and abnormal development of locomotor modules.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This is likely the first report of locomotor muscle synergies of children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a subject group with atypical developmental sensorimotor experience. We found that the earlier the SMA onset age, the more the subjects' synergies deviated from those of age-matched controls. This result suggests contributions of the sensory/corticospinal activities to the typical expression of locomotor modules, and how their disruptions during a critical period of development may lead to abnormal motor modules."

The availability of disease-modifying therapies for SMA therapies highlights the pressing need for easily accessible and cost-effective blood biomarkers to monitor treatment response and for better disease management. Additionally, the wide implementation of newborn genetic screening programs in Western countries enables presymptomatic diagnosis of SMA and immediate treatment administration. However, the absence of monitoring and prognostic blood biomarkers for neurodegeneration in SMA hinders effective disease management. Neurofilament light protein (NfL) is a promising biomarker of neuroaxonal damage in SMA and reflects disease progression in children with SMA undergoing treatment. Recently, the European Medicines Agency issued a letter of support endorsing the potential utilization of NfL as a biomarker of pediatric neurological diseases, including SMA. Within this review, we comprehensively assess the potential applications of NfL as a monitoring biomarker for disease severity and treatment response in pediatric-onset SMA. We provide reference ranges for normal levels of serum based NfL in neurologically healthy children aged 0-18 years. These reference ranges enable accurate interpretation of NfL levels in children and can accelerate the implementation of NfL into clinical practice."

We confirm that the pre-mRNA generated from SMN2Sup undergoes splicing to produce a translation-competent mRNA. We demonstrate that mRNA generated from SMN2Sup produces more SMN than an identical mRNA generated from a cDNA clone. We uncover that overexpression of SMN triggers skipping of exon 3 of SMN1/SMN2. We define the minimal promoter and regulatory elements associated with the initiation and elongation of transcription of SMN2. The shortened introns within SMN2Sup preserved the ability of camptothecin, a transcription elongation inhibitor, to induce skipping of exons 3 and 7 of SMN2. We show that intron 1-retained transcripts undergo nonsense-mediated decay. We demonstrate that splicing factor SRSF3 and DNA/RNA helicase DHX9 regulate splicing of multiple exons in the context of both SMN2Sup and endogenous SMN1/SMN2. Prevention of SMN2 exon 7 skipping has implications for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We validate the utility of the super minigene in monitoring SMN levels upon splicing correction. Finally, we demonstrate how the super minigene could be employed to capture the cell type-specific effects of a pathogenic SMN1 mutation."

    "abstract": "Microrchidia CW-type zinc finger protein 2 (MORC2) is an ATPase-containing nuclear protein which regulates transcription through chromatin remodelling and epigenetic silencing. <i>MORC2</i> may have a role in the development of neurones, and dominant variants in this gene have recently been linked with disorders including Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2Z disease, spinal muscular atrophy and, more recently, a neurodevelopmental syndrome consisting of developmental delay, impaired growth, dysmorphic facies, and axonal neuropathy (DIGFAN), presenting with hypotonia, microcephaly, brain atrophy, intellectual disability, hearing loss, faltering growth, and craniofacial dysmorphism. Notably, variants in <i>MORC2</i> have shown clinical features overlapping with those of Cockayne and Leigh syndromes. Here, we report a case of <i>MORC2</i>-related DIGFAN syndrome in a female infant caused by a novel heterozygous <i>de novo</i> variant. The condition was early onset and severe, further expanding the range of genotypes associated with this disorder. Clinical features included unilateral hearing loss, developmental delay and regression within the first year of life, microcephaly, severe feeding difficulties, and faltering growth, resulting in death at 13 months of age."

    "title": "Development and assessment of educational materials for spinal muscular atrophy carrier screening in the Plain community.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has been reported in both Amish and Mennonite (Plain) communities, and a higher incidence has been observed in certain Mennonite communities compared to the general population. There are several therapies for SMA, but all are most effective in pre-symptomatic newborns. To identify couples from the Wisconsin Plain community who are most likely to have a child with SMA, carrier screening is offered via mailed kits with at-home specimen collection. Our survey data about Plain families' perspectives on genetic testing suggest educational materials are needed for individuals providing informed consent with at-home specimen collection. We therefore developed a Plain population-specific educational trifold brochure about SMA carrier screening by incorporating existing medical education strategies and feedback from Plain community members and their health care providers. Along with the brochure, surveys were included in the kits to assess baseline knowledge about SMA carrier screening (\"pre-education\") as well as improvement in knowledge after reviewing the brochure and cultural appropriateness of the brochure (\"post-education\"). Fifty-five testing kits were distributed, and 26 survey pairs (pre- and post-education) were returned and analyzed (response rate 47%). Respondents had high baseline knowledge with an average of 5 of 7 questions (71%) answered correctly on the pre-education survey. Knowledge improved after reviewing the brochure as the average score increased to 6.5 of 7 questions (93%) answered correctly. Questions about risks of having an affected child after positive or negative carrier screening showed the most improvement from the pre-education to post-education surveys. Most respondents indicated the brochure was helpful, was easy to understand, and contained the right amount of information. Overall, incorporating elements of existing medical education strategies with feedback from the target population and stakeholders about appropriate language seems to be an effective method for creating beneficial, culturally responsive educational materials for the Plain population."

    "abstract": "After a fall from his wheelchair, a 23-year-old wheelchair-dependent patient with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 was initially seen by an emergency dentist, who repositioned and splinted the luxated teeth number 31 and 32. For stabilization, the patient was subsequently referred to a centre for special dental care. In the past, few treatments had been carried out on the patient. A jaw defect and very limited mouth opening compromised dental treatment. In addition, due to the muscle disease, the patient had respiratory and breathing problems, for which he used respiratory equipment. This case describes the importance of a multidisciplinary team in the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy, and the options for performing minimally invasive dental treatment, where the priority is a painless dentition."

    "abstract": "Nusinersen is the first drug approved for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) treatment. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of nusinersen, assess the therapeutic effects based on the treatment initiation timing and baseline motor function, and explore the perception of functional improvement from either parents or patients, utilizing 3-year nationwide follow-up data in South Korea. We enrolled patients with SMA who were treated with nusinersen under the National Health Insurance coverage, with complete motor score records available and a minimum treatment duration of 6 months. To evaluate the motor function of patients, the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination-2 (HINE-2) was used for type 1 and the Expanded Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale (HFMSE) was used for types 2 and 3 patients. A significant improvement was defined as a HINE-2 score gain ≥5 for patients with type 1 and an HFMSE score <b>≥</b> 3 for patients with types 2 and 3 SMA. Effects of treatment timing were assessed. Patients with type 2 were further categorized based on baseline motor scores for outcome analysis. We also analyzed a second dataset from five tertiary hospitals with the information on parents/patients-reported impressions of improvement. The study comprised 137 patients, with 21, 103, and 13 patients representing type 1, 2, and 3 SMA, respectively. At the 3-year follow-up, the analysis encompassed 7 patients with type 1, 12 patients with type 2, and none with type 3. Nearly half of all enrolled patients across SMA types (42.8, 59.2 and 46.2%, respectively) reached the 2-year follow-up for analysis. Patients with type 1 SMA exhibited gradual motor function improvement over 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-ups (16, 9, and 7 patients, respectively). Patients with type 2 SMA demonstrated improvement over 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-ups (96, 61 and 12 patients, respectively). Early treatment from symptom onset resulted in better outcomes for patients with type 1 and 2 SMA. In the second dataset, 90.7% of 108 patients reported subjective improvement at the 1-year follow-up. Nusinersen treatment for types 1-3 SMA is safe and effective in long-term follow-up. Early treatment initiation was a significant factor affecting long-term motor outcome."

    "title": "Motor fiber function in spinal muscular atrophy-analysis of conduction velocity distribution.",
    "abstract": "The motor neuron survival protein, which is deficient in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), performs numerous cellular functions. Currently, SMA is believed to be a multi-organ disease, including lesion of various structures of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Motor nerve damage, especially in milder SMA types, is controversial. This prompted the conduct of the electrophysiological studies in adults with SMA types 2 and 3 presented in this paper. The study group consisted of 44 adult patients with SMA types 2 and 3. All patients underwent neurological examination with Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE) assessment. Standard electrophysiological studies in the ulnar nerve and conduction velocity distribution (CVD) tests were performed in all patients and controls. A prolongation of the distal latency and lowering of the motor potential amplitude with no changes in CVD were found in the whole patient group. There were no dependencies on the number of gene copies. Patients with low HFSME value had slower standard conduction velocity, CVD in upper and median quartiles, and narrower CVD spread; in milder SMA, CVD spread was greater than in controls. The significant reduction in motor response amplitude in SMA seems to be primarily related to motor neuron loss and directly proportional to its severity. The coexisting rearrangement in the peripheral nerve structure is present in SMA, and this could be partially caused by a coexisting demyelinating process. Nerve remodeling mainly affects large fibers and occurs in more severe SMA types with significant disability."

    "title": "Risdiplam in Spinal Muscular Atrophy: Safety Profile and Use Through The Early Access to Medicine Scheme for the Paediatric Cohort in Great Britain.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a progressive neuromuscular disease caused by mutations in Survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, leading to reduction in survival motor neuron protein (SMN), key for motor neuron survival and function in the brainstem and spinal cord. Risdiplam is an orally administered SMN2-splicing modifier which increases production of functional SMN protein. Risdiplam was offered in the UK under early access to medicines scheme (EAMS) to SMA type 1 and 2 patients aged 2 months and older, not suitable for authorised treatments from September 2020 to December 2021. To describe the largest paediatric European real-world set of data on patients' characteristics and short-term safety for risdiplam in Great Britain through EAMS. We collated data from SMA REACH UK a national clinical and research network for all patients enrolled onto EAMS and assessed all submitted adverse events. Of the 92 patients; 78% were Type 2 SMA, mean age 10.9 years, range 0-17 years. 56 were treatment naïve, 33 previously treated; of these 25 had received nusinersen, 3 previous treatment unknown. Sixty adverse events (AEs) were reported occurring in 34 patients. The commonest were respiratory tract infections and gastrointestinal disturbance. Four life-threatening events were reported with 2 deaths and permanent cessation of risdiplam in 3 patients.Overall, 38/60 AEs were considered unrelated to risdiplam, 10/60 related to risdiplam and for 12/60 causality not specified. This study found a safety profile similar to clinical trials with no new safety concerns identified. With the restricted eligibility of onasemnogene abeparvovec and complications of nusinersen administration, EAMS allowed access or continued treatment to naïve patients or patients no longer suitable for approved medications. Collection of longitudinal data for this complex population is needed, to provide greater insights into risdiplam's role in addressing patients' needs into the future."

This study aims to evaluate FSHD disease progression over 1 year and to examine the sensitivity of several outcome measures in detecting changes during this interval. We conducted a 12-month prospective observational study of 41 participants with FSHD. Participants were evaluated at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months with serial strength testing (manual muscle testing or MMT and maximum voluntary isometric contraction testing or MVICT), functional testing (FSHD-Composite Outcome Measure or FSHD-COM, FSHD Clinical Severity Score or CSS, and FSHD Evaluation Score or FES), sleep and fatigue assessments, lean body mass measurements, respiratory testing, and the FSHD-Health Index patient-reported outcome. Changes in these outcome measures were assessed over the 12-month period. Associations between changes in outcome measures and both age and sex were also examined. In a 12-month period, FSHD participant function remained largely stable with a mild worsening of strength, measured by MMT and standardized MVICT scores, and a mild loss in lean body mass. The abilities and disease burden of adults with FSHD are largely static over a 12-month period with participants demonstrating a mild average reduction in some measures of strength. Selection of patients, outcome measures, and trial duration should be carefully considered during the design and implementation of future clinical studies involving FSHD patients."

The workshop involved neuromuscular and clinical experts and representatives of patient advocacy groups and industry. SMN2 copy number is currently one of the main determinants for therapeutic decision in SMA patients: participants discussed the issues that laboratories may encounter in this molecular test and the cruciality of the accurate determination, due the implications as prognostic factor in symptomatic patients and in individuals identified through newborn screening programmes. At the end of the workshop, the attendees defined a set of recommendations divided into four topics: SMA molecular prognosis assessment, newborn screening for SMA, SMN2 copies and treatments, and modifiers and biomarkers. Moreover, the group draw up a series of recommendations for the companies manufacturing laboratory kits, that will help to minimize the risk of errors, regardless of the laboratories' expertise."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the onasemnogene abeparvovec in relation to nusinersen and risdiplam in the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy type 1 from the perspective of the Brazilian Unified Health System. A Markov model was built on a lifetime horizon. Short-term data were obtained from clinical trials of the technologies and from published cohort survival curves (long term). Costs were measured in current 2022 local currency (R$) values and benefits in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Utility values were derived from type 1 spinal muscular atrophy literature, whereas costs related to technologies and maintenance care in each health state were obtained from official sources of reimbursement in Brazil. Deterministic and probabilistic, as well as scenario, sensitivity analyses were performed. Compared with the less costly strategy (nusinersen), the use of onasemnogene abeparvovec resulted in an incremental cost of R$2.468.448,06 ($975 671.169 - purchasing power parity [PPP]) and a 3-QALY increment and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of R$742.890,92 ($293 632.774 - PPP)/QALY. Risdiplam had an extended dominance from other strategies, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of R$926.586,22 ($366 239.612 - PPP)/QALY compared with nusinersen. Sensitivity analysis showed a significant impact of the follow-up time of the cohort and the cost of acquiring onasemnogene abeparvovec. Over a lifetime horizon, onasemnogene abeparvovec seems to be a potentially more effective option than nusinersen and risdiplam, albeit with an incremental cost. Such a trade-off should be weighed in efficiency criteria during decision making and outcome monitoring from the perspective of the Brazilian Unified Health System."

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to develop a clinical tool for the evaluation and follow-up of adolescent and adult patients with 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and to design its validation. This prospective, non-interventional study will be carried out at five centres in Spain and will include patients aged 16 years or older with a confirmed diagnosis of 5q SMA (biallelic mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 [SMN1] gene). A panel of experts made up of neurologists, physiatrists and Spanish patients' association (FundAME), participated in the design of the clinical tool. Physicians will administer the tool at three time points (baseline, 12 months and 24 months). Additionally, data from other questionnaires and scales will be collected. Once recruitment is achieved, an interim statistical analysis will be performed to assess its psychometric properties by applying Rasch analysis and classical statistical tests. The tool will consist of up to 53 items to assess functional status from a clinical perspective in seven key dimensions (bulbar, respiratory, axial, lower, upper, fatigability and other symptoms), which will be collected together with objective clinical measures (body mass index, forced vital capacity, pinch strength and 6-minute walk test). The validation of this tool will facilitate the clinical evaluation of adult and adolescent patients with SMA and the quantification of their response to new treatments in both clinical practice and research."

    "title": "A Study on the Incidence and Prevalence of 5q Spinal Muscular Atrophy in Canada Using Multiple Data Sources.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a leading genetic cause of infant death and represents a significant burden of care. An improved understanding of the epidemiology of SMA in Canada may help inform strategies to improve the standard of care for individuals living with SMA. We employed a multisource approach to estimate the minimal incidence and prevalence of 5q SMA and to gain greater insight into recent clinical practices and treatment trends for the Canadian SMA population. Data sources included the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP), Canadian Neuromuscular Disease Registry (CNDR), and molecular genetics laboratories in Canada. The estimated annual minimum incidence of 5q SMA was 4.38, 3.44, and 7.99 cases per 100,000 live births in 2020 and 2021, based on CPSP, CNDR, and molecular genetics laboratories data, respectively, representing approximately 1 in 21,472 births (range 12,516-29,070) in Canada. SMA prevalence was estimated to be 0.85 per 100,000 persons aged 0-79 years. Delay in diagnosis exists across all SMA subtypes. Most common presenting symptoms were delayed milestones, hypotonia, and muscle weakness. Nusinersen was the most common disease-modifying treatment received. Most patients utilized multidisciplinary clinics for management of SMA. This study provides data on the annual minimum incidence of pediatric 5q SMA in Canada. Recent therapeutic advances and newborn screening have the potential to drastically alter the natural history of SMA. Findings underline the importance of ongoing surveillance of the epidemiology and long-term health outcomes of SMA in the Canadian population."

    "abstract": "In the past, the spinal cord was considered a hard-wired network responsible for spinal reflexes and a conduit for long-range connections. This view has changed dramatically over the past few decades. It is now recognized as a plastic structure that has the potential to adapt to changing environments. While such changes occur under physiological conditions, the most dramatic alterations take place in response to pathological events. Many of the changes that occur following such pathological events are maladaptive, but some appear to help adapt to the new conditions. Although a number of studies have been devoted to elucidating the underlying mechanisms, in humans and animal models, the etiology and pathophysiology of various diseases impacting the spinal cord are still not well understood. In this review, we summarize current understanding and outstanding challenges for a number of diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic laterals sclerosis (ALS), and spinal cord injury (SCI), with occasional relations to stroke. In particular, we focus on changes resulting from SCI (and stroke), and various influencing factors such as cause, site and extent of the afflicted damage."
