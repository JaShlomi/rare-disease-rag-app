    "title": "Efficacy and safety of pitolisant in children above 6 years with narcolepsy.",
    "abstract": "The newly approved use of pitolisant in pediatric narcolepsy marks a significant advancement for patients and clinicians, given the scarcity of medications for this age group that are both safe and effective in reducing narcolepsy symptoms and improving quality of life. This article covers the use of pitolisant for treating narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) and 2 (NT2) in pediatric patients considering drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. By integrating recent literature and real-world data, the safety, the tolerability and the efficacy of this drug have been analyzed, also including evidence drawn from studies involving patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome. Pitolisant represents a groundbreaking treatment for pediatric narcolepsy, addressing the paucity of safe and effective options for this age group. Its unique mechanism as a histamine H3 receptor antagonist reduces excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy while offering cognitive benefits. With a favorable safety profile and good tolerability, pitolisant efficiently outperforms traditional therapies, which often have distressing side effects. Its use is particularly critical in childhood, a developmental stage where factors like growth, school performance, and socialization must be carefully considered, making it a transformative option for pediatric care."

    "abstract": "Up to 10% of patients with severe early-onset obesity carry pathogenic variants in known obesity-related genes, mostly affecting the leptin-melanocortin pathway. Studying children with severe obesity from consanguineous populations provides a unique opportunity to uncover novel molecular mechanisms. Using whole-exome sequencing, followed by a rigorous analytical and filtration strategy, we identified three different homozygous missense variants in SREK1 (encoding Splicing Regulatory glutamic acid and lysine rich protein) in Pakistani children with severe obesity, from three unrelated consanguineous pedigrees. The wild type SREK1 gene of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hypothalamic neurons was individually replaced by each of the three variants and the impact of these changes on global gene expression was studied. Neurons expressing the two variants in the SREK1 RNA recognition domain p.P95L and p.T194M, but not the C-terminally located p.E601K, had markedly reduced expression of the small nucleolar RNA clusters SNORD115 and SNORD116, deficiency of which has been implicated in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). In addition to hyperphagic obesity the carriers of these two variants had other features of PWS, such as neonatal hypotonia. In conclusion, homozygous variants in SREK1 result in a subtype of severe early onset obesity sharing features with PWS."

    "title": "Sensorineural deafness in a child with Prader-Willi Syndrome-A rare case report.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic condition, predominantly of sporadic origin, associated with chromosomal abnormalities involving the long arm of chromosome 15, specifically the q11-13 region. Of note, the STRC gene, located on chromosome 15q15.3, is implicated in congenital sensorineural hearing loss, primarily affecting the inner hair cells of the cochlea, and typically results in mild to moderate hearing impairment. In our case, the patient presented with unilateral profound hearing loss, predominantly involving the neural component-a unique finding not previously documented in the literature. Whether hearing impairments are an intrinsic feature of PWS or merely a coincidental association remains unclear. While routine monitoring in PWS typically focuses on growth, vision, sleep, developmental milestones, and endocrine function, auditory screening in asymptomatic children is often overlooked. This case underscores the need for further investigation into hearing issues in individuals with PWS."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal impairment (HPAI) in adults with Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS) remains unclear despite its clinical relevance. The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of HPA axis impairment in adults with PWS based on the results of the high dose short synacthen test (HDSST), as well as to analyze the effects of hydrocortisone (HCT) therapy in this population. Retrospective analysis. Thirty adult patients (14 men, 16 women, aged 18-28 years) with genetically confirmed PWS. Twenty-two patients (73.3%) had been adequately treated with human recombinant growth hormone (rhGH). Due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, all patients received hormone replacement therapy. Physical examination included measuring height, weight and body fat percentage (using the electrical bioimpedance method). Based on HDSST results, patients were divided into two groups: with HPA axis impairment (cortisol < 500 nmol/L at 30<sup>th</sup> minute), and AS (adrenal sufficiency; cortisol ≥ 500 nmol/L at the 30<sup>th</sup> minute). Clinical symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (AI), body weight and body fat percentage were evaluated at baseline, after 6 and 12 months of follow-up. Fourteen of the 30 patients (46.7%) showed a 30-min cortisol peak <500 nmol/L, and were assigned to the HPAI group. Peak cortisol levels at 30' and 60' were significantly lower in the HPAI group compared to the Control one, respectively (<i>P</i><0.001) Correlation analysis revealed that basal cortisol was positively correlated with cortisol levels at both 30' and 60' of the HDSST (r = 0.872, <i>P</i> < 0.001 and r = 0.829, <i>P</i> < 0.001, respectively). Fatigue, myalgia and muscle weakness occurred more often in the HPAI group than in the Control group (90.9% vs. 20%, <i>P</i>= 0.01, 90.9% vs. 0%, <i>P</i>=0.001, respectively). All symptomatic patients with HPAI received HCT treatment (10 mg/day) in two divided doses. Fatigue, myalgiaand muscle weakness improved significantly after 12 months of HCT therapy (P<0.001). No adverse effects of HCT treatment were observed, such as weight gain, body fat percentage increase or metabolic abnormalities. The results of our study suggest that the HPA axis should be routinely evaluated in adult patients with PWS. Short term, low-dose HCT treatment in symptomatic patients with HPAI is safe and can reduce symptoms of fatigue, myalgia and muscle weakness. However, the benefits and adverse effects of HCT treatment in this population require confirmation in prospective, placebo-controlled randomized clinical studies."

    "title": "Role of mitochondrial function in the oxidative stress profile of children with Prader-Willi syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe obesity and associated with increased oxidative stress. This phenomenon is partly attributed to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which promote inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, contributing to significant metabolic complications. Growth hormone (GH) treatment is widely used in children with PWS due to its well-documented benefits, including improvements in body composition, motor development, and cognitive function. In this study, we assessed the oxidative stress profile in children with PWS treated with GH. Since obesity and inflammation are well-established contributors to oxidative stress, values obtained from non-syndromic obese patients were included as a reference, allowing the findings to be contextualized within the framework of oxidative stress. The study included 12 GH-treated PWS children with a mean age of 15 years and 11 non-syndromic obese patients with a mean age of 14 years. Flow cytometry was employed as the primary method to analyse markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial function in both groups. Additionally, this technique enabled the identification of immune cell populations associated with chronic inflammation, acute inflammation, and immune response, providing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Despite PWS children having 4- to 6-fold lower glutathione (GSH) levels, PWS children demonstrated 2- to 3.5-fold higher mitochondrial activity, increasing their antioxidant capacity and reducing lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation by up to 2-fold compared to non-syndromic obese children. GH-treated PWS children also showed lower mitochondrial dysfunction under oxidative conditions, higher cell viability, and elevated inflammatory biomarkers, suggesting a link to senescence and premature ageing. GH-treated PWS children, despite being non-obese, exhibited higher systemic inflammation compared to the non-syndromic obese group, alongside significant differences in oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. These findings suggest that mitochondrial pathways may play a role in antioxidant responses in PWS, highlighting the complexity of oxidative stress and its potential contribution to premature ageing in this condition. Understanding these mechanisms and the role of GH treatment could inform the development of targeted therapies to better manage oxidative stress and inflammation, ultimately improving the quality of life for PWS children."

    "abstract": "Biallelic variants in the pro-opiomelanocortin gene (POMC) can cause hypocortisolism, hypopigmentation, and early-onset obesity. Following the identification of two patients of combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD), we investigated the prevalence of this association among carriers of rare pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) POMC variants. Case report and systematic literature review. Genetic analysis was conducted in a family with two cousins with childhood-onset obesity and CPHD. We assessed CPHD in carriers for biallelic pathogenic POMC variants using data from the literature and Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). Clinical and biological data were collected, including pituitary axis involvement, obesity onset age, and pituitary imaging results. The two cousins, compound heterozygous for POMC variants, developed CPHD following initial hypocortisolism, with subsequent hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, and hypogonadism. Among 41 patients with biallelic POMC variants identified in the literature, 20 had rare homozygous/compound heterozygous P/LP POMC variants and detailed endocrine evaluations. Of these, 40% presented with CPHD, always associated with early-onset severe obesity and hypocortisolism. Growth hormone deficiency was the most frequent (75%), followed by thyrotropic and gonadotropic deficiencies (62.5%). No anomalies were revealed in pituitary imaging. Two patients recovered the gonadotropic axis after treatment with the MC4R agonist. These findings underscore the potential for CPHD to occur in carriers of biallelic pathogenic POMC variants. Sequencing the full POMC, including coding and regulatory regions, is crucial in CPHD cases, alongside evaluating all pituitary axes in neonatal hypocortisolism. Beyond weight regulation, Setmelanotide may modulate hypothalamic-pituitary function, with implications for fertility."

    "title": "Sertraline-Induced Mood and Behavioral Activation in Two Adults With Prader-Willi Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> Risk for mood and behavioral activation (MBA) due to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is multiply determined in persons with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) due to underlying epigenetic and pharmacogenomic factors that affect medication response. Further, age and molecular subtype of PWS are predisposing factors, as there is a >60% risk for bipolar disorder onset prior to age 30 among those with maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD). This article presents two cases of MBA due to sertraline prescribed to treat anxiety in these adults with PWS (mUPD). <b>Methods:</b> Literature review, clinical experience, and data from group home behavior logs inform this case report. The assent of the patients and the consent of their parents (legal guardians) were obtained for this publication. <b>Results:</b> In these two cases, the gradual onset of MBA occurred over 1 year as the dose of sertraline was increased causing irritability, sleep disturbance, increased intensity of hyperphagia, and other phenotypic behaviors. These clinical signs were attributed to the stress of COVID-19 shutdown that resulted in loss of community activities for work, socialization, leisure, and exercise. But after sertraline was discontinued, activation resolved. Mood-stabilizing medication was required for a return to baseline, as sertraline may have unmasked or exacerbated an underlying bipolar diathesis. <b>Conclusion:</b> Sertraline and other SSRI medications can cause MBA in patients with PWS at typical starting doses, although risk for adverse effects increases with higher doses. Age is a contributing factor. Knowing the genetic subtype of PWS is essential for making clinical decisions about pharmacotherapy, and results of pharmacogenomic testing may inform the selection of medication, dose, and schedule of administration."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are rare imprinting disorders caused by the aberrant expression of 15q11.2-q13 imprinted genes. Due to their rarity, data on health outcomes during infancy are limited. This EUROlinkCAT study aimed to investigate major health outcomes of children with these chromosomal disorders. Data of children born in 1995-2014 and diagnosed with PWS (n=150) or AS (n=46), collected by 11 population-based congenital anomaly registries, were linked to local electronic healthcare and mortality databases and analysed. Children with PWS had a survival rate of 94% (95% CI 89.5% to 98.7%) by 10 years of age. Nearly all children (99.5%, 95% CI 97.6% to 99.9%) with PWS required hospitalisation during the first year of life with a median length of stay of 25 days; a high proportion continued to need hospital care later in life (93.2% at 1-4 years and 79.6% at 5-9 years) with shorter stays (1.2 and 0.5 days per year, respectively). In comparison, no deaths occurred among children with AS by 10 years of age. Fewer children with AS required hospitalisation in the first year of life (59.0%, 95% CI 39.6% to 74.0%); as they grew older, the proportion admitted was 68% (95% CI 40.0% to 85.0%) at 5-9 years. Children with PWS and AS underwent first surgery at approximately 1.8 years and 2.5 years, respectively. This study provides valuable evidence for improving family counselling and promoting an adequate healthcare support system."

    "abstract": "Hexasomy of the Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndrome Critical Region (PWASCR; chromosome 15q11-q13) is very rare with only 13 patients being described to date. The region is known for its high susceptibility to genomic rearrangements, and extra copies within the region have been shown to be associated with distinct but variable clinical features of intellectual disability, epilepsy, global developmental delay amongst others. We present a 10-year-old girl with moderate to severe intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, seizures, autistic features and challenging behaviours. Her karyotype is 47,XX,+mar[25]/46,XX[5]. On chromosome analysis using G-banding, we identified a very large dicentric supernumerary marker chromosome 15q11-q13. Microarray analysis and metaphase fluorescence in-situ hybridisation using the SNRPN gene specific to 15q11.2-q13.3 region showed 87 % of cells containing 6 signals and 13 % of cells containing 2 signals. This represents mosaicism for a partial hexasomy of the long arm of chromosome 15q. We also reviewed and consolidated the literature of all reported patients with hexasomy of PWASCR, and found that amongst all 14 patients (including ours), despite some variation in phenotype, all patients had seizures, and the majority had intellectual disability and challenging behaviours."

However, this treatment option is limited to children in most countries and to children with short stature in countries such as the USA and Japan. The aim of this multicohort study was to evaluate the effect of somatropin on body composition and to assess its safety in Japanese pediatric and adult participants with PWS. GH-naïve pediatric participants (n = 6) received somatropin 0.245 mg/kg/week, GH-treated pediatric participants (n = 7) received somatropin 0.084 mg/kg/week, and adult participants (n = 20) received somatropin 0.042 mg/kg/week for 1 month, followed by 0.084 mg/kg/week. The study met its primary endpoint in the adult cohort because the least squares mean (95% CI) of the change from baseline to Month 12 in lean body mass (LBM) (%) was greater than the prespecified efficacy criterion of 0. LBM (%) was higher at 12 months in GH-naïve pediatric participants, while GH-treated pediatric participants showed little deterioration in LBM despite reduced GH dosage. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were experienced by five (83.3%), five (71.4%), and 19 (95.0%) participants in the GH-naïve pediatric cohort, GH-treated pediatric cohort, and adult cohort, respectively. Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Three participants reported four serious TEAEs, and none were treatment related. Somatropin improved body composition in adult participants, enabled maintenance of body composition in pediatric participants, and demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in all PWS cohorts.

This review includes evaluated evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving children and adolescents aged 3-19 years, identified from PsycINFO, Medline (Ovid version), Web of Science, and the reference lists of existing reviews. Risk of bias were assessed using Risk of Bias Tool (RoB 2) in RevMan (version 5.4, Cochrane Collaboration). The results were qualitatively summarized by describing the main findings across the studies. Of the 1561 studies screened, 10 RCTs with 408 participants were included. Three gut microbiota-based interventions evaluated were probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary supplementation. Probiotics and dietary supplementation were identified as effective on reducing depression and anxiety in three studies; no significant effects were reported in the remaining seven studies. No evidence supported the effectiveness of prebiotics in reducing depression and anxiety in children and adolescents. Four studies presented low risk of bias, while others showed some bias in the randomization process, allocation concealment, selective reporting, and blinding of the outcome assessment. This review highlights the potential of probiotics and dietary supplements in treating depression and anxiety in children and adolescents. However, the current evidence is constrained by inadequate mental health measurements, participant heterogeneity, and small sample sizes in reviewed studies. Further well-designed studies are needed to confirm their effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Imprinting disorders are a group of rare congenital disorders characterized by common clinical features that affect growth, development, metabolism, and shared molecular abnormalities [1]. Patients with these disorders exhibit feeding difficulties and changes in social skills. Pediatric feeding disorders affect approximately 25% of children in the general population but have been difficult to understand and manage globally; indeed, they have traditionally been approached from different professional disciplines, each advocating its own unique method. An interdisciplinary consensus group recently introduced a more integrative definition of pediatric feeding disorders. From this new approach, we hypothesized that the imprinted genes may play an important role in the relationship between feeding and social development. In addition, we hypothesize in this letter that research on imprinting disorders may contribute to a better understanding of pediatric feeding disorders."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic disorder arising from abnormalities on chromosome 15q11.2-q13, characterized by distinct physical, cognitive, and behavioral features that evolve across the lifespan. Early manifestations include severe hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and failure to thrive in infancy, progressing to hyperphagia, obesity, intellectual disabilities, and behavioral challenges in later stages. Additional features include growth hormone deficiency, short stature, delayed puberty, and other endocrine abnormalities. Genetic advances have illuminated the role of imprinted genes, such as SNORD116, in driving the syndrome's core features, offering insights into its variability and severity. Emerging research on targeted pathways, including oxytocin and ghrelin signaling, holds promise for innovative treatments addressing hyperphagia and behavioral symptoms. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of PWS's clinical features, natural history, and molecular underpinnings, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis, multidisciplinary care, and precision medicine in optimizing outcomes and enhancing the quality of life for individuals with PWS."

If serial VFSS were performed or if the patient also had a bedside swallow study (BSS), data from all were investigated. Patients were stratified by aspiration status on 1st VFSS (aspirator versus non-aspirator). Associated clinical characteristics were assessed. Forty-one total swallow studies were performed for 18 patients with PWS: 36 VFSS and 5 BSS. Dysphagia was present in 100% of patients on their 1st VFSS and in 100% of BSS. Aspiration was present in 33.3% of all VFSS and was always silent. Further studies are needed to understand the long-term implications of swallow dysfunction in children with PWS."

We primarily compare and correlate serum lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and baseline clinical characteristics of genetically confirmed children with PWS at their GH treatment-naïve stage to their control groups. Secondary objectives were to correlate serum Lp(a) and hs-CRP concentration to multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification subgroups, body composition indices, sleep apnea parameters, and hepatic shear-stress by 2-dimensional shear wave elastography in children with PWS. A total of 32 genetically confirmed PWS children (age 5 to 18 years), 20 simple obesity children, and 20 healthy children as age-matched control groups were studied for the primary and secondary study objectives. Lp(a) was higher in the study group as compared to the control group (<i>P</i> <i><</i> .0001), but we found no difference between the control groups (<i>P</i> = .9680).In addition, no correlation was detected in Lp(a) levels in the study population with respect to their body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference. hs-CRP levels were also higher in the study population compared to both control groups (<i>P</i> = .0962; <i>P</i> < .0001); in contrast, Lp(a) differed significantly between the control groups (<i>P</i> = .002). Lower fat-free mass index (FFMI) correlated with higher levels of serum Lp(a) (<i>r</i> = -0.5525; <i>P</i> = .001), whereas FFMI was not correlated with hs-CRP levels in PWS children (<i>P</i> = .657). Based on genomic subtypes, patients with PWS were divided into deletion and nondeletion genetic subgroups. We found significantly altered levels of Lp(a), hs-CRP, fat-free mass, and sleep apnea parameters, particularly in the deletion subgroup. Serum Lp(a) as well as hs-CRP stand out to be the core independent risk factors along with their strong correlation with the other study parameters, which necessitates the role of future targeted therapeutics in PWS, especially in deletion pathology. Thus, genetic subtyping during diagnostic confirmation endorses further prognostic elaboration."

Currently, limited therapeutic options are available to manage these neuropsychiatric manifestations. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of guanfacine-extended release (GXR) in reducing aggression and self-injury in individuals with PWS. Subjects with a diagnosis of PWS, aged 6-35 years with moderate to severe aggressive and/or self-injurious behavior, as determined by the clinical global impression (CGI)-Severity scale, were included in an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-flexible dose clinical trial of GXR, that was followed by an 8-week open-label extension phase. Validated behavioral instruments and physician assessments measured the efficacy of GXR treatment, its safety, and tolerability. GXR was effective in reducing aggression/agitation and hyperactivity/noncompliance, as measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) scales (p = 0.03). Overall aberrant behavior scores significantly reduced in the GXR arm. Aggression, as measured by the modified overt aggression scale (MOAS) also showed a significant reduction. Skin-picking lesions, as measured by the self injury trauma (SIT) scale, decreased in response to GXR. No serious adverse events were experienced by any of the study participants. Fatigue/sedation was the only adverse event significantly associated with GXR. The GXR group demonstrated significant overall clinical improvement, as measured by the CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) scale (p < 0.01). Findings of this pragmatic trial strongly support the use of GXR for the treatment of aggression, skin picking, and hyperactivity in children, adolescents, and adults with PWS."

We described the clinical and biological profile of this association and highlighted the management of this case through GH therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported association in the literature. This report discusses a case of a 9-year-old child diagnosed with both PWS and ring 18 syndrome at the age of 3 years. The diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome with ring chromosome 18 was established using CGH ARRAY technique. It showed the absence of expression of paternal chromosome 15 in the 15q11-q13 region, and a karyotype showing ring chromosome 18 according to the formula: 46. XX (37)/46. XX r(18) (p11.3 ;q23) (27). Our case contributes to a better understanding of the clinical presentation of complex aberrations of chromosome 18 and that of PWS. The main common clinical features of this association were a moderate dysmorphic syndrome, hypotonia, grade II obesity with severe OSA, mild cognitive deficit with learning difficulties, and a discreet scoliosis. Diagnosis and management of this complex disorder require a multidisciplinary approach. The primary focus for those patients is to enhance their quality of life and prevent any potential complications."

We identified 50 children with Prader-Willi syndrome and matched them for age, obstructive and central apnoea-hypoponea index, body mass index and sex to 50 typically developing children. All children underwent overnight polysomnography. Time and frequency domain heart rate variability were analysed during N2, N3, REM and total sleep, and nocturnal dipping of heart rate from wake was calculated. Children with Prader-Willi syndrome had reduced time domain heart rate variability in REM, reduced low frequency power in N2, higher heart rate in REM and total sleep (p < 0.05 for all) and reduced fall in heart rate from wake to REM (p < 0.05). When stratified into age groups, similar results were found in children ≤ 1 and > 1 ≤ 6 years, with no differences between groups in children > 6 years of age. The significant reduction in LF power and nocturnal dipping indicates children with Prader-Willi syndrome have delayed maturation of autonomic control, particularly below 6 years of age. Investigating the impact of age on heart rate variability longitudinally and treatments such as growth hormone remains to be elucidated."

    "title": "A new homozygous pathogenic LEPR variant causing severe, early onset obesity in a Senegalese child.",
    "abstract": "We report the case of a three-year-old Senegalese child presenting with severe obesity and hyperphagia since birth. Despite normal birth parameters and non-consanguineous parents with average BMI, the child exhibited rapid weight gain, surpassing obesity thresholds before the age of one. Genetic analysis revealed a novel homozygous variant in the LEPR gene (c.3190 G>T; p.(Glu1064Ter)). Functional assays demonstrated impaired leptin receptor signaling due to this truncating mutation. This case highlights the importance of considering monogenic causes in early-onset obesity. Identifying specific mutations enables the proposal of targeted therapies and the adaptation of clinical management."

    "abstract": "This case report describes a 39-year-old phenotypically normal male patient of a married couple with primary infertility presenting as candidates for assisted reproductive techniques. The medical history of the couple is unremarkable, with both partners phenotypically normal. Semen analysis revealed oligoasthenzoospermia (OAT), 15% sperm DNA fragmentation and 4% aneuploidies in the sperm nuclei. Genetic analysis showed no Y chromosome of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene mutations. Karyotype analysis in the male partner revealed a small supernumerary marker chromosome (sSMC) derived from chromosome 15, specifically inverted and duplicated (inv dup(15)) corresponding to the 15q11.2 region but lacking the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region (PWACR). Further investigations revealed that 35% of the patient's spermatozoa carried the sSMC(15). This case study highlights the potential association between the presence of an inv dup(15) sSMC, without the involvement of the PWACR, and male infertility. sSMC(15) may disrupt spermatogenesis and contribute to oligoasthenozoospermia in males with primary infertility. Further research into the association of mechanism mechanisms of male infertility related to the 15q11.2 region is warranted."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is primarily caused by a paternal microdeletion of the 15q11-q13 region, maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD) or unbalanced translocations. The <i>MKRN3</i> gene, located within 15q11-q13, is a master regulator of pubertal initiation. We aimed to compare variant pubertal onset and progression with recent normative data and to correlate it with abnormal <i>MKRN3</i> gene status. Age at pubarche, gonadarche, subsequent pubertal progression and bone age (BA) at gonadarche were investigated in 37 PWS patients (18 females) who already entered pubarche and/or gonadarche with median age 11.1 (95% CI: 6.4 - 18.8) years. All patients were re-tested to confirm genetic subtypes of PWS. The <i>MKRN3</i> gene was analyzed using single gene sequencing. Out of 37 subjects, 22 had microdeletion and 15 mUPD. Regardless of genetic subtypes and <i>MKRN3</i> gene status, no correlation between genotypes and the pubertal pattern was found. They initiated pubarche early - girls at 7.4 (95%CI:6.4-8.4), and boys at 9.2 (8.2-10.2) years. The subsequent progression from PH2 to PH4 (pubic hair development) was prolonged to 3.7 years in girls (1.5-5.9;p<0.05), and 2.9 in boys (2.2-3.6;p<0.001). The age at gonadarche was adequate - 10.0 years in girls (8.8-11.2), and 11.0 in boys (9.8-12.1). Progression rate of breast development from B2 to B4 was 3.9 (0.2-7.5) years in girls and of testicular volume from 4 ml to 15ml was 3.8 (0.0-8.1) years in boys. The BA at gonadarche is advanced by 0.6 ± 1.1 years (p<0.001). Children with PWS, regardless of the genetic subtype and/or <i>MKRN3</i> status, had an early pubarche and normally timed gonadarche. Pubarche progression was slower. Advanced BA was significantly correlated with gonadarche."

    "abstract": "Family caregivers of individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome face significant challenges that affect their social, economic, personal, and emotional well-being. The mental health of these caregivers remains largely unexplored, particularly regarding their own premature death. This study seeks to explicate how caregivers manage their responsibility of providing continuous specialized care for individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome. A mixed research approach was used to uncover depression, death anxiety, and anticipated fear of own death among caregivers of patients with SPW who access a foundation in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico. A mixed-methods approach was employed, using a sequential explanatory design. The quantitative sample included 15 volunteer participants between 35 and 66 years old, belonging to a foundation in Hidalgo, Mexico. Research instruments had an internal consistency of r = >0.70. Qualitative data was gathered through a focus group, using interpretive description to explore caregivers' emotional experiences. Statistical analyses, including Gamma and Kendall Tau tests, revealed significant correlations (<i>P</i> = 0.01) between caregivers' anticipated fear of death and the levels of death anxiety and depression. The qualitative findings yielded 3 principal themes: uncertainty about future self-sufficiency, fear of the future if they pass away, and the crucial role of community support. This methodological mixed study reveals a correlation between anxiety about the future, fear of death, and the emotional need for support. Continual emotional support and counselling are crucial for caregivers responsible for PWS patients' care."

    "abstract": "Pediatric dysphagia is a prominent feature of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Dysphagia increases the risk of malnutrition, aspiration, and subsequent respiratory infections, highlighting the importance of improving the understanding and management of dysphagia. The present study investigated the potential role of oxytocin (OXT) in advancing feeding and swallowing behaviors in postnatal day 0 (P0) to P42 (6-week-old) rats, with potential therapeutic implications for PWS. We hypothesized that OXT administered subcutaneously in Sprague Dawley rats within 12 to 24 hours of birth would accelerate the maturation of feeding and swallowing behaviors compared to naïve and saline-treated controls. Importantly, the videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) protocol was successfully adapted to evaluate rats as young as P21, broadening the application of this protocol beyond the previous limitation of 6-week-old rats. Using an adapted VFSS protocol for juvenile (P21-P35) and peripubertal (P36-P42) rats, feeding and swallowing maturation was objectively characterized using custom JawTrack™ software. Protocol adaptations included the refinement of oral contrast formulations for liquid and solid foods and the optimization of fluoroscope settings and equipment. Body weight and developmental milestones (e.g., crawling, walking, self-feeding) were also recorded. OXT modulated specific feeding behaviors in juvenile rats (i.e., lick rate and inter-lick interval). However, OXT did not significantly accelerate the attainment of developmental milestones in rats, and the selective effects on feeding behaviors were not observed to extend into the peripubertal stage. The present study establishes a useful methodology for future research using our enhanced VFSS protocol. In light of these results, future research is well-positioned to expand our understanding of the potential of OXT to treat dysphagia in neurodevelopmental disorders."

    "abstract": "Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon in mammals that affects brain development and behavior. Imprinting involves the regulation of allelic expression for some genes in offspring that depends on whether alleles are inherited from mothers compared to fathers, and is thought to provide parental control over offspring social behavior phenotypes. Imprinted gene expression is prevalent in the mammalian brain, and human imprinted gene mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodivergent social behavior in Prader-Willi Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome, and autism. Here, we provide a review of the evidence that imprinted genes influence social behaviors across major neurodevelopmental stages in humans and mouse animal models that include parent-infant interactions, juvenile sociability, and adult aggression, dominance, and sexual behavior."

These genetic anomalies pose significant challenges in anesthetic management when PWS patients undergo bariatric surgery. We present five instances of anesthetic management in three PWS patients who underwent bariatric surgery under general anesthesia supplemented with nerve block techniques. Obesity, sleep apnea, airway ventilatory dysfunction, and hypotonia were the primary challenges faced by PWS patients in our study. We implemented specific strategies, primarily including the reverse Trendelenburg position, gradually deepening sedation, multimodal analgesia and perioperative progressive respiratory exercises. Only in case 1a, respiratory obstruction occurred during mask ventilation, which was resolved through the use of a nasopharyngeal ventilation tract. Additionally, delayed awakening was observed in case 1a postoperatively, with the spontaneous breathing showing minimal recovery following the administration of neostigmine and atropine. Extubation of the tracheal tube was performed on the first postoperative day. Upon her second admission (case 1b), we administered sugammadex as the neuromuscular blockade reversal agent, which facilitated successful tracheal extubation ten minutes post-procedure. We advocate the use of sugammadex as the neuromuscular blockade reversal agent, the implementation of neuromuscular monitoring, progressive respiratory exercises, and multimodal analgesia in PWS patients undergoing bariatric surgery."

    "abstract": "Modest decreases in height occur during normal aging, but usually have only a minimal effect on BMI (body mass index). Height loss may result from vertebral fractures, disc collapse, kyphosis, and/or scoliosis. Accurate determinations of BMI values are essential for prescribing diet and exercise regimens especially for adults with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We measured standing heights in 28 PWS adults over a duration 11.3 ± 3.4 (range 5.1 to 16.2) years in our national multidisciplinary PWS clinic. Most had no or only minimal height loss, but in four individuals measured heights decreased by 6.2, 6.6, 7.0, and 6.3 cm, respectively. Height loss for these four patients resulted in artifactually high BMI values compared to values based on heights measured 7.9 to 16.1 years earlier. The apparent increase in BMI due to height loss rather than weight gain may lead to inappropriate recommendations for reduction in caloric intake. Even minor changes in diet restrictions can affect mood and behavior in individuals with PWS. Recognition of height loss as a contributing factor to BMI calculations is important for clinical studies evaluating effects of life-style changes and medical interventions for obesity."

Heteromorphisms in 15p11.2-15q11.1 have been reported, as has been a euchromatic variant (EV) region in 15q11.2. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to examine the genomic regions 15p11.2-15q11.2 in parallel and at the single-cell level. A total of 44 cases with normal chromosomes 15 were examined, including 38 cases with a small supernumerary marker chromosome 15 (sSMC(15)). Combined five-color FISH probe sets A and B were developed, which include probe mixtures for the positions 8.7-20.7 Mb and 22.262115-23.863963 Mb (GRCh37/hg19). Therefore, the frequencies of the 15p11.2-15q11.1 heteromorphisms for D15Z1, D15Z3, and D15Z4 were determined at 16%, 7.4%, and 13.5%, respectively. Copy number gains or losses in the EV region 15q11.2 were most frequently observed at positions 22.262115-22.826598 (GRCh37/hg19); overall, copy number variants in 15q11.2 were observed in 41% of the chromosomes 15 examined. Furthermore, it became clear that more attention needs to be paid to the exact characterization of breakpoints in sSMC(15) cases. It was shown that the breakpoint clusters involved in sSMC formation differ from those responsible for microdeletions associated with Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome. Interestingly, at least 25% of the sSMC(15) cases studied here were formed by an interchromosomal U-type exchange. This group also included two previously unrecognized asymmetric sSMCs. In summary, the detailed investigation of the chromosomal regions 15p11.2-15q11.2 using molecular cytogenetics has provided new insights into the formation of sSMC(15) and submicroscopic variations in this region."

Nine children with PWS (11.4 ± 3.3 years, 45.6 ± 5.2% BF), 11 children without OB (9.2 ± 1.4 years, 18.6 ± 5.0% BF), and 12 children with OB (9.6 ± 1.3 years, 40.4 ± 5.4% BF) participated. Children stepped onto an elevated platform wearing a weighted vest for 6 sets of 10 repetitions per leg separated by 1 min of rest. Blood samples were obtained before exercise (pre), immediately post (IP), and during recovery (+15 and +60 min). There were no group-by-time interactions for any cytokine; and neither time nor group effects for TNF-α or irisin (p ≥ 0.378). For IL-6, 60+ was higher than pre, IP, and +15 (p < 0.001). Children with PWS and OB had increased IL-6 than children without OB (p ≤ 0.038). Neither PWS nor OB affected IL-6, TNF-α or irisin responses to RE. However, excess body fat was associated with higher IL-6 concentrations."

While the contribution of individual genes to the PWS phenotype remains unclear, previous studies suggested that isolated deletions of MAGEL2, NDN, and MKRN3, excluding the SNRPN/SNORD116 locus, were insufficient to cause PWS. Here, we present a case report of a patient with an isolated deletion of MAGEL2, NDN, and MKRN3 who exhibits the full PWS phenotype, including neonatal hypotonia, developmental delay, hyperphagia, obesity, and behavioral issues. We explore the potential mechanisms underlying this case and investigate the potential contribution of the deleted genes to the observed phenotype. This case challenges previous findings and highlights the complexity of genotype-phenotype correlations in PWS. We compare the clinical data of our patient with previous reports and discuss the discrepancy with earlier findings. Our findings underscore the need for further research to fully elucidate the roles of individual genes within the PWS locus and the mechanisms underlying the phenotypic spectrum of this complex disorder."

Sleep-disordered breathing is common in PWS and is often ignored by clinicians. This paper reports a patient with PWS complicated with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A 13-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital due to ptosis, lethargy, and weight gain. Polysomnography (PSG) showed OSA and severe hypoxemia. Imaging examination showed scoliosis. Laboratory tests suggested that the patient had metabolic dysfunction. Finally, PWS was diagnosed by chromosome karyotype and gene analysis. The patient's obesity and OSA represented contraindications to growth hormone. After continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, the patient's sleep apnea symptoms and height were significantly improved, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) index was significantly decreased, peripheral oxygen saturation was increased, and his height increased by 4 cm. At present, the patient has been treated with growth hormone after exclusion of contraindications. This case reports a patient with PWS with severe OSA who had improved height after CPAP treatment alone. This patient's diagnosis had been delayed due to differences in medical education and medical level among the treating physicians. Timely diagnosis and treatment can improve the quality of life of children."

We report a patient with an atypical deletion within 15q11.2q13 and a PWS phenotype, including hypotonia, feeding difficulties, short stature, developmental delay, and dysmorphisms. She has a deletion from TUBGCP5 to SNURF-SNRPN (including the imprinting center) but not the SNORD region.

    "abstract": "Several primary and secondary disorders disrupting normal growth pattern are responsible for childhood short stature (SS; height less than 2 standard deviation score [SDS] or the third percentile). Pegylated recombinant human growth hormone (PEG-rhGH) is a long-acting growth hormone which has demonstrated efficacy and safety in pediatric growth hormone deficiency. However, limited data is present on its treatment pattern, extensive population use, and long-term follow-up. Therefore, a real-world study is required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PEG-rhGH and recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) in treating childhood SS. The proposed study will be an open-label, multicenter, prospective and retrospective, observational study that will recruit Chinese children aged ≥ 2 years with SS. The entire study will be categorized into three cohorts: retrospective, retrospective-prospective, and prospective. The study will recruit 10,000 patients including 3000 patients in the retrospective cohort and 7000 in the retrospective-prospective and prospective cohort, respectively. The total duration of this study will be 16 years. The primary objective will be to evaluate the long-term safety (incidence of all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events) of PEG-rhGH and rhGH for the treatment of patients with SS having growth hormone disorder (GHD), idiopathic short stature (ISS), small for gestational age (SGA), Turner syndrome (TS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Noonan syndrome (NS), deficiency of the short stature homeobox gene on the X-chromosome (SHOX deficiency), and other causes of SS. The secondary objective will be to evaluate the efficacy of PEG-rhGH and rhGH for the treatment of patients with SS with different etiologies. The results may provide the evidence of long-term efficacy and safety of PEG-rhGH and rhGH by analyzing the existing patient data and will also provide a vast array of information, which can be used as reference evidence for the Chinese academic community to design national guidelines or consensus for patients with SS.

    "abstract": "Exfoliation Syndrome is an age-related systemic condition characterized by large aggregated fibrillar material deposition in the anterior eye tissues. This aggregate formation and deposition on the aqueous humor outflow pathway are significant risk factors for developing Exfoliation Glaucoma (XFG). XFG is a multifactorial late-onset disease that shares common features of neurodegenerative diseases, such as increased protein aggregation, impaired protein degradation, and oxidative and cellular stress. XFG patients display decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial DNA deletions. Here, using Tenon Capsule Fibroblasts (TFs) from patients without glaucoma (No Glaucoma, NG) and XFG patients, we found that XFG TFs have impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics and increased reactive oxygen species accumulation. These defects are associated with mitochondrial abnormalities as XFG TFs exhibit smaller mitochondria that contain dysmorphic cristae, with increased mitochondrial localization to lysosomes and slowed mitophagic flux. Mitochondrial dysfunction in the XFG TFs was associated with hyperdynamic microtubules, decreased acetylated tubulin, and increased HDAC6 activity. Treatment of XFG TFs with a mitophagy inducer, Urolithin A (UA), and a mitochondrial biogenesis inducer, Nicotinamide Ribose (NR), improved mitochondrial bioenergetics and reduced ROS accumulation. Our results demonstrate that XFG TFs have abnormal mitochondria and suggest that mitophagy inducers may represent a potential class of therapeutics for reversing mitochondrial dysfunction in XFG patients."

    "title": "Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Central Respiratory Control in Children: A Comprehensive Review.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a primary concern in children's health. Research suggests that repeated oxygen drops during sleep-common in SDB-may harm the brainstem's breathing control centres. This damage likely occurs through oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death, which weaken the brain's ability to regulate breathing. Over time, these effects could lead to functional changes (e.g., disrupted chemical signalling) and physical damage in critical brain regions, creating a cycle of unstable breathing. However, much of this evidence comes from animal or lab studies, leaving gaps in our understanding of how these mechanisms work in humans. This review synthesises existing research on how breathing disruptions during sleep-particularly episodes of intermittent hypoxia-affect the brain's ability to control respiration in children and adolescents. <b>Methods</b>: We analysed studies from medical databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on how SDB (obstructive or central sleep apnoea) impacts the brain's respiratory centres in young populations. Animal studies and research involving children on mechanical ventilation were excluded to focus on natural sleep patterns. <b>Results</b>: After removing duplicates, 54 studies remained. Additionally, 43 record were excluded for various reasons. Ultimately, 11 articles were selected for the final analysis, including three that focused on genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Pierre Robin sequence. The findings suggest that repeated oxygen dips during sleep may harm the brainstem's respiratory control areas, especially during critical developmental stages. This damage could lead to long-term issues, such as unstable breathing, cardiovascular strain, or neurological problems. However, most studies only captured the immediate effects of low oxygen, leaving uncertainty about permanent harm due to a lack of long-term follow-up. <b>Conclusions</b>: Repeated oxygen deprivation during sleep appears to damage the brainstem and disrupt breathing regulation. However, small study sizes and short observation periods limit the strength of these conclusions. Future research should use advanced imaging tools to clarify long-term risks, develop effective treatments, and track children over extended periods. More significantly, longer-term studies are urgently needed to guide clinical care for vulnerable populations."

    "title": "Neuroglia in eating disorders (obesity, Prader-Willi syndrome and anorexia nervosa).",
    "abstract": "The hypothalamus is widely recognized as one of the most extensively studied brain regions involved in the central regulation of energy homeostasis. Within the hypothalamus, peptidergic neurons play a crucial role in monitoring peripheral concentrations of metabolites and hormones, and they finely adjust the sensing of these factors, leading to the activation of either anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) or orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) pathways. While cortical innervation of the hypothalamus does influence these processes, it is generally considered of secondary importance. Eating-related disorders, such as obesity and anorexia nervosa, are strongly associated with imbalances in energy intake and expenditure. The phenotypes of these disorders can be attributed to dysfunctions in the hypothalamus. Traditionally, it has been believed that hypothalamic dysfunction in these disorders primarily stems from defects in neural pathways. However, recent evidence challenges this perception, highlighting the active participation of neuroglial cells in shaping both physiologic and behavioral characteristics. This review aims to provide an overview of the latest insights into glial biology in three specific eating disorders: obesity, Prader-Willi syndrome, and anorexia. In these disorders, neural dysfunction coincides with glial malfunction, suggesting that neuroglia actively contribute to the development and progression of various neurologic disorders. These findings underscore the importance of glial cells and open up potential new avenues for therapeutic interventions."

Two <i>SPA</i>s are processed from a polycistronic transcript embedded in the human 15q11-q13 region related to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Once produced, <i>SPA</i>s accumulate at their transcription site and sequester splicing factors to form PWS bodies that are involved in alternative splicing regulation. But how the processing of <i>SPA</i>s is regulated has remained obscure. Here, we identified that both far upstream element-binding protein 1 (FUBP1) and myelin expression factor 2 (MYEF2) were enriched in the PWS bodies; loss of either individually impaired <i>SPA</i>s' expression and dampened the size of PWS bodies in H9 and PA1 cells. Specifically, FUBP1, on the one hand, enhanced the transcription of <i>SPA</i>-embedded polycistronic transcripts by targeting the FUSE-like sequence upstream of the promoter, and on the other hand, was required for <i>SPA1</i> splicing and maturation by binding the uridine (U)-rich intronic sequences. These findings suggest a comprehensive and distinct regulation of PWS region-derived <i>SPA</i> lncRNAs."

    "title": "The Role of the Arcuate Nucleus in Regulating Hunger and Satiety in Prader-Willi Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder. The main characteristics are muscular hypotonia, failure to thrive and feeding problems in infancy, which switch to hyperphagia in early childhood and continue into adulthood. Due to hyperphagia, the risk of developing morbid obesity is high without treatment. PWS is considered a hypothalamic disease, and within the hypothalamus the arcuate nucleus (AC) is of central importance for controlling metabolism, hunger, and satiety. The AC has been studied in several animal models as well as in humans, including PWS. The function of AC is regulated by several neuropeptides and proteins produced within the central nervous system such as oxytocin, orexin, tachykinins as well as the hypothalamic hormones, regulating the adeno-hypophyseal hormones, also acting as neurotransmitters. Additionally, there are many peripheral hormones among which insulin, leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) are the most important. High levels of adiponectin and ghrelin have consistently been reported in PWS, but dysregulation and deviating levels of many other factors and hormones have also been demonstrated in both individuals with PWS and in animal models. In this review, we focus on the role of AC and peptides and proteins produced within the central nervous system in the regulation of hunger and satiety in PWS."

    "abstract": "Loss of Snord116, a non-coding RNA, causes Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS), a complex disorder with circadian, metabolic, neurologic, and cardiovascular phenotypes. The Snord116 paternal knockout (Snord116p-) mouse, a model of PWS, demonstrated differential methylation of thousands of genes involved in regulation of metabolism, epigenetics, and ion homeostasis. To determine if Snord116 expression influences the cardiomyocyte response to acute ischemia, we developed a model of ischemia and reperfusion using living myocardial slices and monitored cardiomyocyte function in slices derived from Snord116p- mice and wildtype littermates (WT LM) of both sexes. We found that Snord116 loss reduced ischemia-induced systolic prolongation and delayed diastolic elongation in slices from both males and females. Furthermore, when compared with slices from males, slices from females experienced a greater increase in end-diastolic force after ischemia. We conclude that female myocardium responds more dramatically and quickly to ischemic injury in this model and that loss of Snord116 is cardioprotective; this allows for a more complete myocardial recovery following reperfusion."

The individualized GAS framework enabled the patient and her caregivers to establish specific treatment goals across cognitive, motor, and physiological domains. Although validated outcome measures for this population are limited, GAS effectively captured crucial aspects of the patient's experience, revealing overall improvements in most symptoms during a six-month follow-up. This method provided an unbiased assessment of treatment effectiveness, underscoring the importance of integrating patient-centered measures in the management of rare diseases like PWS. The findings suggest that GAS can yield valuable insights into patient priorities and treatment outcomes, highlighting the need for further research into its application in clinical settings for PWS and similar conditions."

Limited literature exists on the prevalence, diagnosis, and surgical management of late diagnosed hip dysplasia in PWS. This study assessed the prevalence of hip dysplasia in children with PWS and evaluated the outcomes following surgical intervention of late diagnosed hip dysplasia. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients diagnosed with PWS at our institution from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021. Patient demographics were collected, the acetabular index (AI) and the central edge angle (CEA) were measured. A single fellowship-trained pediatric orthopedic surgeon determined the presence of hip dysplasia based on radiographic measurements. The prevalence of hip dysplasia with PWS is 33.3%. There was no significant association between prevalence and sex or genetic subtype. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 34.4 months (6 months to 109 months). Five patients (2 right side, 3 bilateral) underwent surgical intervention at an average age of 82.4 months. The acetabular index decreased from 42.8 ± 5.9 degrees preoperatively to 21.7 ± 7.7 degrees postoperatively. No serious postoperative complications were reported during the follow-up. The present study demonstrated a higher prevalence of hip dysplasia in patients with PWS than in the general population. The prevalence does not significantly differ across sexes or genetic subtypes. While preliminary findings suggest outcomes may be comparable to those of HD without PWS, further studies with larger cohorts are required to validate these observations."

    "abstract": "We aimed to characterize genetic alterations in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) using whole genome microarrays. We performed mRNA expression microarray analysis using RNA isolated from whole blood of 25 PWS patients and 25 age-matched controls. After preprocessing the data to reduce heterogeneity, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between groups were identified using a linear regression model package. Reactome pathway analysis was performed for upregulated and downregulated genes using EnrichR. Correlations between gene expression levels and clinical factors were estimated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Of 21,488 probes examined in the microarray analysis, 4,156 were detected. Fifty-two genes had different expression levels in children with PWS compared with healthy controls (36 genes upregulated and 16 downregulated). Twelve genes were upregulated and 13 were downregulated in obese PWS patients compared with normal-weight PWS (NW-PWS) patients. The C-type lectin domain family 4 member D (CLEC4D) was upregulated in both PWS (vs. control) and obese-PWS (vs. NW-PWS) patients, and CLEC4D expression was also correlated with body mass index-standard deviation score in PWS patients. Among the genes upregulated in obese PWS vs. NW-PWS, Annexin A3 (ANXA3), potassium inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J member 15 (KCNJ15), and selenium binding protein 1 (SELENBP1) were upregulated in obese-control vs. NW-control. Gene ontology analysis revealed that upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in biological processes, including pathways involved in myeloid dendritic cell activation associated with CLEC4D. This study revealed differences in gene expression between obese and NW-PWS patients. The regulation of macrophage infiltration by CLEC4D suggests a possible mechanism associated with obesity-related complications in PWS."

Much of the investigation into SNORD116 has been undertaken in the context of the congenital disease Prader-Willi syndrome, wherein SNORD116 expression is lost. However, emerging evidence indicates wider roles in various disease and tissue contexts such as cellular growth, metabolism and signalling. Nevertheless, a conclusive mechanism of action for SNORD116 remains to be established. Here, we review the key findings from these investigations, with the aim of identifying common elements from which to elucidate potential targets and mechanisms of SNORD116. A key recurring element identified is disruption to the insulin/IGF-1 and PI3K/mTOR signalling pathways, contributing to many of the phenotypes associated with SNORD116 modulation explored in this review."

    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder mapping to the imprinted 15q11-13 locus, specifically at the paternally expressed snord116 region, which has been implicated in controlling epigenetic mechanisms. Some aspects of the PWS-related clinical phenotype, such as the high mortality rate in adulthood, might be attributed to accelerated epigenetic ageing. <b>Objectives</b>: The aim of the present case-control study was to evaluate epigenetic age, age acceleration, vascular age (VA), and vascular ageing in adults with PWS (<i>n</i> = 24; F/M = 11/13; age = 36.8 [26.6; 45.3] years; body mass index, BMI = 36.8 [33.9; 44.8] kg/m<sup>2</sup>), compared with a sex- and age-matched group of subjects with essential obesity (EOB) (<i>n</i> = 36; F/M = 19/17; age = 43.4 [30.6; 49.5] years; BMI = 44.8 [41.2; 51.7] kg/m<sup>2</sup>). <b>Results</b>: In subjects with PWS, there was a younger epigenetic age and a lower age acceleration than in subjects with EOB. No differences were found between VA and vascular ageing in the two groups. Epigenetic age was associated with chronological age and VA within each group. For each group, no relevant associations of epigenetic age or age acceleration with demographic, biochemical, and clinical parameters were found. When considering individuals with PWS, there were no associations of epigenetic age with growth hormone (GH) deficiency, duration of hormone replacement therapy, and plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). <b>Conclusions</b>: The hypothesis of accelerated epigenetic ageing in PWS should be rejected. Additionally, considering the existence of a SNORD116-dependent epigenetic dysregulation in PWS, the results of the present study might be misleading, since an epigenetics-based approach was used to measure ageing."

However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie these changes in the brain remain poorly understood. Differential expression analysis was performed on bulk-tissue RNA sequencing data generated from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples of elderly participants in ROS/MAP (Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project; <i>N</i> = 998, mean age at death = 89.7 years). Bulk tissue RNA sequencing was analyzed against depressive symptoms measured prior to death, controlling for Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, medication status, and lifestyle factors. Sex-stratified models were also tested. Increased abundance of the Prader-Willi syndrome-associated gene <i>PWAR1</i> (corrected <i>p</i> = 5.47 × 10<sup>-3</sup>) and <i>CTDSPL2</i> (corrected <i>p</i> = .03) were associated with a higher burden of depressive symptoms in the combined sample. An additional 14 genes showed suggestive associations, including several with known links to neuropsychiatric illness (e.g., <i>ACVR2B-AS1</i>, <i>COL19A1</i>). Functional enrichment analysis revealed downregulation of aerobic metabolism and upregulation of both amino acid catabolism and DNA modification processes. Differential expression signatures were poorly correlated between males and females (Pearson <i>r</i> = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.13), and only the male group showed independently significant differential expression. Little overlap was found with previously published analyses of major depressive disorder. Building on recently published single-nucleus profiling, we present the largest-ever study of transcriptomic correlates of depressive symptoms in late life, revealing new insights into sex-specific regulators. <i>PWAR1</i> and <i>CTDSPL2</i> were identified as putative markers of late-life depression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and warrant further study."

Although the clinical features and diagnosis of PWS are well described, the management protocol for hip dysplasia (HD) is still controversial. We present a case of a 4-year-old female child who was diagnosed with PWS and had developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) as a skeletal manifestation. She underwent an open reduction of the hip, femoral shortening with fixation using a plate, Dega osteotomy, capsulorrhaphy, and temporary stabilization of the hip joint with a K-wire, similar to any other case of DDH. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. However, there were challenges associated with her management from both a surgical and an anesthetic point of view.It is imperative that once diagnosed, the condition be addressed comprehensively. A detailed preoperative evaluation by the anesthesia team is required to ensure preparedness for potential surgical challenges. Similarly, the surgical team must be equipped with all necessary instruments and a backup plan. Hip dysplasia (HD) should be diagnosed as early as possible. Nonoperative treatment is usually sufficient before the age of 6 months. However, in PWS, it may present late and be neglected, requiring surgical management similar to a case of DDH, with the associated challenges."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder that can increase risk of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), caused by the combination of increased viscosity of secretions, craniofacial abnormalities, hypotonia, and obesity. While first-line treatment of pediatric OSA is typically adenotonsillectomy, the complex pathophysiology of OSA in PWS patients may lead to less success with this therapy. The TriNetX database was queried for patients 18 years old or younger based on the diagnoses of PWS and OSA and the surgical interventions of adenotonsillectomy, tonsillectomy, and adenoidectomy. The primary endpoint was the removal of the diagnosis of OSA 6 months postoperatively. Pediatric patients without PWS were used as a control. Secondary endpoints were the risk of OSA with common medical interventions for children with PWS. A total of 2163 patients were found to have PWS, with 1035 (47 %) diagnosed with OSA. PWS patients undergoing surgery had a total success rate of 39.0 %, compared to 79.6 % in controls (p < 0.001). Total success for these surgeries was also significantly lower compared to controls matched by demographics and obesity status (36.8 % versus 82.1 %, p < 0.001). Use of growth hormone (RR 1.43, p < 0.001) and testosterone (RR 1.39, p < 0.001) were both associated with increased risk of OSA. Adenotonsillectomy has significantly lower rates of success at treating pediatric OSA in patients with PWS. These patients would likely benefit from multidisciplinary care to treat their OSA and mitigate the effects of untreated disease, and further studies determining best practices for caring for these patients are necessary."

    "abstract": "Subsequent to early life feeding issues, children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) develop hyperphagia and severe obesity. Growth hormone (GH) therapy has been approved in PWS to improve growth, body composition, and BMI. We aimed to clarify the role of age at GH therapy onset on growth and BMI trajectories in children with PWS. We analyzed height and BMI in 114 patients (58 boys) from REPAR - Czech national GH registry. From them, 69 started GH therapy prior to 2 y/o (age 0.8 ± 0.4 years; mean ± SD; early-onset group [EO]), and 45 later (age 7.1 ± 4.1 years; late-onset group [LO]). Height-SDS before therapy was similar in all (EO: -1.9 ± 1.2 [mean ± SD]; LO: -1.7 ± 1.1). After the first year of GH therapy, height-SDS in the EO group increased to -1.0 ± 1.2, in the LO group to -0.9 ± 1.1. After 5 years, height fully normalized in all (-0.1 ± 1.1 SDS). The LO children were already obese at treatment initiation (BMI-SDS: 2.9 ± 2.2), and their BMI-SDS decreased after 1 year of GH therapy by 0.9 (p=0.003). The weight in EO children was below average before GH treatment (BMI-SDS: -0.9 ± 1.2) and their BMI-SDS increased to the overweight range of 1.3 ± 2.2 (p<0.001) within the oncoming 3 years. Albeit BMI-SDS was around the obesity limit in most children after 5 years on GH therapy, the highest lifetime BMI-SDS was lower in EO (2.2 ± 2.6) than in LO (3.7 ± 2.2; p<0.001). GH treatment in PWS normalizes body height. After 5 years of GH therapy, BMI-SDS in EO and LO groups are similar; however, the EO group is exposed to lower maximal BMI-SDS values."

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAHS) is a respiratory disorder that greatly affects the health and quality of life of patients. OSAHS affects up to 5.7% of children aged up to 18 years old, and its prevalence is doubled in children with risk factors such as obesity, craniofacial syndromes, Prader-Willi syndrome or trisomy 21. The most common aetiology of OSAHS in children is tonsil hypertrophy, and the first line treatment proposed for the majority of patients is the surgical removal of these tonsils. However, the risk of residual OSAHS after surgery is approximately 10-20%, and, thus, other therapeutic options are being developed to improve patient care. The objective of this scoping review is to assess the extent of the evidence regarding the effectiveness of the different types of treatments offered for OSAHS in children. Relevant studies over a 13 year period were identified using three search engines: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. The selection of studies was made using previously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria based on a review of the title and abstracts initially, followed by a full reading of the texts. The studies were classified based on their design and following the grades and level of scientific proof defined by the Health High Authority. Twenty-nine manuscripts were included for synthesis. The first-line treatment proposed for the majority of patients with OSAHS is surgical removal of the tonsils, but the risk of residual OSAHS after surgery remains significant, and other less invasive options, such as orthodontics, are also useful for improving the management of these patients. OSAHS treatment recommendations should consider orthodontic treatment as a minimally invasive approach with beneficial effects."

Clinical data were gathered from reports by clinical genetic specialists, and a questionnaire was included in the referral list to our laboratory. All participants were of pediatric age, ranging from neonatal to 12 years old. Chromosomal microarray testing was conducted by the Agilent SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray 8×60K. The application of molecular karyotyping yielded clinically significant results in 16 cases (32.65%), which included 13 deletions and 6 duplications. Three patients presented with two clinically significant CNVs (csCNVs). In ten cases, we identified recurrent microdeletion or microduplication syndromes well-documented in the literature: Williams syndrome as the most commonly identified (three patients), and others like Koolen de Vries, Prader-Willi, Miller-Dieker, Dryer, DiGeorge syndrome, 7q11.23 microduplication, 16p13.11 microdeletion, and 1q21.1 microdeletion syndrome. Six patients had rare non-recurrent pathological CNVs. There was no statistically significant difference between patients with csCNVs and those without regarding the presence of intellectual disabilities, central nervous system, cardiac or skeletal malformations.

In France, the referral center for rare gynecological diseases specializes in four major types of conditions, namely, uterovaginal malformations, hereditary hemorrhagic diseases, rare benign breast diseases, and gynecological repercussions of rare chronic diseases. To describe consecutive patients who had a first visit in 2018-2023 at the referral center for rare gynecological diseases at the Necker Pediatric University Hospital in Paris, France, and who were diagnosed with a condition in any of the four categories listed above.

These data included year of birth, age at and reason for first gynecology visit, and rare chronic disease and referring rare-disease center for patients seen for gynecological repercussions of rare chronic diseases. The 704 included patients had a median age of 15.2 years (interquartile range 3.8) at the first visit.

    "title": "The Effects of Bilingualism on the Executive Control Abilities of the Prader-Willi Syndrome Population.",
    "abstract": "Unlike with the typically developing population, non-typically developing individuals, especially those with intellectual disabilities, have usually been recommended to learn and use only one language, despite perhaps coming from bilingual families or living in multilingual environments. This common practice, however, is not backed by empirical evidence; previous research, although limited, has systematically shown that bilingualism does not have negative effects. This study investigates how bilingualism shapes the executive control abilities of individuals with genetic disorders. Specifically, we compare the interference suppression abilities of Spanish-Catalan bilinguals and Spanish monolinguals with Prader-Willi syndrome. Fifteen participants with Prader-Willi syndrome were recruited in Spain. The bilingual group consisted of seven Spanish-Catalan bilinguals from Catalonia-an officially bilingual territory of Spain-, while the monolingual group was formed by eight Spanish speaking individuals from Madrid-an officially monolingual territory. Participants were administered two widely used psychological tasks: the Flanker Task (a non-language-based task) and the Stroop Task (a language-based task). Three experimental conditions were included in each task: neutral, congruent, and incongruent. Both accuracy and reaction time data were collected and analyzed. The results obtained are consistent between both tasks in showing (i) no detrimental effects of bilingualism; (ii) a high answer accuracy rate; (iii) a practice effect (the more familiar participants became with the tasks the faster their answers became); (iv) sensitivity to an interference effect (higher reaction times for incongruent trials than neutral trials) but not to a clear facilitation effect (lower reaction times for congruent trials than neutral trials). These results, far from being anecdotal, are in line with results from previous research investigating the effects of bilingualism among typically developing individuals as well as non-typically developing individuals with and without genetic disorders. This study not only evidences that Prader-Willi individuals can become bilingual if they are exposed to more than one language, but also that they can do so without showing negative effects at the cognitive level. In fact, taking into account the trend in the descriptive data, if an effect of bilingualism were in place, it would be a positive one. Bilingualism has repetitively been proven to neither be a burden nor to have negative effects for the typically or the non-typically developing population. Thus, as previous researchers have pointed out, there seems to be a clear incongruity between what the research is showing and the actual advice that these individuals and their families are receiving, and this should be amended without further delay."

    "abstract": "The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) hosts the central circadian pacemaker and regulates daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. The SCN is composed of peptidergic neuron populations expressing arginine vasopressin (AVP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), as well as glial cells. Patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) commonly experience circadian disturbances, which are particularly evident in their sleep/wake patterns. Using publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data, we assessed the cell-type specificity of PWS-causative genes in murine SCN, which revealed the differential presence of PWS-related genes in glial and neural subpopulations. We then investigated neurons and glial cells in the SCN using immunohistochemistry in the postmortem hypothalami of PWS subjects and matched controls. We profiled neural populations characterized by AVP and VIP, astroglia characterized by glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), and microglia marked by ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) and NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2). Our analysis revealed an increased total number, neuronal density, and relative staining intensity of AVP-containing neurons in the PWS compared to controls while VIP-containing cells were unaltered. In contrast, GFAP-expressing astroglial cells were significantly lower in PWS subjects. Moreover, we did not detect any differences in microglia between PWS subjects and controls. Collectively, our findings show that PWS selectively affects AVP-containing neurons and GFAP-expressing astrocytes in the SCN. As each of these cell populations can affect the daily rhythmicity of the SCN biological clock machinery, the disruption of these cells may contribute to the circadian disturbances in patients with PWS."

KO mouse models for each candidate gene have been generated, but they lack the functional interactions between PWS genes. Here, we revealed an interplay between Necdin and Magel2 PWS genes and generated a mouse model (named Del Ndn-Magel2 mice) with a deletion including both genes. A subset of Del Ndn-Magel2 mice showed neonatal lethality. Behaviorally, surviving mutant mice exhibited sensory delays during infancy and alterations in social exploration at adulthood. Del Ndn-Magel2 mice had a lower body weight before weaning, persisting after weaning in males only, with reduced fat mass and improved glucose tolerance as well as altered puberty. Adult mutant mice displayed increased ventilation and a persistent increase in apneas following a hypercapnic challenge. Transcriptomics analyses revealed a dysregulation of key circadian genes and alterations of genes associated with axonal function similar to patients with PWS. At neuroanatomical levels, Del Ndn-Magel2 mice had an impaired maturation of oxytocin neurons and a disrupted development of melanocortin circuits. Together, these data indicate that the Del Ndn-Magel2 mouse is a pertinent and genetically relevant model of PWS."

While research has evidenced speech problems, little is known about reading, which is a critical language ability involved in communication. The aim of the present study was to investigate vocabulary and reading skills in adults with PWS. A total of 56 individuals (35 females, mean age = 33.64 years, range = 19-57 years) with PWS participated. Standardized paper and pencil tests were used to examine the level of vocabulary (LexTale-FR test) and reading performance (Alouette-R test). Two computerized tasks were also administered to assess the efficiency of lexical and phonological processes in reading (lexical and phonological decision tasks, taken from the ECCLA software). Performance was analyzed and compared with available norms on neurotypical adults and/or children. The results showed that adults with PWS had a low level of vocabulary (i.e., three to five standard deviations difference compared to neurotypical adults), poor reading skills (i.e., equivalent to the level of nine-year-olds), and less efficient lexical and non-lexical phonological processes. The present data suggest a global impairment in vocabulary and reading skills in adults with PWS. These findings might help clinicians to better understand the language abilities of these patients."

    "abstract": "While increased fiber intake may benefit appetite and metabolism in the general population, its effects in individuals with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a condition characterized by hyperphagia, obesity and metabolic dysregulation, remain to be explored. This study assessed the effects of a fiber intervention on hyperphagia, metabolic health, and gut microbiota in individuals with PWS, and explored associations between changes in health markers and shifts in microbiota. Participants received either a high-dose fiber intervention (35g/day) or a control for 3 weeks. Following a washout period of 4 to 8 weeks, participants switched treatments for another 3 weeks. Fecal (bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA) and blood (immunometabolic markers, targeted metabolomics) samples were collected before and after each treatment. Fourteen participants (with a median age of 13.6 years, 8 [57.1%] were female) reported high tolerance to the fiber intervention. While it did not significantly alter hyperphagia or key metabolic markers, the fiber intervention led to shifts in gut microbiota diversity and increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium longum and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Additionally, it altered fecal and serum metabolites, including a decrease in branched-chain fatty acids and an increase in serum C4-OH acylcarnitine. While this study did not observe significant changes in primary or secondary endpoints, it suggests that a short-term high-fiber intervention may induce beneficial shifts in gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in individuals with PWS. Further research is warranted to investigate the long-term effects and potential therapeutic applications of fiber interventions in PWS."

    "title": "Early oxytocin treatment in infants with Prader-Willi syndrome is safe and is associated with better endocrine, metabolic and behavioral outcomes.",
    "abstract": "Oxytocin (OT) plays an important role in modulating behavior, social interactions and feeding. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder, is a model of hypothalamic disorder including OT dysfunction. We previously showed that infants with PWS who had received an early short course (7 days) of intranasal OT treatment improved their oral and social skills. We aim to document the long-term tolerance and effects of early intranasal OT treatment on the disease trajectory. We performed a comparative clinical trial including the 17 children who had received OT as infants in our previous study and compared them to 17 PWS non-exposed children at 3-4 years old. Primary endpoint was the total communication score on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-2nd edition (VABS-II). Secondary endpoints were the other domains of VABS-II, behavior scored by the Child Behavior Checklist, feeding skills, endocrine and metabolic profiles, and brain connectivity on functional magnetic resonance imaging. We documented the long-term safety of early OT treatment. The VABS-II communication score was not different between the two groups, defined as OT-exposed and non-exposed, whereas a trend toward a higher socialization score was found in the OT-exposed children (p = 0.06). Circulating IGF-1 and HDL cholesterol were significantly higher in the OT-exposed group (p < 0.05). OT-exposed children had normal acylated ghrelin levels, which were lower than those observed in non-exposed children (p = 0.06), and they displayed higher connectivity of the orbitofrontal cortex brain region. Early OT treatment in infants with PWS is safe up to 3-4 years of age. OT-exposed children display better social, endocrine and metabolic outcomes. This study documents for the first time in human the biological window of opportunity of early OT treatment, which may change the trajectory of the PWS condition.

    "abstract": "Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain is one of the largest membrane protein assemblies ever discovered. A patient carrying a homozygous NDUFB7 intronic mutation died within two months after birth due to cardiorespiratory defects, preventing further study. Here, we report another patient with compound heterozygous mutations in NDUFB7 who suffers from pons abnormality, lactic acidosis, prematurity, prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, incomplete closure of the abdominal wall (ventral hernia), and a poorly functioning gastrointestinal tract (pseudo-obstruction). We demonstrated that the patient's skin fibroblasts are deficient in Complex I assembly and reduced supercomplex formation. This report further broadens the spectrum of mitochondrial disorders. The patient has had several surgeries. After receiving treatment with Coenzyme Q10 and vitamin B complex, she has remained stable up to this point. To further explore the functionality of NDUFB7 in vivo, we knocked down Ndufb7 in zebrafish embryos. This resulted in brain ventricle and neuronal defects, elevated lactic acid levels, and reduced oxygen consumption, indicating defective mitochondrial respiration. These phenotypes can be specifically rescued by ectopic expression of ndufb7. More importantly, Mitoquinone mesylate (MitoQ), a common remedy for mitochondrial disorders, can ameliorate these conditions. These results suggest a role for NDUFB7 in mitochondrial activity and the suitability of the zebrafish model for further drug screening and the development of therapeutic strategies for this rare disease."

    "title": "Circadian rhythm defects in Prader-Willi syndrome neurons.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a spectrum of symptoms, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, and increased risk of autism. PWS is an imprinting disorder caused by the loss of paternal expression of critical genes in the 15q11.2-q13 region, including MAGEL2, SNRPN/SNURF, and SNORD116. PWS patients often suffer from various sleep disorders, including sleep-disordered breathing and central hypersomnolence. Mouse models of PWS also exhibit disruptions in circadian rhythms and sleep. In cultured cells, Magel2 was shown to regulate the expression of Bmal1 and Per2, two core clock genes involved in the circadian rhythm regulatory process. Here, we investigated the circadian clock function in neurons derived from dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) of PWS patients and neurotypical controls. To study the circadian rhythms of PWS patients in vitro, we introduced the Per2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter (Per2:luc) to these DPSC cell lines to assess their circadian rhythm by bioluminescence. These Per2:luc cells were differentiated for 4 weeks to mature neuronal reporter cell lines, followed by kinetic measurements of luciferase activity over several days. We observed significant differences in circadian period length between PWS neurons and controls. Moreover, treatment with the small molecule longdaysin effectively lengthened the period length of PWS neurons with a shorter period length, as anticipated based on the mechanism of action of this compound. This work lays the foundation for a deeper understanding of PWS pathophysiology and represents a critical first step toward developing high-throughput assays for drug discovery targeting circadian and sleep dysfunction in PWS."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare, genetic, multi-systemic disorder. Its main characteristics are muscular hypotonia, behavioral problems, intellectual disability, endocrine deficiencies, hyperphagia, and a high risk of morbid obesity and related comorbidities. This study aimed to investigate the rate of comorbidity, prescription of endocrine medications, and mortality in individuals with PWS compared to the general population. <b>Methods:</b> The association between PWS and outcomes were investigated in a matched cohort study of individuals born in the period of 1930-2018 with data from Swedish national health and welfare registers. Each individual was matched with 50 non-PWS comparisons. The associations between PWS, outcomes and prescribed endocrine medications were estimated through Cox proportional hazard models, presented as Hazard Ratios (HR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). <b>Results:</b> Among 360 individuals (53% men) with PWS, 16% had diabetes mellitus, 6% heart failure, 4% vein thrombosis, 2% atrial fibrillation, 2% coronary heart disease, and 1% pulmonary embolism. Individuals with PWS had an increased rate of heart failure (HR: 23.85; 95% CI: 14.09-40.38), diabetes mellitus (HR: 17.49; 95% CI: 12.87-23.74), vein thrombosis (HR: 10.44; 95% CI: 5.69-19.13), pulmonary embolism (HR: 5.77; 95% CI: 2.27-14.67), atrial fibrillation (HR: 5.19; 95% CI: 2.48-10.86), and coronary heart disease (HR: 3.46; 95% CI: 1.50-7.97) compared to non-PWS individuals. Somatotropin was prescribed in 63%, antidiabetics in 18%, and thyroid hormones in 16% of the PWS individuals (<1%, 2%, and 3%, respectively, in non-PWS individuals). The rate of mortality was fifteen times higher in PWS than in non-PWS, with a mean age at death of 42 years. <b>Conclusions:</b> The rates of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular comorbidities were higher in individuals with PWS. As expected, the prescription of somatotropin was high, but the endocrine prescription pattern also reflected the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus and thyroid illness. Although the mean age at death was older than previously reported, a higher awareness and intensified efforts to avoid obesity, as well as the prevention and early treatment of cardiovascular and endocrine comorbidity, are crucial aims in the care of people with PWS."

    "abstract": "The treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is still a challenge. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are attractive options, since they effectively reduce weight and improve blood glucose, without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. However, data on their use in PWS are scarce. In 2019, a 27-year-old male came to our Clinic because of first appearance of severe hyperglycemia (fasting plasma glucose 22.5 mmol/L). Based on clinical presentation, PWS was suspected, and diagnosis was confirmed by genetic tests. The patient was discharged on a basal-bolus insulin therapy managed by his parents due to his cognitive impairment. In spite of COVID-19 pandemic, the patient achieved tight glycemic control (HbA1c 41 mmol/mol) with non-severe hypoglycemic events in the face of significant body weight (BW) increase (+ 13 kg vs baseline). Insulin therapy was then discontinued, and once-weekly semaglutide (up to 0,5 mg weekly) was started. At 12-month follow-up, BW dropped from 79 to 73 kg while maintaining excellent glycemic control (HbA1c 40 mmol/mol). At 24-month follow-up, glycemic control remained optimal (HbA1c 38 mmol/mol) with further BW reduction (71 kg). Neither hypoglycemia nor gastro-intestinal or psychiatric adverse events were reported. This case supports the potential use of semaglutide for the treatment of subjects with PWS, obesity and T2D. <i>Ad hoc</i> trials are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability in these subjects."

Herein, we are the first to report a 5-year-old boy with the blended phenotypes of infantile hypotonia, severe neurodevelopmental disorder, patent ductus arteriosus, cryptorchidism, obesity, distinctive facial features, and elevated isovaleryl carnitine. Trio-based whole-exome sequencing was performed on genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples from the boy and his parents. Functional analysis of the <i>IVD</i> variant <i>in vitro</i> was performed. Mutant <i>IVD</i> gene pcDNA3.1(+)-MUT-3xFlag and control pcDNA3.1(+)-WT-3xFlag mammalian expression vectors were constructed. Both vectors were transformed into HEK293T cells. The assays of relative <i>IVD</i> gene mRNA expression, IVD protein expression, and enzymatic activity were used. Whole-exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous missense variant in the <i>IVD</i> gene (NM_002225.5) c.1006T>C (p.Cys336Arg) within a region of homozygosity of 15q11.2-q21.3. Our <i>in vitro</i> functional and computer simulation findings revealed that this variant was associated with haploinsufficiency, which resulted in dramatically reducing the formation of IVD protein due to unstable mutant protein and not a lack of mRNA expression. The boy was diagnosed with the dual genetic disorders of Prader-Willi syndrome and isovaleric acidemia. This case provides a useful reference for genetic counseling for complex and diverse clinical phenotypes. The presence of two or more likely pathogenic or pathogenic variations in an individual with neurodevelopmental phenotypes is not an \"exceptional\" phenomenon."

    "abstract": "Individuals with PWS need constant support and/or supervision, which creates a high caregiver burden on their parents and siblings. Previous research has identified adverse stress outcomes in relatively small and country-specific samples. This study's aims were to examine stress outcomes in a large multi-country sample of parents and siblings and to expand upon previous research by incorporating data on psychosocial factors that may mitigate stress outcomes. The sample comprised 135 parents of a child with PWS, with additional data for 45 siblings as reported by parents. Participants were recruited from 31 countries, spanning Europe, North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australasia, who participated by completing an online questionnaire that included standardised psychometric measures of depression and anxiety (HADS), life stress (PSS), PTSD symptoms (CATS-C) and family cohesion (FACES II). Outcomes were compared to published population norms, and multiple regression was used to investigate the role of potential exacerbating and mitigating factors. Findings revealed high rates of mental pathologies in both parents and siblings. Parents' scores for depression and anxiety indicated high rates of caseness: 67.4% of parents exhibited 'abnormal' levels of anxiety, while 15.6% exhibited 'borderline abnormal' levels; 34.8% exhibited 'abnormal' levels of depression, with 22.2% exhibiting 'borderline abnormal' levels. Younger parents exhibited higher anxiety than older parents (p = 0.007); younger male parents reported higher depression than older male parents (p = 0.029). Parents whose child with PWS lived in the family home exhibited higher depression scores than parents whose child with PWS lived away from home (p = 0.035). Family cohesion was inversely associated with parental depression (p < 0.001) and parental anxiety (p = 0.012), even when statistically controlling for age of parent, age of child with PWS and parental education level. Scores for life stress were markedly higher than population norms, with 88.7% of parents exhibiting 'high' or 'moderate' life stress. Parental life stress was significantly correlated with temper outburst severity in their child with PWS (p < 0.001) and with food problem severity (p < 0.001). All siblings exhibited at least one symptom of PTSD, with 28.9% of siblings exhibiting 'clinically relevant' levels of PTSD symptoms. Sibling PTSD symptom levels were significantly associated with temper outburst severity in the child with PWS (p = 0.025) but not with ratings of food problem severity (p = 0.114). Family cohesion was inversely associated with PTSD symptoms in siblings (p = 0.022). PWS impacts families negatively, and relatives suffer as a result. The findings of this study confirm that parents and siblings of persons with PWS exhibit clinically notable levels of mental pathology. Strategies to enhance family cohesion should be employed to help diminish adverse outcomes among PWS families."

    "abstract": "Wearable technology has potential benefits for clinical measurement with children who have neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, this cohort may experience sensory processing disorder, behavioral dysregulation, and cognitive challenges. For effective and considerate implementation, the experiences and views of parents of children with NDDs on this topic need in-depth investigation. This qualitative semi-structured interview study used purposeful sampling of families with experience with wearable technology in a research setting. The cohort included 12 parents of 14 children with a diagnosis of Fragile X (n = 6), Prader-Willi (n = 4), or Angelman (n = 4) syndromes. The data were processed using NVivo software (QSR International Ltd. 1999-2013). Data analysis was conducted using reflexive thematic analysis. Theme 1: Parents are willing to use wearable technology in the home or community if it is feasible. Aspects of feasibility were the ease of embedding technology into existing routines, device robustness, and device invasiveness. Theme 2: Parents are guided by previous healthcare and research experiences. Wearables were considered low burden in the context of everything else their child experiences through health care. Theme 3: Early engagement with families in the design and research process of new technologies is important. Parents had strong views on how to introduce a wearable to their child. In this article, parents stressed that the child's behavioral phenotype needs to be considered early in the design and rollout phases. A shared decision-making approach between researchers and parents will improve the uptake and success of NDD-focused research adopting wearable technology approaches for clinical measurement."

    "abstract": "Epigenome editing with DNA-targeting technologies such as CRISPR-dCas9 can be used to dissect gene regulatory mechanisms and potentially treat associated disorders. For example, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) results from loss of paternally expressed imprinted genes on chromosome 15q11.2-q13.3, although the maternal allele is intact but epigenetically silenced. Using CRISPR repression and activation screens in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we identified genomic elements that control the expression of the PWS gene SNRPN from the paternal and maternal chromosomes. We showed that either targeted transcriptional activation or DNA demethylation can activate the silenced maternal SNRPN and downstream PWS transcripts. However, these two approaches function at unique regions, preferentially activating different transcript variants and involving distinct epigenetic reprogramming mechanisms. Remarkably, transient expression of the targeted demethylase leads to stable, long-term maternal SNRPN expression in PWS iPSCs. This work uncovers targeted epigenetic manipulations to reprogram a disease-associated imprinted locus and suggests possible therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "For people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, other's perceptions of them based on their condition often begin before birth and go on to impact relationships, opportunities, and self perception across the life course. Search engine results and news media, which may portray these conditions stereotypically or in poor light, are often a key source in these perceptions. Our purpose was to understand how search engine results and available news media can shape perceptions on certain intellectual and developmental disabilities. We developed an online Likert-scale survey to measure differences in perceptions based off first available search engine results, images, and news headlines of four intellectual and developmental disabilities: cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Angelman syndrome. These four conditions were selected to compare less prevalent (Prader-Willi and Angelman) and more prevalent conditions (Down syndrome and cerebral palsy). Perception questions addressed general impression and aspects of the disability experience expected to be impacted by perception from others. We recruited via multiple social media platforms, flyers posted in the Boston area, and word of mouth to local communities and friends. 229 individuals opened the survey, and 125 responses were used in analysis. Mean responses to Prader-Willi syndrome were significantly more negative than responses to cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, and Angelman syndrome across all variables. Responses to Angelman syndrome were also more negative than responses to Down syndrome. Significant differences between conditions found when treating the data as continuous were confirmed when treating the data as ordinal. Lesser-known intellectual and developmental disabilities, such as Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome, are subject to more negative portrayal in media, leading to more negative perception, which may impact social opportunity and quality of life. Combined with our finding that the perception of Prader-Willi syndrome follows the ideals of the medical model of disability more closely than the social model, a need for social model of disability training and education for physicians and other medical providers is clear."

    "title": "Validation of the Food Safe Zone questionnaire for families of individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder, is characterized by hyperphagia and significant behavioral problems. Hyperphagic individuals with PWS are chronically hungry yet rarely feel sated, and often engage in food-seeking behaviors. To avoid life-threatening obesity in their children, families implement food security strategies (e.g., locking food sources, constant supervision around food, alerting others). Although widely used, these strategies have yet to be systematically examined. We thus developed and analyzed the psychometric properties of a new measure of these diverse strategies, the Food Safe Zone, and evaluated them in relation to hyperphagic symptoms and demographic variables. In doing so, we also shine a light on the extraordinary efforts of families in managing their children's hyperphagia. Our team developed 20 FSZ items that were revised for clarity and completeness in an iterative feedback process with stakeholders, including parents, PWS specialists, and individuals with PWS. The FSZ was pilot tested, descriptive findings were reviewed by additional stakeholders, and then administered to 624 parents in a large-scale study. Based on an open-ended question, \"Is there anything else you do to ensure food safety?\" two additional items were added and evaluated in a follow-up study. Principal component analyses revealed that 21 FSZ items loaded onto 5 factors that were readily interpretable, accounting for 67% of test variance: Alerting Others and Food Supervision in the Community; Locking or Restricting Food Sources; Checking for Food; At Home Supervision and Meals; and Avoiding Food Settings. Internal consistency and test-rest reliability were robust. Convergent validity analyses revealed that parents implemented FSZ strategies in response to the severity of their child's hyperphagia, and not their child's age, gender or PWS genetic subtype. The psychometrically sound FSZ holds promise for future research, especially on the effects of food safety tactics on family members. In future clinical trials, the FSZ could also be used to help parents think critically about their food safety tactics in relation to their child's hyperphagia, or as an exploratory endpoint; if hyperphagia is lessened, so too may food safety tactics, thereby enhancing familial quality of life."

We developed novel computational software that employs a targeted approach with region-specific normalisation and calling procedures to detect microdeletion risk in predefined chromosomal regions. The software was developed using 500 NIPT samples and validated on an additional 84 samples, including 34 rare fetal microdeletions confirmed both pre- and postnatally. BinDel correctly identified 30 out of 34 samples with microdeletions, with only three false-positive calls among 50 euploid samples, all latter originating from the Williams-Beuren and Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome-associated microdeletion regions. We confirmed BinDel's feasibility for integrating microdeletion analysis into routine NIPT protocol. This work stands as a unique contribution to prenatal microdeletion screening, providing a novel and readily available software tool that was validated with a large set of actual microdeletion samples, positioning it as the first of its kind in the field.

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the most prevalent cause of syndromic obesity. Obesity development in PWS is driven by dysfunction in neural pathways involved in satiety and reward, dysregulation in hormones regulating satiety and food intake, altered body composition and reduced energy expenditure, as well as the presence of various hormone deficiencies. As hyperphagia, satiety dysfunction and consequent food-seeking behaviors are intrinsic to PWS, obesity management can be challenging. We present a long-term follow-up of treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) semaglutide in three patients with PWS without diabetes, one of whom had previously undergone metabolic surgery. Semaglutide treatment at dosages from 0.5 mg to 2 mg weekly demonstrated variable efficacy, from preventing further weight gain in patient 1, to achieving weight loss of up to 14.4% and 11% relative to baseline, in Patient 2 and Patient 3. It was well tolerated, even after metabolic surgery. Long-term randomized placebo-controlled trials with larger sample sizes are needed to provide stronger evidence on the long-term efficacy and safety of semaglutide for obesity treatment in PWS as well as explore the potential synergistic effects of GLP-1 RA treatment combined with other therapeutic interventions."

The hypothalamus is a crucial integration center for many peripheral and central pathways relating to cardiovascular, metabolic, and behavioral functions and constitutes a potential target for neuromodulation in treatment-refractory conditions. To conduct a systematic review, investigating hypothalamic targets in DBS, their indications, and the primary clinical findings. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched in accordance with the PRISMA guideline to identify papers published in English studying DBS of the hypothalamus in humans. After screening 3,148 papers, 34 studies consisting of 412 patients published over two decades were included in the final review. Hypothalamic DBS was indicated in refractory headaches (n = 238, 57.8%), aggressive behavior (n = 100, 24.3%), mild Alzheimer's disease (n = 58, 14.1%), trigeminal neuralgia in multiple sclerosis (n = 5, 1.2%), Prader-Willi syndrome (n = 4, 0.97%), and atypical facial pain (n = 3, 0.73%). The posterior hypothalamus was the most common DBS target site across 30 studies (88.2%). 262 (63.6%) participants were males, and 110 (26.7%) were females. 303 (73.5%) patients were adults whereas 33 (8.0%) were pediatrics. The lowest mean age of participants was 15.25 ± 4.6 years for chronic refractory aggressiveness, and the highest was 68.5 ± 7.9 years in Alzheimer's disease patients. The mean duration of the disease ranged from 2.2 ± 1.7 (mild Alzheimer's disease) to 19.8 ± 10.1 years (refractory headaches). 213 (51.7%) patients across 29 studies (85.3%) reported symptom improvements which ranged from 23.1% to 100%. 25 (73.5%) studies reported complications, most of which were associated with higher voltage stimulations. DBS of the hypothalamus is feasible in selected patients with various refractory conditions ranging from headaches to aggression in both pediatric and adult populations. Future large-scale studies with long-term follow-up are required to validate the safety and efficacy data and extend these findings."

    "abstract": "Wearable sensors have the potential to transform diagnosis, monitoring, and management of children who have neurological conditions. Traditional methods for assessing neurological disorders rely on clinical scales and subjective measures. The snapshot of the disease progression at a particular time point, lack of cooperation by the children during assessments, and susceptibility to bias limit the utility of these measures. Wearable sensors, which capture data continuously in natural settings, offer a non-invasive and objective alternative to traditional methods. This review examines the role of wearable sensors in various paediatric neurological conditions, including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, as well as Rett syndrome, Down syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy, ataxia, Gaucher disease, headaches, and sleep disorders. The review highlights their application in tracking motor function, seizure activity, and daily movement patterns to gain insights into disease progression and therapeutic response. Although challenges related to population size, compliance, ethics, and regulatory approval remain, wearable technology promises to improve clinical trials and outcomes for patients in paediatric neurology."

    "abstract": "Retrotransposon Gag-like (RTL) 8A, 8B and 8C are eutherian-specific genes derived from a certain retrovirus. They cluster as a triplet of genes on the X chromosome, but their function remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that <i>Rtl8a</i> and <i>Rtl8b</i> play important roles in the brain: their double knockout (DKO) mice not only exhibit reduced social responses and increased apathy-like behaviour, but also become obese from young adulthood, similar to patients with late Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a neurodevelopmental genomic imprinting disorder. Mouse RTL8A/8B proteins are expressed in the prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus and localize to both the nucleus and cytoplasm of neurons, presumably due to the N-terminal nuclear localization signal-like sequence at the N-terminus. An RNAseq study in the cerebral cortex revealed reduced expression of several GABA type A receptor subunit genes in DKO, in particular <i>Gabrb2,</i> which encodes its β2 subunit. We confirmed the reduction of GABRB2 protein in the DKO cerebral cortex by western blotting. As GABRB2 has been implicated in the aetiology of several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, it is likely that the reduction of GABRB2 is one of the major causes of the neuropsychiatric defects in the DKO mice."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder that impacts the musculoskeletal, endocrine, pulmonary, neurologic, ocular, and gastrointestinal systems. In addition, individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome have issues with cognitive development, characteristic behavioral problems, and perhaps most profoundly, appetite control. Currently, the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy for Prader-Willi syndrome is growth hormone, which has been Food and Drug Administration approved for > 20 years for the treatment of growth failure in Prader-Willi syndrome. Growth hormone has shown to improve many aspects of this syndrome, including final height, body composition, developmental milestones, and cognition, but it does not affect hyperphagia, which is the hallmark symptom of this condition. Over the past 15 years, there have been several medication trials for the treatment of hyperphagia in Prader-Willi syndrome, but thus far, all have failed to achieve Food and Drug Administration approval for a variety of reasons. However, hyperphagia is the most life-limiting symptom of Prader-Willi syndrome, thus new pharmacologic therapies are desperately needed.

Other issues in Prader-Willi syndrome that significantly impact quality of life include excessive daytime sleepiness and severe behavioral problems.

    "title": "Modulation of respiration and hypothalamus.",
    "abstract": "The hypothalamus is the gray matter of the ventral portion of the diencephalon. The hypothalamus is the higher center of the autonomic nervous system and is involved in the regulation of various homeostatic mechanisms. It also modulates respiration by facilitating the respiratory network. Among subregions of the hypothalamus, the paraventricular nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, perifornical area, dorsomedial and posterior hypothalamus play particularly important roles in respiratory control. Neurons in these regions have extensive and complex interconnectivity with the cerebral cortex, pons, medulla, spinal cord, and other brain areas. These hypothalamic regions are involved in the maintenance of basal ventilation, respiratory responses to hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions, respiratory augmentation during dynamic exercise, and respiratory modulation in awake and sleep states. Disorders affecting the hypothalamus such as narcolepsy, ROHHAD syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome could lead to respiratory abnormalities. However, the role of the hypothalamus in respiratory control, especially its interplay with other local respiratory networks has not yet been fully elucidated. Further clarification of these issues would contribute to a better understanding of the hypothalamus-mediated respiratory control and the pathophysiology of respiratory disorders underlain by hypothalamic dysfunction, as well as to the development of new targeted therapies."

    "title": "GH Therapy in Non-Growth Hormone-Deficient Children.",
    "abstract": "Before 1985, growth hormone (GH) was extracted from human pituitaries, and its therapeutic use was limited to children with severe GH deficiency (GHD). The availability of an unlimited amount of recombinant GH (rhGH) allowed for investigating the efficacy of its therapeutic use in a number of conditions other than GHD. Nowadays, patients with Turner syndrome, <i>SHOX</i> deficiency, Noonan syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, idiopathic short stature, chronic kidney disease, and children born small for gestational age can be treated with rhGH in order to improve adult height. In patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, rhGH therapy also improves body composition and cognitive function. Large post-marketing multinational studies in a large number of pediatric patients demonstrated a good safety profile for rhGH. Recently, long-acting formulations of rhGH have been approved and licensed for GHD, and clinical trials are ongoing for other conditions. In this paper, we review the rhGH therapy in children with conditions other than GHD."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare, genetically determined neurodevelopmental disorder. Individuals with PWS face numerous challenges that significantly impact their psychological well-being and quality of life, ultimately limiting their personal and social functioning. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of life and psychological well-being in a sample of Italian adult patients with PWS compared to an age-matched control group of normal-weight Italian individuals. <b>Methods</b>: Thirty patients with PWS (11 men and 19 women; mean age ± SD: 36.4 ± 10.31 years; mean Body Mass Index (BMI: 35.7 ± 8.92 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and thirty Italian adult individuals from the general population (5 men and 25 women; mean age ± SD: 32.1 ± 6.86 years; mean Body Mass Index (BMI: 21.8 ± 2.90 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were studied. Quality of life and well-being were assessed using the Italian versions of the 36-item Health Survey Short Form and the Psychological General Well-Being Index. <b>Results</b>: Normal-weight subjects scored significantly higher than PWS patients on the physical health (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and social functioning (<i>p</i> = 0.047) subscales of the SF-36. Conversely, PWS patients scored higher on the vitality subscale (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Similarly, the vitality subscale of the PGWBI was significantly higher in PWS patients than in controls (<i>p</i> = 0.010), whereas the Self-Control subscale of the PGWBI was higher in controls compared to PWS patients, albeit not statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.057). <b>Discussion</b>: Patients with PWS exhibited impairments in various aspects of quality of life and psychological well-being, including physical, behavioral, and social domains. However, the higher vitality scores observed in PWS patients suggest a preserved dimension of their psychological well-being. <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings enhance the understanding of the psychological condition of patients with PWS and provide valuable insights for improving multidisciplinary psychological treatment approaches for these individuals."

    "abstract": "Early onset scoliosis (EOS) has traditionally been an indication for MRI because of its association with neural axis abnormalities (NAAs). Because these abnormalities are often clinically silent and concerns regarding sedation in young children are growing, routine MRI for EOS is debated. This study investigates the current practices of EOS MRI screening among surgeons in the Pediatric Spine Study Group (PSSG). A survey assessing EOS MRI practices was distributed to the PSSG. The survey presented scenarios that varied in age, curve size, and diagnosis and asked which scenarios would indicate an MRI. Respondents also ranked age, curve progression, etiology, and need for sedation by level of importance when considering to order MRI. Age and curve progression were ranked as the most important factors when deciding to order MRI. For all non-congenital scoliosis, increased age and curve size were associated with increased rates of MRI among respondents. For idiopathic EOS, more than 60% of respondents would order MRI for patients with curve magnitudes of 45° regardless of age. All respondents would order MRI for congenital EOS before surgery and for EOS caused by neurofibromatosis. For EOS secondary to cerebral palsy, 61% of respondents would order an MRI, and 34% believe that EOS and Prader-Willi syndrome require MRI. Our results indicate that the MRI screening practices for EOS vary greatly between physicians, as expected. Future research on the prevalence of NAAs in EOS and the clinical outcomes of routine MRI is needed to inform which MRI practices should be standard."

    "abstract": "The impact of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) domain gene expression on the growth of healthy children is not well understood. This study investigated associations between PWS domain gene expression in umbilical cord tissue and prenatal and postnatal growth, considering potential sex differences. Relative gene expression of paternally expressed MAGEL2, NDN, and SNURF-SNRPN, and the small nucleolar RNAs SNORD116 and SNORD115 were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in umbilical cord tissue from 122 healthy newborns (59 girls and 63 boys). Gene expression levels were correlated with auxological measures at birth, infancy, and childhood (ages 2, 4, and 6 years). MAGEL2, NDN, SNORD116, and SNORD115 expression in the umbilical cord was negatively associated with birth weight, length, and placental weight (P < 0.001). Postnatally, these genes were positively associated with weight and length at 3 months (P < 0.001) and weight gain from birth to ages 1, 2, and 4 years (P < 0.01). Negative associations at birth were stronger in girls (P < 0.001), while positive associations during infancy and childhood were stronger in boys (P < 0.001). MAGEL2, SNORD116, and SNORD115 expression predicted early-postnatal growth, explaining the higher growth rate in boys compared to girls and accounting for sex differences up to 1.5 kg in weight and 3 cm in height during infancy. Paternally expressed PWS domain gene expression in the umbilical cord was negatively associated with prenatal growth and positively with early-postnatal growth in healthy infants. This gene expression may predict early human postnatal growth and promote the well-known sex dimorphism in growth. These results can also help in understanding the etiology of PWS, which remains unclear."

    "abstract": "Individuals with Prader Willi syndrome (PWS) often exhibit behavioral difficulties characterized by deficient impulse regulation and obsessive-compulsive features resembling those observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder. The genetic configuration of PWS aligns with molecular and neurophysiological findings suggesting dysfunction in the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneuron system may contribute to its clinical manifestation. In the cerebral cortex, this dysfunction is expressed as desynchronization of local neural activity. We used functional connectivity MRI to examine potential alterations in the local synchrony of the cerebral cortex in PWS. Whole-brain functional connectivity maps were generated using iso-distance average correlation (IDAC) measures in 22 patients with PWS and 22 control participants. Patients with PWS showed reduced local connectivity (weaker synchrony) in frontal areas, including the orbitofrontal cortex, ventral medial and lateral frontal regions, the anterior cingulate cortex, and sensory areas. The presence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms was significantly associated with the degree of functional structure alteration in part of the orbitofrontal and sensory cortices. In addition, abnormally heightened functional connectivity (stronger synchrony) was identified in the posterior cingulate cortex and the bilateral angular gyri, core components of the default mode network, with distance-dependent effects. Our findings of cortical synchrony alterations indicate a degree of overlap with the anatomy of the alterations previously observed in primary obsessive-compulsive disorder, while also suggesting the implication of GABAergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of the disorder. Our observations may support the rational development of more specific therapeutic strategies in the treatment of behavioral disinhibition characteristic of PWS."

This review describes recent advances in genomics and how these expand our understanding of these rare disorders, guiding treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. PWS features include severe infantile hypotonia, failure to thrive, hypogonadism, developmental delay, behavioral and psychiatric features, hyperphagia, and morbid obesity, if unmanaged. AS presents severe intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, seizures, absent speech, and a characteristic happy demeanor. Standard-of-care testing involves SNRPN promoter methylation, microarray and genomic analyses for individuals presenting with these features. These tests identify syndromic-specific DNA methylation patterns and molecular genetic classes responsible for disease etiology. This review provides an update on studies of genotype-phenotype relationships and novel genomic technologies used for diagnostic purposes. We give an overview and update on the genetics and underlying mechanisms associated with symptoms and potential treatments with focus on features reported to be different between specific molecular genetic classes. The review also describes laboratory testing methods for diagnosis of these imprinting disorders with implications for clinical practice."

Standard care of PWS is limited to strict supervision of food intake and GH therapy, highlighting the unmet need for new therapeutic strategies. Environmental enrichment (EE), a housing environment providing physical, social, and cognitive stimulations, exerts broad benefits on mental and physical health. Here we assessed the metabolic and behavioral effects of EE in the Magel2-null mouse model of PWS. EE initiated after the occurrence of metabolic abnormality was sufficient to normalize body weight and body composition, reverse hyperleptinemia, and improve glucose metabolism in the male Magel2-null mice. These metabolic improvements induced by EE were comparable to those achieved by a hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene therapy although the underlying mechanisms remain to be determined. These data suggest biobehavioral interventions such as EE could be effective in the treatment of PWS-related metabolic abnormalities."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder associated with baseline respiratory impairment caused by multiple contributing etiologies. While this may be expected to increase the risk of severe COVID-19 infections in PWS patients, survey studies have suggested paradoxically low disease severity. To better characterize the course of COVID-19 infection in patients with PWS, this study analyses the outcomes of hospitalizations for COVID-19 among patients with and without PWS. The National Inpatient Sample, an all-payors administrative claims database of hospitalizations in the United States, was queried for patients with a coded diagnosis COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021. Hospitalizations for patients with PWS compared to those for patients without PWS using Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighting (AIPW). There were 295 (95% CI: 228-362) COVID-19 hospitalizations for individuals with PWS and 4,112,400 (95% CI: 4,051,497-4,173,303) for individuals without PWS. PWS patients had a median age of 33 years compared to 63 for those without PWS. Individuals with PWS had higher baseline rates of obesity (47.5% vs. 28.4%). AIPW models show that PWS diagnosis is associated with increased hospital length of stay by 7.43 days, hospital charges by $80,126, and the odds of mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death (odds ratios of 1.79 and 1.67, respectively). PWS patients hospitalized with COVID-19 experienced longer hospital stays, higher charges, and increased risk of mechanical ventilation and death. These results suggest that PWS should be considered a risk factor for severe COVID-19, warranting continued protective measures and vaccination efforts. Further research is needed to validate coding for PWS and assess the impact of evolving COVID-19 variants and population immunity on this vulnerable population."

    "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic disease characterized by pathological accumulation of adipose tissue. The exponentially increasing number of children with severe obesity draws attention to the tragic consequences of the lack of, or inadequate treatment of, obesity in this age group. This article aims to present ways of preventing obesity and ways of treating its complications in order to reduce the risk of the life-threatening problems caused by it. The first patient was a 9-year-old boy with Prader-Willi syndrome, severe obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, status post myocarditis, and recurring episodes of desaturation up to 70-80%. Respiratory support using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and two-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) were included in the treatment and the resolution of desaturation was observed. The second patient was a 5-year-old girl with simple obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and subclinical hypothyroidism, hospitalized for sudden cardiac arrest, most likely caused by excessive fat tissue compressing the airway. Despite the introduced treatment, tracheostomy, and tonsillectomy, the girl remained unconscious during hospitalization and in the rehabilitation clinic, where she spent 7 months in a coma. Currently, her health is slowly improving as her weight significantly decreases. In both cases, serious consequences were observed due to non-adherence to dietary recommendations, lack of regular medical check-ups, and failure to implement appropriate treatment. Obesity can lead to life-threatening consequences, including respiratory arrest and a need for respiratory support, if proper treatment is not administered and if medical recommendations are not followed."

We investigated whether whole-genome long-read sequencing could be used as a single data source to simultaneously evaluate copy number variants, single-nucleotide variants, structural variants, and differences in methylation in a cohort of individuals known to have either Prader-Willi or Angelman syndrome. Twenty-five individuals sequenced to an average depth of coverage of 36× on an Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION were evaluated. A custom one-page report was generated that could be used to assess copy number, single-nucleotide variants, and methylation patterns at select CpG sites within the 15q11.2-q13.1 region and prioritize candidate pathogenic variants in UBE3A. After training with three positive controls, three analysts blinded to the known clinical diagnosis arrived at the correct molecular diagnosis for 22 of 22 cases (20 true positive, 2 negative controls). Our findings demonstrate the utility of long-read sequencing as a single, comprehensive data source for complex clinical testing, offering potential benefits, such as reduced testing costs, increased diagnostic yield, and shorter turnaround times, in the clinical laboratory."

Recently, THOC5 was identified as an important regulator in the development of dopaminergic neurons. However, how THOC5 is regulated has not been explored. In this study, we found an interaction between THOC5 and necdin, which is encoded by a gene located in the chromosome deletion region of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), by using a yeast two-hybrid assay. Necdin affects the mRNA export function of THOC5 by regulating its nucleocytoplasmic localization. As a result, the expression of a few DA neuronal development-related genes, such as Mef2c, Lef1 and Prkcg, is altered in necdin-deficient mice. We also found neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons and an increase of glial cells in necdin-deficient mice, which may underlie the dyspraxia behaviors in these mice. Our results thus identified necdin as a novel regulator for THOC5, which may underlie, at least partly, the abnormal DA neuron development in necdin-deficient mice."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by dysplasia in early life. Psychoradiology studies have suggested that mental and behavioral deficits in individuals with PWS are linked to abnormalities in brain structural and functional networks. However, little is known about changes in network-based structural-functional coupling and structural/functional topological properties and their correlations with developmental scales in children with PWS. Here, we acquired diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 25 children with PWS and 28 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, constructed structural and functional networks, examined intergroup differences in structural-functional coupling and structural/functional topological properties (both global and nodal), and tested their partial correlations with developmental scales. We found that children with PWS exhibited (1) decreased structural-functional coupling, (2) a higher characteristic path length and lower global efficiency in the structural network in terms of global properties, (3) alterations in classical cortical and subcortical networks in terms of nodal properties, with the structural network dominated by decreases and the functional network dominated by increases, and (4) partial correlation with developmental scales, especially for functional networks. These findings suggest that structural-functional decoupling and abundant structural/functional network topological properties may reveal the mechanism of early neurodevelopmental delays in PWS from a neuroimaging perspective and might serve as potential markers to assess early neurodevelopmental backwardness in PWS."

This study aimed to assess the integration of Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis into Preimplantation Genetic Testing for Structural Rearrangements (PGT-SR) to assess UPD risk and its impact on selecting euploid embryos for embryo transfer in couples with chromosomal translocations involving imprinted chromosomes. This study evaluated three couples carrying balanced chromosomal translocations: 45,XX,der(13;14)(q10;q10), 46,XX,t(10;11)(q22;q13), and 45,XY,der(14;15)(q10;q10). STR analysis was performed on trophectoderm (TE) biopsies after Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) after PGT-SR analysis using parental blood samples to assess UPD risk in euploid embryos. Haplotyping was conducted with five to six STR markers specific to each rearranged chromosome to detect UPD in euploid embryos. Of the four embryos analyzed across the three families, two couples had euploid embryos that tested negative for UPD. These embryos were successfully transferred, resulting in the birth of two healthy children. In the third family, the euploid embryo also tested negative for UPD but failed to implant after transfer, resulting in no pregnancy. Despite its rarity, UPD involving imprinted chromosomes poses significant clinical risks, as seen in disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. This study highlights the importance of integrating UPD screening into PGT-SR protocols, to detect both heterodisomic and isodisomic UPD events minimizing the risk of severe genetic disorders. Integrating STR-based UPD screening within PGT-SR workflows is a reliable and cost-effective strategy that enhances embryo selection and mitigates the risk of imprinting disorders. This approach improves reproductive outcomes for families with chromosomal rearrangements, offering a practical advancement in assisted reproduction."

    "abstract": "Obesity and weight regulation disorders are determined by the combined effects of genetics and environment. Polygenic obesity results from the combination of common variants in several genes which predisposes the individual to obesity and its related complications. In contrast, monogenic obesity results from changes in single genes, especially those in leptin-melanocortin pathway, and presents with early onset severe obesity, with or without other syndromic features. Rare variants in melanocortin 4 receptor are the commonest form of monogenic obesity. In addition, structural variation in small or large segments of chromosomes may also present with syndromic forms of obesity. Prader-Willi Syndrome, caused by imprinting errors in chromosome 15q11-13, is the most prevalent genetic cause of severe hyperphagia and obesity. With the advances in technologies, the past decade has witnessed a revolution in the identification of novel genetic causes of obesity, primarily in genes related to the leptin melanocortin pathway. The availability of safe melanocortin analogs holds the potential for targeted therapies for some of these disorders. This review summarizes known and novel rare genetic forms of obesity, along with approaches for the clinical investigation of copy number and sequence variants. The goal is to provide a reference for practicing clinicians to encourage genetic testing in obesity. IMPACT: What does this article add to the existing literature? Genetic obesity is an expanding frontier with potential to change management. Here, we summarize current information on the genetic causes of obesity and provide guidance for genetic testing.

Characterized by recurrent upper airway obstruction during sleep, OSA can lead to serious health consequences, including neurocognitive deficits, behavioral issues, and cardiovascular complications. The diagnosis is complicated by symptom overlap with conditions like Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) while polysomnography (PSG) remains the gold standard for diagnosis, access to this test is limited in many regions. Treatment options include lifestyle modifications, surgical interventions like adenotonsillectomy, and non-invasive approaches such as upper airway stenting for patients who are non-compliant with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Evidence indicates that adenotonsillectomy significantly reduces the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy, although residual OSA is common, particularly in high-risk populations like those with Prader-Willi syndrome. Recent studies have explored pharmacological treatments, advanced diagnostic techniques, and machine learning applications to improve outcomes. This review emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary, individualized approach to the management of pediatric OSA, highlighting the need for further research into innovative therapeutic strategies and long-term outcomes for affected children."

Body-Mass-Index (BMI)-SDS for PWS showed no differences between the groups at any time. BMI-SDS-differences showed no influence on differences in SpO2 evaluations. In the genetic subgroup with deletion there was a statistically significant effect on an increased number of OSA (p = 0.027). The genetic subgroup with uniparental disomy (UPD) was associated with a reduced risk of higher HF (p = 0.035) and less hypopnea (p = 0.011). PWS patients predominantly experienced only mild to medium symptoms during COVID-19 infection without necessity of hospitalisation. However, on average three months after infection, differences in PSG evaluations were still apparent, manifesting in lower SpO2 and more frequent hypopnea. A long-lasting impairment of the pulmonary system due to the COVID-19 infection might be responsible."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare disorder that was initially documented by Prader and Willi in 1956. Despite significant advancements in the understanding of PWS over recent decades, no bibliometric studies have been reported on this field. We aimed to analyze and explore the research trends and hotspots of PWS using a bibliometric analysis to understand the future development of basic and clinical research. The literature regarding PWS was retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-Expanded) database. Data were extracted from the articles or review articles, and analyzed using CiteSpace and VOSviewer software. A total of 1,895 related studies have been published in 64 countries or regions. The United States has published the most articles, followed by the United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, and France. University of Florida (The United States), University of Kansas (The United States), University of Alberta (Canada), University of Cambridge (the United Kingdom), and Dutch Growth Research Foundation (Netherlands) were the top five most productive institutions. Butler, Merlin G. and his colleagues have made the most outstanding contributions in the field of PWS research. Keyword co-occurrence analysis showed that genomic imprinting, uniparental disomy, obesity, hyperphagia, hypothalamus, growth hormone treatment, and ghrelin appeared with the higher frequency. Furthermore, oxytocin, magel2, and management were the latest bursts keywords. Our findings indicated that genetic mechanism, diagnose, and emerging therapies will be the hotspots and frontiers in PWS research."

    "abstract": "Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) exhibit hyperphagic behavior, the severity of which varies throughout life. The mechanisms underlying this behavior are still unknown. Asprosin is a new discovered adipokine involved in the regulation of food intake, glucose homeostasis and energy balance. In this study we assessed asprosin serum levels in a cohort of children, adolescents and adults with PWS with the aim to correlate them with hyperphagic behavior, body mass index (BMI) and metabolic parameters, and to evaluate age-related changes. This cross-sectional study included 87 children and adolescents and 31 adults with PWS. Auxological data, fasting levels of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and asprosin were collected, and the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was determined. The 11-item Italian version of the Hyperphagia Questionnaire (HQ) was administered to the parents/caregivers of the patients to assess hyperphagia. Patients were analysed according to age (children < 10 years, adolescents between 10 and 17.9 years, adults ≥ 18 years) or BMI categories [normal weight (NW), overweight (OW), and obesity (OB)]. No significant correlations were found between asprosin levels and cardiometabolic risk factors in the whole cohort. Higher values of asprosin were found in adults compared with adolescents, as well as in the OB group compared to the NW group (p = 0.014). Hyperphagia total score and hyperphagic subdimensions were significantly lower in children compared to adults (p < 0.05). Similarly, hyperphagia total score and hyperphagic subdimensions were significantly lower in the NW group compared to the OB group. Asprosin levels were significantly higher in patients with deletion versus patients with uniparental disomy (p = 0.037). By logistic regression analysis, HQ total score and hyperphagic subdimensions were significantly associated with BMI-SDS independently of age, sex, and asprosin levels. In conclusion, our data demonstrated higher asprosin levels in PWS individuals with OB compared to NW, while differences by age and sex were inconsistent. The lower levels of hyperphagia, BMI-SDS, and metabolic variables in children with PWS compared to adults underline that prevention of obesity should start very early in life and should be maintained over time."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental condition characterized by cognitive disabilities, behavioral problems, hypothalamic dysfunction with obesity, and sleep disorders. A few studies have reported autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Our aim was to investigate dysautonomia by combining sleep studies and standard autonomic testing in regularly followed children with PWS. In this retrospective study, heart rate variability was analyzed during each sleep stage (polysomnography) using time and frequency domains in PWS children (N = 37) compared with age-matched controls (N = 20). Cardiovascular autonomic testing (Ewing tests) and sweating assessment (electrochemical skin conductance) were also performed in patients over 6 years (N = 23). Autonomic testing: Heart rate changes with active standing and with deep breathing were impaired in 47% and 22% of the children, respectively. Asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension (OH) was found in 26%. Baroreflex sensitivity in supine position was in normal range (14.1 ± 6.7 ms/mmHg). Electrochemical skin conductance was normal. Sleep study: 46% of the children with PWS had obstructive sleep apnea and 24% had central sleep apnea. None of these events were observed in the control group. Mean R-R and time domain heart rate variability parameters were significantly lower compared with controls in N2 and Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep stages. Narcoleptic-like phenotype was found in 47% associated with lower low-frequency (LF) power (sympathetic index) in REM sleep. Our study confirms a decreased vagal modulation during both wakefulness and sleep in children with PWS. OH in some patients suggests a sympathetic dysfunction. These changes may contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in PWS."

Therefore, we explored whether people with PWS can accurately identify their true image and how this self-perception is impacted by their neuropsychological profile. This observational study included patients with PWS with regular attendance to transdisciplinary treatment at a center specialized in the management of rare diseases. All patients were evaluated with the Stunkard scale (including silhouettes ranging from extremely skinny to extremely obese) and the WISC-IV and WAIS-III questionnaires, specifically the perceptual reasoning index (PRI). Among the 21 participants, 62% misperceived their body image, most underestimating their body dimensions (actual BMI 28.0±8.3kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs self-perceived BMI 23.2±4.7kg/m<sup>2</sup>, p=0.03). While BMI differences between accurate and inaccurate body image perception were nonsignificant (accurate 26.6±8.8kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs inaccurate 28.9±8.1kg/m<sup>2</sup>, p=0.56), individuals with accurate perception showed both higher PRI scores (accurate 67.6±8.2 vs inaccurate 60.2±7.2, p=0.043) and, to a lesser extent, intelligence quotients (IQ) (accurate 60.0±4.9 vs inaccurate 55.0±7.5, p=0.079). In this study, we identified distortion of body image perception as a very common finding among PWS patients, in most cases as underestimation, and influenced by the neuropsychological profile."

    "abstract": "In the snoRNA host gene SNHG14, 29 consecutive introns each generate SNORD116, and 48 tandem introns encode SNORD115. Loss of SNORD116 expression, but not of SNORD115, is linked to the neurodevelopmental disease Prader-Willi syndrome. SNORD116 and SNORD115 resemble box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) but lack known targets. Both were strongly accumulated during neuronal differentiation, but with distinct mechanisms: Increased host-gene expression for SNORD115 and apparent stabilization for SNORD116. For functional characterization we created cell lines specifically lacking the expressed, paternally inherited, SNORD115 or SNORD116 cluster. Analyses during neuronal development indicates changes in RNA stability and protein synthesis. These data suggest that the loss of SNORD116 enhances some aspects of developmental timing of neuronal cells. Altered mRNAs include MAGEL2, causal in the PWS-like disorder Schaaf-Yang syndrome. Comparison of SNORD115 and SNORD116 mutants identifies small numbers of altered mRNAs and ncRNAs. These are enriched for functions potentially linked to PWS phenotypes and include protocadherins, which are key cell signalling factors during neurodevelopment."

    "title": "RNAi Knockdown of <i>EHMT2</i> in Maternal Expression of Prader-Willi Syndrome Genes.",
    "abstract": "Euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2, also known as G9a) is a mammalian histone methyltransferase that catalyzes the dimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9). On human chromosome 15, the parental-specific expression of Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS)-related genes, such as <i>SNRPN</i> and <i>SNORD116</i>, are regulated through the genetic imprinting of the PWS imprinting center (PWS-IC). On the paternal allele, PWS genes are expressed whereas the epigenetic maternal silencing of PWS genes is controlled by the EHMT2-mediated methylation of H3K9 in PWS-IC. Here, we measured the effects of RNA interference of EHMT2 on the maternal expression of genes deficient in PWS in mouse model and patient iPSC-derived cells. We used small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides and lentiviral short harpin RNA (shRNA) to reduce <i>Ehtm2</i>/<i>EHMT2</i> expression in mouse <i>Snord116</i> deletion primary neurons, PWS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line and PWS iPSC-derived neurons. We then measured the expression of transcript or protein (if relevant) of PWS genes normally silenced on the maternal allele. With an approximate reduction of 90% in <i>EHMT2</i> mRNA and more than 80% of the EHMT2 protein, we demonstrated close to a 2-fold increase in the expression of maternal transcripts for <i>SNRPN</i> and <i>SNORD116</i> in PWS iPSCs treated with si<i>EHMT2</i> compared to PWS iPSC siControl. A similar increase in <i>SNORD116</i> and <i>SNRPN</i> RNA expression was observed in PWS iPSC-derived neurons treated with sh<i>EHMT2</i>. RNAi reduction in EHMT2 activates maternally silenced PWS genes. Further studies are needed to determine whether the increase is therapeutically relevant. This study confirms the role of EHMT2 in the epigenetic regulation of PWS genes."

Although substantial progress has been made in treating rare diseases, many patients have unmet medical sleep needs, and current regulatory policy makes it prohibitively difficult to address those needs medically. This opinion reviews the rare disease experience with sleep disorders and explores potential solutions. First, we provide case profiles for the rare diseases Wilson's Disease, Angelman Syndrome, and Prader-Willi Syndrome. These profiles highlight challenges in rare disease diagnosis and barriers to pinpointing disease pathophysiology, including biomarkers that intersect with sleep disorders. Second, we transition to a bird's eye view of sleep disorders and rare diseases by reporting input from a stakeholder discussion with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding abnormal sleep patterns in various rare diseases. Last, in response to the profound unmet medical needs of patients with rare diseases and sleep disorders, we propose adapting and using the clinical trial design known as a \"basket trial\". In this case, a basket trial would include patients with different rare diseases but the same debilitating symptoms. This research approach has the potential to benefit many rare disease patients who are otherwise left with profound unmet medical needs."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by neonatal hypotonia, followed by hyperphagia and obesity. Most PWS cases exhibit megabase-scale deletions of paternally imprinted 15q11-q13 locus. However, several PWS patients have been identified harboring much smaller deletions encompassing the SNORD116 gene cluster, suggesting these genes are direct drivers of PWS phenotypes. This cluster contains 30 copies of individual SNORD116 C/D box small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Many C/D box snoRNAs have been shown to guide chemical modifications of RNA molecules, often ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Conversely, SNORD116 snoRNAs show no significant complementarity to rRNA and their targets are unknown. Since many reported PWS cases lack their expression, it is crucial to identify the targets and functions of SNORD116. To address this we modeled PWS in two distinct human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines with two different sized deletions, differentiated each into neurons, and compared differential gene expression. This analysis identified a novel set of 42 consistently dysregulated genes. These genes were significantly enriched for predicted SNORD116 targeting and we demonstrated impacts on FGF13 protein levels. Our results demonstrate the need for isogenic background comparisons and indicate a novel gene regulatory network controlled by SNORD116 is likely perturbed in PWS patients."

    "abstract": "Homologous to the C-terminus of E6AP (HECT) and RCC1-like domain (RLD)-containing protein 2 (HERC2) is a large, 528 kDa E3 ubiquitin ligase that is associated with cancer, oculocutaneous albanism type 2, Prader-Willi syndrome, and other neurological diseases. HERC2 has been found to contribute to double-stranded DNA break repairs, tumor suppression, maintaining centrosome architecture, and ubiquitylation. The C-terminal portion of the HECT domain (C-lobe) of HERC2 is responsible for transferring ubiquitin to a substrate but the precise function of the other eight domains in HERC2 are unknown. Interestingly, HERC2 contains a unique and negatively charged C-terminal tail adjoined to the C-lobe that is predicted to act as a linker to promote interactions between HERC2 and its binding partners. This study aims to better understand the function and relevance of HERC2 in disease by investigating the structural aspects of the HERC2 C-lobe and HERC2 C-terminal tail using AlphaFold followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and circular dichroism (CD). Secondary structure content analysis from MD simulations and the fully resonance assigned <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra of the HERC2 C-lobe and the isolated C-terminal tail confirm that the C-lobe is well-folded but the C-terminal tail is disordered. CD melting curves indicate that the flexible C-terminal tail provides improved stability to the C-lobe. Additionally, MD simulations have identified that the interaction between residues D4829 and R4728 is prevalent among the non-bonded contacts between the tail and the C-lobe. Overall, our results demonstrate that the negatively charged C-terminal tail is disordered, provides stability to the C-lobe, and may act as a flexible scaffold for protein-protein interactions."

Among all ventilated patients at our Center from January 2012 to December 2022, we retrospectively included children with a cAHI ≥ 1 events/h on baseline poly(somno)graphic study. Additional parameters assessed included the underlying disease, type of ventilation (non-invasive vs. invasive), age at ventilation onset, ventilation mode, and transcutaneous capnometry parameters. To assess the effectiveness of ventilation on central apneas, we compared the cAHI at baseline and on ventilation. Sixty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria for central apnea (cAHI > 1 events/h). Diagnoses included hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, 15 (22.4%); Ondine syndrome, 14 (20.9%); polymalformative syndrome, 10 (14.9%); Prader-Willi syndrome, 8 (11.9%); brain tumor, 6 (9.0%); Down syndrome, 4 (6.0%); ROHHAD syndrome, 2 (3.0%); other infrequent pathologies were, Arnold-Chiari II, primary central apnea, epilepsy, lisosomal diseases, hydrocephalus, myopathy, obesity, Rett Syndrome. Pressure-supported ventilation (PSV) was the most common mode used (45 out 67 patients, 67.2%), followed by pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) (15 out 67 patients, 22.4%) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (7 out 67 patients, 10.4%). Statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) in cAHI was observed in patients with polymalformative syndrome (3.5 vs. 0.3, p = 0.01), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (3.1 vs. 0.1, p = < 0.01), and Prader-Willi syndrome (3.5 vs. 0.1, p = 0.03), while there was no significant improvementn in children with brain tumor (6.2 vs. 1.5, p = 0.21). Central apneas are present in children with various underlying pathologies. Ventilatory strategies tailored to the specific diagnosis and severity of central apneas yield significant improvements in cAHI. PSV was the preferred ventilation mode in this study and there was notable effectiveness across different diagnostic categories. PCV was employed in most severe cases. CPAP was exclusively used in patients with predominantly obstructive sleep apneas."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are imprinting disorders caused by genetic or epigenetic aberrations of 15q11.2-q13. Their clinical testing is often multitiered; diagnostic testing begins with methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification or methylation-sensitive PCR and then proceeds to molecular subtyping to determine the mechanism and recurrence risk. Currently, correct classification of a proband's PWS/AS subtype often requires parental samples, a costly process for families and health systems. The use of nanopore sequencing for molecular diagnosis of PWS and AS has been explored by Yamada <i>et al</i>; however, to confirm heterodisomy parental data were still required. Here, we investigate genome-wide nanopore sequencing in a larger cohort of PWS (18) and AS (6) as a singular test to detect the molecular subtype, without parental data. We accurately subtyped these cases including uniparental heterodisomy, mixed iso-/heterodisomy, type 1 and 2 deletions, microdeletion and <i>UBE3A</i> indels. One PWS case with a previously unresolved diagnosis subtyped as maternal isodisomy. This work highlights the application of long-read sequencing and other imprinted regions outside of the PWS/AS critical region to resolve the molecular diagnosis and subtyping of PWS and AS without parental data. The work also outlines an approach to generically detect heterodisomy through the interrogation of distant imprinted regions."

    "abstract": "Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that is an increasingly recognized cause of acute behavioural changes in children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Literature suggests that catatonia can present differently in this population and can be missed due to diagnostic overshadowing. Catatonia is a treatable condition, and management strategies in children with NDD include benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Untreated, it can cause significant morbidity including severe medical complications, and therefore timely recognition and management of catatonia in children and adolescents with NDD is essential. In this case series, we present three cases of children ages 7, 14, and 10, with diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome, respectively. All were admitted to a pediatric inpatient unit for acute behavioural regression. Each had symptoms consistent with catatonia, resulting in trials of benzodiazepine therapy with inadequate response, and were then treated with bilateral ECT. In all cases, marked improvement was noted after ECT, with no apparent adverse effects. The cases are used to highlight the nuances of diagnosis and management of catatonia in children and adolescents with NDD. This includes insights on how presentations of catatonia may differ in this population, challenges with the use of available diagnostic tools, and how these patients may respond differently to recommended treatments such as benzodiazepines. The case series aims to increase clinicians' awareness of pediatric catatonia when children and adolescents with NDD present with acute behavioural changes, and to encourage consideration of the full spectrum of treatments, including bilateral ECT."

    "abstract": "Obesity is a silent global pandemic. It is a condition associated with multiple risk factors and adverse outcomes that arise from the intertwined relationship between environmental factors and genetics. The genetic factors that cause phenotypic expression are variable. Monogenic obesity is a severe early-onset and rarer form of obesity, which presents with co-morbidities such as abnormal feeding behaviour. Monogenic obesity causes impaired weight regulation in the hypothalamus due to defects in the leptin-melanocortin signalling pathway. The emergence of a new therapeutic treatment, the melanocortin-4 receptor agonist setmelanotide (originally RM-493), has represented a breakthrough in the management of monogenic obesity and has raised hope in managing complex obesity. This review provides an overview of the setmelanotide trials that have taken place, as well as its mechanism of action, side effects and weight loss outcomes that led to its approval in the treatment of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) deficiency. It also explores setmelanotide's role in other genetic forms of obesity, such as hypothalamic obesity, Prader-Willi syndrome, Alström syndrome and other rare genetic conditions that are being investigated. This review aims to help to understand the pathophysiology of genetic obesity and aid in future treatment options for people with severe, complex genetic obesity."

This retrospective cohort study included ≥2 years of age children who had obesity and genetically confirmed Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) or were non-PWS obese children. Out of 267 children, 58 children met inclusion criteria. Clinical data and records of standard overnight polysomnography (PSG) were collected and compared between groups during the study. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was identified in 97.2 % non-PWS obese children and 72.7 % PWS children (p = 0.072). Central sleep apnea (CSA) events were more commonly found in children with PWS (p = 0.035, OR 4.35, CI 95 % 1.05-18.03) as well as sleep-related hypoventilation (p = 0.016, OR 4.66, CI 95 % 1.26-17.34). Sleep efficiency was higher in PWS patients (p = 0.038). Sleep fragmentation was significantly associated with higher AHI only in non-PWS obese children (p = 0.027). In the PWS group patients, a moderate correlation was found between BMI and age (p = 0.025, r = 0.559, CI 95 % 0.087-0.826) as well as AHI and age (p = 0.003, r = 0.686, CI 95 % 0.232-0.895). Non-PWS obese children, similar to those with PWS, exhibit a high risk of SRBDs. Although CSA and sleep-related hypoventilation may occur more frequently in patients with PWS, OSA remains the predominant disorder. Both patient groups are advised to undergo PSG due to the significant risk of SRBDs, particularly during adolescence."

Each occurs at an approximate incidence of 1/15,000 to 1/30,000 live births and has a range of debilitating phenotypes. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been valuable tools to understand human-relevant gene regulation at this locus and have contributed to the development of therapeutic approaches for AS. Nonetheless, gaps remain in our understanding of how these deletions contribute to dysregulation and phenotypes of AS and PWS. Variability across cell lines due to donor differences, reprogramming methods, and genetic background make it challenging to fill these gaps in knowledge without substantially increasing the number of cell lines used in the analyses. Isogenic cell lines that differ only by the genetic mutation causing the disease can ease this burden without requiring such a large number of cell lines. Here, we describe the development of isogenic human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines modeling the most common genetic subtypes of AS and PWS. These lines allow for a facile interrogation of allele-specific gene regulation at the chromosome 15q11-q13 locus. Additionally, these lines are an important resource to identify and test targeted therapeutic approaches for patients with AS and PWS."

Specific breakpoints (BP1-BP5) that lead to deletions and duplications of variable size have been identified. Additionally, this specific region contains several imprinted genes, giving rise to complex syndromes (Prader-Willi, Angelman and 15q11-q13 duplication syndromes). 15q11.2-q13 duplication syndrome has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (hypotonia, developmental delay, speech delay and seizures) and ASD but is characterized by variable expressivity and reduced penetrance, features that make genetic counseling a complex procedure especially in prenatal cases. In the present study, a total of 14 pre- and postnatal cases were diagnosed as 15q11.2q13 duplication carriers using Affymetrix CytoScan 750 K array-CGH, and our analysis combined these with 120 cases existing in the literature. The inheritance pattern of the cases of this study is unknown, but as a review of the literature revealed, 62.96% of the affected carriers inherited the duplicated area from their mother. The combined results of this analysis (the present study and the literature) show that in the majority of the cases, the phenotype is a compound phenotype, with clinical characteristics that include ASD, intellectual disability, developmental delay and an absence of speech. The aim of this paper is to deliver new possibilities to genetic counseling that can be provided in prenatal and postnatal cases as the phenotype of 15q11.2q13 microduplication carriers cannot be fully predicted; so, clinical diagnoses should be a combination of molecular findings and clinical manifestations that are present."

The sample recruited at the Division of Auxology, IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano, was composed of 30 adult subjects with PWS (11 men and 19 women; mean age ± SD: 36.4 ± 10.31 years; mean Body Mass Index (BMI): 35.7 ± 8.92: kg/m2) and their caregivers (10 men and 20 women). To assess the psychological condition of caregivers, the Italian-validated versions of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Coping Orientation to the Problems Experiences (COPE) were used, while to assess the psychological well-being of individuals with PWS and their caregivers, the Italian validated version of the Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) was used. Depression (p < 0.001), Stress (p = 0.050), and Total score (p = 0.009) of DASS 21 were higher in the caregivers of subjects with PWS than in the general population. PGWBI scores of caregivers were significantly lower than in individuals with PWS in Positive Well-being (p < 0.001), General Health (p = 0.006), Vitality (p = 0.004), and the total score (p = 0.006). The depression subscale of PGWBI was higher in caregivers than in subjects with PWS. Correlations between the subscales of COPE and the total score of PGWBI in caregivers revealed that the Avoidance subscale of COPE had a negative significant correlation with the total score of PGWBI (p = 0.003). Our results highlighted several critical insights into the profound emotional and psychological challenges faced by the caregivers of individuals with PWS."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder characterised by hyperphagia, intellectual disability and increased propensity to a range of medical disorders. To better characterise the clinical presentation of PWS across the lifespan, this study reports on the demographics and clinical diagnosis of individuals with PWS hospitalised in the United States. The National Inpatient Sample, an all-payor administrative claims database of hospitalisations in the United States, was queried for patients with a coded diagnosis of PWS from October 2019 through December 2021. Hospitalisations for patients with PWS were matched to five non-PWS hospitalisations based on age, sex, year and hospital characteristics. There were 4400 (95% CI: 3,885 to 4,915) PWS hospitalisations, with a median age of 24. Compared to controls, PWS hospitalisations had longer hospital stays (median 5 vs. 3 days) and higher in-hospital mortality (2.2% vs. 1.3%). Infectious (19.0%) and respiratory (16.2%) diagnoses were most common for PWS patients. Codes for overweight or obesity were present in 38.1% of PWS hospitalisations, with Hispanic ethnicity was associated with a higher odds of overweight/obesity in PWS patients (aOR 1.73; 95% CI: 1.11-2.71). PWS hospitalisations are characterised by higher healthcare utilisation and complexity compared to matched controls. The high prevalence of obesity and significant rates of infectious and respiratory conditions highlight specific health challenges for PWS patients. Validation of the Q87.11 administrative claims code is an essential step for ongoing health services research in this condition."

Down syndrome was excluded from this analysis of less well-known genetic diagnoses. At least two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, read full-text articles, and extracted data. Of 89 full-text articles, 79 met inclusion criteria. Studies included 544 individuals aged 1 month to 63 years with Kabuki, 49, XXXXY, Prader-Willi, PURA, Koolen de Vries, Emanuel, TRPM3, Wolf-Hirschhorn, and other rare syndromes. Most diagnoses may be associated with a combination of differences in hip structure or stability that are evident at birth, or develop in early infancy, with increasing hip dysplasia and subluxation over time. Joint or ligamentous laxity was most reported along with hypotonia and hypermobility as risk factors. Limited data were identified about conservative or surgical intervention and outcomes in these populations. Children with significant hypotonia, with or without a confirmed genetic diagnosis, are at increased risk of hip problems that may be missed with standard neonatal screening. Ultrasound is recommended between 6 weeks and 6 months, and annual orthopaedic review with regular radiographs for older children and adults with significant and persistent hypotonia."

    "abstract": "Confronting oxytocin and vasopressin deficits in autism spectrum disorders and rare syndromes brought promises and disappointments for the treatment of social disabilities. We searched downstream of oxytocin and vasopressin for targets alleviating social deficits in a mouse model of Prader-Willi syndrome and Schaaf-Yang syndrome, both associated with high prevalence of autism. We found a population of neurons in the lateral septum-activated on termination of social contacts-which oxytocin and vasopressin inhibit as per degree of peer affiliation. These are somatostatin neurons expressing oxytocin receptors coupled to GABA-B signaling, which are inhibited via GABA-A channels by vasopressin-excited GABA neurons. Loss of oxytocin or vasopressin signaling recapitulated the disease phenotype. By contrast, deactivation of somatostatin neurons or receptor signaling alleviated social deficits of disease models by increasing the duration of contacts with mates and strangers. These findings provide new insights into the treatment framework of social disabilities in neuropsychiatric disorders."

MKRN1 contributes to the tumor growth suppression, energy metabolism, anti-pathogen defense, and apoptosis and has a broad variety of targets, including hTERT, APC, FADD, p21, and various viral proteins. MKRN2 regulates cell proliferation, inflammatory response; its targets are p65, PKM2, STAT1, and other proteins. MKRN3 is a master regulator of puberty timing; it controls the levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the arcuate nucleus neurons. MKRN4 is the least studied member of the MKRN protein family, however, it is known to contribute to the T cell activation by ubiquitination of serine/threonine kinase MAP4K3. Proteins of the MKRN family are associated with the development of numerous diseases, for example, systemic lupus erythematosus, central precocious puberty, Prader-Willi syndrome, degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, inflammation, and cancer. In this review, we discuss the functional roles of all members of the MKRN protein family and their involvement in the development of diseases."

These clinical features arise from disruptions in neurodevelopment and neuroendocrine regulation, yet the molecular intricacies of PWS remain incompletely understood. <b>Methods</b>: This study aimed to comprehensively profile circulating neuromodulatory factors in the serum of 53 subjects with PWS and 34 patients with non-syndromic obesity, utilizing a proximity extension assay with the Olink Target 96 neuro-exploratory and neurology panels. The ANOVA <i>p</i>-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamani-Hochberg method. Protein-protein interaction networks were generated in STRING V.12. Corrplots were calculated with R4.2.2 by using the Hmisc, Performance Analytics, and Corrplot packages <b>Results</b>: Our investigation explored the potential genetic underpinnings of the circulating protein signature observed in PWS, revealing intricate connections between genes in the PWS critical region and the identified circulating proteins associated with impaired oxytocin, NAD metabolism, and sex-related neuromuscular impairment involving, CD38, KYNU, NPM1, NMNAT1, WFIKKN1, and GDF-8/MSTN. The downregulation of CD38 in individuals with PWS (<i>p</i> < 0.01) indicates dysregulation of oxytocin release, implicating pathways associated with NAD metabolism in which KYNU and NMNAT1 are involved and significantly downregulated in PWS (<i>p</i> < 0.01 and <i>p</i> < 0.05, respectively). Sex-related differences in the circulatory levels of WFIKKN1 and GDF-8/MSTN (<i>p</i> < 0.05) were also observed. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study highlights potential circulating protein biomarkers associated with impaired oxytocin, NAD metabolism, and sex-related neuromuscular impairment in PWS individuals with potential clinical implications."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder marked by disruptions in circadian rhythms and autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, hyperphagia, and episodes of emotional outbursts. Previous trials suggest that both invasive and non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce emotional outbursts in PWS, potentially through its effects on vagal activity. This case series investigated the effects of transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) on cardiac markers of circadian vagal activity, specifically heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate (HR), and their potential links to improvements in emotional outbursts. Five individuals with PWS (mean age: 26.9 years; 3 males, 2 females) received four hours of daily taVNS for 12 months, followed by one month of two-hour daily sessions. Outcome measures included daily recording of emotional outbursts and every three months 24-h HRV and HR recordings. Mixed cosinor models were applied to analyze changes in circadian rhythms of HRV and HR. A linear mixed model was used to assess the predictive value of cardiac vagal activity on emotional outbursts. Circadian amplitudes of HRV and HR were significantly higher at the end of the treatment compared to baseline (all p's < .01). There was a significant increase in the rhythm-adjusted mean of HRV (p < .01), while the rhythm-adjusted HR mean significantly decreased, both indicating increased cardiac vagal activity. Higher rhythm-adjusted mean HRV predicted a lower number of emotional outbursts. The results suggest that taVNS may be effective by targeting ANS activity in individuals with PWS, contributing to improvements in behavioral regulation."

Once a PWS diagnosis is established, sharing diagnosis information with an affected child can be challenging due to its early age of onset and diverse phenotype. This mixed-methods study aimed to evaluate how parents and guardians have shared a PWS diagnosis with their child and examine the motivating and influencing factors behind their disclosure. Parents and guardians of children with PWS aged at least 5 years completed a survey, and a select group completed an interview. A total of 51 surveys and 15 interviews were completed, with the majority of participants (n = 46; 90%) having shared at least some diagnosis information with their child. Parents and guardians were more likely to disclose if they self-reported a higher level of knowledge about PWS (p = 0.004) and if their child is currently older (p = 0.02) and/or has at least one sibling (p = 0.046). Interview analysis revealed 15 themes and 10 subthemes that illustrated parents' motivations, methods, and experiences with disclosure. This research provides information for others considering disclosure of PWS or another rare diagnosis with their child."

    "abstract": "The International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) Telehealth (TH) Task Force explored the use of TH for improving diagnosis, care, research, and education for rare diseases (RDs). The Task Force reviewed related literature published from January 2017 to August 2023, and identified various models and implementation strategies of TH for RD. The Task Force highlighted the reported value and benefits of using TH for RDs, along with the limitations and opportunities. The number of publications sharply increased since 2021, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the rapid adoption of TH in many healthcare settings. One of the major benefits of TH for RDs lies in its capacity to surmount geographical barriers, which helps in overcoming the constraints posed by limited numbers and geographical dispersion of specialists. This was evident during the pandemic when TH was used to maintain a level of continued medical care and research when face-to-face visits were severely restricted. TH, through which clinical research can be decentralized, can also facilitate and enhance RD research by decreasing burden, expanding access, and enhancing efficiency. This will be especially beneficial when coupled with the adoption of digital health technologies, such as mobile health (mHealth) and wearable devices for remote monitoring (i.e., surveillance of outpatient data transmitted through devices), along with big data solutions. TH has also been shown to be an effective means for RD education and peer mentoring, enabling local health care providers (HCPs) to care for RD patients, which indirectly ensures that RD patients get the expertise and multidisciplinary care they need. However, limitations and weaknesses associated with using TH for RD care and research were also identified, including the inability to perform physical examinations and build relationships with HCPs. Therefore, TH has been recommended as a complement to, rather than substitute for, face-to-face consultations. There is also a concern that TH may lead to an amplification of health disparities and inequities related to social determinants of health for those with RDs due to lack of access to TH technologies, inadequate digital literacy, and geographical, socio-cultural, and linguistic barriers. Finally, the Task Force also discussed evidence and knowledge gaps that will benefit from future research efforts to help advance and expand the use of TH for RD care, research, and education."

To report safety and effectiveness data for children with PWS treated with biosimilar rhGH (Omnitrope<sup>®</sup>, Sandoz) in the PAtients TReated with Omnitrope (PATRO) Children study. PATRO Children was a multicenter, non-interventional, postmarketing surveillance study. Children with PWS received Omnitrope according to standard clinical practice. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored for the duration of Omnitrope treatment. Effectiveness outcomes were also assessed, including height standard deviation (SD) scores (HSDS). As of July 2020 (study completion), 235 patients with PWS had been enrolled. At baseline, 95.7% (<i>n</i> = 225) of patients were prepubertal and 86.4% (<i>n</i> = 203) were rhGH treatment-naïve. At analysis, the median (range) treatment duration in the study was 56.8 (2.9-155.8) months. AEs were reported in 192 patients (81.7%) and were suspected as treatment-related in 39 patients (16.6%). Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 96 patients (40.9%) and were suspected as treatment-related in 22 patients (9.4%). The most frequent treatment-related SAEs were sleep apnea syndrome (<i>n</i> = 11; 4.7%), tonsillar hypertrophy (<i>n</i> = 4; 1.7%), and adenoidal hypertrophy (<i>n</i> = 4; 1.7%). Development of scoliosis was considered treatment-related in two patients; development of impaired glucose tolerance in one patient and type 2 diabetes mellitus in another patient were considered treatment-related. Effectiveness outcomes were primarily assessed in 153 patients who completed 3 years of treatment. Among the 151 prepubertal patients (135 treatment-naïve), mean (SD) change from baseline in HSDS after 3 years was +1.50 (1.07) across all patients and +1.57 (1.07) for treatment-naïve patients. These data suggest that biosimilar rhGH is well tolerated and effective in patients with PWS managed in real-life clinical practice. Patients with PWS should continue to be closely monitored for well-known safety issues (including respiratory, sleep, and glucose metabolism disorders, and scoliosis) during rhGH treatment."

However, integrated methylation analysis for DMRs and sequence analysis for MLID-causative genes in MLID cases and their mothers have been performed only in a single study focusing on Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) phenotypes. Of 783 patients with various IDs we have identified to date, we examined a total of 386 patients with confirmed epimutation and 71 patients with epimutation or uniparental disomy. Consequently, we identified MLID in 29 patients with epimutation confirmed by methylation analysis for multiple ID-associated DMRs using pyrosequencing and/or methylation-specific multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification. MLID was detected in approximately 12% of patients with BWS phenotype and approximately 5% of patients with SRS phenotype, but not in patients with Kagami-Ogata syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, or Angelman syndrome phenotypes. We next conducted array-based methylation analysis for 78 DMRs and whole-exome sequencing in the 29 patients, revealing hypomethylation-dominant aberrant methylation patterns in various DMRs of all the patients, eight probably deleterious variants in genes for SCMC in the mothers of patients, and one homozygous deleterious variant in ZNF445 in one patient. These variants did not show gene-specific methylation disturbance patterns. Clinically, neurodevelopmental delay and/or intellectual developmental disorder (ND/IDD) was observed in about half of the MLID patients, with no association with the identified methylation disturbance patterns and genetic variants. Notably, seven patients with BWS phenotype were conceived by assisted reproductive technology (ART). The frequency of MLID was 7.5% (29/386) in IDs caused by confirmed epimutation. Furthermore, we revealed diverse patterns of hypomethylation-dominant methylation defects, nine deleterious variants, ND/IDD complications in about half of the MLID patients, and a high frequency of MLID in ART-conceived patients."

Retrospective study of all fetuses diagnosed with ADV between January 2013 and December 2022 in a tertiary center. ADV was diagnosed in 33 fetuses. The diagnosis was made at a mean gestational age of 21.2 ± 8.4 weeks. Conventional karyotype was applied in a single fetus (3.0%), CMA was applied in 21 fetuses (66.7%), and five fetuses (22.8%) were additionally tested with ES. ADV was isolated in eight fetuses (24%), whereas in 25 (76%) it was associated with abnormal ultrasound findings, including increased nuchal translucency (NT), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and variable structural malformations, mostly cardiac (42%) followed by central nervous system (CNS) and skeletal malformations (24%). Genetic abnormalities were found in six fetuses out of 22 investigated (27%), of which 3 were detected by ES, 3 by CMA and 1 by conventional karyotype. A higher incidence of genetic aberrations was evident among ADVs associated with abnormal ultrasound findings. Genetic abnormalities were indicative of Prader Willi/Angelman syndrome, Noonan syndrome, CASK related disorder, 16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome and Trisomy 21. ADV associated with abnormal ultrasound findings is commonly correlated with genetic abnormalities and consequently unfavorable pregnancy outcomes. Our study emphasizes the value of genetic studies chiefly among cases associated with abnormal ultrasound findings, enabling early diagnosis of fetal pathologies associated with ADV, and providing better parental counseling."

This study aimed to examine how different PWS genotypes influence the outcome of rhGH treatment in children with PWS. A review was conducted on 146 Chinese children with PWS, genetically classified and monitored from 2017 to 2022. Unaltered and modified generalized estimating equations (GEE) were employed to examine the long-term patterns in primary outcomes (growth metrics) and secondary outcomes (glucose metabolism metrics and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)) during rhGH therapy. The study also evaluated the prevalence of hypothyroidism, hip dysplasia, and scoliosis before and after rhGH treatment. Children with PWS experienced an increase in height/length standard deviation scores (SDS) following rhGH administration. The impact of rhGH therapy on growth measurements was similar in both the deletion and maternal uniparental diploidy (mUPD) cohorts. Nevertheless, the deletion group was more prone to insulin resistance (IR) compared to the mUPD group. No significant variations in growth metrics were noted between the two groups (P > 0.05). At year 2.25, the mUPD group showed a reduction in fasting insulin (FINS) levels of 2.14 uIU/ml (95% CI, -4.26, -0.02; P = 0.048) and a decrease in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) of 0.85 (95% CI, -1.52, -0.17; P = 0.014) compared to the deletion group. Furthermore, there was a decrease in the IGF standard deviation scores (SDS) by 2.84 (95% CI, -4.84, -0.84; P = 0.005) in the mUPD group during the second year. The frequency of hip dysplasia was higher in the mUPD group compared to the deletion group (P < 0.05). rhGH treatment effectively increased height/length SDS in children with PWS, with similar effects observed in both deletion and mUPD genotypes. Children with mUPD genetype receiving rhGH treatment may experience enhanced therapeutic effects in managing PWS."

    "abstract": "Recombinant human growth hormone therapy (rhGH) has been widely accepted as the safe treatment for short stature in children with such genetic syndromes as Prader-Willi syndrome and Turner or Noonan syndrome. Some patients with short stature and rare genetic syndromes are treated with rhGH as growth hormone-deficient individuals or as children born small for their gestational age. After years of experience with this therapy in syndromic short stature, it has been proved that there are some aspects of long-term rhGH treatment beyond growth promotion, which can justify rhGH use in these individuals. This paper summarizes the data of a literature review of the effects of rhGH treatment beyond growth promotion in selected genetic syndromes. We chose three of the most common syndromes, Prader-Willi, Turner, and Noonan, in which rhGH treatment is indicated, and three rarer syndromes, Silver-Russel, Kabuki, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, in which rhGH treatment is not widely indicated. Many studies have shown a significant impact of rhGH therapy on body composition, resting energy expenditure, insulin sensitivity, muscle tonus, motor function, and mental and behavioral development. Growth promotion is undoubtedly the primary benefit of rhGH therapy; nevertheless, especially with genetic syndromes, the additional effects should also be considered as important indications for this treatment."

The inability to recognise facial expressions of emotion is an apparent social cognition deficit in people diagnosed with PWS. The main objective of the present study is to compare the ability to recognise emotional facial expression, in both non-contextualised and contextualised scenarios, among the main subtypes of PWS and a control group. The sample consisted of 46 children divided into three groups: deletion (n = 10), maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD) (n = 13) and control (n = 23). The protocol included the Facially Expressed Emotion Labeling and the Deusto-e-Motion 1.0. The control group recognised facial emotions more accurately and quickly in both non-contextualised and contextualised scenarios than children with PWS, regardless of genetic subtype. Despite no differences being detected between PWS subtypes when non-contextualised scenarios were analysed, in contextualised situations, a longer reaction time was observed in children with the mUPD subtype. This is the first study to assess the ability to recognise emotional facial expressions in contextualised situations among PWS subtypes and a control group. The findings suggest that some of the social cognitive deficits evidenced in children with mUPD PWS may be similar to those in autism spectrum disorder."

While this may be expected to increase the risk of severe COVID-19 infections in PWS patients, survey studies have suggested paradoxically low disease severity. To better characterize the course of COVID-19 infection in patients with PWS, this study analyzes the outcomes of hospitalizations for COVID-19 among patients with and without PWS. The National Inpatient Sample, an all-payors administrative claims database of hospitalizations in the United States, was queried for patients with a coded diagnosis COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021. Hospitalizations for patients with PWS compared to those for patients without PWS using Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighting (AIPW). There were 295 (95% CI: 228 to 362) COVID-19 hospitalizations for individuals with PWS and 4,112,400 (95% CI: 4,051,497 to 4,173,303) for individuals without PWS. PWS patients had a median age of 33 years compared to 63 for those without PWS. Individuals with PWS had higher baseline rates of obesity (47.5% vs. 28.4%). AIPW models show that PWS diagnosis is associated with increased hospital length of stay by 7.43 days, hospital charges by $80,126, and the odds of mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death (odds ratios of 1.79 and 1.67, respectively). PWS patients hospitalized with COVID-19 experienced longer hospital stays, higher charges, and increased risk of mechanical ventilation and death. PWS should be considered a risk factor for severe COVID-19, warranting continued protective measures and vaccination efforts. Further research is needed to validate coding for PWS and assess the impact of evolving COVID-19 variants and population immunity on this vulnerable population."

    "abstract": "Despite therapy with growth hormone (GH) in children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), low bone mineral density and various orthopedic deformities have been observed often. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze bone markers, with an emphasis on vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDPs), in normal-weight children with PWS undergoing GH therapy and a low-energy dietary intervention. Twenty-four children with PWS and 30 healthy children of the same age were included. Serum concentrations of bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), osteocalcin (OC), carboxylated-OC (Gla-OC), undercarboxylated-OC (Glu-OC), periostin, osteopontin, osteoprotegerin (OPG), sclerostin, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I), and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) were determined using immunoenzymatic methods. OC levels and the OC/CTX-I ratios were lower in children with PWS than in healthy children (<i>p</i> = 0.011, <i>p</i> = 0.006, respectively). Glu-OC concentrations were lower (<i>p</i> = 0.002), but Gla-OC and periostin concentrations were higher in patients with PWS compared with the controls (<i>p</i> = 0.005, <i>p</i> < 0.001, respectively). The relationships between IGF-I and OC (<i>p</i> = 0.013), Gla-OC (<i>p</i> = 0.042), and the OC/CTX-I ratio (<i>p</i> = 0.017) were significant after adjusting for age in children with PWS. Bone turnover disorders in children with PWS may result from impaired bone formation due to the lower concentrations of OC and the OC/CTX-I ratio. The altered profile of OC forms with elevated periostin concentrations may indicate more intensive carboxylation processes of VKDPs in these patients. The detailed relationships between the GH/IGF-I axis and bone metabolism markers, particularly VKDPs, in children with PWS requires further research."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to increase our understanding of cardiac activity abnormalities in Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) and the relationship between cardiac activity, PWS behaviours thought to be associated with cardiac vagal tone and endogenous oxytocin and vasopressin levels. We compared cardiac activity (respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), low-frequency heart rate variability (LF-HRV), heart period) in 30 adolescents and adults with PWS to 30 typically developing age-matched controls. RSA, LF-HRV, and heart period were lower in individuals with PWS than in the control group. In the control group, RSA was higher for females than males. However, for those with PWS, there was no difference between the sexes. Individuals with the mUPD genetic subtype had lower RSA and LF-HRV than participants with the PWS deletion subtype and compared to typically developing controls, no difference was found between the latter two groups. Heart period was also lower for those with mUPD compared to controls. Higher RSA reduced the odds of having temper outbursts and skin-picking. RSA was lower in those with PWS and psychosis compared to those with PWS without psychosis. Finally, we found RSA correlated with vasopressin for those with mUPD but not deletion. There was no relationship between RSA and oxytocin plasma or saliva levels. Our findings suggest autonomic dysfunction in PWS that is more marked in mUPD than deletion and potentially due to greater loss of parasympathetic activity in mUPD."

    "title": "Parent-of-origin-specific DNA replication timing is confined to large imprinted regions.",
    "abstract": "Genomic imprinting involves differential DNA methylation and gene expression between homologous paternal and maternal loci. It remains unclear, however, whether DNA replication also shows parent-of-origin-specific patterns at imprinted or other genomic regions. Here, we investigate genome-wide asynchronous DNA replication utilizing uniparental human embryonic stem cells containing either maternal-only (parthenogenetic) or paternal-only (androgenetic) DNA. Four clusters of imprinted genes exhibited differential replication timing based on parent of origin, while the remainder of the genome, 99.82%, showed no significant replication asynchrony between parental origins. Active alleles in imprinted gene clusters replicated earlier than their inactive counterparts. At the Prader-Willi syndrome locus, replication asynchrony spanned virtually the entirety of S phase. Replication asynchrony was carried through differentiation to neuronal precursor cells in a manner consistent with gene expression. This study establishes asynchronous DNA replication as a hallmark of large imprinted gene clusters."

    "title": "Deciphering the physiopathology of neurodevelopmental disorders using brain organoids.",
    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) encompass a range of conditions marked by abnormal brain development in conjunction with impaired cognitive, emotional and behavioural functions. Transgenic animal models, mainly rodents, traditionally served as key tools for deciphering the molecular mechanisms driving NDD physiopathology and significantly contributed to the development of pharmacological interventions aimed at treating these disorders. However, the efficacy of these treatments in humans has proven to be limited, due in part to the intrinsic constraint of animal models to recapitulate the complex development and structure of the human brain but also to the phenotypic heterogeneity found between affected individuals. Significant advancements in the field of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a promising avenue for overcoming these challenges. Indeed, the development of advanced differentiation protocols for generating iPSC-derived brain organoids gives an unprecedented opportunity to explore human neurodevelopment. This review provides an overview of how 3D brain organoids have been used to investigate various NDD (i.e. Fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, Angelman syndrome, microlissencephaly, Prader-Willi syndrome, Timothy syndrome, tuberous sclerosis syndrome) and elucidate their pathophysiology. We also discuss the benefits and limitations of employing such innovative 3D models compared to animal models and 2D cell culture systems in the realm of personalized medicine."

    "abstract": "Cohen syndrome (CS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder marked by developmental delays, distinct facial features, and a variety of systemic manifestations. We present a case of a 28-year-old male previously misdiagnosed with Prader-Willi syndrome who exhibited recurrent generalized weakness, fever, fatigue, and significant hemoglobin drops requiring multiple blood transfusions due to thalassemia major. The patient displayed characteristic CS features, including developmental delays, distinct facial characteristics, morbid obesity, and heterochromia iridis. Severe gastrointestinal bleeding led to a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) via colonoscopy. Management included blood transfusions, hydrocortisone, mesalamine, and azathioprine, resulting in stabilized UC and improved overall health. CS presents with a spectrum of clinical features that overlap with other syndromic conditions, necessitating careful differential diagnosis. Early diagnosis and supportive care significantly improve quality of life and help manage complications effectively."

    "abstract": "This study aims to explore the food management strategies among caregivers/family members of children with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) using the lens of 'familialisation' of a health problem and the sociology of food socialization. Food intake among individuals with PWS is a main concern for parents, caregivers, and medical practitioners as it affects their physical, mental, and social well-being throughout their lives. Earlier studies on PWS and food intake centered around dietary management, dietary intake and growth, nutritional treatment and pharmacological approaches, nutritional phases, and weight gain. However, little has been done to understand the challenges of managing children with PWS from the sociological lens of food management strategies and socialization among families in Malaysia. This study is based on an investigation involving eight children with PWS and 46 family members and caregivers through lab observations and reflexive interviews. Ten food management strategies were identified that were adopted by the caregivers and families, which were influenced by cultural factors, family norms, and formal and informal support systems. The findings will influence future behavioral interventions to ensure the empowerment and well-being of individuals with PWS and their families."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder typically characterized by decreased social interaction, hyperphagia, poor behavioral control and temper tantrums, together with a high risk of morbid obesity unless food intake is controlled. The genetic defects that cause PWS include paternal 15q deletion (estimated in 60% of cases), chromosome 15 maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) (estimated in 35% of cases) and imprinting defects and translocations. Several studies indicate an oxytocin deficiency in PWS. Oxytocin is a hypothalamic nonapeptide with receptors located in the brain and in various other tissues in the body. It acts as a neuropeptide in several brain areas of great importance for behavioral and metabolic effects, as well as a neurohypophyseal hormone released into the circulation. Oxytocin in both rats and humans has strong and long-lasting behavioral and metabolic effects. Thus, an oxytocin deficiency might be involved in several of the behavioral and metabolic symptoms characterizing PWS. Treatment with oxytocin has, in some studies, shown improvement in psycho-social behavior and hyperphagia in individuals with PWS. This review focus on the behavioral and metabolic effects of oxytocin, the symptoms of a potential oxytocin deficiency in PWS and the effects of oxytocin treatment."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS, MIM 176,270) and Angelman syndrome (AS, MIM 105,830) are caused by imprinting defects of chromosome 15q11-13, with loss of maternal gene expression causing AS and paternal gene expression causing PWS. The diagnosis, once established in most cases by using a methylation-specific PCR test, enables appropriate therapeutic interventions and avoids the need for further investigations. Genetic testing for PWS/AS is limited in Sri Lanka (and in other low- and middle-income countries), mainly because parents are unable to pay for testing as these are not funded by the health service. Ninety cases (46 female) with clinical features suggesting PWS (n = 37) and AS (n = 53), referred by a pediatric endocrinologist and a pediatric neurologist, were recruited. Clinical information and blood samples were obtained following informed consent. DNA was extracted and methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) was performed following bisulfite modification of DNA by using an in-house method and a kit. Results were validated using known positive controls. Parent-child trio DNA samples were used in cases with confirmed PWS and AS to determine if the disease was due to a deletion or uniparental disomy. The cost of the MS-PCR testing of the two modification methods and the microsatellite analysis was determined. Among the suspected PWS cases, 19/37 were positive, while 5/53 of the suspected AS cases were positive. The lower identification rate of AS is probably related to the overlap of clinical features of this condition with other disorders. The kit-based modification method was more reliable, less time-consuming, and cost-effective in our laboratory. The kit-based modification followed by MS-PCR described in this study enables more affordable genetic testing of suspected PWS/AS cases, and this is likely to improve patient care by targeting appropriate therapy for the affected cases. Parental genetic counselling is made possible regarding the low recurrence risk, especially where a deletion or uniparental disomy is confirmed. In MS-PCR, negative cases with a strong clinical suspicion of AS, UBE3A mutation testing is required. In addition, imprinting center mutation/deletion testing may also be needed in strongly clinically suspected, MS-PCR negative PWS and AS cases."

Among thyroid nodular diseases, Plummer's adenoma occurs very rarely in pediatrics, and currently, there is no literature providing evidence of this diagnosis in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We report the case of a 9-year-old Caucasian boy affected by PWS presenting with a rapidly growing palpable mass in the thyroid lodge associated with subclinical hyperthyroidism. Laboratory and other examinations (thyroid ultrasound, fine-needle aspiration of the nodule, and scintigraphy) were strongly suggestive for Plummer's adenoma; therefore, the patient underwent left hemithyroidectomy surgery, and anatomo-pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis. Our case describes the first evidence of an isolated follicular adenoma in children with PWS. Surgery is the only therapeutic option in younger children. Further evidence is needed to assess the possible correlation between these two conditions and the existence of potential risk factors."

The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) is a standardized rating scale for assessing problematic behaviors in persons with developmental disabilities. Our study aims to describe ABC scores in youth with PWS and track their change over time. The analysis included 69 patients. Mean ABC scores were compared in four age groups (5-8, 9-12, 13-16, and 17-22 years). A statistically significant difference was found only in the Irritability subscale, with lower scores in the 5-8 age group compared to the 9-12 age group. For change over time, scores for Irritability, Lethargy, Stereotypic Behavior, Hyperactivity subscales, and Total score were likely to decrease after age 12. Irritability subscale scores of males were predicted to increase more than those of females between ages of 5 and 12 . The Lethargy score in the nondeletion group had a greater reduction than the deletion group in the 12-20 year range. This study highlights the need for systematic collection and characterization of behavioral data given the burden of maladaptive behaviors that often persist for a lifetime."

Notably, many characteristic symptoms of PWS are correlated with locus coeruleus norepinephrine system (LC-NE) dysfunction, including impairment in arousal, learning, pain modulation, and stress-induced negative affective states. Although electrophysiological experiments in necdin-deficient mice, an established PWS animal model, have revealed decreased spontaneous neuronal firing activity in the LC and impaired excitability, the behavioral phenotypes related to LC-NE dysfunction remain unexplored. In this study, heterozygous necdin-deficient mice (B6.Cg-Ndn<sup>tm1ky</sup>) were bred from wild-type (WT) females to generate WT (+m/+p) and heterozygous (+m/-p) animals. Compared to WT mice, Ndn + m/-p mice demonstrated impaired visual-spatial memory in the Y-maze test, reduced social interaction, impaired sexual recognition, and shorter falling latency on the Rotarod. Using the open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze (EPM), we observed similar locomotion activity of Ndn + m/-p and WT mice, but Ndn + m/-p mice were less anxious. After acute restraint, Ndn + m/-p mice exhibited significant impairment in stress-induced anxiety. Additionally, the plasma norepinephrine surge following exposure to acute restraint stress was also impaired. Pretreatment with atomoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor aimed to enhance LC function, restored Ndn + m/-p mice to exhibit a normal response to acute restraint stress. Furthermore, by employing chemogenetic approaches to facilitate LC neuronal firing, post-stress anxious responses were also partially rescued in Ndn + m/-p mice. These data strongly suggest that LC dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of stress-related neuropsychiatric symptoms in PWS. Manipulation of LC activity may hold therapeutic potential for patients with PWS."

    "abstract": "Pseudohypoparathyroidism, newly classified as inactivating PTH/PTHrP signaling disorder (iPPSD) type 2 or type 3, is a rare disease caused by defects in the GNAS imprinted gene that encodes Gsα. The most common phenotype comprises resistance to hormones binding to G protein-coupled receptors such as PTH, PTHrP, or TSH, subcutaneous ossifications, short stature, brachydactyly, and early onset obesity. Uncommon features have been described including sleep apnea, asthma, and resistance to calcitonin. At the national French reference center for rare calcium and phosphate metabolism diseases, a large cohort of patients with iPPSD type 2 and type 3 is followed. Interestingly, digestive manifestations and in particular intractable constipation were regularly reported by families of children with iPPSD type 2 or type 3. The aim of our study was therefore to specify the frequency and characteristics of digestive manifestations in children followed up for iPPSD2 or iPPSD3 in our reference center. Thirty-six patients aged between 2 and 18 years (32 followed up for iPPSD2 and 4 for iPPSD3) were included. Parents completed a specific questionnaire to assess any digestive disorders in their child. The diagnosis of constipation was established using the Bristol visual scale in the event of a score of less than 2 according to stool appearance. Parents reported constipation through the questionnaires in 22/36 (over 60%) of the children. It was the most frequently reported digestive disorder. Among these 22 children, 19 (87%) had a Bristol score for stool shape and texture between 1 and 2 on a scale of 7, confirming constipation. Dedicated treatment had been initiated for 10 (55%) of them, yet only 3 families (16%) considered this treatment effective. Neonatal vomiting and eating disorders, such as lack of satiety or food selectivity, were also noted in 18 (50%) of patients, as was gastroesophageal reflux present in the neonatal period in 14 (40%) of children. There were no significant differences according to the type of iPPSD or patient age. Our work shows for the first time that digestive manifestations, including constipation, occur frequently in children followed for iPPSD, suggesting a potential role of Gsα and G protein receptors in the digestive tract. It is well known that constipation and digestive symptoms alter quality of life. Early management is therefore essential to improve the quality of life of children followed for iPPSD. Our data need to be confirmed on a larger cohort."

    "abstract": "Obesity among adolescents poses a significant global health concern with profound short- and long-term impact on physical and mental well-being. The intricate relationship between obesity and the onset of diabetes remains ambiguous, particularly in cases where the manifestation may differ from that observed in individuals with uncomplicated obesity. Herein, we present the case of a 14-year-old male adolescent with Prader-Willi phenotype and subsequent obesity, exhibiting symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia over a 10-day period, indicative of potential diabetes mellitus (DM). Laboratory assessments revealed a hemoglobin A1c level of 10%, confirming the suspected diagnosis. Notably, despite the absence of ketosis, elevated C-peptide levels and the presence of slightly positive islet-cell antibodies warranted further investigation. While the presence of antibodies typically aligns with a diagnosis of type 1 DM, recent research has highlighted the occurrence of anti-insulin pancreatic cell antibodies in type 2 DM cases. This article aims to delve into the multifaceted issues surrounding adolescent obesity, atypical presentations of DM with positive antibodies, and the long-term management of patients with genetic syndromes."

Such rare disorders may have overlapping phenotypes, despite their distinct genetic etiology. One unique aspect of rare neurological diseases is their potential common association with altered epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic mechanisms include regulatory processes that control gene expression and cellular phenotype without changing the composition of the corresponding DNA sequences. Epigenetic factors include three types of proteins, the \"readers, writers, and erasers\" of DNA and DNA-bound proteins. Thus, epigenetic impairments of many neurological diseases may contribute to their pathology and manifested phenotypes. Here, we aim to provide a comprehensive review on the general etiology of selected rare neurological diseases, that include Rett Syndrome, Prader-Willi Syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome, Huntington's disease, and Angelman syndrome, with respect to their associated aberrant epigenetic mechanisms."

However, results can be unclear, and a plan for second-tier analysis must be determined based on the patient's biochemical results and clinical presentation - in many cases, triggering a diagnostic odyssey. A male patient from the United States presenting with unexplained developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, and feeding difficulties was referred for clinical genetic evaluation at age 8 months. Biochemical testing revealed an isolated marked elevation of glutaric acid on urine organic acid profile, without elevations of related metabolites. Further testing included <i>GCDH</i> sequencing, a neurometabolic gene panel, chromosomal microarray, Prader Willi/Angelman testing, and lysosomal disease enzyme panel, all of which were non-diagnostic. The patient had persistent developmental delay and hypotonia, dystonia, sensorineural hearing loss, and abnormal brain myelination on magnetic resonance imaging. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed and revealed a dual diagnosis of glutaric aciduria III (GA III) and <i>BCAP31-</i>related disorder, an X-linked intellectual disability syndrome, caused by a novel pathogenic variant. GA III has historically been considered clinically benign, with few reported cases. This patient's presenting symptoms were similar to those commonly seen in GA I and GA II, however the biochemical abnormalities were not consistent with these disorders, prompting additional molecular and biochemical testing. Ultimately, WES confirmed a diagnosis of <i>BCAP31</i>-related syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, which explained the patient's presenting symptoms. WES also identified a secondary diagnosis of GA III. We present a patient with two rare genetic conditions, highlighting the importance of deep phenotyping and the utility of WES in the setting of a patient with dual genetic diagnoses."

The aims of this study were to assess GH prescribing practices and growth outcomes over time, the prevalence and predictors of scoliosis in GH-treated PWS children, and the near-final height of GH-treated PWS patients. This is a retrospective, descriptive study evaluating data from all clinic visits of patients aged 0-18 years with PWS, seen through the Children's Hospital at Westmead between March 1992 and May 2022 (n=75). A total of 64 patients were treated with GH (visits = 1,414). In the recent decade, the diagnosis of PWS and GH commencement were made significantly earlier in life. The prevalence of scoliosis was 41 %, in which age was the only significant predictor for scoliosis (odds ratio 1.19: 95 % CI [1.08-1.31; p=0.001]) adjusted for other predictors. In patients with data available at the age 16 years (23/28 treated with GH), those who were GH treated had significantly higher height SDS vs. nontreated group (SDS -0.67 vs. -2.58; p=0.0001) and lower BMI SDS (1.18 vs. 2.37; p<0.001). Significant improvements in growth and body composition were seen in the GH-treated group vs. non-treated group of children with PWS. There were no significant modifiable clinical predictors of scoliosis in children with PWS, but our findings confirm the high prevalence of scoliosis in GH-treated children with PWS reinforcing the need for close surveillance."

Growth hormone (GH) treatment may impact the thyroid hormone axis by direct inhibition of T4 or TSH secretion or by increased peripheral conversion of free T4 (FT4) to T3. The objective of this study is to evaluate thyroid function during GH treatment in a large group of children with PWS. Serum FT4, T3, and TSH are measured in a 2-year randomized controlled GH trial (RCT) and 10-year longitudinal GH study (GH treatment with 1.0 mg/m²/day [∼0.035 mg/kg/day]). Forty-nine children with PWS were included in the 2-year RCT (median [interquartile range, IQR] age: GH group 7.44 [5.47-11.80] years, control group 6.04 [4.56-7.39] years). During the first 6 months, median (IQR) FT4 standard deviation score (SDS) decreased in the GH group from -0.84 (-1.07 to -0.62) to -1.32 (-1.57 to -1.08) (P < .001) and T3 SDS increased from 0.31 (-0.01-0.63) to 0.56 (0.32-0.79) (P = .08), while in the control group, FT4 and T3 SDS remained unchanged. In our 10-year GH study, 240 children with PWS (median [IQR] age: 1.27 (0.54-4.17) years] were included. Between 2 and 10 years, median (IQR) FT4 SDS remained unchanged, being -0.87 (-0.98 to -0.77) after 2 years and -0.88 (-1.03 to -0.74) after 10 years (P = .13). TSH SDS decreased from -0.35 (-0.50 to -0.21) after 2 years to -0.68 (-0.84 to -0.53) after 10 years (P < .001). Our findings suggest that GH treatment decreases FT4 levels, due to increased peripheral conversion of FT4 to T3 in the first months of treatment, but thereafter, FT4 and T3 normalize and remain stable during long-term GH treatment in almost all children and adolescents with PWS."

    "abstract": "Human cell line models, including the neuronal precursor line LUHMES, are important for investigating developmental transcriptional dynamics within imprinted regions, particularly the 15q11-q13 Angelman (AS) and Prader-Willi (PWS) syndrome locus. AS results from loss of maternal UBE3A in neurons, where the paternal allele is silenced by a convergent antisense transcript UBE3A-ATS, a lncRNA that terminates at PWAR1 in non-neurons. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the exclusive and progressive increase in UBE3A-ATS in differentiating LUHMES neurons, validating their use for studying UBE3A silencing. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses revealed changes to 11 834 genes during neuronal differentiation, including the upregulation of most genes within the 15q11-q13 locus. To identify dynamic changes in chromatin loops linked to transcriptional activity, we performed a HiChIP validated by 4C, which identified two neuron-specific CTCF loops between MAGEL2-SNRPN and PWAR1-UBE3A. To determine if allele-specific differentially methylated regions (DMR) may be associated with CTCF loop anchors, whole genome long-read nanopore sequencing was performed. We identified a paternally hypomethylated DMR near the SNRPN upstream loop anchor exclusive to neurons and a paternally hypermethylated DMR near the PWAR1 CTCF anchor exclusive to undifferentiated cells, consistent with increases in neuronal transcription. Additionally, DMRs near CTCF loop anchors were observed in both cell types, indicative of allele-specific differences in chromatin loops regulating imprinted transcription. These results provide an integrated view of the 15q11-q13 epigenetic landscape during LUHMES neuronal differentiation, underscoring the complex interplay of transcription, chromatin looping, and DNA methylation. They also provide insights for future therapeutic approaches for AS and PWS."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is caused by loss of expression of paternally expressed genes in the human 15q11.2-q13 imprinting domain. A set of imprinted genes that are active on the paternal but silenced on the maternal chromosome are intricately regulated by a bipartite imprinting center (PWS-IC) located in the PWS imprinting domain. In past work, we discovered that euchromatic histone lysine N-methyltransferase-2 (EHMT2/G9a) inhibitors were capable of un-silencing PWS-associated genes by restoring their expression from the maternal chromosome. Here, in mice lacking the <i>Ehmt2</i> gene, we document un-silencing of the imprinted <i>Snrpn/Snhg14</i> gene on the maternal chromosome in the late embryonic and postnatal brain. Using PWS and Angelman syndrome patient derived cells with either paternal or maternal deletion of 15q11-q13, we have found that chromatin of maternal PWS-IC is closed and has compact 3D folding confirmation. We further show that a new and distinct noncoding RNA preferentially transcribed from upstream of the PWS-IC interacts with EHMT2 and forms a heterochromatin complex to silence gene expression of <i>SNRPN</i> in CIS on maternal chromosome. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that allele-specific recruitment of EHMT2 is required to maintain the maternal imprints. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights and support a new model for imprinting maintenance of the PWS imprinted domain."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare disorder characterised by varying nutritional phases that occur throughout the lifespan, ranging from failure to thrive to hyperphagia. If uncontrolled, the imbalance between energy intake and expenditure results in obesity development and increased morbidity and mortality risk. Although measures of energy requirements for accurate nutrition assessment are vital, the evidence appears sparse and heterogeneous; hence, the aim of this review was to examine the available literature on energy expenditure predicted or measured using various methods in individuals with PWS. Studies were sought that presented methods and results on resting energy expenditure or basal metabolic rate. A narrative synthesis was completed to present the study characteristics and results. Methods of determining energy requirements included predictive equations and indirect calorimetry. Differences amongst ages, growth hormone therapy, fasting status, and measures in which results were presented were limitations to appropriately summarising and identifying trends in energy expenditure. Indirect calorimetry was identified as the most accurate method; however, it is not widely available in all settings. Further research is encouraged to support the development of valid and reliable predictive equations that will better inform and improve the efficiency of clinical practice in supporting people with PWS."

    "title": "Should we routinely assess hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome?",
    "abstract": "It has been reported that central adrenal insufficiency (CAI) in pediatric patients (pts) with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) may be a potential cause of their sudden death. In addition, the risk of CAI may increase during treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH). To prevent both over- and undertreatment with hydrocortisone, we evaluated the prevalence of CAI in a large multicenter cohort of pediatric pts with PWS analyzing adrenal response in the low-dose ACTH test (LDAT) and/or the glucagon stimulation test (GST) and reviewing the literature. A total of 46 pts with PWS were enrolled to the study, including 34 treated with rhGH with a median dose of 0.21 mg/kg/week. LDAT was performed in 46 pts, and GST was carried out in 13 pts. Both tests were conducted in 11 pts. The tests began at 8:00 a.m. Hormones were measured by radioimmunoassays. Serum cortisol response >181.2 ng/mL (500 nmol/L) in LDAT and >199.3 ng/mL (550 nmol/L) in GST was considered a normal response. Additionally, cortisol response delta (the difference between baseline and baseline) >90 ng/mL and doubling/tripling of baseline cortisol were considered indicators of normal adrenal reserve. Three GSTs were not diagnostic (no hypoglycemia obtained). LDAT results suggested CAI in four pts, but in two out of four pts, and CAI was excluded in GST. GST results suggested CAI in only one patient, but it was excluded in LDAT. Therefore, CAI was diagnosed in 2/46 pts (4.3%), 1 treated and 1 untreated with rhGH, with the highest cortisol values of 162 and 175 ng/dL, but only in one test. However, in one of them, the cortisol delta response was >90 ng/mL and peak cortisol was more than tripled from baseline. Finally, CAI was diagnosed in one patient treated with rhGH (2.2%). We present low prevalence of CAI in pediatric pts with PWS according to the latest literature. Therefore, we do not recommend to routinely screen the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) in all pts with PWS, both treated and untreated with rhGH. According to a review of the literature, signs and symptoms or low morning ACTH levels suggestive of CAI require urgent and appropriate diagnosis of HPAA by stimulation test. Our data indicate that the diagnosis of CAI should be confirmed by at least two tests to prevent overtreatment with hydrocortisone."

    "title": "Puberty in girls with Prader-Willi syndrome: cohort evaluation and clinical recommendations in a Latin American tertiary center.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by hypothalamic-pituitary deficiencies including hypogonadism. In girls with PWS, hypogonadism can present early in childhood, leading to genital hypoplasia, delayed puberty, incomplete pubertal development, and infertility. In contrast, girls can present with premature activation of the adrenal axis leading to early pubarche and advanced bone age. We aim to evaluate the progression of puberty and adrenarche signals in girls with PWS. A longitudinal retrospective cohort study included girls with PWS followed at a Pediatric Endocrinology Outpatient Clinic in a Tertiary University Hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil from 2002 to 2022. Data collected via chart review included clinical information on birth history, breast and pubic hair Tanner stages, presence of genital hypoplasia, age at menarche, regularity of menstrual cycles, body mass index (BMI) z-score, final height, age of initiation of estrogen replacement and growth hormone replacement, as well as results for PWS genetic subtype; biochemical investigation (LH, FSH, estradiol, DHEA-S); radiographic bone age and pelvic ultrasound. A total of 69 girls were included in the study and the mean age of puberty onset was 10.2 years in those who started puberty after the age of 8 years. Breast Tanner stage IV was reached by 29.1% girls at a mean age of 14.9 years. Spontaneous menarche was present in 13.8% and only one patient had regular menstrual cycles. Early adrenarche was seen in 40.4% of cases. Our study demonstrated in a large sample that girls with PWS often present with delayed onset of puberty despite frequent premature adrenarche. Based on our results, we suggest an estrogen replacement protocol for girls with PWS to be started at the chronological age or bone age of 12-13 years, taking into consideration the uterus size. Further prospective studies are needed."

    "title": "Feasibility, safety, and efficacy of dietary or lifestyle interventions for hypothalamic obesity: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "A dysfunctional hypothalamus may result in decreased feelings of satiety (hyperphagia), decreased energy expenditure, and increased fat storage as a consequence of hyperinsulinemia. Hypothalamic dysfunction may thus lead to morbid obesity and can be encountered in childhood as a consequence of congenital, genetic, or acquired disorders. There is currently no effective treatment for hypothalamic obesity (HO). However, comparable to alimentary obesity, dietary and lifestyle interventions may be considered the cornerstones of obesity treatment. We questioned the effect of dietary or lifestyle interventions for HO and systematically searched the literature for evidence on feasibility, safety, or efficacy of dietary or lifestyle interventions for childhood hypothalamic overweight or obesity. A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE (including Cochrane Library), EMBASE, and CINAHL (May 2023). Studies assessing feasibility, safety, or efficacy of any dietary or lifestyle intervention in children with hypothalamic overweight or obesity, were included. Animal studies, studies on non-diet interventions, and studies with no full text available were excluded. Because the number of studies to be included was low, the search was repeated for adults with hypothalamic overweight or obesity. Risk of bias was assessed with an adapted Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Level of evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. Descriptive data were described, as pooled-data analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of included studies. In total, twelve studies were included, with a total number of 118 patients (age 1-19 years) of whom one with craniopharyngioma, one with ROHHAD-NET syndrome, 50 with monogenic obesity, and 66 with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Four studies reported a dietary intervention as feasible. However, parents did experience difficulties with children still stealing food, and especially lowering carbohydrates was considered to be challenging. Seven studies reported on efficacy of a dietary intervention: a well-balanced restrictive caloric diet (30% fat, 45% carbohydrates, and 25% protein) and various hypocaloric diets (8-10 kcal/cm/day) were considered effective in terms of weight stabilization or decrease. No negative effect on linear growth was reported. Four studies reported on specific lifestyle interventions, of which three also included a dietary intervention. Combined dietary and lifestyle intervention resulted in decreased BMI, although BMI returned to baseline values on long-term. One additional study was identified in adults after brain trauma and showed a significant reduction in BMI in one out of eight patients after a combined dietary and lifestyle intervention. Hypocaloric diet or restrictive macronutrient diet with lower percentage of carbohydrates seems feasible and effective for childhood HO, although most of the studies had a high risk of bias, small cohorts without control groups, and were conducted in children with PWS only, compromising the generalizability. Lifestyle interventions only resulted in BMI decrease in short-term, indicating that additional guidance is needed to sustain its effect in the long-term. Literature on feasibility and efficacy of a dietary or lifestyle intervention for hypothalamic overweight or obesity is scarce, especially in children with acquired HO (following treatment for a suprasellar tumor). There is need for prospective (controlled) studies to determine which dietary and lifestyle intervention are most helpful for this specific patient group."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic disorder caused by lack of expression of genes on the paternally inherited chromosome 15q11.2-q13 region, known as the Prader Willi critical region. Nutritional clinical manifestations change with age and are described in four different phases. The phases span both extremes of the nutritional spectrum, beginning with an infant with poor sucking reflexes and failure to thrive then progressing to an adolescent who may have hyperphagia and be at risk for obesity. The phenotype is likely due to hypothalamic dysfunction due to genetic changes in the Prader Willi critical region. Researchers are examining the pathological mechanisms that determine the disease course."

    "abstract": "Responding to social signals by expressing the correct behavior is not only challenged in autism, but also in diseases with high prevalence of autism, like Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). Clinical evidence suggests aberrant pro-social behavior in patients can be regulated by intranasal oxytocin (OXT) or vasopressin (AVP). However, what neuronal mechanisms underlie impaired behavioral responses in a socially-aversive context, and how can they be corrected, remains largely unknown. Using the <i>Magel2</i> knocked-out (KO) mouse model of PWS (crossed with CRE-dependent transgenic lines), we devised optogenetic, physiological and pharmacological strategies in a social-fear-conditioning paradigm. Pathway specific roles of OXT and AVP signaling were investigated converging on the lateral septum (LS), a region which receives dense hypothalamic inputs. OXT and AVP signaling promoted inhibitory synaptic transmission in the LS, which failure in <i>Magel2</i>KO mice disinhibited somatostatin (SST) neurons and disrupted social-fear extinction. The source of OXT and AVP deficits mapped specifically in the supraoptic nucleus→LS pathway of <i>Magel2</i>KO mice disrupting social-fear extinction, which could be corrected by optogenetic or pharmacological inhibition of SST-neurons in the LS. Interestingly, LS SST-neurons also gated the expression of aggressive behavior, possibly as part of functional units operating beyond local septal circuits. SST cells in the LS play a crucial role in integration and expression of disrupted neuropeptide signals in autism, thereby altering the balance in expression of safety versus fear. Our results uncover novel mechanisms underlying dysfunction in a socially-aversive context, and provides a new framework for future treatments in autism-spectrum disorders."

In this review, we consolidate decades of research on MAGEL2 to elucidate its physiological functions. Moreover, we synthesize current knowledge on SYS, suggesting that while MAGEL2 loss-of-function seems to underlie several SYS and PWS phenotypes, additional pathomechanisms probably contribute to the distinct and severe phenotype observed in SYS. In addition, we highlight recent therapeutic advances and identify promising avenues for future investigation."

A chart review of children with PWS treated at our institution between 1990 and 2021 was performed. PP was defined as Tanner stage 2 (TS2) pubic hair in girls <8 and boys <9 years old. Demographic, anthropometric, and laboratory data were collected to assess predisposing factors and consequences of PP in comparison to patients with PWS who had normal pubarche (NP). Analysis included 43 children with PWS, 23 (53.5%) with PP and 20 (46.5%) with NP. Median age at pubarche was 7.0 years in PP group and 10.0 years in NP group. Age at pubarche was not correlated with age of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) initiation, body mass index (BMI) z-score, or homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at pubarche. BMI z-score at pubarche was modestly correlated with degree of pubarchal BA advancement (p = 0.033). Those with PP were more likely to have a lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (1.05 mmol/L vs. 1.41 mmol/L in the NP group, p = 0.041). The difference between target and final height did not differ between groups (p = 0.507). PP is common in PWS but does not compromise final height in comparison to the NP group. Obesity and insulin resistance were not associated with PP in children with PWS, contrary to what has been seen in obese children without PWS."

A variety of findings have been reported on the phenotypic differences between the genetic subtypes of PWS. This article compares the clinical findings of 57 PWS patients by genetic subtype and explores possible associations in this context. Methylation‑specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays were used to diagnose deletion and uniparental disomy (UPD). For phenotype-genotype correlation, clinical data were collected and genetic subgroups were compared statistically, and P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. These 57 patients consisted of 15 type I deletions, 20 type II deletions, six atypic deletions, 11 heterodisomy UPD, four isodisomy UPD, and one translocation-type PWS. All patients had hypotonia, poor neonatal sucking, and feeding difficulties during infancy. Other PWS-related clinical findings, such as speech articulation problems (85.9%), sleep apnea (77.2%), normal birth length (71.9%), small hands/feet (71.9%), childhood polyphagia (57.9%), clinodactyly (56.1%), thick viscous saliva (54.4%), and behavioral problems (50.9%) were observed at varying rates with no statistical difference between genetic subtypes in general. This study highlights the phenotype-genotype associations on PWS from a cohort of Turkish pediatric patients as a single-center experience."

To provide unbiased population-based estimates of prevalence and risk associated with psychiatric disorders for rCNVs and to compare risks across outcomes, rCNV dosage type (deletions or duplications), and locus features. This genetic association study is an analysis of data from the Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research (iPSYCH) case-cohort sample of individuals born in Denmark in 1981-2008 and followed up until 2015, including (1) all individuals (n = 92 531) with a hospital discharge diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), or schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) and (2) a subcohort (n = 50 625) randomly drawn from the source population. Data were analyzed from January 2021 to August 2023. Carrier status of deletions and duplications at 27 autosomal rCNV loci was determined from neonatal blood samples genotyped on single-nucleotide variant microarrays. Population-based rCNV prevalence was estimated with a survey model using finite population correction to account for oversampling of cases. Hazard ratio (HR) estimates and 95% CIs for psychiatric disorders were derived using weighted Cox proportional hazard models. Risks were compared across outcomes, dosage type, and locus features using generalized estimating equation models. A total of 3547 rCNVs were identified in 64 735 individuals assigned male at birth (53.8%) and 55 512 individuals assigned female at birth (46.2%) whose age at the end of follow-up ranged from 7.0 to 34.7 years (mean, 21.8 years). Most observed increases in rCNV-associated risk for ADHD, ASD, or SSD were moderate, and risk estimates were highly correlated across these disorders. Notable exceptions included high ASD-associated risk observed for Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome duplications (HR, 20.8; 95% CI, 7.9-55). No rCNV was associated with increased MDD risk. Also, rCNV-associated risk was positively correlated with locus size and gene constraint but not with dosage type. Comparison with published case-control and community-based studies revealed a higher prevalence of deletions and lower associated increase in risk for several rCNVs in iPSYCH2015. This study found that several rCNVs were more prevalent and conferred less risk of psychiatric disorders than estimated previously. Most case-control studies overestimate rCNV-associated risk of psychiatric disorders, likely because of selection bias. In an era where genetics is increasingly being clinically applied, these results highlight the importance of population-based risk estimates for genetics-based predictions."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked progressive disorder and the most common type of muscular dystrophy in children. As newborn screening (NBS) for DMD undergoes evaluation for the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel and is already mandated in multiple states, refining NBS algorithms is of utmost importance. NBS for DMD involves measuring creatine kinase-MM (CK-MM) concentration-a biomarker of muscle damage-in dried blood spots. The current test is FDA-approved for samples obtained less than 72 h after birth. Separate reference ranges are needed for samples collected later than 72 h after birth. In this study, we investigated the relationship between age and CK-MM in presumed healthy newborns to inform NBS algorithm designs. In patients with DMD, CK-MM is persistently elevated in childhood and adolescence, while it may be transiently elevated for other reasons in healthy newborns. CK-MM decrease over time was demonstrated by a population sample of 20,306 presumed healthy newborns tested between 0 and 60 days of life and repeat testing of 53 newborns on two separate days. In the population sample, CK-MM concentration was highest in the second 12 h period of life (median = 318 ng/mL) when only 57.6% of newborns tested below 360 ng/mL, the lowest previously published cutoff. By 72 h of age, median CK-MM concentration was 97 ng/mL, and 96.0% of infants had concentrations below 360 ng/mL. Between 72 h and 60 days, median CK-MM concentration ranged from 32 to 37 ng/mL. Establishing age-related cutoffs is crucial for optimizing the sensitivity and specificity of NBS for DMD."

    "abstract": "The neurodevelopmental disorders Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS) both arise from genomic alterations within human chromosome 15q11-q13. A deletion of the SNORD116 cluster, encoding small nucleolar RNAs, or frameshift mutations within MAGEL2 result in closely related phenotypes in individuals with PWS or SYS, respectively. By investigation of their subcellular localization, we observed that in contrast to a predominant cytoplasmic localization of wild-type (WT) MAGEL2, a truncated MAGEL2 mutant was evenly distributed between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. To elucidate regulatory pathways that may underlie both diseases, we identified protein interaction partners for WT or mutant MAGEL2, in particular the survival motor neuron protein (SMN), involved in spinal muscular atrophy, and the fragile-X-messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), involved in autism spectrum disorders. The interactome of the non-coding RNA SNORD116 was also investigated by RNA-CoIP. We show that WT and truncated MAGEL2 were both involved in RNA metabolism, while regulation of transcription was mainly observed for WT MAGEL2. Hence, we investigated the influence of MAGEL2 mutations on the expression of genes from the PWS locus, including the SNORD116 cluster. Thereby, we provide evidence for MAGEL2 mutants decreasing the expression of SNORD116, SNORD115, and SNORD109A, as well as protein-coding genes MKRN3 and SNRPN, thus bridging the gap between PWS and SYS."

We employed methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) and Sanger sequencing, along with collecting phenotypic data from the patients for comparison. Among the 45 patients, 29 (64%) exhibited a deletion of 15q11-q13, while the remaining 16 (36%) had uniparental disomy. No statistically significant differences were found in the main signs and symptoms of PWS. However, three clinical features showed significant differences between the groups. Deletion patients had a higher prevalence of myopia than those with uniparental disomy, as well as obstructive sleep apnea and an unusual skill with puzzles. The diagnostic tests (MS-HRM, MS-MLPA, and Sanger sequencing) yielded positive results, supporting their applicability in PWS diagnosis. The study's findings indicate a general similarity in the genotype-phenotype correlation across genetic subtypes of PWS."

    "abstract": "As research on diabetes continues to advance, more complex classifications of this disease have emerged, revealing the existence of special types of diabetes, and many of these patients are prone to misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis, leading to treatment delays and increased health care costs. The purpose of this study was to identify four causes of secondary diabetes. Secondary diabetes can be caused by various factors, some of which are often overlooked. These factors include genetic defects, autoimmune disorders, and diabetes induced by tumours. This paper describes four types of secondary diabetes caused by Williams-Beuren syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, pituitary adenoma, and IgG4-related diseases. These cases deviate significantly from the typical progression of the disease due to their low incidence and rarity, often leading to their neglect in clinical practice. In comparison to regular diabetes patients, the four individuals described here exhibited distinct characteristics. Standard hypoglycaemic treatments failed to effectively control the disease. Subsequently, a series of examinations and follow-up history confirmed the diagnosis and underlying cause of diabetes. Upon addressing the primary condition, such as excising a pituitary adenoma, providing glucocorticoid supplementation, and implementing symptomatic treatments, all patients experienced a considerable decrease in blood glucose levels, which were subsequently maintained within a stable range. Furthermore, other accompanying symptoms improved. Rare diseases causing secondary diabetes are often not considered in the diagnosis of diabetes. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct genetic tests, antibody detection and other appropriate diagnostic measures when necessary to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention through proactive and efficient management of the underlying condition, ultimately improving patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is considered a disorder of emotion regulation resulting from the expression of a biologically determined emotional vulnerability (that is, heightened sensitivity to emotion, increased emotional intensity/reactivity, and a slow return to emotional baseline) combined with exposure to invalidating environments. Vagal tone has been associated with activity in cortical regions involved in emotion regulation and a lower resting state of vagal tone has been observed in BPD patients relative to healthy controls. Non-invasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has been shown to reduce temper outbursts in adults with Prader-Willi Syndrome, to enhance recognition of emotions in healthy students, and to improve depressive and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, a single session of taVNS has been shown to acutely alter the recognition of facial expressions of negative valence in adolescents with MDD and increase emotion recognition in controls. However, the effect of taVNS on emotional vulnerability and regulation in individuals diagnosed with BPD has not been investigated. Our aims are to determine if taVNS is effective in acutely reducing emotional vulnerability and improve emotional regulation in BPD patients. Forty-two patients will be randomized to a single session of taVNS or sham-taVNS while going through an affect induction procedure. It will consist of the presentation of one neutral and three negative affect-evoking 4-min-long videos in sequence, each of which is followed by a 4-min post-induction period during which participants will rate the quality and intensity of their current self-reported emotions (post-induction ratings) and the perceived effectiveness in managing their emotions during the video presentation. The rating of the current self-reported emotions will be repeated after every post-induction period (recovery ratings). Mixed models with individuals as random effect will be used to investigate the ratings at each stage of the study, taking into account the repeated measures of the same individuals at baseline, pre-induction, post-induction, and recovery. The study has potential to yield new insights into the role of vagal tone in emotion dysregulation in BPD and offer preliminary data on the effectiveness of taVNS as a possible non-invasive brain stimulation to treat a core symptom of BPD.

PWS-specialized hostels (SH) succeed in preventing morbid obesity and in coping with behavioral disorders; however, effects of restricted living environments on quality of life (QOL) have not been described. Evidence on QOL is critical for clinicians involved in placement decisions. <b>Methods</b>: We examined the impact of living in SH versus at home or in non-specialized hostels (H and NSH) on QOL, behavior, and health parameters. All 58 adults (26 males) followed-up in the National Multidisciplinary Clinic for PWS were included: 33 resided in SH, 18 lived at home, and 7 lived in NSH. Questionnaires were administered to primary caregivers to measure QOL, and data were obtained from the medical records. <b>Results</b>: The H and NSH group were compared with those for adults in SH. Despite strict diet and exercise regimens, QOL was similar for both groups. Eight-year follow-up showed that food-seeking behavior decreased in SH but increased in H and NSH. BMI, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were lower in SH. <b>Conclusion</b>: Our results suggest that living in SH is associated with benefits for physical health and behavior without negatively affecting QOL."

    "abstract": "Obesity is a major risk factor for liver and cardiovascular diseases. However, obesity-driven mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple organ diseases are still obscure and treatment is inadequate. We hypothesized that increased , glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the key rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose shunt, is critical in evoking metabolic reprogramming in multiple organs and is a significant contributor to the pathogenesis of liver and cardiovascular diseases. G6PD is induced by a carbohydrate-rich diet and insulin. Long-term (8 months) high-fat diet (HFD) feeding increased body weight and elicited metabolic reprogramming in visceral fat, liver, and aorta, of the wild-type rats. In addition, HFD increased inflammatory chemokines in visceral fat. Interestingly, CRISPR-edited loss-of-function Mediterranean G6PD variant (G6PD<sup>S188F</sup>) rats, which mimic human polymorphism, moderated HFD-induced weight gain and metabolic reprogramming in visceral fat, liver, and aorta. The G6PD<sup>S188F</sup> variant prevented HFD-induced CCL7 and adipocyte hypertrophy. Furthermore, the G6PD<sup>S188F</sup> variant increased Magel2 - a gene encoding circadian clock-related protein that suppresses obesity associated with Prader-Willi syndrome - and reduced HFD-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver. Additionally, the G6PD<sup>S188F</sup> variant reduced aging-induced aortic stiffening. Our findings suggest G6PD is a regulator of HFD-induced obesity, adipocyte hypertrophy, and fatty liver."

Of 77 people with PWS, 44.2% had at least one psychiatric comorbid diagnosis. The main reasons for seeking psychiatric care were emotional outbursts and aggressive behaviour. 34.9% reported that they were currently seeking psychiatric care without success. However, 32.5% of PWS had been treated with psychotropic medication, mainly antipsychotics. Psychiatric comorbidity appears to be undertreated in PWS, especially in the ambulatory setting.

    "title": "Early onset stage III diabetic nephropathy in a child with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with dulaglutide: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisystem genetic disorder caused by chromosomal imprinting gene defects, with approximately 70% of cases resulting from paternal deletion of the chromosomal region 15. The main clinical features include severe infantile hypotonia, early-onset childhood obesity, hyperphagia, and underdeveloped external genitalia. As individuals with PWS age, they may exhibit irritability, social dysfunction, impaired gonadal development, and metabolic syndrome. Previous literature places the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in PWS at approximately 7-24%. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide secreted by the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei of the hypothalamus and regulates energy metabolism, which is involved in PWS. Due to age limitations, very few patients progress to diabetic nephropathy during childhood, and reports of typical diabetic nephropathy in PWS during childhood are extremely rare. Dulaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist which can be used in the treatment of T2DM. This article reports a case of a child with PWS complicated by stage III diabetic nephropathy, providing a retrospective analysis of the diagnosis and treatment process, as well as a review of domestic and international literature, to enhance understanding of this condition. And this article provides a treatment idea for PWS patients with diabetic nephropathy. It is very important to enhance understanding of PWS. And we offer new diagnostic and possible therapeutic approaches for pediatric patients with diabetic nephropathy."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare orphan disease and complex genetic neurodevelopmental disorder, with a birth incidence of approximately 1 in 10,000-30,000. Management of people with PWS requires a multi-disciplinary approach, ideally through a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) clinic with community support. Hypotonia, poor feeding and faltering growth are characteristic features in the neonatal period, followed by hyperphagia and risk of rapid weight gain later in childhood. Children and adolescents (CA) with PWS usually display developmental delay and mild learning disability and can develop endocrinopathies, scoliosis, respiratory difficulties (both central and obstructive sleep apnoea), challenging behaviours, skin picking, and mental health issues, especially into adulthood. This consensus statement is intended to be a reference document for clinicians managing children and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) with PWS. It considers the bio-psycho-social domains of diagnosis, clinical assessment, and management in the paediatric setting as well as during and after transition to adult services. The guidance has been developed from information gathered from peer-reviewed scientific reports and from the expertise of a range of experienced clinicians in the United Kingdom and Ireland involved in the care of patients with PWS."

    "title": "Relationship of thyroid function with genetic subtypes and treatment with growth hormone in Prader-Willi syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the most common genetic syndrome with obesity and results from loss of expression of paternally inherited genes on chromosome 15q11-q13 by a variety of mechanisms which include large deletions (70%-75%), maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) (20%-30%), and imprinting defects (2%-5%) or balanced translocations. Individuals often have a characteristic behavior disorder with mild intellectual disability, infantile hypotonia associated with poor sucking, short stature, and obesity. PWS is characterized by hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction with growth hormone (GH) deficiency, hypogonadism, and several other hormonal deficiencies resulting in short stature, centrally driven excessive appetite (hyperphagia), central obesity, cryptorchidism, and decreased lean body mass. In this study, we determined and sought differences in the incidence of thyroid abnormalities among the common genetic subtypes in a cohort of 52 subjects with PWS because there was limited literature available. We also sought the effects of growth hormone (GH) treatment on the thyroid profile. Fifty-two subjects with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of PWS were included in this study at the University of California, Irvine. Blood samples for baseline thyroxine stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) levels were obtained in the morning after an overnight fast for 8-12 h. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS (SPSS Inc., 21.0). Mean values were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, and student's t-test and statistical significance were set at p < 0.05. The subjects included 26 males and 26 females with an age range of 3-38 years. There were 29 subjects with chromosome 15q11-q13 deletions and 23 with UPD; 28 were GH treated currently or in the past, and 24 never received GH. There was no significant difference in age or body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) between GH-treated versus non-GH-treated groups. BMI was higher in the deletion group compared to the UPD group (p = 0.05). We identified two individuals who were clinically diagnosed and treated for hypothyroidism, one of whom was on GH supplements. We identified two additional individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism who were not on GH treatment, giving a frequency of 7.6% (4/52) in this cohort of patients. We did not find significant differences in thyroid function (TSH) in the deletion versus UPD groups. We found significant differences in thyroid function, however, between GH-treated and non-GH-treated groups. The mean TSH was lower (2.25 ± 1.17 uIU/M, range 0.03-4.92 uIU/M versus 2.80 ± 1.44 uIU/M, range 0.55-5.33 uIU/M respectively, p = 0.046), and the free T4 levels were significantly higher (1.13 ± 0.70 and 1.03 ± 0.11 ng/dL, respectively, p = 0.05) in the GH-treated individuals compared to non-GH-treated individuals. In this cohort of subjects with PWS, we identified two previously diagnosed individuals with hypothyroidism and two individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism (4/52, 7.6%), three of whom were not receiving GH treatment. We did not find any significant differences in thyroid function between molecular subtypes; however, we found that euthyroid status (lower TSH levels and higher free T4 levels) was significantly higher in individuals who were treated with GH compared to the untreated group. We recommend that individuals with PWS should be screened regularly for thyroid deficiency and start treatment early with GH in view of the potentially lower incidence of thyroid deficiency."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by behavioral disturbances, hyperphagia, and intellectual disability. Several surveys indicate that PWS is also associated with cardiac abnormalities, possibly contributing to a high incidence of sudden death. However, the pathological mechanisms underlying cardiac dysfunction in PWS remain unclear. In this study, we found that deficiency in necdin, an intronless gene within PWS region, led to heart systolic and diastolic dysfunction in mice. Through yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified an interaction between necdin and non-muscle myosin regulatory light chain 12a/b (MYL12 A/B). We further showed that necdin stabilized MYL12 A/B via SGT1-heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) chaperone machinery. The zebrafish lacking the MYL12 A/B analog, MYL12.1, exhibited impaired heart function, while cardiac-specific overexpression of MYL12A normalized the heart dysfunction in necdin-deficient mice. Our findings revealed necdin dysfunction as a contributing factor to cardiomyopathy in PWS patients and emphasized the importance of HSP90 chaperone machinery and non-muscle myosin in heart fitness."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness and relevance of projective techniques such as house-tree-person (HTP) and family in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), who have a limited ability to identify and verbalize emotions and express them often using behaviors. We included individuals with genetic confirmation of PWS immersed in a regular transdisciplinary treatment in an institution dedicated to rare diseases. All individuals were evaluated using the HTP and family projective techniques. These instruments are commonly administered to the general population and, in this case, to people with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, including difficulties in their communication abilities. A total of 25 individuals with PWS between 10 and 41 years old (15 men and 10 women) were included. We identified the presence of graphic indicators corresponding to the behavioral phenotype of individuals with PWS, such as anxiety, stubbornness, emotional lability, difficulty in achieving adequate externalization and identification of emotions, impulsivity, aggressive traits, poor social skills, need for support and interaction, low self-concept, and compulsive behaviors. In the present study, we demonstrated the usefulness of graphic techniques to elucidate aspects of behavior, emotions, and thoughts that individuals with PWS cannot formulate due to expression and communication difficulties."

A nationwide register-based cohort study. Swedish national registers and nationwide quality IVF register. All liveborn singletons in Sweden (N = 2,084,127) between 1997 and 2017 with follow-up to December 31, 2018. The use of specific methods implemented in ART. The International Classification of Diseases version 10 was used to identify three distinct imprinting disorder groups: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), and Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), as well as central precocious puberty. The Cox model combined with inverse probability treatment weights was used to estimate the weighted hazard ratio (wHR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI), accounting for multiple confounders. A total of 1,044 children were diagnosed with the disorders of interest, and 52 of them were conceived using ART therapy. The overall risk of being diagnosed with any of the studied imprinting disorders was elevated in children conceived using ART therapy compared with all other children (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.38-2.45). After adjusting for parental background factors, the association was partially attenuated (wHR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.97-2.32), but remained in the weighted comparison restricted to children of couples with known infertility (wHR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.05-2.21). For the specific diagnoses of PWS/SRS, and BWS compared with children of couples with known infertility, children conceived with ART therapy showed a small excess risk, which could not be distinguished from the null (wHR, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.93-2.62 and 1.80; 95% CI, 0.99-3.28, respectively). Further subgroup analysis showed that the combined use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection and cryopreserved embryos was associated with a higher risk of both PWS/SRS (wHR, 4.60; 95% CI, 1.72-12.28) and BWS (wHR, 6.69; 95% CI, 2.09-21.45). The number of central precocious puberty cases in children conceived using ART therapy was too small (N = 3) to make any meaningful inference. The combined use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection and cryopreserved embryos was associated with small elevated risks of PWS/SRS, and BWS in children, independent of parental factors related to infertility."

    "abstract": "STAC3 disorder, or Native American myopathy, is characterised by congenital myopathy, hypotonia, musculoskeletal and palatal anomalies, and susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia. A STAC3 c.851 G > C (p.Trp284Ser) pathogenic variant, common in the Lumbee Native American tribe, has been identified in other populations worldwide, including patients of African ancestry. We report on the frequency of STAC3 c.851 G > C in a cohort of 127 patients presenting with congenital hypotonia that tested negative for spinal muscular atrophy and/or Prader-Willi syndrome. We present a clinical retrospective, descriptive review on 31 Southern African patients homozygous for STAC3 c.851 G > C. The frequencies of various phenotypic characteristics were calculated. In total, 25/127 (20%) laboratory-based samples were homozygous for STAC3 c.851 G > C. A carrier rate of 1/56 and a predicted birth rate of 1/12 500 was estimated from a healthy cohort. A common haplotype spanning STAC3 was identified in four patients. Of the clinical group, 93% had a palatal abnormality, 52% a spinal anomaly, 59% had talipes equinovarus deformity/deformities, 38% had arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, and 22% had a history suggestive of malignant hyperthermia. The novel finding that STAC3 disorder is a common African myopathy has important clinical implications for the diagnosis, treatment and genetic counselling of individuals, with neonatal and/or childhood hypotonia with or without arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, and their families. The spread of this variant worldwide and the allele frequency higher in the African/African-American ancestry than the Admixed Americans, strongly indicates that the STAC3 c.851 G > C variant has an African origin which may be due to an ancient mutation with migration and population bottlenecks."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare disease, which shows a peculiar clinical phenotype, including obesity, which is different from essential obesity (EOB). Metabolomics might represent a valuable tool to reveal the biochemical mechanisms/pathways underlying clinical differences between PWS and EOB. The aim of the present (case-control, retrospective) study was to determine the metabolomic profile that characterizes PWS compared to EOB. A validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) targeted metabolomic approach was used to measure a total of 188 endogenous metabolites in plasma samples of 32 patients with PWS (F/M = 23/9; age: 31.6 ± 9.2 years; body mass index [BMI]: 42.1 ± 7.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), compared to a sex-, age- and BMI-matched group of patients with EOB (F/M = 23/9; age: 31.4 ± 6.9 years; BMI: 43.5 ± 3.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Body composition in PWS was different when compared to EOB, with increased fat mass and decreased fat-free mass. Glycemia and HDL cholesterol were higher in patients with PWS than in those with EOB, while insulinemia was lower, as well as heart rate. Resting energy expenditure was lower in the group with PWS than in the one with EOB, a difference that was missed after fat-free mass correction. Carrying out a series of Tobit multivariable linear regressions, adjusted for sex, diastolic blood pressure, and C reactive protein, a total of 28 metabolites was found to be associated with PWS (vs. non-PWS, i.e., EOB), including 9 phosphatidylcholines (PCs) ae, 5 PCs aa, all PCs aa, 7 lysoPCs a, all lysoPCs, 4 acetylcarnitines, and 1 sphingomyelin, all of which were higher in PWS than EOB. PWS exhibits a specific metabolomic profile when compared to EOB, suggesting a different regulation of some biochemical pathways, fundamentally related to lipid metabolism."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized by a complex clinical condition, whose typical features lead to impaired motor and functional skills. To date, limited data is available as regards symmetry of gait in PWS. The aim of this study was to characterize lower-limb asymmetry during gait in a group of Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) individuals by using the synchronized cyclograms and to compare it with those of two different control groups, a normal-weight group and an obese group. A total of 18 PWS, 30 normal weight (NW) and 28 obese individuals (OG) matched for age, sex and height were assessed via 3D gait analysis. Gait spatio-temporal parameters were computed together with angle-angle diagrams, characterized in terms of their geometric features (i.e. area, orientation, and trend symmetry index). Individuals with PWS exhibit reduced speed, stride length and cadence and increased duration of both stance and double support phase than the other groups. OG was characterized by the same pattern when compared to NW. With respect to inter-limb symmetry, individuals with PWS exhibited significantly larger cyclogram areas at hip joint with respect to the other two groups (203.32 degrees<sup>2</sup> vs. 130.73 degrees<sup>2</sup> vs. 111.59 degrees<sup>2</sup>) and significantly higher orientation angle (4.17° vs. 2.11° vs. 1.22°) and Trend Symmetry (3.72 vs. 2.02 vs. 1.21) with respect to the other two groups at knee joint; no differences were found at ankle joint. Both individuals with PWS and those of OG exhibited reduced ROM at knee and ankle joints with respect with normal weight, but no statistically significant differences were observed between PWS and OG. The obtained results may provide novel and useful insights to understand better the impairments in motor control associated with this pathological state, supporting clinics in the identification of the best rehabilitation program for this rare pathological state, aimed to improve stability and motor control."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the prototypic genomic disorder resulting from deficiency of paternally expressed genes in the human chromosome 15q11-q13 region. The unique molecular mechanism involving epigenetic modifications renders PWS as the most attractive candidate to explore a proof-of-concept of epigenetic therapy in humans. The premise is that epigenetic modulations could reactivate the repressed PWS candidate genes from the maternal chromosome and offer therapeutic benefit. Our prior study identifies an EHMT2/G9a inhibitor, UNC0642, that reactivates the expression of PWS genes via reduction of H3K9me2. However, low brain permeability and poor oral bioavailability of UNC0642 preclude its advancement into translational studies in humans. In this study, a newly developed inhibitor, MS152, modified from the structure of UNC0642, has better brain penetration and greater potency and selectivity against EHMT2/G9a. MS152 reactivated maternally silenced PWS genes in PWS patient fibroblasts and in brain and liver tissues of PWS mouse models. Importantly, the molecular efficacy of oral administration is comparable with the intraperitoneal route. MS152 treatment in newborns ameliorates the perinatal lethality and poor growth, maintaining reactivation in a PWS mouse model at postnatal 90 days. Our findings provide strong support for MS152 as a first-in-class inhibitor to advance the epigenetic therapy of PWS in humans."

    "abstract": "This narrative review study investigates the correlations between obesity, allergies, and sleep-disordered breathing in pediatric populations. Searches for pertinent articles were conducted on the Medline PubMed Advanced Search Builder, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from unlimited to April 2024. Sleep-disordered breathing causes repeated upper airway obstructions, leading to apneas and restless sleep. Childhood obesity, which affects around 20% of children, is often associated with sleep-disordered breathing and allergies such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. It is distinguished between diet-induced obesity (resulting from excess of diet and physical inactivity) and genetic obesity (such as is seen in Down syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome). In children with diet-induced obesity, chronic inflammation linked to weight can worsen allergies and increase the risk and severity of asthma and rhinitis. Furthermore, the nasal congestion typical of rhinitis can contribute to upper respiratory tract obstruction and obstructive sleep apnea. A vicious circle is created between asthma and sleep-disordered breathing: uncontrolled asthma and sleep-disordered breathing can worsen each other. In children with genetic obesity, despite alterations in the immune system, fewer allergies are observed compared to the broader population. The causes of this reduced allergenicity are unclear but probably involve genetic, immunological, and environmental factors. Additional research is necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The present narrative review study emphasizes the importance of jointly evaluating and managing allergies, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea in children considering their close interconnection."

    "abstract": "Diagnosing imprinting defects in neonates and young children presents challenges, often necessitating molecular analysis for a conclusive diagnosis. The isolation of genetic material from oral swabs becomes crucial, especially in settings where blood sample collection is impractical or for vulnerable populations like newborns, who possess limited blood volumes and are often too fragile for invasive procedures. Oral swab samples emerge as an excellent source of DNA, effectively overcoming obstacles associated with rare diseases. In our study, we specifically addressed the determination of the quality and quantity of DNA extracted from oral swab samples using NaCl procedures. We compared these results with extractions performed using a commercial kit. Subsequently, the obtained material underwent MS-HRM analysis for loci associated with imprinting diseases such as Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. Our study emphasizes the significance of oral swab samples as a reliable source for obtaining DNA for MS-HRM analysis. NaCl extraction stands out as a practical and cost-effective method for genetic studies, contributing to a molecular diagnosis that proves particularly beneficial for patients facing delays in characterization, ultimately influencing their treatment."

This syndrome also includes endocrine dysfunction, leading to short stature, hypogonadism, and obscure hyperphagia. Although recent progress has been made toward understanding the genetic basis for PWS, the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathology in obesity remain unclear. In this study, we examined the adipocytic characteristics of two PWS-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines: those with the 15q11-q13 gene deletion (iPWS cells) and those with 15q11-q13 abnormal methylation (M-iPWS cells). The transcript levels of the lipid-binding protein aP2 were decreased in iPWS and M-iPWS adipocytes. Flow-cytometry analysis showed that PWS adipocytes accumulated more lipid droplets than did normal individual adipocytes. Furthermore, glucose uptake upon insulin stimulation was attenuated compared to that in normal adipocytes. Overall, our results suggest a significantly increased lipid content and defective in glucose metabolism in PWS adipocytes."

Feeding difficulties and hypotonia ('floppy infant') are the most striking characteristics. Prader-Willi syndrome requires specific follow-up and treatment, emphasizing the importance of early recognition.We encountered an infant of three months old with severe hypotonia. The hypotonia ameliorated spontaneously over time, although feeding per nasogastric tube was necessary. There were no apparent dysmorphisms. Extensive genetic investigations showed a maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15, fitting with Prader-Willi syndrome explaining all symptoms. After excluding contraindications, treatment with growth hormone therapy was started. Parents were educated regarding medical emergencies specific for Prader-Willi syndrome ('medical alerts'). Although Prader-Willi syndrome is rare, it should always be considered in cases of neonatal hypotonia. Early recognition is paramount as specific recommendations and treatment are warranted."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic disorder caused by three different types of molecular genetic abnormalities. The most common defect is a deletion on the paternal 15q11-q13 chromosome, which is seen in about 60% of individuals. The next most common abnormality is maternal disomy 15, found in around 35% of cases, and a defect in the imprinting center that controls the activity of certain genes on chromosome 15, seen in 1-3% of cases. Individuals with PWS typically experience issues with the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, leading to excessive hunger (hyperphagia), severe obesity, various endocrine disorders, and intellectual disability. Differences in physical and behavioral characteristics between patients with PWS due to deletion versus those with maternal disomy are discussed in literature. Patients with maternal disomy tend to have more frequent neurodevelopmental problems, such as autistic traits and behavioral issues, and generally have higher IQ levels compared to those with deletion of the critical PWS region. This has led us to review the pertinent literature to investigate the possibility of establishing connections between the genetic abnormalities and the endocrine disorders experienced by PWS patients, in order to develop more targeted diagnostic and treatment protocols. In this review, we will review the current state of clinical studies focusing on endocrine disorders in individuals with PWS patients, with a specific focus on the various genetic causes. We will look at topics such as neonatal anthropometry, thyroid issues, adrenal problems, hypogonadism, bone metabolism abnormalities, metabolic syndrome resulting from severe obesity caused by hyperphagia, deficiencies in the GH/IGF-1 axis, and the corresponding responses to treatment."

    "abstract": "Children with neurogenetic syndromes commonly experience significant and pervasive sleep disturbances, however, associations with caregiver mental health remains unclear. Previous studies have linked sleep disturbances with increased caregiver depression in typically developing populations, and heightened caregiver stress among neurogenetic populations. The present study expands on findings by exploring the longitudinal association between child sleep duration and caregiver mental health (depression, anxiety, stress) throughout development (infancy to school-aged children) in dyads with and without a child affected by a neurogenetic syndrome. Participants were drawn from the Purdue Early Phenotype Study, including 193 caregivers (Age: <i>M</i> = 34.40 years, <i>SD</i> = 4.53) of children with neurogenetic syndromes (Age: <i>M</i> = 40.91 months, <i>SD</i> =20.72) and typically developing children (n = 55; Age: <i>M</i> = 36.71 months, <i>SD</i> = 20.68). Children in the neurogenetic group were diagnosed with Angelman (n = 49), Prader Willi (n = 30), Williams (n = 51), and Fragile X (n = 8) syndromes. Caregivers completed assessments every six months up to child age three, and annual assessments thereafter. Child sleep duration was measured using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire, and caregiver internalizing symptoms were assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale. Multilevel models were conducted to examine caregiver depression, anxiety, and stress in relation to child sleep duration at both between- and within-person levels, with child age as a moderator. Results indicated a between-person effect of child sleep duration on caregiver depression (i.e., differences between families) and a within-person effect on caregiver stress (i.e., change over time) in the full, combined sample. These effects were not maintained when examined separately in neurogenetic and typically developing groups, except for a between-person effect on caregiver stress in the typically developing cohort. Moderating effects of child age were significant for depression and stress only in the typically developing cohort. In summary, persistent child sleep disruptions were linked to exacerbated caregiver depression across the sample, while acute child sleep disruptions exacerbate caregiver stress within dyads over time. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing child sleep to enhance caregiver wellbeing and has potential relevance for a wide range of neurogenetic syndromes."

    "abstract": "Long-read whole genome sequencing like Oxford Nanopore Technology, is increasingly being introduced in clinical settings. With its ability to simultaneously call sequence variation and DNA modifications including 5-methylcytosine, nanopore is a promising technology to improve diagnostics of imprinting disorders. Currently, no tools to analyze DNA methylation patterns at known clinically relevant imprinted regions are available. Here we present NanoImprint, which generates an easily interpretable report, based on long-read nanopore sequencing, to use for identifying clinical relevant abnormalities in methylation levels at 14 imprinted regions and diagnosis of common imprinting disorders.

    "title": "Behavioral changes in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome receiving diazoxide choline extended-release tablets compared to the PATH for PWS natural history study.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurobehavioral-metabolic disease caused by the lack of paternally expressed genes in the chromosome 15q11-q13 region, characterized by hypotonia, neurocognitive problems, behavioral difficulties, endocrinopathies, and hyperphagia resulting in severe obesity if energy intake is not controlled. Diazoxide choline extended-release (DCCR) tablets have previously been evaluated for their effects on hyperphagia and other behavioral complications of people with PWS in a Phase 3 placebo-controlled study of participants with PWS, age 4 and older with hyperphagia (C601) and in an open label extension study, C602. To better understand the longer-term impact of DCCR, a cohort from PATH for PWS, a natural history study that enrolled participants with PWS age 5 and older, who met the C601 age, weight and baseline hyperphagia inclusion criteria and had 2 hyperphagia assessments ≥ 6 months apart, were compared to the C601/C602 cohort. Hyperphagia was measured using the Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (HQ-CT, range 0-36). The primary analysis used observed values with no explicit imputation of missing data. A sensitivity analysis was conducted in which all missing HQ-CT assessments in the C601/C602 cohort were assigned the highest possible value (36), representing the worst-case scenario. Other behavioral changes were assessed using the Prader-Willi Syndrome Profile questionnaire (PWSP). Relative to the PATH for PWS natural history study cohort, the DCCR-treated C601/C602 cohort showed significant improvements in HQ-CT score at 26 weeks (LSmean [SE] -8.3 [0.75] vs. -2.5 [0.43], p < 0.001) and 52 weeks (LSmean [SE] -9.2 [0.77] vs. -3.4 [0.47], p < 0.001). The comparison between the cohorts remained significant in the worst-case imputation sensitivity analysis. There were also significant improvements in all domains of the PWSP at 26 weeks (all p < 0.001) and 52 weeks (all p ≤ 0.003) for C601/C602 participants compared to the PATH for PWS participants. Long-term administration of DCCR to people with PWS resulted in changes in hyperphagia and other behavioral complications of PWS that are distinct from the natural history of the syndrome as exemplified by the cohort from PATH for PWS. The combined effects of administration of DCCR should reduce the burden of the syndrome on the patient, caregivers and their families, and thereby may benefit people with PWS and their families. Clinical study C601 was originally registered on ClinicalTrials.gov on February 22, 2018 (NCT03440814). Clinical study C602 was originally registered on ClinicalTrials.gov on October 22, 2018 (NCT03714373). PATH for PWS was originally registered on ClinicalTrials.gov on October 24, 2018 (NCT03718416)."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder typically characterized by body composition abnormalities, hyperphagia, behavioral challenges, cognitive dysfunction, and hormone deficiencies. Hypogonadism is common but knowledge on potential side effects of testosterone replacement is limited, in particular, the long-term effects on behavior and PSA. Retrospective case studies of seven men, median age 46 years, with genetically verified PWS, testosterone treated hypogonadism and available PSA values were included. Long-term follow-up of PSA was accessible in four patients. Medical records were reviewed for adverse effects. Five men were treated with intramuscular testosterone undecanoate, two had no hypogonadism. Median PSA was 0.68 μg/L (0.23-1.3), median testosterone 15 nmol/L. After a median time of 17 years of testosterone replacement median PSA was 0.75 μg/L (range 0.46-1.4). Testosterone replacement was well tolerated, and no major behavioral changes were reported. Five were treated with growth hormone for >20 years. Levels of PSA were low. Long-term treatment with testosterone was working well and did not result in any clinically meaningful increase in PSA. Our results indicate that testosterone replacement is neither associated with serious adverse events regarding changes in behavior or effect on PSA. However, larger studies are needed to confirm our results."

A systematic search of Medline, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library was conducted. Studies estimating the prevalence of seizures, epilepsy and febrile seizures in the PWS population were included. Meta-analyses of the prevalence of epilepsy and febrile seizures and their association with genotype using the prevalence ratio (PR) were performed. Fifteen studies were included. The prevalence of epilepsy was 0.11 (0.07, 0.15), similar to the prevalence of febrile seizures, with a prevalence of 0.09 (0.05, 0.13). The comparison \"deletion vs. UPD\" had a PR of 2.03 (0.90, 4.57) and 3.76 (1.54, 9.18) for epilepsy and febrile seizures. The prevalence of seizure disorders in PWS is higher than in the general population. In addition, deletions in 15q11-q13 may be associated with a higher risk of seizure disorders. Therefore, active screening for seizure disorders in PWS should improve the lives of these people. In addition, genotype could be used to stratify risk, even for epilepsy, although more studies or larger sample sizes are needed."

    "abstract": "Hyperphagia is highly penetrant in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and has increasingly been reported in other neurogenetic conditions (NGC). The Hyperphagia Questionnaire (HQ) was completed by caregivers of 4-8-year-olds with PWS (n = 17), Angelman syndrome (AS; n = 22), Williams syndrome (WS; n = 25), or low-risk controls (LRC; n = 35). All NGC groups were significantly elevated in HQ Total and Behavior scores compared to LRC. Only AS and WS were significantly elevated in the Drive domain, and only PWS in the Severity domain. After controlling for externalizing behavior, HQ Total scores were higher for PWS relative to other groups. Hyperphagic symptoms may not differentiate PWS from other NGCs in early childhood. However, hyperphagic phenotypes may be most severe in PWS. Further investigation of these profiles may inform etiology and syndrome-specific treatments."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypothalamic dysfunction, hypotonia, cognitive deficits, and hyperphagia, primarily resulting from genetic abnormalities on chromosome 15. Among its varied manifestations, musculoskeletal issues, notably scoliosis, pose important challenges in management. This study aims to investigate differences in postural-motor development and spinal range of movement between preadolescents and adolescents with PWS, with and without scoliosis, while also exploring the potential impact of scoliosis on caregiving burden, an aspect yet to be thoroughly explored in existing literature. This observational study evaluated 13 individuals diagnosed with PWS, including 5 with scoliosis (PWS-Sc) and 7 without (PWS-NSc). Inclusion criteria comprised ages 8 to 18 years, confirmed PWS diagnosis through genetic testing, and scoliosis diagnosis. Anamnestic data, physical examinations, and surface measurements were collected, along with parental burden assessments using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Both groups displayed delays in achieving postural-motor milestones, with the PWS-Sc group exhibiting a more pronounced delay, although statistical significance was not achieved. The main curve magnitude in the PWS-Sc group averaged 31.5° Cobb, with 60% of cases presenting an S-shaped curve. Surface measurements of physiological curves did not differ significantly between groups, but the scoliosis-affected group exhibited lower lumbar extension values (p=0.04). The overall ZBI revealed higher scores in the PWS-Sc group, although statistical significance was not reached. However, significant differences were observed in single questions score evaluating aspects such as social life and caregiver uncertainty (p=0.04 and p=0.03, respectively). Despite the small sample size, delays in achieving postural-motor milestones, particularly in individuals with scoliosis, were observed. The differences recorded in lumbo-pelvic movement suggest that tailored interventions may be beneficial. The heightened caregiving burden in the scoliosis group underscores the need for targeted support. Early intervention and ongoing monitoring should be important for accurate diagnosis and appropriate care, potentially with psychological support for caregivers."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) represents a difficult challenge for spine surgeons, due to the association of a structural scoliosis, with a prevalence between 15 and 86%. Conservative therapy is a viable option, but surgery is increasingly becoming the treatment of choice. The authors reviewed a series of 15 patients affected by PWS treated at their institution between 2008 and 2023. The mean age at index treatment was 9 years and 3 months (range 1-15 years) with a prevalence of female subjects. Primary scoliotic curve ranged from 14 to 102°, and mean thoracic kyphosis was 56° (range 20-75°). Eleven patients underwent conservative treatment, while four were treated surgically. Mean follow-up was 5 years and 3 months (range 2-12 years). Among the 11 patients treated conservatively, only two showed improvements of the coronal curve, while the remaining nine displayed a worsening of the deformity during follow-up. Complication rate after surgery was 75%. One patient developed paraplegia after pedicle screw positioning. One patient displayed rod breakage and PJK that required revision surgery proximally. Hardware deep infection was seen in one case where it was necessary to proceed with instrumentation removal after 10 years. Spine surgery represents a convincing option in patients affected by PWS, but the risks of complications are high. Correct patient selection must be the main objective, and multilevel pedicle screw fixation should be the procedure of choice. Traditional growing rod should be prudently evaluated in every single case."

    "abstract": "Loss of prolyl endopeptidase-like (PREPL) encoding a serine hydrolase with (thio)esterase activity leads to the recessive metabolic disorder Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome-22 (CMS22). It is characterized by severe neonatal hypotonia, feeding problems, growth retardation, and hyperphagia leading to rapid weight gain later in childhood. The phenotypic similarities with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are striking, suggesting that similar pathways are affected. The aim of this study was to identify changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in mouse models for both disorders and to examine mitochondrial function in skin fibroblasts of patients and knockout cell lines. We have demonstrated that Prepl is downregulated in the brains of neonatal PWS-IC<sup>-p/+m</sup> mice. In addition, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is similarly affected in both Prepl<sup>-/-</sup> and PWS-IC<sup>-p/+m</sup> mice resulting in defective orexigenic signaling and growth retardation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that mitochondrial function is altered in PREPL knockout HEK293T cells and can be rescued with the supplementation of coenzyme Q10. Finally, PREPL-deficient and PWS patient skin fibroblasts display defective mitochondrial bioenergetics. The mitochondrial dysfunction in PWS fibroblasts can be rescued by overexpression of PREPL. In conclusion, we provide the first molecular parallels between CMS22 and PWS, raising the possibility that PREPL substrates might become therapeutic targets for treating both disorders."

    "abstract": "The 15q11-q13 region is a genetic locus with genes subject to genomic imprinting, significantly influencing neurodevelopment. Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon that causes differential gene expression based on the parent of origin. In most diploid organisms, gene expression typically involves an equal contribution from both maternal and paternal alleles, shaping the phenotype. Nevertheless, in mammals, including humans, mice, and marsupials, the functional equivalence of parental alleles is not universally maintained. Notably, during male and female gametogenesis, parental alleles may undergo differential marking or imprinting, thereby modifying gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) (resulting from the absence of paternally expressed genes in this region), Angelman syndrome (AS) (associated with the absence of the maternally expressed UBE3A gene), and 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome (resulting from the two common forms of duplications-either an extra isodicentric 15 chromosome or an interstitial 15 duplication), are the outcomes of genetic variations in this imprinting region. Conducted a genomic study to identify the frequency of pathogenic variants impacting the 15q11-q13 region in an ethnically homogenous population from Bangladesh. Screened all known disorders from the DECIPHER database and identified variant enrichment within this cohort. Using the Horizon analysis platform, performed enrichment analysis, requiring at least >60% overlap between a copy number variation and a disorder breakpoint. Deep clinical phenotyping was carried out through multiple examination sessions to evaluate a range of clinical symptoms. This study included eight individuals with clinically suspected PWS/AS, all previously confirmed through chromosomal microarray analysis, which revealed chromosomal breakpoints within the 15q11-q13 region. Among this cohort, six cases (75%) exhibited variable lengths of deletions, whereas two cases (25%) showed duplications. These included one type 2 duplication, one larger atypical duplication, one shorter type 2 deletion, one larger type 1 deletion, and four cases with atypical deletions. Furthermore, thorough clinical assessments led to the diagnosis of four PWS patients, two AS patients, and two individuals with 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome. Our deep phenotypic observations identified a spectrum of clinical features that overlap and are unique to PWS, AS, and Dup15q syndromes. Our findings establish genotype-phenotype correlation for patients impacted by variable structural variations within the 15q11-q13 region."

    "abstract": "Good postural stability control is dependent upon the complex integration of incoming sensory information (visual, somatosensory, vestibular) with neuromotor responses that are constructed in advance of a voluntary action or in response to an unexpected perturbation. To examine whether differences exist in how sensory inputs are used to control standing balance in children with and without Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). In this cross-sectional study, 18 children with PWS and 51 children categorized as obese but without PWS (without PWS) ages 8-11 completed the Sensory Organization Test®. This test measures the relative contributions of vision, somatosensory, and vestibular inputs to the control of standing balance. The composite equilibrium score (CES) derived from performance in all sensory conditions, in addition to equilibrium scores (EQs) and falls per condition were compared between groups. The CES was lower for children with PWS compared to children without PWS (M=53.93, SD=14.56 vs. M=66.17, SD=9.89, p = .001) while EQs declined in both groups between conditions 1 and 4 (F (1.305, 66.577) = 71.381, p < .001). No group differences in the percent of falls were evident in condition 5 but more children with PWS fell in condition 6 (χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 7.468, p = .006). Group differences in frequency of repeated falls also approached significance in conditions 5 (χ<sup>2</sup> (3) = 4.630, p = .099) and 6 (χ<sup>2</sup> (3) = 5.167, p = .076). Children with PWS demonstrated a lower overall level of postural control and increased sway when compared to children with obesity. Both the higher incidence and repeated nature of falls in children with PWS in conditions 5 and 6 suggest an inability to adapt to sensory conditions in which vestibular input must be prioritized. Postural control training programs in this population should include activities that improve their ability to appropriately weight sensory information in changing sensory environments, with a particular focus on the vestibular system. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD?: This study shows that children with PWS demonstrate a lower level of postural stability. The results suggest that children with PWS show inability to adapt to sensory conditions that require prioritizing vestibular information to maintain postural control. This information can be used to help guide training programs in this population."

Recently, two cases with GNB1 encephalopathy caused by haploinsufficiency have been reported that also show a Prader-Willi-like phenotype of childhood hypotonia and severe obesity. Here we present three new cases from our expert centre for genetic obesity in which GNB1 truncating and splice variants, probably leading to haploinsufficiency, were identified. They all have obesity, hyperphagia and intellectual deficit. The clinical cases and their weight courses are presented, together with a review of all 68 published cases with GNB1 encephalopathy. Information on weight was not mentioned in most of these articles, so we contacted authors for additional clinical information on weight status and hyperphagia. Of the 42 patients whose weight status we could determine, obesity was present in 8 patients (19%). Obesity is significantly over-represented in the group with truncating and splicing variants. In this group, we see an obesity prevalence of 75%. Since GNB1 has been linked to several key genes in the hypothalamic leptin-melanocortin pathway, which regulates satiety and energy expenditure, our data support the potential association between GNB1 haploinsufficiency and genetic obesity. We also suggest GNB1 is a candidate gene for the known obesity phenotype of the 1p36 microdeletion syndrome given this chromosomal region includes the GNB1 gene. Knowledge of an additional obesity phenotype is important for prognosis, early interventions against obesity and awareness when prescribing weight-inducing medication."

Understanding lncRNA-protein interactions (LPIs) is vital for elucidating basic cellular processes, human diseases, viral replication, transcription, and plant pathogen resistance. Despite the development of several LPI calculation methods, predicting LPI remains challenging, with the selection of variables and deep learning structure being the focus of LPI research. We propose a deep learning framework called AR-LPI, which extracts sequence and secondary structure features of proteins and lncRNAs. The framework utilizes an auto-encoder for feature extraction and employs SE-ResNet for prediction. Additionally, we apply transfer learning to the deep neural network SE-ResNet for predicting small-sample datasets. Through comprehensive experimental comparison, we demonstrate that the AR-LPI architecture performs better in LPI prediction. Specifically, the accuracy of AR-LPI increases by 2.86% to 94.52%, while the F-value of AR-LPI increases by 2.71% to 94.73%. Our experimental results show that the overall performance of AR-LPI is better than that of other LPI prediction tools."

    "abstract": "Human cell line models, including the neuronal precursor line LUHMES, are important for investigating developmental transcriptional dynamics within imprinted regions, particularly the 15q11-q13 Angelman (AS) and Prader-Willi (PWS) syndrome locus. AS results from loss of maternal UBE3A in neurons, where the paternal allele is silenced by a convergent antisense transcript UBE3A-ATS, a lncRNA that normally terminates at PWAR1 in non-neurons. qRTPCR analysis confirmed the exclusive and progressive increase in UBE3A-ATS in differentiating LUHMES neurons, validating their use for studying UBE3A silencing. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses revealed changes to 11,834 genes during neuronal differentiation, including the upregulation of most genes within the 15q11-q13 locus. To identify dynamic changes in chromatin loops linked to transcriptional activity, we performed a HiChIP validated by 4C, which identified two neuron-specific CTCF loops between MAGEL2-SNRPN and PWAR1-UBE3A. To determine if allele-specific differentially methylated regions (DMR) may be associated with CTCF loop anchors, whole genome long-read nanopore sequencing was performed. We identified a paternally hypomethylated DMR near the SNRPN upstream loop anchor exclusive to neurons and a paternally hypermethylated DMR near the PWAR1 CTCF anchor exclusive to undifferentiated cells, consistent with increases in neuronal transcription. Additionally, DMRs near CTCF loop anchors were observed in both cell types, indicative of allele-specific differences in chromatin loops regulating imprinted transcription. These results provide an integrated view of the 15q11-q13 epigenetic landscape during LUHMES neuronal differentiation, underscoring the complex interplay of transcription, chromatin looping, and DNA methylation. They also provide insights for future therapeutic approaches for AS and PWS."

    "abstract": "Exposure to social trauma may alter engagement with both fear-related and unrelated social stimuli long after. Intriguingly, how simultaneous discrimination of social fear and safety is affected in neurodevelopmental conditions remains underexplored. The role of the neuropeptide oxytocin is established in social behaviors and yet unexplored during such a challenge post-social trauma. Using Magel2 knockout mice, an animal model of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS), we tested memory of social fear and safety after a modified social fear conditioning task. Additionally, we tracked the activity of oxytocin neurons in the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei of the hypothalamus by fiber photometry, as animals were simultaneously presented with a choice between fear and safe social cue during recall. Male Magel2 KO mice trained to fear females with electrical footshocks avoided both unfamiliar females and males during recalls, lasting even a week post-conditioning. On the contrary, trained Magel2 WT avoided only females during recalls, lasting days rather than a week post-conditioning. Inability to overcome social fear and avoidance of social safety in Magel2 KO mice were associated with the reduced engagement of oxytocin neurons in the SON but not the PVN. In a preclinical model of PWS/SYS, we demonstrated region-specific deficit in oxytocin neuron activity associated with behavioral generalization of social fear to social safety. Insights from this study add to our understanding of oxytocin action in the brain at the intersection of social trauma and PWS/SYS."

    "abstract": "A microdeletion including the SNORD116 gene (SNORD116 MD) has been shown to drive the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) features. PWS is a neurodevelopmental disorder clinically characterized by endocrine impairment, intellectual disability and psychiatric symptoms such as a lack of emotional regulation, impulsivity, and intense temper tantrums with outbursts. In addition, this syndrome is associated with a nutritional trajectory characterized by addiction-like behavior around food in adulthood. PWS is related to the genetic loss of expression of a minimal region that plays a potential role in epigenetic regulation. Nevertheless, the role of the SNORD116 MD in DNA methylation, as well as the impact of the oxytocin (OXT) on it, have never been investigated in human neurons. We studied the methylation marks in induced pluripotent stem-derived dopaminergic neurons carrying a SNORD116 MD in comparison with those from an age-matched adult healthy control. We also performed identical neuron differentiation in the presence of OXT. We performed a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis from the iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons by reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing. In addition, we performed RNA sequencing analysis in these iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons differentiated with or without OXT. The analysis revealed that 153,826 cytosines were differentially methylated between SNORD116 MD neurons and control neurons. Among the differentially methylated genes, we determined a list of genes also differentially expressed. Enrichment analysis of this list encompassed the dopaminergic system with COMT and SLC6A3. COMT displayed hypermethylation and under-expression in SNORD116 MD, and SLC6A3 displayed hypomethylation and over-expression in SNORD116 MD. RT-qPCR confirmed significant over-expression of SLC6A3 in SNORD116 MD neurons. Moreover, the expression of this gene was significantly decreased in the case of OXT adjunction during the differentiation. SNORD116 MD dopaminergic neurons displayed differential methylation and expression in the COMT and SLC6A3 genes, which are related to dopaminergic clearance."

This retrospective study included children with PWS (with and without rhGH) who had undergone at least 1 polysomnography. Outcomes measured were the presence of SDB before and after starting rhGH and the progress of SDB with and without rhGH. Serial insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) measurements were recorded. One-hundred and thirteen polysomnograms were analyzed. The majority (92.3%) of initial polysomnograms showed SDB, with a median (interquartile range) apnea-hypopnea index of 5.0 (2.6, 16.3) events/h. The age for receiving rhGH was a median (IQR) of 1.9 (0.7, 3.4) years. One-third (36.8%) had worsening SDB after initiating rhGH, which was associated with higher IGF-1 levels post-rhGH (<i>P</i> = .007). After a median of 5 years of rhGH, 73.6% maintained or reduced their positive airway pressure settings. Without rhGH, 80% had increased their positive airway pressure settings. Worsening SDB while on rhGH was associated with higher body mass index, lower rhGH dose, higher IGF-1 levels, and non-15q deletion. The majority of Malaysian children with PWS had SDB. At initiation of rhGH, one-third of patients had worsening SDB, associated with increased IGF-1 levels. Stabilization of SDB was more frequently seen in those receiving long-term rhGH.

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder of genetic etiology, characterized by paternal deletion of genes located at chromosome 15 in 70% of cases. Two distinct genetic subtypes of PWS deletions are characterized, where type I (PWS T1) carries four extra haploinsufficient genes compared to type II (PWS T2). PWS T1 individuals display more pronounced physiological and cognitive abnormalities than PWS T2, yet the exact neuropathological mechanisms behind these differences remain unclear. Our study employed postmortem hypothalamic tissues from PWS T1 and T2 individuals, conducting transcriptomic analyses and cell-specific protein profiling in white matter, neurons, and glial cells to unravel the cellular and molecular basis of phenotypic severity in PWS sub-genotypes. In PWS T1, key pathways for cell structure, integrity, and neuronal communication are notably diminished, while glymphatic system activity is heightened compared to PWS T2. The microglial defect in PWS T1 appears to stem from gene haploinsufficiency, as global and myeloid-specific Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency in murine models demonstrated. Our findings emphasize microglial phagolysosome dysfunction and altered neural communication as crucial contributors to the severity of PWS T1's phenotype."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is the most common genetic cause of obesity, occurring in approximately 1 in 15,000 newborns. It results from the lack of expression of genes on the paternal allele of the chromosomal region 15q-11q13 (65-75% due to type 1 or type 2 deletion). Individuals with PWS experience associated symptoms such as hypotonia, hyperphagia, and early-onset obesity (before 5 years of age). Around 20% of adults with PWS also develop type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have shown the beneficial effects of GLP1-RA medications, such as exenatide and liraglutide, in treating type 2 diabetes in PWS. However, there is limited information available on the use of semaglutide in PWS. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of semaglutide on weight loss and glycaemic control in four patients with PWS and type 2 diabetes associated with obesity. The patients were started on weekly subcutaneous progressive doses of semaglutide."

    "abstract": "We present a series of microdeletion and microduplication syndromes (MMSs) observed in our clinical practice over a three-year period from 2020 to 2023. Microdeletion and microduplication syndromes, characterized by chromosomal deletions or duplications of less than five megabases, pose challenges in terms of diagnosis, especially prenatal and clinical management. Clinically, MMSs encompass a broad spectrum of manifestations, ranging from intellectual disability and developmental delays to congenital anomalies, facial dysmorphisms, and neurobehavioral abnormalities. Notable examples include well-characterized syndromes such as DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion), Prader-Willi syndrome (15q11-q13 deletion), and Williams syndrome (7q11 deletion). Our study focuses on the genetic foundations and prenatal ultrasound findings of these syndromes, with an emphasis on cases associated with intellectual disability. Using SNP array technology, we delve into the evolving landscape of diagnostic methods, providing a nuanced understanding of copy number variations (CNVs) and their implications. Prenatal diagnosis allows for the early detection of MMSs, enabling parents and healthcare providers to make informed decisions about the pregnancy and plan for appropriate medical care and interventions. Beyond theoretical considerations, our article bridges the gap between research and practical application by offering insights derived from clinical cases. Through the presentation of specific cases, we aim to contribute valuable data to the broader discourse on MMSs, fostering knowledge exchange and enhancing the medical community's awareness of these complex genetic conditions."

    "abstract": "Obesity is known as a heterogeneous and multifactorial disease. The distribution of body fat is crucial for the development of metabolic complications. Comprehensive genetic analyses on different fat tissues are rare but necessary to provide more detailed information. Therefore, we performed genetic analyses of three patients with obesity using high resolution genome wide SNP array (blood, visceral fat tissue) and fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) analyses (visceral and subcutaneous fat tissue). Altogether, we identified 31 small Copy Number Variations (losses: 1p31.1, 1p22.2, 1q21.3, 2q34, 2q37.1, 3q28, 6p25.3, 7q31.33, 7q33, 8p23.3, 10q22.3, 11p15.4, 11p15.1, 11p14.2, 11p12, 13q12.3, 15q11.2-q13.1, 15q13.3, 20q13.2, 22q11.21; gains: 2q22.1-q22.2, 3p14.3, 4p16.3, 4q32.2, 6q27, 7p14.3, 7q34, 11p12, 12p11.21, 16p11.2-p11.1, 17q21.31) and 289 small copy-neutral Loss of Heterozygosity (cn-LOH). For the chromosomal region 15q11.2-q13.1, we detected a microdeletion (Prader-Willi-Syndrome) in one patient. Interestingly, we identified chromosomal SNP differences between EDTA-blood and visceral fat tissue (deletion and gain). Small losses of 7q31.33, 7q33, 11p14.2, 11p12, 13q12.3 as well as small gain of 7q34 were detected only in fat tissue and not in blood. Furthermore, FISH analyses on 7q31.33, 7q33 and 11p12 revealed differences between subcutaneous and visceral fat tissue. Generally, the deletions were detected more frequent in visceral fat tissue. Predominantly detected cn-LOH vs. CNV suggests a meaning of these cn-LOH for the pathogenesis of obesity. We conclude that the SNP array and FISH analyses used is applicable to generate more information for basic research on difficult cell subpopulations (e.g., visceral adipose tissue) and could opens up new diagnostic aspects in the field of obesity. Altogether, the significance of these mostly not yet described genetic aberrations in different fat tissues needs to confirmed in a larger series."

    "abstract": "Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a Sertoli cell-secreted glycoprotein involved in male fetal sex differentiation: it provokes the regression of Müllerian ducts, which otherwise give rise to the Fallopian tubes, the uterus and the upper part of the vagina. In the first trimester of fetal life, AMH is expressed independently of gonadotropins, whereas from the second trimester onwards AMH testicular production is stimulated by FSH and oestrogens; at puberty, AMH expression is inhibited by androgens. AMH has also been suggested to participate in testicular descent during fetal life, but its role remains unclear. Serum AMH is a well-recognized biomarker of testicular function from birth to the first stages of puberty. Especially in boys with nonpalpable gonads, serum AMH is the most useful marker of the existence of testicular tissue. In boys with cryptorchidism, serum AMH levels reflect the mass of functional Sertoli cells: they are lower in patients with bilateral than in those with unilateral cryptorchidism. Interestingly, serum AMH increases after testis relocation to the scrotum, suggesting that the ectopic position result in testicular dysfunction, which may be at least partially reversible. In boys with cryptorchidism associated with micropenis, low AMH and FSH are indicative of central hypogonadism, and serum AMH is a good marker of effective FSH treatment. In patients with cryptorchidism in the context of disorders of sex development, low serum AMH is suggestive of gonadal dysgenesis, whereas normal or high AMH is found in patients with isolated androgen synthesis defects or with androgen insensitivity. In syndromic disorders, assessment of serum AMH has shown that Sertoli cell function is preserved in boys with Klinefelter syndrome until mid-puberty, while it is affected in patients with Noonan, Prader-Willi or Down syndromes."

    "abstract": "Epigenome editing with DNA-targeting technologies such as CRISPR-dCas9 can be used to dissect gene regulatory mechanisms and potentially treat associated disorders. For example, Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is caused by loss of paternally expressed imprinted genes on chromosome 15q11.2-q13.3, although the maternal allele is intact but epigenetically silenced. Using CRISPR repression and activation screens in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we identified genomic elements that control expression of the PWS gene <i>SNRPN</i> from the paternal and maternal chromosomes. We showed that either targeted transcriptional activation or DNA demethylation can activate the silenced maternal <i>SNRPN</i> and downstream PWS transcripts. However, these two approaches function at unique regions, preferentially activating different transcript variants and involving distinct epigenetic reprogramming mechanisms. Remarkably, transient expression of the targeted demethylase leads to stable, long-term maternal <i>SNRPN</i> expression in PWS iPSCs. This work uncovers targeted epigenetic manipulations to reprogram a disease-associated imprinted locus and suggests possible therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "This perspective review aims to explore the potential neurobiological mechanisms involved in the application of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) for Down syndrome (DS), the leading cause of genetically-based intellectual disability. The neural mechanisms underlying tDCS interventions in genetic disorders, typically characterized by cognitive deficits, are grounded in the concept of brain plasticity. We initially present the neurobiological and functional effects elicited by tDCS applications in enhancing neuroplasticity and in regulating the excitatory/inhibitory balance, both associated with cognitive improvement in the general population. The review begins with evidence on tDCS applications in five neurogenetic disorders, including Rett, Prader-Willi, Phelan-McDermid, and Neurofibromatosis 1 syndromes, as well as DS. Available evidence supports tDCS as a potential intervention tool and underscores the importance of advancing neurobiological research into the mechanisms of tDCS action in these conditions. We then discuss the potential of tDCS as a promising non-invasive strategy to mitigate deficits in plasticity and promote fine-tuning of the excitatory/inhibitory balance in DS, exploring implications for cognitive treatment perspectives in this population."

Eleven French University Hospital Centers. Adults with CRO (body mass index > 30 kg/m²) without the sign of recurrence of craniopharyngioma in the past year. Exenatide or placebo injected subcutaneously twice a day during 26 weeks. The primary outcome was the mean change in body weight at week 26 in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary outcomes were eating behavior, calories intake, energy expenditure, cardiovascular, metabolic risk factor, quality of life, and the tolerance profile. At week 26, weight decreased from baseline by a mean of -3.8 (SD 4.3) kg for exenatide and -1.6 (3.8) kg for placebo. The adjusted mean treatment difference was -3.1 kg (95% confidence interval [CI] -7.0 to 0.7, P = 0.11). Results were compatible with a higher reduction of hunger score with exenatide compared with placebo (estimated treatment difference in change from baseline to week 26: -2.3, 95% CI -4.5 to -0.2), while all other outcomes did not significantly differ between groups. Adverse events were more common with exenatide versus placebo, and occurred in, respectively, 19 (95%) participants (108 events) and 14 (70%) participants (54 events). Combined with intensive lifestyle interventions, a 26-week treatment with exenatide was not demonstrated superior to placebo to treat craniopharyngioma-related obesity."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex, genetic disorder characterized by multisystem involvement, including hyperphagia, maladaptive behaviors and endocrinological derangements. Recent developments in advanced neuroimaging have led to a growing understanding of PWS as a neural circuit disorder, as well as subsequent interests in the application of neuromodulatory therapies. Various non-invasive and invasive device-based neuromodulation methods, including vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS) have all been reported to be potentially promising treatments for addressing the major symptoms of PWS. In this systematic literature review, we summarize the recent literature that investigated these therapies, discuss the underlying circuits which may underpin symptom manifestations, and cover future directions of the field. Through our comprehensive search, there were a total of 47 patients who had undergone device-based neuromodulation therapy for PWS. Two articles described VNS, 4 tDCS, 1 rTMS and 2 DBS, targeting different symptoms of PWS, including aberrant behavior, hyperphagia and weight. Multi-center and multi-country efforts will be required to advance the field given the low prevalence of PWS. Finally, given the potentially vulnerable population, neuroethical considerations and dialogue should guide the field."

We performed a retrospective review of children with PWS and healthy controls who underwent diagnostic polysomnograms between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2020, at SickKids, Toronto, Canada. EEGs from the polysomnograms were reviewed for the presence of the 14 and 6 like spike wave activity and its characteristics. Clinical correlation of the EEG variant with sleep-disordered breathing indices from the polysomnograms was also evaluated. A total of 94 children with PWS and 50 healthy controls were included. The median age and interquartile range for the cohort was 1.42 (0.6, 4.2) years. There were 50 (53.2%) males in the PWS cohort. The EEG variant prevalence in this cohort was 51.0% (n = 48) in children with PWS and 0% for the healthy controls. 14 and 6 Hz like spike wave activity was bilateral in 52% (25/48) children with PWS. The waves had a negative deflection in almost all patients, 44/48 (92%), with PWS. It was predominantly located in the frontal leads for children with PWS, 23/48 (47.9%). It most frequently occurred during non-rapid eye movement stage 2 sleep for children with PWS, 25/48 (52.0%). The mean (standard deviation) frequency was 6.8 (0.97) Hz. The median (interquartile range) length of the waves was 1.1 (0.8, 1.4) seconds in children with PWS. There was no correlation between the presence of the EEG variant and sleep-disordered breathing indices in children with PWS. The 14 and 6 Hz like spike wave activity EEG variant was present in more than 50% of a pediatric cohort of children with PWS compared with 0% in healthy children.

Oxt also increases muscle tonicity and decreases proteolysis while PWS infants are hypotonic and require assisted feeding in early infancy. This evidence inspired us to merge the results of almost 20 years of studies and formulate a new hypothesis according to which the disruption of Oxt's mechanism of thermoregulation manifests in PWS, SYS, and ASD through thermosensory abnormalities and skeletal muscle tone. This review will integrate the current literature with new updates on PWS, SYS, and ASD and the recent discoveries on Oxt's regulation of thermogenesis to advance the knowledge on these diseases."

Due to the close association between these two conditions, and recognizing that Theory of Mind (ToM) is related to social behaviors in ASD, there is a growing interest in studying the reciprocity of social communication between these two groups. The primary objective of this study was to compare how children (n = 45) with PWS (n = 15), ASD (n = 15), and a control group (n = 15) respond to emotion recognition of facial expressions and empathy, which are both concepts related to ToM. The study utilized two tools named FEEL and Deusto-e-Motion 1.0. We also evaluated the Working Memory index of the WISC-IV scale, the Social Perception domain of the NEPSY-II battery, and the SCQ in both clinical groups. Our findings suggest that individuals with PWS exhibit lower accuracy in recognizing facial expressions and empathy compared to the control group. Both clinical groups exhibited a delayed reaction time compared to the control group. Children with PWS display difficulties in recognizing emotions of disgust and surprise. In terms of cognitive empathy, children with PWS showed a greater inclination to respond to disgust as compared to children with ASD. This study represents the initial stage in comprehending the emotional and empathetic abilities of children with PWS and ASD.

To date no study has explored eating behavior in children with severe, early-onset obesity. Self-administered questionnaire data from these children were examined to evaluate eating behavior and the etiology of early-onset obesity. Children with severe, early-onset obesity (body mass index [BMI] > International Obesity Task Force [IOTF] 30) of different etiologies (hypothalamic obesity [HO], intellectual disability with obesity [IDO], common polygenic obesity [CO]) were prospectively included. BMI history and responses from the Dykens' Hyperphagia Questionnaire and an in-house Impulsivity Questionnaire at first visit were compared between groups. This cohort of 75 children (39 girls; mean age ± standard deviation [SD] 10.8 ± 4.4 years) had severe, early-onset obesity at an age of 3.8 ± 2.7 years, with a BMI Z-score of 4.9 ± 1.5. BMI history varied between the 3 groups, with earlier severe obesity in the HO group versus 2 other groups (BMI > IOTF40 at 3.4 ± 1.6 vs. 4.6 ± 1.6 and 8.4 ± 4.1 years for the IDO and CO groups, respectively [P < 0.01]). Absence of adiposity rebound was more prevalent in the HO group (87% vs. 63% and 33% for the IDO and CO groups, respectively [P < 0.01]). The Dykens' mean total score for the cohort was 22.1 ± 7.2 with no significant between-group differences. Hyperphagia (Dykens' score > 19) and impulsivity (score > 7) were found in 50 (67%) and 11 children (15%), respectively, with no difference between the HO, IDO and CO groups regarding the number of patients with hyperphagia (10 [67%], 14 [74%], and 26 [63%] children, respectively) or impulsivity (2 [13%], 1 [7%], and 8 [19%] children, respectively). Children with food impulsivity had significantly higher total and severity scores on the Dykens' Questionnaire versus those without impulsivity. The Dykens' and Impulsivity questionnaires can help diagnose severe hyperphagia with/without food impulsivity in children with early-onset obesity, regardless of disease origin. Their systematic use can allow more targeted management of food access control in clinical practice and monitor the evolution of eating behavior in the case of innovative therapeutic targeting hyperphagia."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare, neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the lack of expression of paternally imprinted genes on chromosome 15q11-13. PWS features a complex behavioral phenotype, including hyperphagia, anxiety, compulsivity, rigidity, repetitive speech, temper outbursts, aggressivity, and skin-picking. Questionnaires exist for measuring hyperphagia, but not for the aggregation of other problems that are distinctive to PWS. A PWS-specific tool is needed for phenotypic research, and to help evaluate treatment efficacy in future clinical trials aimed at attenuating PWS's hyperphagia and related problems. In this 4-phase study, we leveraged our expertise in PWS with feedback from families and specialists to validate the PWS Profile, a novel, informant-based measure of behavioral and emotional problems in this syndrome. The authors developed a bank of 73 items that tapped both common and less frequent but clinically significant problems in PWS (Phase 1). An iterative feedback process with families and stakeholders was used to ensure content and construct validity (Phase 2). After adding, omitting, or revising items, in Phase 3, we pilot tested the measure in 112 participants. Results were reviewed by an international team of PWS specialists and revised again (Phase 3). The final, 57-item Profile was then administered to 761 participants (Phase 4). Principal component factor analyses (n = 873) revealed eight conceptually meaningful factors, accounting for 60.52% of test variance, and were readily interpretated as: Rigidity, Insistence; Aggressive Behaviors; Repetitive Questioning, Speech; Compulsive Behaviors; Depression, Anxiety; Hoarding; Negative Distorted Thinking; and Magical Distorted Thinking. Factors were internally consistent and showed good test-retest reliability and convergent validity with existent measures of behavioral problems. Profile factors were not related to IQ, BMI, or parental SES. Three Profile factors differed across PWS genetic subtypes. Age and gender differences were found in only one Profile factor, Hoarding. The PWS Profile is a valid, psychometrically-sound questionnaire that already has shown responsivity to treatment in a previous clinical trial. The Profile can extend the reach of future clinical trials by evaluating the impact of novel agents not only on hyperphagia, but also on the emotional and behavioral problems that characterize PWS."

In short-term studies, no difference in REE was found between GH-treated and untreated children with PWS. However, there are limited data on REE in children with PWS who were GH-treated for a long period. This study describes measured REE (mREE), energy intake, and body composition during long-term GH treatment in children with PWS. Patients were treated with 1.0 mg GH/m2/day (∼0.035 mg/kg/day). REE was determined by indirect calorimetry; dietary energy intake was calculated using a 3-day dietary record. Body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. We included 52 GH-treated children with PWS with a mean (SD) age of 8.53 (4.35) years and a median (IQR) GH-treatment duration of 7 (4-11) years. mREE increased with age, but was not associated with GH-treatment duration. A higher LBM was associated with higher mREE. Mean energy intake was significantly lower compared to daily energy requirements (DER) for age- and sex-matched healthy children (p < 0.001), ranging from 23 to 36% less intake in children aged 3.5-12 years to 49% less intake in children aged 12-18 years. Fifty percent of children had a normal REE, 17.3% a decreased REE, and 32.7% an elevated REE, according to predicted REE based on measured REE in a large group of healthy children. In children with PWS, mREE increases with age. GH-treatment duration is not associated, whereas LBM is an important determinant of mREE. Children with PWS have a low to very low energy intake compared to DER for age- and sex-matched children, with a declining intake when becoming older. Severe obesity can develop in children with PWS when food intake is not controlled. Maintenance of body weight requires an energy balance, of which energy intake and energy expenditure are important components.

    "title": "Psychotic illness in people with Prader-Willi syndrome: a systematic review of clinical presentation, course and phenomenology.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare and complex neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from absent paternal expression of maternally imprinted genes at chromosomal locus 15q11-13. This absence of expression occurs as a consequence of a deletion on the chromosome 15 of paternal origin (ca. 70%), a chromosome 15 maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD; ca. 25%), or an imprinting centre defect (IC; ca. 1-3%). At birth, individuals with PWS are severely hypotonic and fail to thrive. Hyperphagia and characteristic physical and neuropsychiatric phenotypes become apparent during childhood. The risk for the development of a co-morbid psychotic illness increases during the teenage years, specifically in those with PWS due to the presence of an mUPD. The primary aim of this literature review is to inform clinical practice. To achieve this, we have undertaken a systematic analysis of the clinical research literature on prevalence, presentation, course, characteristics, diagnosis and treatment of psychotic illness in people with PWS. The secondary aim is to identify clinical aspects of psychotic illness in PWS in need of further investigation. A systematic literature review on psychosis in PWS was conducted on the databases Web of Knowledge, PubMed and Scopus, using the terms \"((Prader-Willi syndrome) OR (Prader Willi Syndrome)) AND ((psychosis) OR (psychotic illness))\". All articles written in English and reporting original human research were reviewed. In all but three of the 16 cohort studies in which the genetic types were known, the authors reported higher rates of psychosis in people with PWS resulting from an mUPD, compared to those with the deletion subtype of PWS. When psychosis was present the presentation was psychosis similar regardless of genetic type and was usually characterised by an acute onset of hallucinations and delusions accompanied by confusion, anxiety and motor symptoms. The onset of confusion, an affective cyclical pattern with the presence of abnormal mental beliefs and experiences, usually of rapid onset is suggestive of the development of psychotic illness. Phenomenologically, this psychosis in people with PWS is atypical in comparison to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the general population. The relationship to psychosis in the general population and the optimum treatments remain uncertain."

This study aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of orthopedic deformities in patients with PWS. A retrospective study was conducted on 175 patients up to March 2023. The Cobb angle(CA) of the spine, the alpha angle of the hip joint, and the acetabular index (AI) were measured. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between demographic parameters and bone deformities. Scoliosis was found in 66 patients (43.7%), including 52 (78.8%) with mild scoliosis, 10 (15.2%) with moderate scoliosis, and 4 (6.1%) with severe scoliosis. Only seven patients received orthopedic treatment (10.6%). The median age of scoliosis was 4.5 years old, and the prevalence of scoliosis increased rapidly at the age of 5 years and adolescence. The mean CA in this study increased gradually with age. HD was found in 47 patients (38.2%), and 6 patients received orthopedic treatment (12.7%). The median age at HD was 1.8 years old. The mean AI of the study population decreased with age. The prevalence of HD treated with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) was low. No significant differences were observed in sex, genotype, body mass index (BMI), obesity rate, or onset of scoliosis and HD. The prevalence of scoliosis and HD was higher in patients with PWS. The onset age and developmental trends of the different skeletal malformations were different. Early diagnosis and treatment are important for the prognosis and treatment of orthopedic diseases in patients with PWS."

    "title": "A supervised learning method for classifying methylation disorders.",
    "abstract": "DNA methylation is one of the most stable and well-characterized epigenetic alterations in humans. Accordingly, it has already found clinical utility as a molecular biomarker in a variety of disease contexts. Existing methods for clinical diagnosis of methylation-related disorders focus on outlier detection in a small number of CpG sites using standardized cutoffs which differentiate healthy from abnormal methylation levels. The standardized cutoff values used in these methods do not take into account methylation patterns which are known to differ between the sexes and with age. Here we profile genome-wide DNA methylation from blood samples drawn from within a cohort composed of healthy controls of different age and sex alongside patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Fragile-X syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and Silver-Russell syndrome. We propose a Generalized Additive Model to perform age and sex adjusted outlier analysis of around 700,000 CpG sites throughout the human genome. Utilizing z-scores among the cohort for each site, we deployed an ensemble based machine learning pipeline and achieved a combined prediction accuracy of 0.96 (Binomial 95% Confidence Interval 0.868[Formula: see text]0.995). We demonstrate a method for age and sex adjusted outlier detection of differentially methylated loci based on a large cohort of healthy individuals. We present a custom machine learning pipeline utilizing this outlier analysis to classify samples for potential methylation associated congenital disorders. These methods are able to achieve high accuracy when used with machine learning methods to classify abnormal methylation patterns."

    "title": "Body weight, behaviours of concern, and social contact in adults and adolescents with Prader-Willi syndrome in full-time care services: Findings from pooled international archival data.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic neurodevelopmental condition characterised by a range of debilitating and lifelong symptoms. The many physical and behavioural challenges that arise with adults with PWS often necessitate full-time (i.e., 24-hour) professional care support. However, despite the fact that many clinicians regard full-time PWS-specific care to represent best practice, relatively few studies have directly examined the benefits of such services. The purpose of this paper is to use archival data to investigate the impact of full-time care services on people with PWS, and to assemble a large statistical dataset on which robust analyses of improvements in weight, BMI, and behavioural outcomes can be based. Information collated by the International PWS Organisation (IPWSO), an international non-profit membership organisation supporting national PWS associations around the world, was combined into a single anonymised dataset for statistical analysis. Data were supplied by service-providers from several countries who provide full-time support to people with PWS. The dataset included details on the specific services provided, basic demographic information on service recipients, including weight, body mass index (BMI), and observational records relating to behaviours of concern (BOC; consisting of temper outbursts, skin-picking, egocentrism, inflexibility, and striving for dominance). A total of 193 people with PWS (ranging in age from < 10 yrs to > 50 yrs; 93% of whom were > 18 yrs), residing in 11 services across 6 countries, were represented in the dataset. On average, people with PWS showed significant reductions in weight and BMI after joining a full-time care service, with improvements within one year of entering, which were cumulative over time and independent of age or initial weight at entry. Similar cumulative improvements over time were seen for BOC within one year and were unrelated to age or severity of BOC at entry. The degree to which services are specialised for residents with PWS appeared to confer particular benefits, with people living in PWS-exclusive services showing the greatest improvements in weight, BMI, and BOC. Reductions in BOC were associated with greater, rather than less, social contact, suggesting that these improvements were not achieved at the expense of broader freedoms, such as the opportunity to meet with families and friends. We conclude that full-time care services have a high likelihood of enhancing the lives of people with PWS within one year with long-lasting benefits, especially if those services are exclusive and specialised around the particular needs of PWS."

    "title": "Current and future state of pharmacological management of pediatric obesity.",
    "abstract": "Pediatric obesity is a highly prevalent chronic disease, which has traditionally been treated with lifestyle therapy alone. Yet for many youth, lifestyle intervention as a monotherapy is often insufficient for achieving clinically significant and durable BMI reduction. While metabolic/bariatric surgery achieves robust and long-lasting outcomes, it is neither widely accessible nor wanted by most pediatric patients and families. In the past 3 years, this treatment gap between lifestyle therapy and metabolic/bariatric surgery has been filled with a number of landmark clinical trials examining the safety and efficacy of anti-obesity medication (AOM) for use in children and adolescents. These trials include studies of liraglutide, phentermine/topiramate ER, semaglutide, and setmelanotide, all of which have led to FDA and/or EMA approval. Concurrent with this developing evidence base, in 2023, the American Academy of Pediatrics published their first Clinical Practice Guideline on the assessment and management of childhood obesity. The Guideline includes the recommendation that pediatric health care providers should offer AOM to youth ages ≥12 years with obesity. Recognizing that AOM use in the pediatric population will likely become the standard of care and to provide perspective on the recently generated data regarding new AOM, this narrative review summarizes the published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from the past 10 years that examine AOM for the pediatric population. This report additionally includes RCTs examining AOM for special populations of pediatric obesity including monogenic obesity, Bardet Biedl syndrome, Prader Willi syndrome, and hypothalamic obesity. Finally, the clinical application of AOM for children and adolescents, as well as future directions and challenges are discussed."

    "abstract": "To reveal the clinical significance, pathological involvement and molecular mechanism of imprinted in Prader-Willi syndrome (IPW) in RPE anomalies that contribute to AMD. IPW expression under pathological conditions were detected by microarrays and qPCR assays. In vitro cultured fetal RPE cells were used to study the pathogenicity induced by IPW overexpression and to analyze its upstream and downstream regulatory networks. We showed that IPW is upregulated in the macular RPE-choroid tissue of dry AMD patients and in fetal RPE cells under oxidative stress, inflammation and dedifferentiation. IPW overexpression in fetal RPE cells induced aberrant apical-basal polarization as shown by dysregulated polarized markers, disrupted tight and adherens junctions, and inhibited phagocytosis. IPW upregulation was also associated with RPE oxidative damages, as demonstrated by intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species, reduced cell proliferation, and accelerated cell apoptosis. Mechanically, N6-methyladenosine level of the IPW transcript regulated its stability with YTHDC1 as the reader. IPW mediated RPE features by suppressing MEG3 expression to sequester its inhibition on the AKT serine-threonine kinase (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. We also noticed that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin suppresses the AKT/mTOR pathway to alleviate the IPW-induced RPE anomalies. We revealed that IPW overexpression in RPE induces aberrant apical-basal polarization and oxidative damages, thus contributing to AMD progression. We also annotated the upstream and downstream regulatory networks of IPW in RPE. Our findings shed new light on the molecular mechanisms of RPE dysfunctions, and indicate that IPW blockers may be a promising option to treat RPE abnormalities in AMD."

A Global PWS Registry survey was developed to investigate nasogastric (NG) and gastrostomy (G) tube use and associated complications. Of 346 participants, 242 (69.9%) had NG-tubes, 17 (4.9%) had G-tubes, and 87 (25.1%) had both NG- and G-tubes. Primary indication for placement was \"feeding difficulties and/or poor weight gain\" for both NG- (90.2%) and G-tubes (71.2%), while \"aspiration/breathing difficulties\" was the procedural indication for 6.4% of NG-tubes and 23.1% of G-tubes. NG-tubes were generally removed by age 6 months (NG Only: 82.9%; NG/G: 98.8%), while G-tubes were often removed by age 2 years (G Only: 85.7%; NG/G: 70.5%). The severe complication rate from G-tubes was 31.7% and from NG-tubes was 1.2%. Overall, caregivers indicated the presence of an NG- or G-tube had a positive effect on quality of life. Feeding difficulties in PWS are largely managed by NG-tube alone. The severe complication rate from G-tubes was about 25 times higher than from NG-tubes; yet, G-tube placement rates have generally increased. G-tube placement puts individuals with PWS at risk for anesthesia and surgery-related complications and should be considered judiciously by a multidisciplinary team."

    "title": "Mothering a Child With Complexity and Rarity: A Narrative Inquiry Exploring Prader-Willi Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Daily experiences of mothers caring for children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are largely unknown and unvoiced. Knowledge of PWS has generally focused on pathology of the disorder. This emphasis overlooks the challenging moments of everyday life caring for children with PWS. Storied accounts of mothers caring for children with PWS offer expanded narratives to medicalized descriptions of experience. An understanding of everyday challenges in managing physical and mental health issues of PWS including hyperphagia and anxiety may create shifts in social and clinical perspectives. This understanding could improve practices in health and social care for families with PWS. This narrative inquiry studied everyday experience using storied accounts. Participants were mothers caring for children aged 3-17 years with genetically confirmed PWS who were experiencing hyperphagia. Four participants were recruited, and each interviewed 8-12 times over 12 months. Field texts and narrative accounts were co-composed through a collaborative process of analysis. Engaging with participants' day-to-day experiences offered insights into their work of nurturing, caring, and contributing to the care of a child with PWS. Narrative threads focused on complexity and rarity and include the desire to be normal, how ordinary becomes extraordinary, isolation, behaviors and normative standards, and alternative stories of mothering. Recommendations for practice and policy include (a) challenges of mothering a child with complexity, (b) moving beyond functionality and impairment to participation and quality of life, (c) re-storying narratives and supports for families, and (d) engaging with mothers to determine care priorities."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder affecting multiple systems. Approximately one-quarter of PWS patients will develop diabetes. Given the uncontrolled hyperphagia and resultant severe obesity in these patients, their glycemic management poses a significant challenge. We present the clinical profile of a male patient diagnosed with both PWS and diabetes. Previous administration of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor Canagliflozin resulted in improved glycemic control and weight management. But at the age of 25, the patient was hospitalized due to worsened glycemic control and the detection of ketonuria. After thorough examination and clinical observation, we discovered that the patient ketonuria was associated with enhanced lipid metabolism related to Canagliflozin. After excluding the risk of SGLT-2 inhibitor-induced euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, adjustments of the hypoglycemic regimen, building upon prior treatment, were recommended for the patient. It is important to note that among patients with both PWS and diabetes, the utilization of SGLT-2 inhibitors can lead to the emergence of ketonuria due to increased lipolysis. Therefore, any decision to discontinue SGLT-2 inhibitors should undergo thorough evaluation."

    "abstract": "Syndromic obesity refers to obesity occurring with additional clinical findings, such as intellectual disability/developmental delay, dysmorphic features, and congenital malformations. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To present a narrative review regarding the genetic etiology, clinical description, and molecular diagnosis of syndromic obesity, which is a rare condition with high phenotypic variability and genetic heterogeneity. The following syndromes are presented in this review: Prader-Willi, Bardet-Biedl, Pseudohypoparathyroidism, Alström, Smith-Magenis, Cohen, Temple, 1p36 deletion, 16p11.2 microdeletion, Kleefstra, SIM1-related, Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann, WAGRO, Carpenter, MORM, and MYT1L-related syndromes. RECENT FINDINGS: There are three main groups of mechanisms for syndromic obesity: imprinting, transcriptional activity regulation, and cellular cilia function. For molecular diagnostic, methods of genome-wide investigation should be prioritized over sequencing of panels of syndromic obesity genes. In addition, we present novel syndromic conditions that need further delineation, but evidences suggest they have a higher frequency of obesity. The etiology of syndromic obesity tends to be linked to disrupted neurodevelopment (central) and is associated with a diversity of genes and biological pathways. In the genetic investigation of individuals with syndromic obesity, the possibility that the etiology of the syndromic condition is independent of obesity should be considered. The accurate genetic diagnosis impacts medical management, treatment, and prognosis, and allows proper genetic counseling."

We aimed to explore the influence of specific gene changes on the clinical symptoms of PWS and the value of early screening and early intervention of the condition. All data in this study were extracted from the database of the XiaoPang Weili Rare Disease Care Center. The collected information included basic demographics, maternal pregnancy information, endocrine abnormalities, growth and development abnormalities, and other clinical phenotypes. The relationships between genotypes and phenotypes in the major categories of PWS were analyzed. A total of 586 PWS cases with confirmed molecular diagnosis and genotyping were included in this study. Among them, 83.8% belonged to the deletion type, 10.9% the uniparental disomy (UPD) type, and 5.3% the imprinting defect (ID) type. Age-wide comparison among the three groups: The rate of hypopigmentation in the deletion group was higher than that in the UPD group (88.8% vs. 60.9%; p < 0.05); A total of 62 patients (14.2%) had epilepsy; and no statistical significance was found among the three groups (p = 0.110). Age-wide comparison between the deletion and non-deletion types: the rate of skin hypopigmentation and epilepsy in the deletion group was significantly higher than that in the non-deletion group (88.8% vs. 68.4%, p < 0.001; 15.9% vs. 7.6%, p = 0.040). The intergroup comparison for the >2-year age group: there were significant intergroup differences in the language development delay among the three groups (p < 0.001). The incidence of delayed language development was the highest in the deletion group, followed by the UPD group, and the lowest in the ID group. The rates of obesity and hyperphagia in the deletion group were also higher than those in the non-deletion group (71.1% vs. 58.9%, p = 0.041; 75.7% vs. 62.0%, p = 0.016). There are significant differences in the rates of skin hypopigmentation and language developmental delay among the deletion, UPD, and ID genotypes. The patients with deletion type had significantly higher rates of lighter skin color, obesity, hyperphagia, language developmental delay, and epilepsy. The results of this study will help clinicians better understand the impact of different PWS molecular etiologies on specific phenotypes."

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to describe the characteristics of the first large national sample of persons with PWS in Spain and analyse the relationships of those characteristics with key demographic and clinical factors, particularly with obesity and the regular use of psychotropic medication. Participants were recruited among all members of the Spanish Prader-Willi Association who agreed to take part in the study and fulfilled its inclusion criteria. Family and patient demographic features, family size and birth order, intelligence quotient (IQ), anthropometric measures, lifestyle habits, behavioural disturbances (with the Aberrant Behavior Checklist) and clinical data, as well as use of psychotropic drugs and their side effects (with the UKU scale), were collected in genetically confirmed cases of PWS. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were used for determining the associations of demographic and clinical factors with both obesity and the regular use of psychotropic medication. The cohort included 177 participants (aged 6-48 years), that is, 90 (50.8%) males and 87 (49.2%) females. Behavioural disturbances were present in a range of 75% to 93% of participants; psychotropic medication was prescribed to 81 (45.8%) of them. Number of siblings showed a direct correlation with IQ, especially among males, and inappropriate speech was more intense in only-child females. Obesity was, in parallel, strongly associated with ascending age and with not being currently under growth hormone (GH) treatment. Participants taking any psychotropic medication were characterised by more frequent age ≥30 years, high level of hyperactivity and a psychiatric diagnosis. Characterisation of persons with PWS in Spain confirms their physical and behavioural phenotype and supports the long-term application of GH therapy and the rational use of psychotropic medication."

    "abstract": "Obesity is highly prevalent in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), particularly among adults. This condition, which can be morbid in many cases, is multifactorial and has a complex management. The purpose of our study was to describe the feasibility of achieving a better nutritional status, including normal weight in individuals diagnosed with PWS, through specific nutritional interventions within the framework of a transdisciplinary treatment and without resorting to pharmacological treatments or growth hormone (GH). This observational study included patients with confirmed genetic diagnosis of PWS, receiving transdisciplinary treatment in a specialized rare diseases institution. Patients under treatment with GH and those under pharmacological treatment with nutritional objectives were excluded from the study. All patients attended our institution regularly on a weekly or fortnightly basis. Anthropometric records, including weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated in each visit from treatment onset until the last check-up. We included 24 patients with confirmed genetic diagnosis of PWS. At baseline, 9 patients (38 %) had obesity grade III, 1 (4 %) of obesity grade II, 10 (42 %) of obesity grade I, 2 (8 %) of overweight, and 2 patients (8 %) with normal baseline weight. After a median duration of 52 months (interquartile range 23-116 months) of transdisciplinary nutritional treatment, we identified a significant reduction in BMI (baseline 40.2 ± 15.7 kg/m2 vs. follow-up 28.3 ± 6.7 kg/m2, p < 0.0001), without significant differences regarding height (baseline 1.45 ± 0.1 m vs. follow-up 1.48 ± 0.1 m, p = 0.09). In this study, we demonstrated that nutritional nonpharmacologic interventions immersed in a transdisciplinary treatment enabled a consistent and sustainable improvement in BMI and nutritional status among patients with PWS."

Cytogenetic analysis revealed a karyotype of 46, XX of cultured amniocytes. Further analysis using copy number variation sequencing (CNV-seq) analysis showed 55 % T15 mosaicism. The second amniocentesis was performed and showed a karyotype of 46, XX and 26 % T15 mosaicism by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). MS-MLPA analysis of uncultured amniocytes showed that the copy number ratio of 15q11-13 ranged from 1.3 to 1.5, and the percentage of methylation was between 70 % and 100 %. MS-MLPA assay of cultured amniocytes showed a copy number ratio of 1 and a methylation percentage of 100 %. Therefore, this fetus was identified to be an UPD(15) mat/T15 mosaicism.

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the impact of rhGH treatment on sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBDs) for toddlers with PWS. A total of 17 age-matched PWS patients receiving rhGH treatment (rhGH group) and 17 control individuals not receiving rhGH treatment (non-rhGH group) were recruited for this study between October 2018 and January 2023. Data related to polysomnography-polygraphy (PSG) and serum levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) were collected. The mean age in the rhGH group was 20.76 ± 9.22 months, which was comparable to that of the non-rhGH group (25.23 ± 13.81 months). The demographic and anthropometric parameters were similar across the two groups after 52 weeks of treatment. Administration of rhGH to toddlers did not exert adverse effects on the obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI), central apnea index (CAI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), mean percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), lowest SpO<sub>2</sub>, duration when SpO<sub>2</sub> is lower than 90%, or proportion of the patients with SpO<sub>2</sub> lower than 90%. Furthermore, the increased IGF-1 z-score and IGFBP-3 level did not worsen SRBDs. Treatment with rhGH for 52 weeks on young toddlers with PWS showed no deleterious effects on SRBDs. This shed more light on the importance of initiating rhGH therapy early in PWS patients."

    "abstract": "People with intellectual disabilities are at increased risk of dental anxiety and poor oral health. In addition, people with intellectual disabilities are at increased risk of potentially traumatic experiences, such as violence and sexual abuse, and appear to be more vulnerable to developing trauma-related disorders following such experiences. While psychological trauma is associated with poor oral health and dental anxiety in the general population, the potential link between dental anxiety, poor oral health and psychological trauma is yet to be explored in people with intellectual disabilities. In this conceptual paper, we provide an overview of recent findings concerning the relationships between oral health and intellectual disabilities, psychological trauma and intellectual disabilities, as well as between psychological trauma and oral health, and discuss the relevance of these findings related to dental care for people with intellectual disabilities. We conclude that psychological trauma is likely to contribute to dental anxiety and poor oral health also in people with intellectual disabilities. Implications include an urgent need for research exploring how trauma affects oral health and experiences of dental care for people with intellectual disabilities, as well as the importance of individualized and trauma-informed dental care for these individuals."

    "title": "Hypoventilation in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome across the pediatric age.",
    "abstract": "Few data on alveolar hypoventilation in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are available and the respiratory follow-up of these patients is not standardized. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of alveolar hypoventilation in children with PWS and identify potential risk factors. This retrospective study included children with PWS recorded by polysomnography (PSG) with transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure (PtcCO2) or end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) measurements, between 2007 and 2021, in a tertiary hospital center. The primary outcome was the presence of alveolar hypoventilation defined as partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) ≥ 50 mmHg during ≥2% of total sleep time (TST) or more than five consecutive minutes. Among the 57 included children (38 boys, median age 4.8 years, range 0.1-15.6, 60% treated with growth hormone [GH], 37% obese), 19 (33%) had moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (defined as obstructive apnea-hypopnea index ≥5/h) and 20 (35%) had hypoventilation. The median (range) pCO2 max was 49 mmHg (38-69). Among the children with hypoventilation, 25% were asymptomatic. Median age and GH treatment were significantly higher in children with hypoventilation compared to those without. There was no significant difference in terms of sex, BMI, obstructive or central apnea-hypopnea index between both groups. The frequency of alveolar hypoventilation in children and adolescents with PWS is of concern and may increase with age and GH treatment. A regular screening by oximetry-capnography appears to be indicated whatever the sex, BMI, and rate of obstructive or central apneas."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex multisystem disorder due to the absent expression of paternally active genes in the Prader-Willi syndrome-critical region on chromosome 15 (15q11.2-q13). The main clinical features are hyperphagia (which frequently results in early-onset obesity), hypogonadism, developmental delays, typical behaviors (such as obsessive-compulsive tendencies, tantrums, perseveration, insistence on sameness, and rigidity), and distinctive facial features. In infants, the most prominent findings are hypotonia and feeding difficulties. This paper highlights a case of a 14 year old male patient of an Ethiopian ethnicity with diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome, which is first report in Ethiopia. He presented with progressive excessive weight gain, insatiable appetite, clinical and laboratory features of hypogonadism, ophthalmological refractory error, and facial features of Prader-Willi syndrome, which was further confirmed by genetic analysis. He is currently on lifestyle intervention, testosterone replacement, and treatment for vitamin D deficiency. Prader-Willi syndrome should be considered in a child who presents with progressive weight gain and other typical clinical features such as cognitive impairment, excessive insatiable eating, or hypothalamic hypogonadism. Early lifestyle intervention may help to reduce excessive weight gain. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported in Ethiopia."

    "abstract": "To analyze the risk for genetic aberrations and pregnancy outcomes in pregnancies with isolated polyhydramnios. This was a retrospective study of singleton pregnancies complicated by isolated polyhydramnios that underwent genetic amniocentesis between 2016 and 2021. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and reviewed for these cases, including maternal demographics, prenatal sonographic findings, chromosomal microarray results, and pregnancy outcomes. A total of 94 singleton pregnancies were included. Three (3.2%) cases with chromosomal abnormalities were detected, including 2 case of trisomy 21 and 1 of 22q21.1 microdeletion. One case was diagnosed as Prader-Willi syndrome caused by maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15. Perinatal death occurred in 1 case with severe polyhydramnios, and was retrospectively diagnosed as Bartter syndrome. Of the 90 infants survived, two were identified to have single gene disorders after birth by whole exome sequencing. We first attempted to determine the value of exome sequencing in pregnancies with isolated polyhydramnios. Our results warrant more studies to evaluate advanced genetic testing technologies used in such pregnancies."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is associated with impaired growth hormone (GH) secretion and decreased insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I levels. Pappalysins (PAPP-A, PAPP-A2) and stanniocalcins (STC-1, STC-2) regulate IGF binding-protein (IGFBP) cleavage and IGF bioavailability, but their implication in PWS is unknown. We determined serum levels of PAPP-As and STCs in association with IGF axis components in prepubertal and pubertal patients with PWS, also analyzing the effect of GH treatment. Forty children and adolescents with PWS and 120 sex- and age-matched controls were included. The effect of GH was evaluated at 6 months of treatment in 11 children. Children with PWS had lower levels of total IGF-I, total and intact IGFBP-3, acid-labile subunit, intact IGFBP-4, and STC-1, and they had higher concentrations of free IGF-I, IGFBP-5, and PAPP-A. Patients with PWS after pubertal onset had decreased total IGF-I, total and intact IGFBP-3, and intact IGFBP-4 levels, and had increased total IGFBP-4, and STCs concentrations. GH treatment increased total IGF-I, total and intact IGFBP-3, and intact IGFBP-4, with no changes in PAPP-As, STCs, and free IGF-I levels. Standardized height correlated directly with intact IGFBP-3 and inversely with PAPP-As and the free/total IGF-I ratio. The increase in PAPP-A could be involved in increased IGFBP proteolysis, promoting IGF-I bioavailability in children with PWS. Further studies are needed to establish the relationship between growth, GH resistance, and changes in the IGF axis during development and after GH treatment in these patients."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome is a serious genetic condition, capable of causing endocrinological imbalance, which has as one of its main treatments the growth hormone therapy. However, this therapy still causes some uncertainty concerning its effects on the respiratory parameters of those patients, especially in cases of obstructive sleep apnea, therefore, presenting a need for the analysis of the relationship between the therapy and the otolaryngologic condition. A systematic review following the PRISMA model was developed, with searches for keywords made in the databases PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and Web of Science and registration in the PROSPERO platform (CRD42023404250). Three randomized controlled trials were considered eligible for inclusion in the review. None of the studies demonstrated statistically significant modifications in the obstructive sleep apnea parameters of Prader-Willi patients related to the growth hormone administration. Growth hormone therapy is safe for Prader-Willi syndrome patients when analyzing their obstructive sleep apnea parameters."

This study examined which parental and familial factors predicted completion of and compliance with a home-based family PA program in a cohort of families with a child with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS; a rare disorder with obesity and developmental disability) or with obesity but with neurotypical development. Participants (<i>n</i> = 105) were parents of children with PWS (<i>n</i> = 41) and parents of children with obesity but without PWS (<i>n</i> = 64). Parents completed a series of questionnaires documenting their demographic characteristics, self-efficacy, social support, and family environment (active-recreational orientation and cohesion). Relationships between these factors and intervention completion and compliance were evaluated using bivariate correlations and logistic regression (compliance) and multiple regression (completion) analyses with groups together and then separately if the child group was a significant predictor. None of the variables of interest (marital status, employment, employed hours per week, self-efficacy, social support, and family environment) were significant predictors of intervention completion. Intervention compliance was negatively associated with parents working part-time and working full-time and positively associated with family cohesion (Model R<sup>2</sup> = 0.107, <i>F</i>(3,100) = 4.011, <i>p</i> = .010). Child group was not a factor. Compliance with a 24-week family home-based PA intervention was related to fewer employment hours of the primary caregiver and family environment factors. Future interventions should consider how to reduce the intervention's burden in working parents along with strategies to foster family cohesion."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by loss of expression of paternal chromosome 15q11.2-q13 genes. Individuals with PWS exhibit unique physical, endocrine, and metabolic traits associated with severe obesity. Identifying liver steatosis in PWS is challenging, despite its lower prevalence compared to non-syndromic obesity. Reliable biomarkers are crucial for the early detection and management of this condition associated with the complex metabolic profile and cardiovascular risks in PWS. Circulating proteome profiling was conducted in 29 individuals with PWS (15 with steatosis, 14 without) using the Olink Target 96 metabolism and cardiometabolic panels. Correlation analysis was performed to identify the association between protein biomarkes and clinical variables, while the gene enrichment analysis was conducted to identify pathways linked to deregulated proteins. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves assessed the discriminatory power of circulating protein while a logistic regression model evaluated the potential of a combination of protein biomarkers. CDH2, CTSO, QDPR, CANT1, ALDH1A1, TYMP, ADGRE, KYAT1, MCFD, SEMA3F, THOP1, TXND5, SSC4D, FBP1, and CES1 exhibited a significant differential expression in liver steatosis, with a progressive increase from grade 1 to grade 3. FBP1, CES1, and QDPR showed predominant liver expression. The logistic regression model, -34.19 + 0.85 * QDPR*QDPR + 0.75 * CANT1*TYMP - 0.46 * THOP1*ALDH1A, achieved an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.63-0.99), with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 80% for detecting steatosis in individuals with PWS. These biomarkers showed strong correlations among themselves and were involved in an interconnected network of 62 nodes, related to seven metabolic pathways. They were also significantly associated with cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, transaminases, HbA1c, FLI, APRI, and HOMA, and showed a negative correlation with HDL levels. The biomarkers identified in this study offer the potential for improved patient stratification and personalized therapeutic protocols."

    "abstract": "Since hypothalamic obesity (HyOb) was first described over 120 years ago by Joseph Babinski and Alfred Fröhlich, advances in molecular genetic laboratory techniques have allowed us to elucidate various components of the intricate neurocircuitry governing appetite and weight regulation connecting the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, brainstem, adipose tissue, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract. On a background of an increasing prevalence of population-level common obesity, the number of survivors of congenital (eg, septo-optic dysplasia, Prader-Willi syndrome) and acquired (eg, central nervous system tumors) hypothalamic disorders is increasing, thanks to earlier diagnosis and management as well as better oncological therapies. Although to date the discovery of several appetite-regulating peptides has led to the development of a range of targeted molecular therapies for monogenic obesity syndromes, outside of these disorders these discoveries have not translated into the development of efficacious treatments for other forms of HyOb. This review aims to summarize our current understanding of the neuroendocrine physiology of appetite and weight regulation, and explore our current understanding of the pathophysiology of HyOb."

This paper aims to investigate the intra- and internetwork functional connectivity (FC) changes, and their relationships with developmental delays in PWS children. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets of PWS children and healthy controls (HCs) were acquired. Independent component analysis was used to acquire core resting-state networks (RSNs). The intra- and internetwork FC patterns were then investigated. In terms of intranetwork FC, children with PWS had lower FC in the dorsal attention network, the auditory network, the medial visual network (VN) and the sensorimotor network (SMN) than HCs (FWE-corrected, p < 0.05). In terms of internetwork FC, PWS children had decreased FC between the following pairs of regions: posterior default mode network (DMN) and anterior DMN; posterior DMN and SMN; SMN and posterior VN and salience network and medial VN (FDR-corrected, p < 0.05). Partial correlation analyses revealed that the intranetwork FC patterns were positively correlated with developmental quotients in PWS children, while the internetwork FC patterns were completely opposite (p < 0.05). Intranetwork FC patterns showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.947, with a sensitivity of 96.15% and a specificity of 81.25% for differentiating between PWS and HCs. Impaired intra- and internetwork FC patterns in PWS children are associated with developmental delays, which may result from neural pathway dysfunctions. Intranetwork FC reorganization patterns can discriminate PWS children from HCs. ChiCTR2100046551."

    "abstract": "The Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (HQ-CT) is an observer-reported outcome measure that has been widely used in interventional studies to assess changes in hyperphagic behaviors in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). However, HQ-CT scores in the wider PWS population and the general population have not been reported. Here we report HQ-CT scores from more than 400 individuals with PWS and 600 typical individuals, aged 5-26. Overall, HQ-CT scores were significantly higher in those with PWS compared to typically developing individuals at all ages evaluated. In addition, while HQ-CT scores in the typically developing population decreased with age, scores increased with age in PWS. To further understand the variability of HQ-CT scores in the PWS population, semi-structured interviews were conducted with caregivers of a small subset of adults with PWS who had unexpectedly low HQ-CT scores. These caregivers reported that strict adherence to a food routine, food security measures and supervised food preparation reduced the frequency and intensity of hyperphagic behaviors measured by HQ-CT. Thus, hyperphagic behaviors are captured by the HQ-CT for most individuals with PWS, but for some individuals residing in settings with highly structured food routines, HQ-CT scores may not fully reflect the extent of PWS-associated hyperphagia."

    "abstract": "Endogenous neuropeptide Oxytocin (OXT) plays a crucial role in modulating pro-social behavior and the neural response to social/emotional stimuli. Intranasal administration is the most common method of delivering OXT. Intranasal OXT has been implemented in clinical studies of various psychiatric disorders with mixed results, mainly related to lack of solid pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics model. Due to intranasal OXT's mechanism of reducing the activation of neural areas implicated in emotional responding and emotion regulation, a psychopathology with this target mechanism could be potentially excellent candidate for future clinical trial. In this regard, irritability in youth may be a very promising target for clinical studies of intranasal OXT. Here we provide a mini-review of fifteen randomized controlled trials in pediatric patients with diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), or Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS). Most studies had small sample sizes and varying dosages, with changes in irritability, mainly as adverse events (AEs). Neuroimaging results showed modulation of the reward processing system and the neural areas implicated in social-emotional information processing by intranasal OXT administration. Further research is needed to determine the most effective dose and duration of OXT treatment, carefully select target psychopathologies, verify target engagement, and measure adverse event profiles."

PWS is characterized by varying degrees of early psychomotor developmental deficits, primarily in cognition, language, and motor development. This review summarizes the early mental cognitive development, language development, and motor development in patients with PWS, compares the correlation of genotype with phenotype, and provides an update regarding the effects and concerns related to potential main side effects of treatment with recombinant human growth hormone on early psycho-cognitive and motor function development along with the linear growth and body composition of children with PWS.Conclusion: Early psychomotor development is strongly correlated with the prognosis of patients with PWS; moreover, current studies support that the initiation of interventions at an early age can exert significant beneficial effects on enhancing the cognitive and linguistic development of patients with PWS and allow them to \"catch up\" with motor development. What is Known: • Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by multisystem damage, and children with Prader-Willi syndrome are typically characterized by early developmental delays, specifically in the areas of cognitive and motor development. • Recombinant human growth hormone therapy is the only medical treatment approved for Prader-Willi syndrome. What is New: • Extensive presentation of psycho-cognitive and motor development features and genotype-phenotype correlation in children with Prader-Willi syndrome. • The effects of growth hormone on early psychomotor development in children with Prader-Willi syndrome were thoroughly reviewed, including their short- and long-term outcomes and any associated adverse effects."

The 15q11-q13 locus is a hotspot of recurrent copy number variation associated with Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes, developmental delay, autism, and epilepsy and is mediated by complex segmental duplications, many of which arose recently during evolution. To gain insight into the instability of this region, we characterized its architecture in human and nonhuman primates, reconstructing the evolutionary history of five different inversions that rearranged the region in different species primarily by accumulation of segmental duplications. Comparative analysis of human and nonhuman primate duplication structures suggests a human-specific gain of directly oriented duplications in the regions flanking the <i>GOLGA</i> cores and <i>HERC</i> segmental duplications, representing potential genomic drivers for the human-specific expansions. The increasing complexity of segmental duplication organization over the course of evolution underlies its association with human susceptibility to recurrent disease-associated rearrangements."

Data about the diagnostic process for each condition were contributed by the advocacy organizations. Median and interquartile ranges were calculated for each condition by molecular subtype and year. Comparison tests were run to explore group differences. The median age of diagnosis was 1.8 years for both AS and Dup15q. PWS was diagnosed significantly younger at a median age of 1 month. Deletion subtypes for both PWS and AS were diagnosed earlier than nondeletion subtypes, and children with isodicentric duplications in Dup15q were diagnosed earlier than those with interstitial duplications. Understanding variability in the age of diagnosis for chromosome 15 disorders is an important step in reducing the diagnostic odyssey and improving access to interventions for these populations.

Late Positive Potential (LPP) responses to food images did not differ from non-food images.

Early identification of SDB and factors contributing to its incidence is essential, particularly when considering growth hormone (GH) therapy. The aims of the study were to describe the prevalence and phenotypes of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and to determine the effects of age, gender, symptoms, GH therapy and body mass index on SDB severity. This study was a retrospective chart review of all patients with genetically confirmed Prader-Willi syndrome who underwent diagnostic overnight polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory at Sidra Medicine. Clinical and PSG data of enrolled patients were collected. We identified 20 patients (nine males, eleven females) with PWS who had overnight sleep polysomnography (PSG) at a median age (IQR) of 5.83 (2.7-12) years. The median apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was 8.55 (IQR 5.8-16.9) events/hour. The median REM-AHI was 27.8 (IQR 15-50.6) events/hour. The median obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) was 7.29 (IQR 1.8-13.5) events/hour. The median central apnea-hypopnea index (CAHI) was 1.77 (IQR 0.6-4.1) events/hour. Nineteen patients (95%) demonstrated SDB by polysomnography (PSG) based on AHI ≥1.5 events/hour. Nine patients (45%) were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Three patients (15%) were diagnosed with central sleep apnea (CSA). Seven patients (35%) were diagnosed with mixed sleep apnea. No correlations were observed between AHI and age, gender, BMI, symptoms, or GH therapy. However, REM-AHI was significantly correlated with BMI (<i>P</i>=0.031). This study shows a high prevalence of SDB among our patients with PWS. Obstructive sleep apnea was the predominant phenotype. BMI was the only predictor for high REM-AHI.

The primary efficacy endpoint was Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (HQ-CT) score. Other endpoints included behavioral assessments, body composition, hormonal measures, and safety. DCCR administration resulted in significant improvements in HQ-CT (mean [SE] -9.9 [0.77], p < 0.0001) and greater improvements in those with more severe baseline hyperphagia (HQ-CT > 22). Improvements were seen in aggression, anxiety, and compulsivity (all p < 0.0001). There were reductions in leptin, insulin, and insulin resistance, as well as a significant increase in adiponectin (all p < 0.004). Lean body mass was increased (p < 0.0001). Disease severity was reduced as assessed by clinician and caregiver (both p < 0.0001). Common treatment-emergent adverse events included hypertrichosis, peripheral edema, and hyperglycemia. Adverse events infrequently resulted in discontinuation (7.2%). DCCR administration to people with PWS was well tolerated and associated with broad-ranging improvements in the syndrome. Sustained administration of DCCR has the potential to reduce disease severity and the burden of care for families."

PWS patients have an increased mortality rate, some due to undiagnosed life-threatening diseases. We describe 2 patients with PWS whose behavioral changes, initially thought to be part of their behavioral phenotype, delayed the final diagnosis of a life-threatening underlying illness. A 13-year-old girl with PWS presented with a sudden change in behavior including aggression, scratching, and self-injury. She was seen by several health care providers, and after 5 months the diagnosis of pyosalpinx was made, for which laparoscopic resection of an infected tailgut cyst was performed, resolving the behavioral symptoms. A 38-year-old man with PWS presented with recurrent vague inguinal pain and nonepileptic seizures. After several years of consulting physicians and psychiatrists, including several hospital admissions, the diagnosis of bilateral inguinal hernia was made. After surgical correction, the pain and seizures ceased. In PWS patients presenting with unexplained behavioral changes and unusual somatic complaints, clinicians should perform an extensive clinical examination and consider underlying physical illness rather than attribute the problem to the behavioral phenotype."

    "abstract": "The goal of this manuscript is to present and summarize several rare pediatric syndromes (Zellweger syndrome, Kartagener syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Schinzel-Giedion syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Joubert-Boltshauser syndrome, Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome, and Langer-Giedion syndrome) who have been named after luminary \"Swiss\" physicians (pediatricians, pediatric neurologists, or pediatric radiologists) who recognized, studied, and published these syndromes. In this manuscript, a brief historical summary of the physicians is combined with the key clinical symptoms at presentation and the typical imaging findings. This manuscript is not aiming to give a complete comprehensive summary of the syndromes, nor does it ignore the valuable contributions of many \"Swiss\" scientists who are not included here, but focuses on several rare syndromes that benefit from imaging data."

    "abstract": "Recurrent copy number variants (rCNVs) are associated with increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders but their pathogenic population-level impact is unknown. We provide population-based estimates of rCNV-associated risk of neuropsychiatric disorders for 34 rCNVs in the iPSYCH2015 case-cohort sample (n=120,247). Most observed significant increases in rCNV-associated risk for ADHD, autism or schizophrenia were moderate (HR:1.42-5.00), and risk estimates were highly correlated across these disorders, the most notable exception being high autism-associated risk with Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndrome duplications (HR=20.8). No rCNV was associated with significant increase in depression risk. Also, rCNV-associated risk was positively correlated with locus size and gene constraint. Comparison with published rCNV studies suggests that prevalence of some rCNVs is higher, and risk of psychiatric disorders lower, than previously estimated. In an era where genetics is increasingly being clinically applied, our results highlight the importance of population-based risk estimates for genetics-based predictions."

    "title": "Identifying key underlying regulatory networks and predicting targets of orphan C/D box <i>SNORD116</i> snoRNAs in Prader-Willi syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized principally by initial symptoms of neonatal hypotonia and failure-to-thrive in infancy, followed by hyperphagia and obesity. It is well established that PWS is caused by loss of paternal expression of the imprinted region on chromosome 15q11-q13. While most PWS cases exhibit megabase-scale deletions of the paternal chromosome 15q11-q13 allele, several PWS patients have been identified harboring a much smaller deletion encompassing primarily <i>SNORD116</i>. This finding suggests <i>SNORD116</i> is a direct driver of PWS phenotypes. The <i>SNORD116</i> gene cluster is composed of 30 copies of individual <i>SNORD116</i> C/D box small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Many C/D box snoRNAs have been shown to guide chemical modifications of other RNA molecules, often ribosomal RNA (rRNA). However, <i>SNORD116</i> snoRNAs are termed 'orphans' because no verified targets have been identified and their sequences show no significant complementarity to rRNA. It is crucial to identify the targets and functions of <i>SNORD116</i> snoRNAs because all reported PWS cases lack their expression. To address this, we engineered two different deletions modelling PWS in two distinct human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines to control for effects of genetic background. Utilizing an inducible expression system enabled quick, reproducible differentiation of these lines into neurons. Systematic comparisons of neuronal gene expression across deletion types and genetic backgrounds revealed a novel list of 42 consistently dysregulated genes. Employing the recently described computational tool snoGloBe, we discovered these dysregulated genes are significantly enriched for predicted <i>SNORD116</i> targeting versus multiple control analyses. Importantly, our results showed it is critical to use multiple isogenic cell line pairs, as this eliminated many spuriously differentially expressed genes. Our results indicate a novel gene regulatory network controlled by <i>SNORD116</i> is likely perturbed in PWS patients."

In anticipation of the nomination of DMD for universal NBS, we conducted a prospective study under the Early Check voluntary NBS research program in North Carolina, United States. We performed screening for creatine kinase-MM (CK-MM), a biomarker of muscle damage, on residual routine newborn dried blood spots (DBS) from participating newborns. Total creatine kinase testing and next generation sequencing of an 86-neuromuscular gene panel that included DMD were offered to parents of newborns who screened positive. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed to assess effects of biological and demographic predictors on CK-MM levels in DBS. We screened 13,354 newborns and identified 2 males with DMD. The provisional 1626 ng/mL cutoff was raised to 2032 ng/mL to improve specificity, and additional cutoffs (900 and 360 ng/mL) were implemented to improve sensitivity for older and low-birthweight newborns. Population-scale screening for elevated CK-MM in DBS is a feasible approach to identify newborns with DMD. Inclusion of birthweight- and age-specific cutoffs, repeat creatine kinase testing after 72 hours of age, and DMD sequencing improve sensitivity and specificity of screening."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized by a switch from failure to thrive to excessive weight gain and hyperphagia in early childhood. An elevated, more unfavorable ratio between acylated and unacylated ghrelin (AG/UAG ratio) might play a role in the underlying mechanisms of this switch. We aimed to assess the evolution of the appetite-regulating hormones acylated ghrelin (AG) and unacylated ghrelin (UAG) and the AG/UAG ratio and their association with the change in eating behavior in children with PWS, compared to healthy age-matched controls. A longitudinal study was conducted in 134 children with PWS and 157 healthy controls, from the Netherlands, France, and Belgium. Levels of AG and UAG and the AG/UAG ratio were measured and nutritional phases as reported for PWS were scored. The AG/UAG ratio was lower in the first years of life in PWS than in controls and started to increase from the age of 3 years, resulting in a high-normal AG/UAG ratio compared to controls. The AG levels remained stable during the different nutritional phases (p = 0.114), while the UAG levels decreased from 290 pg/mL in phase 1a to 137 pg/mL in phase 2b (p &lt; 0.001). The AG/UAG ratio increased significantly from 0.81 in phase 2a to 1.24 in phase 2b (p = 0.012). The change from failure to thrive to excessive weight gain and hyperphagia in infants and children with PWS coincides with an increase in AG/UAG ratio. The increase in AG/UAG ratio occurred during phase 2a, thus before the onset of hyperphagia."

    "abstract": "Spinal kinematics/motion are reported to be altered in adolescents and adults with essential obesity, while no information is available in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome so far. The aim of this study was to examine cross-sectionally the characteristics of spinal postures and mobility in 34 patients with PWS, in 35 age- and sex-matched adults with essential obesity, and in 37 normal-weight individuals. Spinal posture and mobility were assessed using a radiation-free back scan, the Idiag M360 (Idiag, Fehraltorf, Switzerland). Differences in spinal posture and mobility between the three groups were determined using a two-way analysis of variance. Adults with Prader-Willi syndrome had greater thoracic kyphosis [difference between groups (Δ) = 9.6<sup>0</sup>, 95% CI 3.3<sup>0</sup> to 15.6<sup>0</sup>, p = 0.001], less lumbar lordosis (Δ = -6.5<sup>0</sup>, 95% CI -12.7<sup>0</sup> to -0.3<sup>0</sup>, p = 0.03) as well as smaller lumbar and hip mobility than those with normal weight. Although the characteristics of the spine in patients with Prader-Will syndrome appear to be similar to that found in subjects with essential obesity, Prader-Willi syndrome was found to influence lumbar movements more than thoracic mobility. These results provide relevant information about the characteristics of the spine in adults with Prader-Willi syndrome to be taken into careful consideration in the management of spinal conditions. These findings also highlight the importance of considering the musculoskeletal assessment of spinal postures and approaches targeting spinal and hip flexibility in adults with Prader-Willi syndrome."

    "abstract": "Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) exhibit several metabolic and behavioral abnormalities associated with excessive food-seeking activity. PWS is thought to be driven in part by dysfunctional hypothalamic circuitry and blunted responses to peripheral signals of satiety. Previous work described a hypothalamic transcriptomic signature of individuals with PWS. Notably, PWS patients exhibited downregulation of genes involved in neuronal development and an upregulation of neuroinflammatory genes. Deficiencies of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor were identified as potential drivers of PWS phenotypes. Our group recently applied an adeno-associated viral (AAV)-BDNF gene therapy within a preclinical PWS model, <i>Magel2</i>-null mice, to improve metabolic and behavioral function. While this proof-of-concept project was promising, it remained unclear how AAV-BDNF was influencing the hypothalamic microenvironment and how its therapeutic effect was mediated. To investigate, we hypothalamically injected AAV-BDNF to wild type and <i>Magel2</i>-null mice and performed mRNA sequencing on hypothalamic tissue. Here, we report that (1) <i>Magel2</i> deficiency is associated with neuroinflammation in the hypothalamus and (2) AAV-BDNF gene therapy reverses this neuroinflammation. These data newly reveal <i>Magel2</i>-null mice as a valid model of PWS-related neuroinflammation and furthermore suggest that AAV-BDNF may modulate obesity-related neuroinflammatory phenotypes through direct or indirect means."

    "abstract": "Growth hormone (GH) is a peptide hormone that plays a crucial role in controlling growth, development, and lifespan. Molecular regulation of GH is accomplished via the <i>GH receptor</i> (<i>GHR</i>), which is the main factor influencing human development and is essential to optimal functioning of the GH/IGF-I axis. Two GHR isoforms have been studied, according to the presence (flGHR) or absence (d3GHR) of exon 3. The d3GHR isoform, which lacks exon 3 has recently been related to longevity; individuals carrying this isoform have higher receptor activity, improved signal transduction, and alterations in the treatment response and efficacy compared with those carrying the wild type (WT) isoform (flGHR). Further, studies performed in patients with acromegaly, Prader-Willi syndrome, Turner syndrome, small for gestational age (SGA), and growth hormone deficiency (GHD) suggested that the d3GHR isoform may have an impact on the relationship between GH and IGF-I levels, height, weight, BMI, and other variables. Other research, however, revealed inconsistent results, which might have been caused by confounding factors, including limited sample sizes and different experimental methods. In this review, we lay out the complexity of the GHR isoforms and provide an overview of the major pharmacogenetic research conducted on this ongoing and unresolved subject."

    "abstract": "Loss of expression of paternally imprinted genes in the 15q11.2-q13 chromosomal region leads to the neurodevelopmental disorder Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). The PWS critical region contains four paternally expressed protein-coding genes along with small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes under the control of the <i>SNURF-SNRPN</i> promoter, including the <i>SNORD116</i> snoRNA gene cluster that is implicated in the PWS disease etiology. A 5-7 Mb deletion, maternal uniparental disomy, or an imprinting defect of chromosome 15q affect multiple genes in the PWS critical region, causing PWS. However, the individual contributions of these genes to the PWS phenotype remain elusive. Reports of smaller, atypical deletions may refine the boundaries of the PWS critical region or suggest additional disease-causing mechanisms. We describe an adult female with a classic PWS phenotype due to a 78 kb microdeletion that includes only exons 2 and 3 of <i>SNURF-SNRPN</i> with apparently preserved expression of <i>SNORD116</i>."

Therefore, we explore the ability of a brief test to assess intelligence in these patients. This study included individuals with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of PWS, with regular attendance at transdisciplinary treatment in an institution dedicated to the care of rare diseases in Argentina. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT) were used. Correlation was obtained between the scales in paediatric and adult populations.

The purpose of the present study was to characterize the fecal microbiota in Chinese patients with PWS and compare it to that of patients with obesity as well as healthy controls. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 35 PWS patients (PWS), 35 patients with obesity (OB), and 35 healthy controls (HC). Metagenomic sequencing was performed in stool samples. The composition of the fecal microbiota in PWS patients differed from that of participants in the OB and HC groups. It was characterized by increased Akkermansia Eubacterium, Eubacterium rectale, and Roseburia intestinalis and decreased Parabacteroides and Phascolarctobacterium. Additionally, the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was lower in PWS patients than in patients with obesity. Spearman rank correlation analysis showed that Achromobacter, Acidiphilium, Xylophilus, and Frisingicoccus were significantly negatively correlated with HOMA-IR. The composition of the gut microbiota in Chinese PWS patients differed from that in patients with obesity, which might contribute to higher insulin sensitivity in PWS patients."

This narrative review was conducted by searching for papers published in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase and SciELO databases and included 161 articles. The search used the following search terms: \"obesity\", \"obesity and genetics\", \"leptin\", \"Prader-Willi syndrome\", and \"melanocortins\". The types of studies included were systematic reviews, clinical trials, prospective cohort studies, cross-sectional and prospective studies, narrative reviews, and case reports. The leptin-melanocortin pathway is primarily responsible for the regulation of appetite and body weight. However, several important aspects of the pathophysiology of obesity remain unknown. Genetic causes of obesity can be grouped into syndromic, monogenic, and polygenic causes and should be assessed in children with extreme obesity before the age of 5 years, hyperphagia, or a family history of extreme obesity. A microarray study, an analysis of the melanocortin type 4 receptor gene mutations and leptin levels should be performed for this purpose. There are three therapeutic levels: lifestyle modifications, pharmacological treatment, and bariatric surgery. Genetic study technologies are in constant development; however, we are still far from having a personalized approach to genetic causes of obesity. A significant proportion of the affected individuals are associated with genetic causes; however, there are still barriers to its approach, as it continues to be underdiagnosed.

Moreover, apart from their probable involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders, snoRNAs from the SNORD113-SNORD114 cluster have been implicated in multiple biological processes, including pluripotency, development, cancers, and RNA modifications.

Adenotonsillectomy is effective in treating OSA in children without co-morbidities, despite postoperative residual OSA remained in roughly half of these children. For children with comorbidities such as Down syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, sickle cell disease, or cerebral palsy, adenotonsillectomy is less effective and associated with more postoperative complications than that in children without comorbidities. For other OSA-related outcomes, evidence from meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials confirm adenotonsillectomy results in improvement of subjective OSA-related outcomes (e.g. symptoms, behaviors, and quality of life), but the results in objective OSA-related outcomes (e.g. cardiometabolic parameters or neurocognitive functions) are inconsistent.

Each occurs at an approximate incidence of 1/15,000 to 1/30,000 live births and has a range of debilitating phenotypes. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been valuable tools to understand human-relevant gene regulation at this locus and have contributed to the development of therapeutic approaches for AS. Nonetheless, gaps remain in our understanding of how these deletions contribute to dysregulation and phenotypes of AS and PWS. Variability across cell lines due to donor differences, reprogramming methods, and genetic background make it challenging to fill these gaps in knowledge without substantially increasing the number of cell lines used in the analyses. Isogenic cell lines that differ only by the genetic mutation causing the disease can ease this burden without requiring such a large number of cell lines. Here, we describe the development of isogenic human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines modeling the most common genetic subtypes of AS and PWS. These lines allow for a facile interrogation of allele-specific gene regulation at the chromosome 15q11-q13 locus. Additionally, these lines are an important resource to identify and test targeted therapeutic approaches for patients with AS and PWS."

PWS is caused by paternal deletion, maternal uniparental disomy, or imprinting defects that lead to loss of expression of a maternally imprinted region of chromosome 15 encompassing non-coding RNAs and five protein-coding genes; SYS patients have a mutation in one of them, <i>MAGEL2</i>. Throughout life, PWS and SYS patients suffer from musculoskeletal deficiencies, intellectual disabilities, and hormonal abnormalities, which lead to compulsive behaviors like hyperphagia and temper outbursts. Management of PWS and SYS is mostly symptomatic and cures for these debilitating disorders do not exist, highlighting a clear, unmet medical need. Research over several decades into the molecular and cellular roles of PWS genes has uncovered that several impinge on the neuroendocrine system. In this review, we will discuss the expression and molecular functions of PWS genes, connecting them with hormonal imbalances in patients and animal models. Besides the observed hormonal imbalances, we will describe the recent findings about how the loss of individual genes, particularly <i>MAGEL2</i>, affects the molecular mechanisms of hormone secretion. These results suggest that <i>MAGEL2</i> evolved as a mammalian-specific regulator of hypothalamic neuroendocrine function."

    "abstract": "This literature review of growth hormone (GH) therapy and sleep-related health outcomes in children diagnosed with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) assembles evidence for the consequences of sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality: difficulty concentrating and learning at school, behavioral problems, diminished quality of life, and growth impairment. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is another factor that impacts a child's well-being. We searched the electronic databases Medline PubMed Advanced Search Builder, Scopus, and Web of Science using MeSH terms and text words to retrieve articles on GH deficiency, recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy, sleep quality, SDB, and PWS in children. The censor date was April 2023. The initial search yielded 351 articles, 23 of which were analyzed for this review. The study findings suggest that while GH may have a role in regulating sleep, the relationship between GH treatment and sleep in patients with PWS is complex and influenced by GH dosage, patient age, and type and severity of respiratory disorders, among other factors. GH therapy can improve lung function, linear growth, and body composition in children with PWS; however, it can also trigger or worsen obstructive sleep apnea or hypoventilation in some. Long-term GH therapy may contribute to adenotonsillar hypertrophy and exacerbate sleep apnea in children with PWS. Finally, GH therapy can improve sleep quality in some patients but it can also cause or worsen SDB in others, leading to diminished sleep quality and overall quality of life. The current evidence suggests that the initial risk of worsening SDB may improve with long-term therapy. In conclusion, rhGH is the standard for managing patients with PWS. Nonetheless, its impact on respiratory function during sleep needs to be thoroughly evaluated. Polysomnography is advisable to assess the need for adenotonsillectomy before initiating rhGH therapy. Close monitoring of sleep disorders in patients with PWS receiving GH therapy is essential to ensure effective and safe treatment."

Therefore, we sought to explore the psychological impact of caregiving, as well as the differences between main caregivers and other family members. Different evaluation tools and scales were used taking into consideration the impact on caregivers. The scales were administered to those relatives who are immersed in the usual dynamics of the patient, differentiating between the main caregiver and other relatives living in the family home. A total of 33 families of patients with genetic confirmation of PWS were included. In this survey, 32% of primary caregivers reported a high probability of anxiety, compared with 19% of non-primary caregivers (p = 0.27). Concerning depression, 40% of primary caregivers related possible or probable cases of depression compared with non-primary caregivers 13% (p = 0.04). Regarding caregiver burden evaluated using the Zarit scale, 61% of the main caregivers presented high levels of overload, compared with 29% of the other relatives (p = 0.005).

    "title": "Body Fat Distribution Contributes to Defining the Relationship between Insulin Resistance and Obesity in Human Diseases.",
    "abstract": "The risk for metabolic and cardiovascular complications of obesity is defined by body fat distribution rather than global adiposity. Unlike subcutaneous fat, visceral fat (including hepatic steatosis) reflects insulin resistance and predicts type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In humans, available evidence indicates that the ability to store triglycerides in the subcutaneous adipose tissue reflects enhanced insulin sensitivity. Prospective studies document an association between larger subcutaneous fat mass at baseline and reduced incidence of impaired glucose tolerance. Case-control studies reveal an association between genetic predisposition to insulin resistance and a lower amount of subcutaneous adipose tissue. Human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorgamma (PPAR-γ) promotes subcutaneous adipocyte differentiation and subcutaneous fat deposition, improving insulin resistance and reducing visceral fat. Thiazolidinediones reproduce the effects of PPAR-γ activation and therefore increase the amount of subcutaneous fat while enhancing insulin sensitivity and reducing visceral fat. Partial or virtually complete lack of adipose tissue (lipodystrophy) is associated with insulin resistance and its clinical manifestations, including essential hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, reduced HDL-c, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease. Patients with Prader Willi syndrome manifest severe subcutaneous obesity without insulin resistance. The impaired ability to accumulate fat in the subcutaneous adipose tissue may be due to deficient triglyceride synthesis, inadequate formation of lipid droplets, or defective adipocyte differentiation. Lean and obese humans develop insulin resistance when the capacity to store fat in the subcutaneous adipose tissue is exhausted and deposition of triglycerides is no longer attainable at that location. Existing adipocytes become large and reflect the presence of insulin resistance."

    "title": "Register-based and genetic studies of Prader-Willi syndrome show a high frequency of gonadal tumors and a possible mechanism for tumorigenesis through imprinting relaxation.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare disease caused by a lack of expression of inherited imprinted genes in the paternally derived Prader-Willi critical region on chromosome 15q11.2-q13. It is characterized by poor feeding and hypotonia in infancy, intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities, dysmorphic features, short stature, obesity, and hypogonadism. PWS is not a known cancer predisposition syndrome, but previous investigations regarding the prevalence of cancer in these patients suggest an increased risk of developing specific cancer types such as myeloid leukemia and testicular cancer. We present the results from a Swedish national population-based cohort study of 360 individuals with PWS and 18,000 matched comparisons. The overall frequency of cancer was not increased in our PWS cohort, but we found a high frequency of pediatric cancers. We also performed whole-genome sequencing of blood- and tumor-derived DNAs from a unilateral dysgerminoma in a 13-year-old girl with PWS who also developed bilateral ovarian sex cord tumors with annular tubules. In germline analysis, there were no additional findings apart from the 15q11.2-q13 deletion of the paternal allele, while a pathogenic activating <i>KIT</i> mutation was identified in the tumor. Additionally, methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification revealed reduced methylation at the PWS locus in the dysgerminoma but not in the blood. In conclusion, our register-based study suggests an increased risk of cancer at a young age, especially testicular and ovarian tumors. We found no evidence of a general increase in cancer risk in patients with PWS. However, given our limited observational time, further studies with longer follow-up times are needed to clarify the lifetime cancer risk in PWS. We have also described the second case of locus-specific loss-of-imprinting in a germ cell tumor in PWS, suggesting a possible mechanism of carcinogenesis."

    "title": "Chromosomal Aberrations in Pediatric Patients With Moderate/Severe Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability With Abundant Phenotypic Heterogeneities: A Single-Center Study.",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the clinical usefulness of chromosome microarray (CMA) for selective implementation in patients with unexplained moderate or severe developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID) and/or combined with different dysphonic features in the Han Chinese population. We retrospectively analyzed data on 122 pediatric patients with unexplained isolated moderate/severe DD/ID with or without autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, dystonia, and congenital abnormalities from a single-center neurorehabilitation clinic in southern China. A total of 46 probands (37.7%) had abnormal CMA results among the 122 study patients. With the exclusion of aneuploidies, uniparental disomies, and multiple homozygotes, 37 patients harbored 39 pathogenic copy number variations (pCNVs) (median [interquartile range] size: 3.57 [1.6 to 7.1] Mb; 33 deletions and 6 duplications), enriched in chromosomes 5, 7, 15, 17, and 22, with a markedly high prevalence of Angelman/Prader-Willi syndrome (24.3% [nine of 37]). Three rare deletions in the regions 5q33.2q34, 17p13.2, and 13q33.2 were reported, with specific delineation of clinical phenotypes. The frequencies of pCNVs were 18%, 33.3%, 38.89%, 41.67%, and 100% for patients with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 study phenotypes, respectively; patients with more concomitant abnormalities in the heart, brain, craniofacial region, and/or other organs had a higher CMA diagnostic yield and pCNV prevalence (P < 0.05). Clinical application of CMA as a first-tier test among patients with moderate/severe DD/ID combined with congenital structural anomalies improved diagnostic yields and the quality of clinical management in this series of patients."

    "title": "Analysis of children with familial short stature: who should be indicated for genetic testing?",
    "abstract": "Familial short stature (FSS) describes vertically transmitted growth disorders. Traditionally, polygenic inheritance is presumed, but monogenic inheritance seems to occur more frequently than expected. Clinical predictors of monogenic FSS have not been elucidated. The aim of the study was to identify the monogenic etiology and its clinical predictors in FSS children. Of 747 patients treated with growth hormone (GH) in our center, 95 with FSS met the inclusion criteria (pretreatment height ≤-2 SD in child and his/her shorter parent); secondary short stature and Turner/Prader-Willi syndrome were excluded criteria. Genetic etiology was known in 11/95 children before the study, remaining 84 were examined by next-generation sequencing. The results were evaluated by American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. Nonparametric tests evaluated differences between monogenic and non-monogenic FSS, an ROC curve estimated quantitative cutoffs for the predictors. Monogenic FSS was confirmed in 36/95 (38%) children. Of these, 29 (81%) carried a causative genetic variant affecting the growth plate, 4 (11%) a variant affecting GH-insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) axis and 3 (8%) a variant in miscellaneous genes. Lower shorter parent's height (P = 0.015) and less delayed bone age (BA) before GH treatment (P = 0.026) predicted monogenic FSS. In children with BA delayed less than 0.4 years and with shorter parent's heights ≤-2.4 SD, monogenic FSS was revealed in 13/16 (81%) cases. To conclude, in FSS children treated with GH, a monogenic etiology is frequent, and gene variants affecting the growth plate are the most common. Shorter parent's height and BA are clinical predictors of monogenic FSS."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder involving multiple systems, with an incidence of about 1/10000-25000. Ovarian torsion (OT) is not commonly found in children. Ovarian cyst acts as one of the primary factors resulting in OT. While ovarian cyst torsion with Prader-Willi Syndrome has not been reported before. A 12-years old female was admitted to Emergency Department of our hospital with the chief complaint of abdominal pain. The outcomes of physical examination revealed the height of 150 cm, weight of 103 kg, BMI of 45.77 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The patient manifested the special facial features, an obese body, with the abdomen distended into a spherical shape. The fat accumulation in the abdomen significantly embarrassed the palpation. The abdominal CT scan indicated a huge cystic mass in the abdominal cavity, sized about 138 mm × 118 mm. According to medical history, the patient was born with low crying and hypotonia, who has developed the uncontrollable eating behavior since 3-years old. These abnormalities led to a speculation of PWS syndrome, so a genetic test was performed and finally confirmed it, concluding a torsion of ovarian cyst with PWS. With the multidisciplinary consultation, a careful treatment strategy containing the control of blood pressure and blood sugar, coenzyme Q10 was administrated to nourish the myocardium and the application of Growth Hormone was developed. All the above preoperative treatments have brought great benefits to patients. Thus promising the successful completion of operation. The postoperative follow-up till now indicated that the abdominal incision was well healed, without operative complications. This may be the first case report. In the treatment of ovarian cyst torsion, PWS syndrome requires fully consideration, as the latter can lead to multisystem abnormalities, especially the relation to perioperative management, and even fatalities. Genetic testing should be conducted early when PWS was suspected, accompanied with adequate preparation for the perioperative period, the follow-ups of patients should be maintained for a long time after surgery."

    "title": "Kidney disease in adults with Prader-Willi syndrome: international cohort study and systematic literature review.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare, complex, genetic disorder characterized by hyperphagia, hypotonia, delayed psychomotor development, low muscle mass and hypothalamic dysfunction. Adults with PWS often have obesity, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), known risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Early symptoms of CVD and CKD may be masked by intellectual disability and inability to express physical complaints. Furthermore, kidney diseases are often asymptomatic. Therefore, renal and cardiovascular disease might be missed in patients with PWS. Microalbuminuria is an early sign of microvascular damage in the kidneys and other vascular beds. Therefore, we screened our adult PWS cohort for the presence of elevated urinary albumin and (micro)albuminuria. We retrospectively collected anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, medical history, medication use, urine dipstick and biochemical measurements form electronic patient files. In addition, we performed a systematic literature review on kidney disease in PWS. We included 162 adults with genetically confirmed PWS (56% male, median age 28 years), of whom 44 (27%) had DM2. None had known CVD. All subjects had normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) according to non-PWS reference intervals. Elevated urinary albumin or (micro)albuminuria was present in 28 (18%); 19 out of 75 (25%) had an increased urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and 10 out of 57 (18%) had an increased urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio. Elevated urinary albumin was present at a young age (median age 26 (IQR 24-32) years) and was associated with an significantly higher BMI and LDL-cholesterol levels and higher prevalence of DM2, hypertension and dyslipidemia than those with normal UACR (<i>p</i>=0.027, <i>p</i>=0.019, <i>p</i><0.001, <i>p</i><0.001, <i>p</i>=0.011 and respectively). Upon screening, one in every five adults with PWS had increased urinary albumin or (micro)albuminuria, early signs of microvascular disease. All had normal eGFR, according to non-PWS reference intervals, and none had a formal diagnosis of CVD. As muscle mass is low in PWS, creatinine levels and eGFR may be spuriously normal. Urinalysis in this patient group can be used as a screening tool for microvascular (kidney) disease. We propose an algorithm for the detection and management of microvascular disease in adults with PWS."

    "title": "Hyperinsulinemia is a probable trigger for weight gain and hyperphagia in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the most frequently diagnosed genetic cause of early childhood obesity. Individuals with PWS typically progress through 7 different nutritional phases during their lifetime. The main objective of this study was to assess potential factors, particularly insulin, that may be responsible for the weight gains in sub-phase 2a and their role in the subsequent increase in fat mass and obesity in sub-phase 2b and insatiable appetite in phase 3. Fasting plasma insulin levels were measured in children with PWS between the ages of 0-12 years and in age-matched non-PWS participants with early-onset major (clinically severe) obesity (EMO) and in healthy-weight sibling controls (SC). Participants with PWS in nutritional phases 1a and 1b had plasma insulin levels comparable to SC. However, the transition from phase 1b up to phase 3 in the PWS group was accompanied by significant increases in insulin, coinciding in weight gains, obesity, and hyperphagia. Only individuals with PWS in phase 3 had comparable insulin levels to the EMO group who were higher than the SC group at any age. Elevated insulin signaling is a probable trigger for weight gain and onset of hyperphagia in children with Prader-Willi syndrome. Regulating insulin levels early in childhood before the onset of the early weight gain may be key in modulating the onset and severity of obesity and hyperphagia in individuals with PWS, as well as in other young children with non-PWS early-onset obesity. Preventing or reversing elevated insulin levels in PWS with pharmacological agents and/or through diet restrictions such as a combined low carbohydrate, low glycemic-load diet may be a viable therapeutic strategy in combating obesity in children with PWS and others with early childhood obesity."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic hormonal disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis resulting in mental retardation, muscle hypotonia, hypogonadism, and hyperphagia leading to significant obesity. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adult patients with PWS is higher than in healthy controls and mainly secondary to massive obesity. In childhood, mortality may result from respiratory or gastrointestinal illnesses. We present a case of a 10-year-old boy with PWS who experienced recurrent and asymptomatic episodes of sinus pauses caused by the ingestion of large gulps of apple juice, which could be provoked and reproduced. The asystoles could not be provoked by any other vagal maneuvers and an initial diagnostic workup revealed no indication for structural heart disease. Because of the asymptomatic character of the asystoles, no treatment was initially provided. When he re-presented 3 months later after a clinically relevant syncope at school, pacemaker therapy was initiated, and he has demonstrated no subsequent sinus pauses or syncopes. Regarding the rising awareness of subtle cardiac alterations including autonomic dysfunction and electrocardiogram changes in young patients with PWS and especially the occurrence of unexplained sudden deaths in childhood that may be precipitated by arrhythmia, we suggest that the utility of periodic screening for arrhythmia risk should be evaluated in children with PWS."

In addition to hypotonia and intellectual disability, individuals with SYS are frequently affected by neonatal contractures and autism spectrum disorder. In this study, we focus on the burden of disease on patients and their families for the first time. Based on the online SYS Patient Voices Survey the perspective of 81 primary caregivers on SYS was assessed. The perceived severity of muscular and developmental manifestations dominated the evaluation of the phenotype in early childhood, while behavioral issues were considered more impactful later in life. Importantly, an apprehension toward symptoms with a later onset was observed in caregivers of younger children. Available therapeutic options, while mostly effective, did not sufficiently alleviate the total burden of disease. Overall, parents stated that caring for an individual with SYS was very challenging, affecting their daily lives and long-term planning. Our study demonstrates the necessity for treatments that, adapted to age and in accordance with the caregivers' prioritization, improve the patients' medical condition and thus facilitate their and their families' social participation."

In 2019, Partners4Growth started operation at 7 centres (4 experienced and 3 twin centres) with the main aim of aligning their practices in the shortest possible time. Education of twin centres' personnel was organized, equipment and methods for growth evaluation and follow-up were standardized. The approach was tested initially at one centre. At baseline and at the 18th month a questionnaire concerning diagnosis and management of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) requiring disorders was applied. A total of 104 new patients were diagnosed compared to 30 in the previous year. Of those, 91 started rhGH treatment - 65 (64 %) GH deficient, 12 (12 %) Turner syndrome, 7 (7 %) Prader-Willi syndrome patients, and 7 (7 %) born small for gestational age without postnatal catch-up, representing 35.8 % of all currently rhGH treated Bulgarian children. A better geographical coverage and more advanced diagnostic and management practices were achieved. Partners4Growth facilitated the alignment of the tertiary pediatric endocrinology centres competences thus leading to an improved diagnosis and treatment of growth disorders as well as better patients' access. For its short existence, the Programme increased significantly the number of new patients in the difficult times of COVID-19 pandemic thus justifying its continuation."

    "abstract": "The incidence of osteopenia and osteoporosis is of concern in adults with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Walking generates reaction forces that could stimulate bone mineralization and is popular in people with PWS. This study compared bone parameters and ground reaction forces (GRF) during gait between young adults with PWS and without PWS and explored associations between bone and GRFs during gait. 10 adults with PWS, 10 controls with obesity (OB) and 10 with normal weight (NW) matched on sex participated. Segmental and full body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans provided femoral neck, spine, total body minus the head bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC). Vertical GRF, vertical impulse, posterior force and negative impulse were measured during 5 walking trials at a self-selected speed along a 10 m runway. Multivariate analyses of variance showed that adults with PWS (<i>n</i> = 7-8) had hip and body BMD and BMC comparable (<i>p</i> > .050) to NW and lower (<i>p</i> < .050) than OB. Adults with PWS showed slower speed than NW (p < .050) but similar to OB (<i>p</i> > .050). Adults with PWS presented lower absolute vertical GRF, vertical impulse and negative impulse than OB (<i>p</i> < .050). Pearson r correlations (<i>p</i> < .050) in those with PWS (n = 7-8) indicated that femoral neck BMC was associated with vertical GRF (<i>r</i> = 0.716), vertical impulse (<i>r</i> = 0.780), posterior force (<i>r</i> = -0.805), and negative impulse (<i>r</i> = -0.748). Spine BMC was associated with speed (<i>r</i> = 0.829) and body BMD was associated with speed (<i>r</i> = 0.893), and posterior force (<i>r</i> = -0.780). Increased BMC in the femoral neck and body were associated with larger breaking forces during walking, a phenomenon normally observed at greater gait speeds. Faster walking speed was associated with greater BMC in the spine and body. Our preliminary results suggest that young adults with PWS could potentially benefit from faster walking for bone health; however, larger prospective studies are needed to confirm this."

This study examined postural stability and associated gait and neuromuscular factors in young adults with PWS. Participants included 10 adults with PWS [7 M/3F; Body Fat % 40.61 ± 7.79]; ten normal weight (NW) adults [7 M/3F; Body Fat % 23.42 ± 7.0]; ten obese (OB) adults [7 M/3F; Body Fat % 42.40 ± 5.62]. Participants completed the Sensory Organization Test (SOT)®. Condition (C) specific and a composite equilibrium score (CES) were calculated (maximum = 100). Quadriceps strength was assessed using an isokinetic dynamometer. Three-dimensional gait analyses were completed along a 10 m walkway using a motion capture system and two force plates. A gait stability ratio (GSR) was computed from gait speed and step length (steps/m). The PWS group had lower scores for C1, C3, C4 and CES compared to the NW (p < .039 for all) and lower scores for C4 and CES than the OB (p < .019 for both) groups, respectively. In C5 (eyes closed, sway-referenced support) and C6 (sway-referenced vision and support), 33.3% of participants with PWS fell during the first trial in both conditions (X<sup>2</sup> [2] 7.436, p = .024) and (X<sup>2</sup> [2] 7.436, p = .024) but no participant in the other groups fell. Those with PWS showed higher GSR than participants with NW (p = .005) and those with obesity (p = .045). Individuals with PWS had more difficulty maintaining standing balance when relying on information from the somatosensory (C3), visual-vestibular (C4) and vestibular systems (C5, C6). A more stable walk was related to shorter steps, slower velocity and reduced peak quadriceps torque. Participation in multisensory activities that require appropriate prioritization of sensory system(s) input for controlling balance in altered sensory environments should be routinely included. In addition, exercises targeting muscular force and power should be included as part of exercise programming in PWS."

    "abstract": "N-acetylglucosamine kinase (NAGK) has been identified as an anchor protein that facilitates neurodevelopment with its non-canonical structural role. Similarly, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN) regulates neurodevelopment and cognitive ability. In our previous study, we revealed the interaction between NAGK and SNRPN in the neuron. However, the precise role in neurodevelopment is elusive. In this study, we investigate the role of NAGK and SNRPN in the axodendritic development of neurons. NAGK and SNRPN interaction is significantly increased in neurons at the crucial stages of neurodevelopment. Furthermore, overexpression of the NAGK and SNRPN proteins increases axodendritic branching and neuronal complexity, whereas the knockdown inhibits neurodevelopment. We also observe the interaction of NAGK and SNRPN with the dynein light-chain roadblock type 1 (DYNLRB1) protein variably during neurodevelopment, revealing the microtubule-associated delivery of the complex. Interestingly, NAGK and SNRPN proteins rescued impaired axodendritic development in an SNRPN depletion model of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell neurons. Taken together, these findings are crucial in developing therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases."

The panel was validated by next-generation sequencing and distributed to laboratories, along with questionnaires and case scenarios. Sixty-nine laboratories participated in the EQA program, and 91.30% (63/69) of laboratories correctly identified all samples. A total of 7.25% (5/69) of the laboratories reported false-negative results, and 2.90% (2/69) of the laboratories reported unexpected CNVs.

With the increase in the FF, deletion size, and read depth, the detection rate increased. For results reports, only five laboratories reported FF values, one laboratory reported the CNV classification type, and none reported sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values. The detection capabilities of NIPS for CNVs still need to be improved and standardized, and FF, deletion size, and read depth are factors that affect the detection rate."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), which is a complex epigenetic disorder caused by the deficiency of paternally expressed genes in chromosome 15q11-q13, is associated with several psychiatric dimensions, including autism spectrum disorder. We have previously reported that iPS cells derived from PWS patients exhibited aberrant differentiation and transcriptomic dysregulation in differentiated neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurons. Here, we identified SLITRK1 as a downregulated gene in NSCs differentiated from PWS patient iPS cells by RNA sequencing analysis. Because SLITRK1 is involved in synaptogenesis, we focused on the synaptic formation and function of neurons differentiated from PWS patient iPS cells and NDN or MAGEL2 single gene defect mutant iPS cells. Although βIII tubulin expression levels in all the neurons were comparable to the level of differentiation in the control, pre- and postsynaptic markers were significantly lower in PWS and mutant neurons than in control neurons. PSD-95 puncta along βIII tubulin neurites were also decreased. Membrane potential responses were measured while exposed to high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation. The neuronal excitabilities in PWS and mutant neurons showed significantly lower intensity than that of control neurons. These functional defects in PWS neurons may reflect phenotypes of neurodevelopmental disorders in PWS."

Serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) was (median (range)) 121 (182) ng/ml in PWS versus 44 (51) ng/ml in HC, p = 1 × 10<sup>-9</sup>), myeloperoxidase (MPO) was 183 (696) ng/ml versus 65 (180) ng/ml, p = 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) and macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) was 46 (150) ng/ml versus 121 (163) ng/ml (p = 1 × 10<sup>-3</sup>), after adjusting for age and sex. Also other markers tended to be elevated (OPG, sIL2RA, CHI3L1, VEGF) but not significantly after Bonferroni correction (p > 0.002). As expected PWS had higher body mass index, waist circumference, leptin, C-reactive protein, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), VAI and cholesterol, but MMP-9, MPO and MIF remained significantly different in PWS after adjustment for these clinical CVD risk factors. PWS had elevated levels of MMP-9 and MPO and of reduced levels of MIF, which were not secondary to comorbid CVD risk factors. This immune profile suggests enhanced monocyte/neutrophil activation, impaired macrophage inhibition with enhanced extracellular matrix remodeling. These findings warrant further studies targeting these immune pathways in PWS."

    "title": "The importance of gynecological examination in adolescent girls and adult women with Prader-Willi syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Current published guidelines for routine care of women with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) do not include recommendations for gynecologic examinations. We describe our experience with gynecological examinations in women with PWS and offer recommendations for routine health care for these patients. Data were collected on all 41 PWS females ages ≥12 year, followed in our national Israeli multidisciplinary clinic between the years 2011 and 2022. Menstrual data and findings on external gynecological examination, including evaluation of the vulva and hymen were recorded at yearly visits. During the gynecological evaluation the topic of sexual education was discussed. Pelvic ultrasound, specifically for antral follicular count, was performed for those visiting the clinic during 2020-2022. Blood samples for luteinizing hormone (LH), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), and estradiol were obtained routinely and DEXA scans for bone density were done when indicated. Of the 41 women, (median age at start of follow-up 17 years, range [12.3-39], BMI 30.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [IQR 23.5-37.1]), 39 women agreed to external gynecological examination. Eleven women (27%) had spontaneous menses, with menarche at the age of 14 to as late as 31 years. The hymen was intact in all except one. Poor hygiene was observed in eight women, three women with vulvovaginitis, and five with irritated vulva related to poor hygiene. Gynecological ultrasound was performed in 27 women. In 22, endometrial thickness was less than 5 mm. The median antral follicular count (AFC) was 6 (<10th percentile for age). No correlation between AFC and menstruation or BMI was found. Mean FSH level was 5.7 ± 3.6 IU, LH was 2.29 ± 2.23, and estradiol was 128 ± 76 pmol/L. Data on DEXA measurements were available in 25 women aged 16-39. Median spine T score was -1.3 (range between 0.5 and -3.7), and hip T score was -1.2 (range between 0.8 and -3.3). A negative correlation was found between endometrial thickness and the presence of osteopenia or osteoporosis (r = -0.5, p = 0.013). Despite our recommendations, only eight of 14 women agreed to hormonal treatment or contraception. One woman who received treatment had a thromboembolic event. Routine health care for women with PWS should include gynecological examinations. The gynecological evaluation should include external genital examination, assessment of hygiene, obtaining a blood sample for hormone levels, and documenting a history of sexual experience or sexual abuse. Hormonal treatment or contraception should be offered when appropriate."

    "title": "Using <i>sno-</i><i>lncRNAs</i> as potential markers for Prader-Willi syndrome diagnosis.",
    "abstract": "The genetic disorder Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is mainly caused by the loss of multiple paternally expressed genes in chromosome 15q11-q13 (the PWS region). Early diagnosis of PWS is essential for timely treatment, leading to effectively easing some clinical symptoms. Molecular approaches for PWS diagnosis at the DNA level are available, but the diagnosis of PWS at the RNA level has been limited. Here, we show that a cluster of paternally transcribed snoRNA-ended long noncoding RNAs (<i>sno-lncRNAs</i>, <i>sno-lncRNA1-5</i>) derived from the <i>SNORD116</i> locus in the PWS region can serve as diagnostic markers. In particular, quantification analysis has revealed that 6,000 copies of <i>sno-lncRNA3</i> are present in 1 μL whole blood samples from non-PWS individuals. <i>sno-lncRNA</i>3 is absent in all examined whole blood samples of 8 PWS individuals compared to 42 non-PWS individuals and dried blood samples of 35 PWS individuals compared to 24 non-PWS individuals. Further developing a new CRISPR-MhdCas13c system for RNA detection with a sensitivity of 10 molecules per μL has ensured <i>sno-lncRNA3</i> detection in non-PWS, but not PWS individuals. Together, we suggest that the absence of <i>sno-lncRNA3</i> represents a potential marker for PWS diagnosis that can be detected by both RT-qPCR and CRISPR-MhdCas13c systems with only microlitre amount of blood samples. Such an RNA-based sensitive and convenient approach may facilitate the early detection of PWS."

A 24-year-old male patient with Prader-Willi syndrome presented with an enlarged adrenal tumor. Computed tomography detected a well-defined mass. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an increased signal intensity predominantly in fatty areas, suggesting adrenal myelolipoma. Laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was performed. Postoperatively, the patient developed mild pulmonary atelectasis, myelolipoma was confirmed by histopathology, and there was no recurrence at approximately 2 years postoperatively.

    "title": "Early onset critically ill infants with Schaaf-Yang syndrome: a retrospective study from the China neonatal genomes project and literature review.",
    "abstract": "Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS) is a recently identified rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by neonatal hypotonia, feeding difficulty, joint contractures, autism spectrum disorder and development delay/intellectual disability. It is mainly caused by truncating variants in maternally imprinted gene <i>MAGEL2</i> within the Prader-Willi syndrome critical region 15q11-q13. Clinical diagnosis of SYS is difficult for clinicians due to its rarity and highly variable phenotypes, while unique inheritance patterns also complicate genetic diagnosis. To date, no published papers have analyzed the clinical consequences and molecular changes in Chinese patients. In this study, we retrospectively investigated the mutation spectrums and phenotypic features of 12 SYS infants. The data were from a cohort of critically ill infants from the China neonatal genomes project (CNGP), sponsored by Children's Hospital of Fudan University. We also reviewed relevant literature. Six previously reported mutations and six novel pathogenic variations of <i>MAGEL2</i> were identified in 12 unrelated infants. Neonatal respiratory problems were the major complaint for hospitalization, which occurred in 91.7% (11/12) cases. All babies displayed feeding difficulties and a poor suck postnatally, and neonatal dystonia was present in 11 of the cases; joint contractures and multiple congenital defects were also observed. Interestingly, we found that 42.5% (57/134) of the reported SYS patients, including ours carried variants in the c.1996 site, particularly the c.1996dupC variant. The mortality rate was 17.2% (23/134), with the median age of death between 24 gestational weeks in fetuses and 1-month-old in infants. Respiratory failure was the leading cause of death in live-born patients (58.8%, 10/17), especially during the neonatal period. Our findings expanded the genotype and phenotype spectrum of neonatal SYS patients. The results demonstrated that respiratory dysfunction was a typical characteristic among Chinese SYS neonates that should attract physicians' attention. The early identification of such disorders allows early intervention and can further provide genetic counseling as well as reproductive options for the affected families."

    "title": "Imprinting disorders.",
    "abstract": "Imprinting disorders (ImpDis) are congenital conditions that are characterized by disturbances of genomic imprinting. The most common individual ImpDis are Prader-Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Individual ImpDis have similar clinical features, such as growth disturbances and developmental delay, but the disorders are heterogeneous and the key clinical manifestations are often non-specific, rendering diagnosis difficult. Four types of genomic and imprinting defect (ImpDef) affecting differentially methylated regions (DMRs) can cause ImpDis. These defects affect the monoallelic and parent-of-origin-specific expression of imprinted genes. The regulation within DMRs as well as their functional consequences are mainly unknown, but functional cross-talk between imprinted genes and functional pathways has been identified, giving insight into the pathophysiology of ImpDefs. Treatment of ImpDis is symptomatic. Targeted therapies are lacking owing to the rarity of these disorders; however, personalized treatments are in development. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of ImpDis, and improving diagnosis and treatment of these disorders, requires a multidisciplinary approach with input from patient representatives."

    "title": "A Personalized Approach to Determining the Caloric Needs of Children with Prader-Willi Syndrome Treated with Growth Hormone.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is the most frequent cause of genetic obesity. Early reports indicate that children with PWS require 20-40% fewer calories than healthy children to maintain adequate growth. Growth hormone treatment for children with PWS, approved in 2000, affects the body composition and probably affects energy requirements. This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed the caloric intake in children with PWS aged from 6 months to 12 years old who underwent growth hormone treatment, comparing the patients' caloric intake calculated from parent-recorded dietary intake versus the recommended caloric intake for healthy children, taking into account the age, sex, height, weight, and physical activity. We analyzed the data from 25 patients (13 (52%) boys; mean age, 6.72 ± 2.81 y; median age at starting growth hormone treatment, 1.4 y (IQR: 0.78-2.29); 17 (68%) normal weight and 8 (32%) overweight or obese). The mean daily energy intake was 1208 ± 186 kcal/d, representing 96.83% ± 18.66 of the recommended caloric intake for healthy children. The caloric intake in children with PWS treated with growth hormone was very similar to that recommended for healthy children; thus, we should rethink the dietary recommendations for these children."

    "abstract": "Sleep is a fundamental biological necessity, the lack of which has severe repercussions on the mental and physical well-being in individuals of all ages. The phrase \"sleep-disordered breathing (SDB)\" indicates a wide array of conditions characterized by snoring and/or respiratory distress due to increased upper airway resistance and pharyngeal collapsibility; these range from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and occur in all age groups. In the general pediatric population, the prevalence of OSA varies between 2% and 5%, but in some particular clinical conditions, it can be much higher. While adenotonsillar hypertrophy (\"classic phenotype\") is the main cause of OSA in preschool age (3-5 years), obesity (\"adult phenotype\") is the most common cause in adolescence. There is also a \"congenital-structural\" phenotype that is characterized by a high prevalence of OSA, appearing from the earliest ages of life, supported by morpho-structural abnormalities or craniofacial changes and associated with genetic syndromes such as Pierre Robin syndrome, Prader-Willi, achondroplasia, and Down syndrome. Neuromuscular disorders and lysosomal storage disorders are also frequently accompanied by a high prevalence of OSA in all life ages. Early recognition and proper treatment are crucial to avoid major neuro-cognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic morbidities."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by either the deletion of the paternal allele of 15q11-q13, maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 or defects in the chromosome 15 imprinting centre and is characterized by cognitive impairment, hyperphagia and low metabolic rate with significant risk of obesity, as well as a variety of other maladaptive behaviours and autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). Many of the features seen in PWS are thought to be due to hypothalamic dysfunction resulting in hormonal abnormalities and impaired social functioning. The preponderance of evidence indicates that the Oxytocin system is dysregulated in PWS individuals and that this neuropeptide pathways may provide promising targets for therapeutic intervention although the process by which this dysregulation occurs in PWS awaits mechanistic investigation. PWS individuals present abnormalities in thermoregulation an impaired detection for temperature change and altered perception of pain indicating an altered autonomic nervous system. Recent studies indicate that Oxytocin is involved in thermoregulation and pain perception. This review will describe the update on PWS and the recent discoveries on Oxytocin regulation of thermogenesis together with the potential link between Oxytocin regulation of thermogenesis and PWS to create a new groundwork for the treatment of this condition."

    "abstract": "Gene is located inside the nuclease and the genetic data is contained in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). A person's gene count ranges from 20,000 to 30,000. Even a minor alteration to the DNA sequence can be harmful if it affects the cell's fundamental functions. As a result, the gene begins to act abnormally. The sorts of genetic abnormalities brought on by mutation include chromosomal disorders, complex disorders, and single-gene disorders. Therefore, a detailed diagnosis method is required. Thus, we proposed an Elephant Herd Optimization-Whale Optimization Algorithm (EHO-WOA) optimized Stacked ResNet-Bidirectional Long Term Short Memory (ResNet-BiLSTM) model for detecting genetic disorders. Here, a hybrid EHO-WOA algorithm is presented to assess the Stacked ResNet-BiLSTM architecture's fitness. The ResNet-BiLSTM design uses the genotype and gene expression phenotype as input data. Furthermore, the proposed method identifies rare genetic disorders such as Angelman Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, and Prader-Willi Syndrome. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed model with greater accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, and f1-score. Thus, a wide range of DNA deficiencies including Prader-Willi syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Early Onset Morbid Obesity, Rett syndrome, and Angelman syndrome are predicted accurately."

    "abstract": "Eating \"disorders\" of people with Prader-Willi syndrome are frequently reported in the biomedical literature. The eating behaviors are presented as a syndrome-specific trajectory over the course of a lifetime. Infants initially show anorexic behavior, which then develops into hyperphagia that lasts from childhood to adulthood and is characterized by strong cravings for food and relentless thinking about it. However, the sociocultural determinants of these food practices are not fully understood. In the first section of this article, we carry out a literature review of medical articles published on disordered eating in children with PWS. The second section draws on a social science perspective and offers an interdisciplinary problematization using the concept of food socialization. To conclude, the third section explores the challenges facing research and new questions that emerge from the alternative problematization that is the PWS Food Social Norms Internalization (FSNI) theory."

PWS and SYS have phenotypic overlap. Patients with SYS are often treated with growth hormone (GH), but evidence for the effectiveness of the treatment in patients with SYS is limited. This study describes 7 children with SYS. We studied their phenotype, genotype, and the effect of GH treatment on height and body mass index (BMI) during 4 years and on body composition during 1 year. All patients had a normal birth weight. Most patients had hypotonia and feeding difficulties after birth (86%). Full-scale IQ ranged from &lt;50 to 92. All patients above the age of 2 years had psycho-behavioral problems. There were no apparent correlations between the phenotype and the location of the defect in the MAGEL2 gene. Mean (95% CI) height SDS increased significantly from -1.74 (-3.55; 0.07) at start to -0.05 (-1.87; 1.77) after 4 years of GH treatment. Mean (95% CI) BMI SDS decreased significantly from 2.01 (1.02; 3.00) to 1.22 (0.18; 2.26) after 6 months and remained the same during the rest of the follow-up. Fat mass percentage SDS decreased and lean body mass did not change during 1 year of treatment in 3 patients. Patients presented with a phenotype of hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, and feeding difficulties after birth, endocrine disorders, intellectual disability, and behavioral problems. Treatment with GH significantly improved height SDS and BMI over the course of 4 years."

However, the role and mechanism of Prader-Willi region nonprotein coding RNA 2 (PWRN2) in PCOS progression remain unclear. In our study, Sprague-Dawley rat was injected with dehydroepiandrosterone to mimic PCOS rat models. HE staining was used to assess the number of benign granular cells, and serum insulin and hormone levels were detected by ELISA kit. The expression of PWRN2 was examined by qRT-PCR. Ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) proliferation and apoptosis were examined by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. The protein levels of apoptosis markers and Alpha thalassemia retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) were determined by western blot. The interaction between lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and PWRN2 or ATRX was confirmed by RIP and ChIP assay. Our data showed that PWRN2 was upregulated and ATRX was downregulated in the ovarium tissues and serum of PCOS rat. PWRN2 knockdown promoted GCs proliferation and inhibited apoptosis. In the mechanism, PWRN2 inhibited ATRX transcription by binding with LSD1. In addition, downregulation of ATRX also eliminated the effect of sh-PWRN2 on GCs growth. In conclusion, our data suggested that PWRN2 might restrain GCs growth to promote PCOS progression, which was achieved by binding with LSD1 to inhibit ATRX transcription."

However, investigations into endogenous oxytocin and vasopressin levels as well as clinical trials evaluating the effect of exogenous oxytocin on PWS symptoms have had mixed results. It is also unknown whether endogenous oxytocin and vasopressin levels are associated with certain PWS behaviours. We compared plasma oxytocin and vasopressin and saliva oxytocin levels in 30 adolescents and adults with PWS to 30 typically developing age-matched controls. We also compared neuropeptide levels between gender and genetic subtypes within the PWS cohort and examined the relationship between neuropeptide levels and PWS behaviours. While we did not measure a group difference in plasma or saliva oxytocin levels, plasma vasopressin was significantly lower in individuals with PWS compared to controls. Within the PWS cohort, saliva oxytocin levels were higher in females compared to males and individuals with the mUPD compared to the deletion genetic subtype. We also found the neuropeptides correlated with different PWS behaviours for males and females and for genetic subtypes. For the deletion group, higher plasma and saliva oxytocin levels were related to fewer behaviour problems. For the mUPD group, higher plasma vasopressin levels were related to more behaviour problems. These findings support existing evidence of a vasopressin system defect in PWS and for the first time identify potential differences in the oxytocin and vasopressin systems across PWS genetic subtypes."

The PWS phenotype resembles that observed in the classic non-PWS GH deficiency (GHD), including short stature, excessive fat mass, and reduced muscle mass. To date, a small number of studies on the long-term effects of GH treatment are available in adult subjects with PWS. In this longitudinal study, 12 obese subjects with PWS (GHD/non-GHD 6/6) were treated for a median of 17 years, with a median GH dose of 0.35 mg/day. The median age was 27.1 years. Anthropometric, body composition, hormonal, biochemical, and blood pressure variables were analyzed in all subjects. Waist circumference was significantly lower at the end of the treatment period (p-value=0.0449), while body mass index (BMI) did not differ significantly. Compared to the baseline, a highly significant reduction of Fat Mass % (FM%) was observed (p-value=0.0005). IGF-I SDS values significantly increased during GH therapy (p-value=0.0005). A slight impairment of glucose homeostasis was observed after GH therapy, with an increase in the median fasting glucose levels, while insulin, HOMA-IR, and HbA1c values remained unchanged. Considering GH secretory status, both subjects with and without GHD showed a significant increase in IGF-I SDS and a reduction of FM% after GH therapy (p-value= 0.0313 for all). Our results indicate that long-term GH treatment has beneficial effects on body composition and body fat distribution in adults with PWS associated with obesity. However, the increase in glucose values during GH therapy should be considered, and continuous surveillance of glucose metabolism is mandatory during long-term GH therapy, especially in subjects with obesity."

It has been reported that the HPA axis might show a delayed response during acute stress, and it is unknown whether the response of the HPA-axis during acute stress changes with age in children with PWS. To investigate the HPA-axis response during an overnight single-dose metyrapone (MTP) test in children with PWS and to assess if the response changes with age, whether it is delayed and if it changes with repeated testing over time. In addition, we evaluated different cut-off points of ACTH and 11-DOC levels to assess stress-related central adrenal insufficiency (CAI). An overnight single-dose MTP test was performed in 93 children with PWS. Over time, 30 children had a second test and 11 children a third one. Children were divided into age groups (0-2 years, 2-4 years, 4-8 years and > 8 years). Most children did not have their lowest cortisol level at 7.30h, but at 04.00h. Their ACTH and 11-DOC peaks appeared several hours later, suggesting a delayed response. When evaluated according to a subnormal ACTH peak (13-33 pmol/L) more children had an subnormal response compared to evaluation based on a subnormal 11-doc peak (< 200 nmol/L). The percentage of children with a subnormal ACTH response ranged from 22.2 to 70.0% between the age groups, while the percentage of a subnormal 11-DOC response ranged from 7.7 to 20.6%. When using the ACTH peak for diagnosing acute-stress-related CAI, differences between age groups and with repeated testing over time were found, whereas there was no age difference when using the 11-DOC peak. Early morning ACTH or 11-DOC levels are not appropriate to determine acute stress-related CAI in children with PWS, thus multiple measurements throughout the night are needed for an accurate interpretation. Our data suggest a delayed response of the HPA-axis during acute stress. Using the 11-DOC peak for the test interpretation is less age-dependent than the ACTH peak. Repeated testing of the HPA-axis over time is not required, unless clinically indicated."

    "abstract": "As the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders in children, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by deficits in language development, social interaction, and repetitive behaviors or inflexible interests. Contactin associated protein like 2 (CNTNAP2), encoding a single transmembrane protein (CNTNAP2) with 1331 amino acid residues, is a widely validated ASD-susceptible gene. Cntnap2-deficient mice also show core autism-relevant behaviors, including the social deficits and repetitive behavior. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying dysfunction CNTNAP2 and ASD remain elusive. In this study, we found a motif within the transmembrane domain of CNTNAP2 was highly homologous to the γ-secretase cleavage site of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), suggesting that CNTNAP2 may undergo proteolytic cleavage. Further biochemical analysis indicated that CNTNAP2 is cleaved by γ-secretase to produce the CNTNAP2 intracellular domain (CICD). Virally delivery of CICD to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in Cntnap2-deficient (Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup>) mice normalized the deficit in the ASD-related behaviors, including social deficit and repetitive behaviors. Furthermore, CICD promoted the nuclear translocation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) to regulate the transcription of genes, such as Prader Willi syndrome gene Necdin. Whereas Necdin deficiency led to reduced social interaction in mice, virally expression of Necdin in the mPFC normalized the deficit in social preference of Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our results thus reveal a critical function of CICD and highlight a role of the CNTNAP2-CASK-Necdin signaling pathway in ASD."

PWS is caused by the loss of expression of the PWS critical region, a cluster of paternally expressed genes on chromosome 15q11.2-q13. As life expectancy of patients with PWS increases, age-related diseases like malignancies might pose a new threat to health. To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of malignancies in patients with PWS and to provide clinical recommendations for cancer screening. We included 706 patients with PWS (160 children, 546 adults). We retrospectively collected data from medical records on past or current malignancies, the type of malignancy, and risk factors for malignancy. Additionally, we searched the literature for information about the relationship between genes on chromosome 15q11.2-q13 and malignancies. Seven adults (age range, 18-55 years) had been diagnosed with a malignancy (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, intracranial hemangiopericytoma, melanoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, biliary cancer, parotid adenocarcinoma, and colon cancer). All patients with a malignancy had a paternal 15q11-13 deletion. The literature review showed that several genes on chromosome 15q11.2-q13 are related to malignancies. Malignancies are rare in patients with PWS. Therefore, screening for malignancies is only indicated when clinically relevant symptoms are present, such as unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, symptoms suggestive of paraneoplastic syndrome, or localizing symptoms. Given the increased cancer risk associated with obesity, which is common in PWS, participation in national screening programs should be encouraged."

All individuals were evaluated using the Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (HQ-CT). Forty-three individuals were evaluated. The mean age at baseline (treatment onset) was 18.4±8.3 years in the RTT group and 19.1±6.9 years in the control group (p=0.74).

This was also identified within the three categories: arguing or manipulating to obtain food (2.71±2.1 vs 5.41±3.2, p=0.003), sneaking food (1.33±1.5 vs 3.55±3.3, p=0.007), and anger or tantrums related to food (1.67±1.8 vs 4.09±2.7, p=0.001). After a mean treatment duration of 41.0 months, the RTT group had a reduction in body mass index (baseline 38.7±17.1kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs follow-up 29.2±9.2kg/m<sup>2</sup>; p<0.0001). A significant association between RTT duration and BMI reduction (p=0.037) was identified. We observed a positive impact on behaviours related to hyperphagia and a BMI reduction in PWS individuals in a context of a non-pharmacological nutritional approach as part of an RTT."

The current study describes psychological distress and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in non-disabled siblings. Fifty-eight siblings and 86 parents participated. Parents reported that almost 40% of siblings had psychological symptoms that exceeded clinical cut-off scores; 58.9% of siblings reported symptoms of PTSD that exceeded diagnostic cut-off scores. Symptoms were significantly related to family organisation and control per parent report and negative affect per sibling report. Growing up with a sibling with PWS may challenge adaptive resources of non-disabled siblings, leaving them vulnerable to psychological distress. Those who care for children with PWS are in a unique position to educate families about the potential vulnerability of non-disabled siblings. We encourage routine screening and support for affected family members, especially siblings."

Abnormal activation of peripheral immune system is postulated as a contributor. However, detailed features of the peripheral immune cells in PWS have not been fully elucidated. Serum inflammatory cytokines were measured in healthy controls (n=13) and PWS patients (n=10) using a 65- multiplex cytokine assays. Changes of the peripheral immune cells in PWS was assessed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PWS patients (n=6) and healthy controls (n=12). PWS patients exhibited hyper-inflammatory signatures in PBMCs and monocytes were the most pronounced. Most inflammatory serum cytokines were increased in PWS, including IL-1β, IL-2R, IL-12p70, and TNF-α. The characteristics of monocytes evaluated by scRNA-seq and CyTOF showed that CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes were significantly increased in PWS patients. Functional pathway analysis revealed that CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes upregulated pathways in PWS were closely associated with TNF/IL-1β- driven inflammation signaling. The CellChat analysis identified CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes transmitted chemokine and cytokine signaling to drive inflammatory process in other cell types. Finally, we explored the PWS deletion region 15q11-q13 might be responsible for elevated levels of inflammation in the peripheral immune system. The study highlights that CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes contributor to the hyper-inflammatory state of PWS which provides potential targets for immunotherapy in the future and expands our knowledge of peripheral immune cells in PWS at the single cell level for the first time."

    "abstract": "Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) syndrome is an ultra-rare neurocristopathy with no known genetic or environmental etiology. Rapid-onset obesity over a 3-12 month period with onset between ages 1.5-7 years of age is followed by an unfolding constellation of symptoms including severe hypoventilation that can lead to cardiorespiratory arrest in previously healthy children if not identified early and intervention provided. Congenital Central Hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) have overlapping clinical features with ROHHAD and known genetic etiologies. Here we compare patient neurons from three pediatric syndromes (ROHHAD, CCHS, and PWS) and neurotypical control subjects to identify molecular overlap that may explain the clinical similarities. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) from neurotypical control, ROHHAD, and CCHS subjects were differentiated into neuronal cultures for RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Differential expression analysis identified transcripts variably regulated in ROHHAD and CCHS vs. neurotypical control neurons. In addition, we used previously published PWS transcript data to compare both groups to PWS patient-derived DPSC neurons. Enrichment analysis was performed on RNAseq data and downstream protein expression analysis was performed using immunoblotting. We identified three transcripts differentially regulated in all three syndromes vs. neurotypical control subjects. Gene ontology analysis on the ROHHAD dataset revealed enrichments in several molecular pathways that may contribute to disease pathology. Importantly, we found 58 transcripts differentially expressed in both ROHHAD and CCHS patient neurons vs. control neurons. Finally, we validated transcript level changes in expression of <i>ADORA2A</i>, a gene encoding for an adenosine receptor, at the protein level in CCHS neurons and found variable, although significant, changes in ROHHAD neurons. The molecular overlap between CCHS and ROHHAD neurons suggests that the clinical phenotypes in these syndromes likely arise from or affect similar transcriptional pathways. Further, gene ontology analysis identified enrichments in ATPase transmembrane transporters, acetylglucosaminyltransferases, and phagocytic vesicle membrane proteins that may contribute to the ROHHAD phenotype. Finally, our data imply that the rapid-onset obesity seen in both ROHHAD and PWS likely arise from different molecular mechanisms. The data presented here describes important preliminary findings that warrant further validation."

    "abstract": "Lipid metabolism is closely linked to adiposity. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a typical genetic disorder causing obesity; however, the distinct lipidomic profiles in PWS children have not been thoroughly investigated. Herein, serum lipidomics analyses were simultaneously explored in PWS, simple obesity (SO), and normal children (Normal). Results indicated that the total concentration of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in the PWS group were significantly deceased compared with both the SO and the Normal group. In contrast, compared with the Normal group, there was an overall significant increase in triacylglycerol (TAG) levels in both the PWS and the SO groups, with the highest found in SO group. Thirty-nine and 50 differential lipid species were screened among 3 groups: between obesity (PWS and SO) and the Normal group. Correlation analysis revealed distinct profiles in PWS that was different from other 2 groups. Notably, PC (P16:0/18:1), PE (P18:0-20:3), PE (P18:0-20:4)) showed significant negative correlation with body mass index (BMI) only in the PWS group. PE (P16:0-18:2) showed a negative association with BMI and weight in the PWS group, but significant positive correlation in the SO group; no statistically significant association was found in the Normal group. We also found a significant negative correlation between Blautia genus abundance and several significantly changed lipids, including LPC (14:0), LPC (16:0), TAG (C50:2/C51:9), TAG (C52:2/C53:9), TAG (C52:3/C53:10), and TAG (C52:4/C53:11), but no significant correlation in the Normal group and the SO group. Similarly, in the PWS group, the Neisseria genus was significantly negatively associated with acylcarnitine (CAR) (14:1), CAR (18:0), PE (P18:0/20:3), and PE (P18:0/20:4), and extremely positively associated with TAG (C52:2/C53:9); no obvious correlations were observed in the Normal group and the SO group."

    "title": "The Diagnosis and Genetic Mechanisms of Prader-Willi Syndrome: Findings From a Moroccan Population Study.",
    "abstract": "Background Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic disorder caused by a deficit in gene expression on the paternal inherited chromosome 15q11.2-q13. It affects various aspects of growth and development, including feeding, cognitive function, and behavior. Early diagnosis and management of PWS can significantly improve outcomes for patients and their families. Methods In this study, we analyzed a group of 29 clinically diagnosed patients suspected of PWS. All patients were referred to the medical genetics and onco-genetics service for genetic consultation and molecular analysis. We used DNA methylation analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to confirm the diagnosis and identify the underlying genetic mechanisms. Results Our analysis showed that five out of seven patients (71.43%) with a positive methylation-specific PCR (MSP) had chromosomal deletion by FISH and presented major clinical signs summarized by morbid obesity in 65.21% of cases and neonatal hypotonia in 42.85% of cases. This finding indicates that paternal 15q11-q13 deletion is the most common genetic mechanism involved in PWS. Conclusion The results of this study highlight the importance of early diagnosis and molecular analysis in the management of Prader-Willi syndrome. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation in the Moroccan population and provide families with a rigorous molecular diagnosis, relevant genetic counseling, and multidisciplinary support. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of PWS and develop effective interventions to improve outcomes for affected individuals."

    "abstract": "Interstitial 6q deletions are associated with rare genetic syndromes characterized by different signs, including developmental delay, dysmorphisms, and Prader-Willi (PWS)-like features. Drug-resistant epilepsy, a relatively rare finding in this condition, is often a challenge in terms of therapeutic approach. Our aim is to present a new case of interstitial 6q deletion and to conduct a systematic review of the literature with an emphasis on the neurophysiological and clinical traits of afflicted individuals. We report a patient with an interstitial 6q deletion. Standard electroencephalograms (EEG), video-EEG with polygraphy and MRI features are discussed. We also conducted a literature review of previously described cases. We describe a relatively small interstitial 6q deletion (2 Mb circa), detected by CGH-Array, not encompassing the previously described 6q22 critical region for epilepsy occurrence. The patient, a 12-year-old girl, presented with multiple absence-like episodes and startle-induced epileptic spasms since the age of 11, with partial polytherapy control. Treatment with lamotrigine induced the resolution of startle-induced phenomena. From the literature review, we identified 28 patients with overlapping deletions, often larger than our patient's mutation. Seventeen patients presented with PWS-like features. Epilepsy was reported in 4 patients, and 8 patients presented abnormal EEG findings. In our patient, the deletion included genes MCHR2, SIM1, ASCC3, and GRIK2, but, interestingly, it did not encompass the 6q22 critical region for epilepsy occurrence. The involvement of GRIK2 in the deletion may play a role. Literature data are limited, and specific EEG or epileptological phenotypes cannot yet be identified. Epilepsy, although uncommon in the syndrome, deserves a specific diagnostic workup. We speculate on the existence of an additional locus in the 6q16.1-q21 region, different from the already hypothesized q22, promoting the development of epilepsy in affected patients."

    "abstract": "There is a pressing need to improve the accuracy of rare disease clinical study endpoints. Neutral theory, first described here, can be used to assess the accuracy of endpoints and improve their selection in rare disease clinical studies, reducing the risk of patient misclassification. Neutral theory was used to assess the accuracy of rare disease clinical study endpoints and the resulting probability of false positive and false negative classifications at different disease prevalence rates. Search strings were extracted from the Orphanet Register of Rare Diseases using a proprietary algorithm to conduct a systematic review of studies published until January 2021. Overall, 11 rare diseases with one disease-specific disease severity scale (133 studies) and 12 rare diseases with more than one disease-specific disease severity scale (483 studies) were included. All indicators from clinical studies were extracted, and Neutral theory was used to calculate their match to disease-specific disease severity scales, which were used as surrogates for the disease phenotype. For those with more than one disease-severity scale, endpoints were compared with the first disease-specific disease severity scale and a composite of all later scales. A Neutrality score of > 1.50 was considered acceptable. Around half the clinical studies for half the rare diseases with one disease-specific disease severity score (palmoplantar psoriasis, achalasia, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis and Fournier's gangrene) met the threshold for an acceptable match to the disease phenotype, one rare disease (Guillain-Barré syndrome) had one study with an acceptable match, and four diseases (Behcet's syndrome, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome) had no studies. Clinical study endpoints in almost half the rare diseases with more than one disease-specific DSS (acromegaly, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, Fabry disease and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis) were a better match to the composite, while endpoints in the remaining rare diseases (Charcot Marie Tooth disease, Gaucher disease Type I, Huntington's disease, Sjogren's syndrome and Tourette syndrome) were a worse match. Misclassifications varied with increasing disease prevalence. Neutral theory confirmed that disease-severity measurement needs improvement in rare disease clinical studies, especially for some diseases, and suggested that the potential for accuracy increases as the body of knowledge on a disease increases. Using Neutral theory to benchmark disease-severity measurement in rare disease clinical studies may reduce the risk of misclassification, ensuring that recruitment and treatment effect assessment optimise medicine adoption and benefit patients."

    "abstract": "While common obesity accounts for an increasing global health burden, its monogenic forms have taught us underlying mechanisms via more than 20 single-gene disorders. Among these, the most common mechanism is central nervous system dysregulation of food intake and satiety, often accompanied by neurodevelopmental delay (NDD) and autism spectrum disorder. In a family with syndromic obesity, we identified a monoallelic truncating variant in POU3F2 (alias BRN2) encoding a neural transcription factor, which has previously been suggested as a driver of obesity and NDD in individuals with the 6q16.1 deletion. In an international collaboration, we identified ultra-rare truncating and missense variants in another ten individuals sharing autism spectrum disorder, NDD, and adolescent-onset obesity. Affected individuals presented with low-to-normal birth weight and infantile feeding difficulties but developed insulin resistance and hyperphagia during childhood. Except for a variant leading to early truncation of the protein, identified variants showed adequate nuclear translocation but overall disturbed DNA-binding ability and promotor activation. In a cohort with common non-syndromic obesity, we independently observed a negative correlation of POU3F2 gene expression with BMI, suggesting a role beyond monogenic obesity. In summary, we propose deleterious intragenic variants of POU3F2 to cause transcriptional dysregulation associated with hyperphagic obesity of adolescent onset with variable NDD."

    "abstract": "Elevated prevalence of autism characteristics is reported in genetic syndromes associated with intellectual disability. This review summarises recent evidence on the behavioural heterogeneity of autism in the following syndromes: Fragile X, Cornelia de Lange, Williams, Prader-Willi, Angelman, Down, Smith-Magenis, and tuberous sclerosis complex. Key considerations for assessment and support are discussed. The profile and developmental trajectory of autism-related behaviour in these syndromes indicate some degree of syndrome specificity which may interact with broader behavioural phenotypes (e.g. hypersociability), intellectual disability, and mental health (e.g. anxiety). Genetic subtype and co-occurring epilepsy within syndromes contribute to increased significance of autism characteristics. Autism-related strengths and challenges are likely to be overlooked or misunderstood using existing screening/diagnostic tools and criteria, which lack sensitivity and specificity within these populations. Autism characteristics are highly heterogeneous across genetic syndromes and often distinguishable from non-syndromic autism. Autism diagnostic assessment practices in this population should be tailored to specific syndromes. Service provisions must begin to prioritise needs-led support."

    "title": "Current Treatments for Patients with Genetic Obesity.",
    "abstract": "Obesity derives from impaired central control of body weight, implying interaction between environment and an individual genetic predisposition. Genetic obesities, including monogenic and syndromic obesities, are rare and complex neuro-endocrine pathologies where the genetic contribution is predominant. Severe and early-onset obesity with eating disorders associated with frequent comorbidities make these diseases challenging. Their current estimated prevalence of 5-10% in severely obese children is probably underestimated due to the limited access to genetic diagnosis. A central alteration of hypothalamic regulation of weight implies that the leptin-melanocortin pathway is responsible for the symptoms. The management of genetic obesity has so far been only based, above all, on lifestyle intervention, especially regarding nutrition and physical activity. New therapeutic options have emerged in the last years for these patients, raising great hope to manage their complex situation and improve quality of life. Implementation of genetic diagnosis in clinical practice is thus of paramount importance to allow individualized care. This review describes the current clinical management of genetic obesity and the evidence on which it is based. Some insights will also be provided into new therapies under evaluation."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a neurodevelopmental disorder based on the loss of paternally derived but maternally imprinted genes on chromosome 15q11-13, is typically associated with hyperphagia-related behavior leading to massive obesity. Recently, there has been increasing evidence for dysregulated expression patterns of genes outside the PWS locus that influence the behavioral phenotype and for alterations in the dopaminergic system associated with weight regulation in PWS. In this study, we investigated the epigenetic regulation of the promoter regions of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) genes and their association with hyperphagia-related behavior in PWS. Methylation of the DAT and DRD2 promoter regions was examined by DNA bisulfite sequencing in 32 individuals with PWS and compared with a control group matched for sex, age, and body mass index (BMI). Hyperphagia-related behavior was assessed using the Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (HQ-CT). Analysis by linear mixed models revealed a significant effect of factor group on mean DAT promoter methylation rate with decreased mean methylation in PWS (7.3 ± 0.4%) compared to controls (18.8 ± 0.6%), p < 0.001. In the PWS group, we further identified effects of HQ-CT score and BMI on DAT promoter methylation. Although also statistically significantly different (8.4 ± 0.2 in PWS, 10.5 ± 0.3 in controls, p < 0.001), DRD2 promoter methylation visually appeared to be evenly distributed between groups, raising concerns regarding a biological effect. Here, we provide evidence for altered epigenetic regulation of the DAT gene in PWS, which is associated with PWS-typical hyperphagia-related behaviors."

The aim of this study was to investigate if the ANS function is altered in PWS. In this case-control study, we assessed ANS function in 20 subjects with PWS (6 males/14 females; median age 10.5 years) and 27 body mass index (BMI) z-score-matched controls (19 males/8 females; median age 12.8 years). Standardized non-invasive measures of cardiac baroreflex function, heart rate, blood pressure, heart rate variability, quantitative sudomotor axon reflex tests, and a symptom questionnaire were completed. The increase in heart rate in response to head-up tilt testing was blunted (<i>p</i> < 0.01) in PWS compared to controls. Besides a lower heart rate ratio with Valsalva in PWS (<i>p</i> < 0.01), no significant differences were observed in other measures of cardiac function or sweat production.

    "title": "Amygdala hyperactivation relates to eating behaviour: a potential indicator of food addiction in Prader-Willi syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental genetic disorder characterized by various endocrine, cognitive and behavioural problems. The symptoms include an obsession for food and reduced satiety, which leads to hyperphagia and morbid obesity. Neuropsychological studies have reported that Prader-Willi patients display altered social interactions with a specific weakness in interpreting social information and responding to them, a symptom close to that observed in autism spectrum disorders. In the present case-control study, we hypothesized that brain regions associated with compulsive eating behaviour would be abnormally activated by food-related odours in Prader-Willi syndrome, as these can stimulate the appetite and induce hunger-related behaviour. We conducted a brain imaging study using the olfactory modality because odours have a high-hedonic valence and can cause stronger emotional reactions than other modalities. Further, the olfactory system is also intimately associated with the endocrine regulation of energy balance and is the most appropriate modality for studies of Prader-Willi syndrome. A total of 16 Prader-Willi participants were recruited for this study, which is a significant achievement given the low incidence rate of this rare disease. The second group of 11 control age-matched subjects also participated in the brain imaging study. In the MRI scanner, using an MRI-compatible olfactometer during 56 block sessions, we randomly presented two odours (tulip and caramel), which have different hedonic valence and a different capacity to arouse hunger-related behaviour. Our results demonstrate that Prader-Willi participants have abnormal activity in the brain reward system that regulates eating behaviour. Indeed, we found that these patients had right amygdala activity up to five times higher in response to a food odour (caramel) compared with the tulip odour. In contrast, age-matched control participants had similar activity levels in response to both odours. The amygdala activity levels were found to be associated with the severity of the hyperphagia in Prader-Willi patients. Our results provide evidence for functional alteration of the right amygdala in Prader-Willi syndrome, which is part of the brain network involved in food addiction modulated by the ghrelin and oxytocin systems, which may drive the hyperphagia. Our study provides important new insights into the functioning of emotion-related brain circuits and pathology, and it is one of the few to explore the dysfunction of the neural circuits involved in emotion and addiction in Prader-Willi syndrome. It suggests new directions for the exploration and remediation of addictive behaviours."

To discuss a search for causative etiology spanning multiple disciplines and continents. The literature (1965-2022) on the diagnosis, management, pathophysiology, and potential etiology of ROHHAD was methodically reviewed. The experience of several academic centers with expertise in ROHHAD is presented, along with a detailed discussion of scientific discovery in the search for a cause. ROHHAD is an ultra-rare syndrome with fewer than 200 known cases. Although variations occur, the acronym ROHHAD is intended to alert physicians to the usual sequence or unfolding of the phenotypic presentation, including the full phenotype. Nearly 60 years after its first description, more is known about the pathophysiology of ROHHAD, but the etiology remains enigmatic. The search for a genetic mutation common to patients with ROHHAD has not, to date, demonstrated a disease-defining gene. Similarly, a search for the autoimmune basis of ROHHAD has not resulted in a definitive answer. This review summarizes current knowledge and potential future directions. ROHHAD is a poorly understood, complex, and potentially devastating disorder. The search for its cause intertwines with the search for causes of obesity and autonomic dysregulation. The care for the patient with ROHHAD necessitates collaborative international efforts to advance our knowledge and, thereby, treatment, to decrease the disease burden and eventually to stop, and/or reverse the unfolding of the phenotype."

Unfortunately, none of several mouse models carrying PWS mutations emulates the entirety of the human PWS phenotype, including hyperphagia plus obesity. To determine whether housing at thermoneutrality (TN, 30 °C) permits the development of hyperphagia and obesity in the Snord116del PWS mouse model, the effects of housing three different ages of Snord116del and wild-type (WT) littermates at TN versus room temperature (RT, 22-24 °C) for 8 weeks were compared. Snord116del mice born and maintained at TN exhibited lower body weight curves, lower percentage fat mass, and lower food intake than WT mice at RT. In 4- to 6-month-old high-fat diet-fed female mice, TN raised the Snord116del body weight curve closer to that of RT-housed WT mice although the TN-housed Snord116del mice did not gain more adiposity or exhibit greater food intake. In 6- to 8-month-old high-fat diet-fed male mice, body weight, adiposity, and food intake of TN-housed Snord116del mice remained far below levels in RT-housed WT mice. TN elicited hypotonia in Snord116del adults and exacerbated mortality of Snord116del newborns.

She was subsequently diagnosed with non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) confirmed by genetic analysis. Considering the clinical, biochemical, and genetic findings, hydrocortisone therapy was started to prevent rapid BA acceleration and severe compromission of final height. During infancy, short stature and low levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) for age and gender led to suspicion of growth hormone deficiency (GHD), confirmed by stimulation testing (arginine and clonidine). rhGH therapy was administered and continued until final height was reached. During endocrinological follow up she developed impaired glucose tolerance with positive markers of β-cell autoimmunity (anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, GAD Ab), which evolved over time into type 1 diabetes mellitus and insulin therapy with a basal-bolus scheme and an appropriate diet were needed."

    "abstract": "Taurodontism is a rare dental morphological anomaly characterised by an unusual increase in the vertical height of the pulpal chamber along with an apical displacement of the pulpal floor. The tooth lack constriction at the cementoenamel junction is mimicking a bull tooth. Taurodontism is usually observed as an isolated tooth aberration. However, it can also be associated with specific syndromes such as Down's syndrome, amelogenesis imperfecta, Klinefelter syndrome, Tricho-Dento-Osseous syndrome, Mohr syndrome, Prader-Labhart-Willi syndrome, Ellis van Creveld syndrome and Lowe syndrome. Periodontitis is characterised by microbially associated, host-mediated inflammation that results in loss of periodontal attachment. This case report describes a rare case of non-syndromic generalised taurodontism in a male patient with Stage III Grade C periodontitis. The patient was promptly given periodontal care by root planing and Kirkland flap surgery."

    "abstract": "Interference effect of food and emotional stimuli in Stroop-like tasks for children and adults with Prader-Willi Syndrome. The aim of this work was to study the way items related to food or emotion are processed by a population known to have difficulties with dietary restriction, namely individuals with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). Given the presence of intellectual disability (ID) in PWS, our experiments were designed to examine whether these difficulties were specific to PWS or linked with their ID. Two modified Stroop tasks (i.e., a food version and an emotional version) were administered to seventy-four children (aged between 6 and 16 years old) divided into three groups (one with PWS, one with ID matched on age and Intellectual Quotient (IQ), and one healthy group matched on age) and to eighty-four adults (aged between 18 and 48 years old) distributed in the same three groups. For both tasks, a picture version was used for the children and a word version for the adults. For the food Stroop task, (Experiment 1), materials were composed of low or high-caloric food items and stimuli not related to food. The results show a food Stroop effect for children and adults with PWS that was absent in the group of healthy participants. Moreover, a food Stroop effect was also significant for adults with ID. For the emotional Stroop task (Experiment 2), materials were composed of negative, positive and neutral stimuli. The emotional Stroop effect was also obtained for children and adults with PWS as well as for the healthy group, but not for the age- and IQ-matched group. For the PWS groups, results show a preservation to process positive pictures for children and difficulties to process negative stimuli for both age-groups. These results suggest that people with PWS have difficulties in disengaging their attention when food stimuli are present in their environment and poorer abilities to process negative ones. These difficulties endure in adulthood."

Therefore, the presented study examined total oxidant capacity (TOC), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), the oxidative stress index (OSI), and adipokine levels in 22 non-obese children with PWS during dietary intervention and growth hormone treatment compared with 25 non-obese healthy children. Serum concentrations of TOC, TAC, nesfatin-1, leptin, hepcidin, ferroportin, and ferritin were determined using immunoenzymatic methods. We found that TOC concentrations were higher by 50% (<i>p</i> = 0.006) in patients with PWS than in healthy children, but no significant differences in TAC concentrations were observed between these groups. The OSI was higher in children with PWS than in the controls (<i>p</i> = 0.002). We found positive associations between TOC values and the percentage of the Estimated Energy Requirement, body mass index (BMI) Z-score, percentage of fat mass, and leptin, nesfatin-1, and hepcidin concentrations in patients with PWS. A positive association was also found between the OSI and nesfatin-1 levels. These observations suggest that higher daily energy intake and weight gain may be accompanied by an increasing prooxidant state in these patients. Adipokines such as leptin, nesfatin-1, or hepcidin may also play a role in the prooxidant state in non-obese children with PWS."

    "abstract": "The ketogenic diet is known to be a possible adjuvant treatment in several medical conditions, such as in patients with severe or drug-resistant forms of epilepsy. Its use has recently been increasing among adolescents and young adults due to its supposed weight-loss effect, mediated by lipolysis and lowered insulin levels. However, there are still no precise indications on the possible use of ketogenic diets in pediatric age for weight loss. This approach has also recently been proposed for other types of disorder such as inherited metabolic disorders, Prader-Willi syndrome, and some specific types of cancers. Due to its unbalanced ratio of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins, a clinical evaluation of possible side effects with a strict evaluation of growth and nutritional status is essential in all patients following a long-term restrictive diet such as the ketogenic one. The prophylactic use of micronutrients supplementation should be considered before starting any ketogenic diet. Lastly, while there is sufficient literature on possible short-term side effects of ketogenic diets, their possible long-term impact on growth and nutritional status is not yet fully understood, especially when started in pediatric age."

    "title": "Insulin secretion deficits in a Prader-Willi syndrome β-cell model are associated with a concerted downregulation of multiple endoplasmic reticulum chaperones.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisystem disorder with neurobehavioral, metabolic, and hormonal phenotypes, caused by loss of expression of a paternally-expressed imprinted gene cluster. Prior evidence from a PWS mouse model identified abnormal pancreatic islet development with retention of aged insulin and deficient insulin secretion. To determine the collective roles of PWS genes in β-cell biology, we used genome-editing to generate isogenic, clonal INS-1 insulinoma lines having 3.16 Mb deletions of the silent, maternal- (control) and active, paternal-allele (PWS). PWS β-cells demonstrated a significant cell autonomous reduction in basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Further, proteomic analyses revealed reduced levels of cellular and secreted hormones, including all insulin peptides and amylin, concomitant with reduction of at least ten endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones, including GRP78 and GRP94. Critically, differentially expressed genes identified by whole transcriptome studies included reductions in levels of mRNAs encoding these secreted peptides and the group of ER chaperones. In contrast to the dosage compensation previously seen for ER chaperones in Grp78 or Grp94 gene knockouts or knockdown, compensation is precluded by the stress-independent deficiency of ER chaperones in PWS β-cells. Consistent with reduced ER chaperones levels, PWS INS-1 β-cells are more sensitive to ER stress, leading to earlier activation of all three arms of the unfolded protein response. Combined, the findings suggest that a chronic shortage of ER chaperones in PWS β-cells leads to a deficiency of protein folding and/or delay in ER transit of insulin and other cargo. In summary, our results illuminate the pathophysiological basis of pancreatic β-cell hormone deficits in PWS, with evolutionary implications for the multigenic PWS-domain, and indicate that PWS-imprinted genes coordinate concerted regulation of ER chaperone biosynthesis and β-cell secretory pathway function."

The most common etiology is deletion of the maternal or paternal 15q11q13 region. Methylation is the first line for molecular diagnostic testing; MS-MLPA is the most sensitive test. The molecular subtype of PWS/AS provides more accurate recurrence risk information for parents and for the individual affected with the condition. Management should include a multidisciplinary team by various medical subspecialists and therapists. Developmental and behavioral management of PWS and AS in infancy and early childhood includes early intervention services and individualized education programs for school-aged children. Here, we compare and discuss the mechanisms, pathophysiology, clinical features, and management of the two imprinting disorders, PWS and AS."

In nearly half of the patients, the cause of death is of cardiopulmonary origin. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular (CV) disease in PWS adults is complicated by the behavioral phenotype, reduced ability to express physical complaints, high pain threshold and obesity. To describe the challenges in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of CV disease in PWS adults, in order to increase awareness and improve medical care. Retrospective study of medical records of adults visiting the Dutch PWS reference center. We describe the challenges encountered during diagnosis and treatment of four PWS adults with heart failure. All had pre-existent peripheral edema. CV risk factors in these patients were obesity (n=4), type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=2), hypertension (n=2), hypogonadism (n=3) and sleep apnea (n=2). Remarkably, all patients were younger than 40 years during their first cardiac decompensation. All patients presented with progressive shortness of breath and/or orthopnea and progressive pitting edema. In 117 controls with PWS without CV problems, 31% had leg edema. Diagnosing CV problems in PWS adults is challenging. Peripheral edema is common in PWS adults without CV morbidity, which makes edema in general a poor marker for heart failure. However, when edema is of the pitting kind and progressive, this is a strong predictor of cardiac decompensation. We provide practical recommendations for diagnosing and treating CV problems in this vulnerable patient population."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisystemic genetically determined disorder. Musculoskeletal manifestations are common in most patients. We report the cases of two children with PWS who developed inflammatory arthritis, complicated with chronic anterior bilateral uveitis in one case. To our knowledge, no previous reports of such an association exist. Case 1 was of a 3-year-old girl diagnosed with PWS who developed arthritis of the right knee with morning stiffness, joint swelling, and limited range of motion. Other causes of arthritis were ruled out. Increased inflammatory markers, antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity, and hypertrophic synovitis on ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis compatible with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Despite the treatment with methotrexate, arthritis progressed, and etanercept was added. The patient reached and maintained articular remission while on combined MTX and etanercept treatment during 9 years of follow-up. Case 2 was of a 6-year-old boy diagnosed with PWS who developed arthritis of the right knee. Laboratory investigations showed mildly increased acute phase reactants, microcytic anemia, and ANA positivity at high titer (titer 1:1,280). Infectious and other causes of arthritis were excluded. Ultrasound confirmed the presence of joint effusion and synovial thickening, and synovial fluid analysis was consistent with inflammatory arthrosynovitis (white blood cell count of 14,200/µl) compatible with JIA. Shortly after the diagnosis, the ophthalmologic evaluation revealed the presence of bilateral anterior uveitis. Despite MTX and topical corticosteroid, ocular inflammation persisted and adalimumab was added. At the last follow-up, 9 months later, the child experienced inactivity of arthritis and uveitis with normal growth. We aim to raise awareness of this possible association among pediatricians since arthritis might be underestimated due to high pain tolerance, behavioral disturbances, and other musculoskeletal abnormalities in PWS patients."

    "abstract": "The neurohormone oxytocin (OXT) has been implicated in the regulation of social behavior and is intensively investigated as a potential therapeutic treatment in neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social deficits. In the <i>Magel2</i>-knockout (KO) mouse, a model of Schaaf-Yang Syndrome, an early postnatal administration of OXT rescued autistic-like behavior and cognition at adulthood, making this model relevant for understanding the actions of OXT in (re)programming postnatal brain development. The oxytocin receptor (OXTR), the main brain target of OXT, was dysregulated in the hippocampus of <i>Magel2</i>-KO adult males, and normalized upon OXT treatment at birth. Here we have analyzed male and female <i>Magel2</i>-KO brains at postnatal day 8 (P8) and at postnatal day 90 (P90), investigating age, genotype and OXT treatment effects on OXTR levels in several regions of the brain. We found that, at P8, male and female <i>Magel2</i>-KOs displayed a widespread, substantial, down-regulation of OXTR levels compared to wild type (WT) animals. Most intriguingly, the postnatal OXT treatment did not affect <i>Magel2</i>-KO OXTR levels at P8 and, consistently, did not rescue the ultrasonic vocalization deficits observed at this age. On the contrary, the postnatal OXT treatment reduced OXTR levels at P90 in male <i>Magel2</i>-KO in a region-specific way, restoring normal OXTR levels in regions where the <i>Magel2</i>-KO OXTR was upregulated (central amygdala, hippocampus and piriform cortex). Interestingly, <i>Magel2</i>-KO females, previously shown to lack the social deficits observed in <i>Magel2</i>-KO males, were characterized by a different trend in receptor expression compared to males; as a result, the dimorphic expression of OXTR observed in WT animals, with higher OXTR expression observed in females, was abolished in <i>Magel2</i>-KO mice. In conclusion, our data indicate that in <i>Magel2</i>-KO mice, OXTRs undergo region-specific modifications related to age, sex and postnatal OXT treatment. These results are instrumental to design precisely-timed OXT-based therapeutic strategies that, by acting at specific brain regions, could modify the outcome of social deficits in Schaaf-Yang Syndrome patients."

We present an overview of different progressive patterns of growth that involve controlling weight in PWS. Mechanisms involved in the development of obesity and in preventive and therapeutic strategies to control weight gain are discussed. Early diagnosis, a controlled diet regimen, regular physical activity, follow-up by multidisciplinary teams, and hormonal treatment improved the management of excessive weight gain. In selected cases, a surgical approach can be also considered. Controlling weight in PWS remains a challenge for pediatricians. The importance of consulting different healthcare specialists, starting from the neonatal and pediatric age, is also considered as a crucial approach to controlling weight, as well as to limiting and preventing the onset of obesity and its complications."

Most patients with TS14 develop precocious puberty. Some patients with TS14 are treated with growth hormone (GH). However, evidence for the effectiveness of GH treatment in patients with TS14 is limited. This study describes the effect of GH treatment in 13 children and provides a subgroup analysis of 5 prepubertal children with TS14. We studied height, weight, body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, resting energy expenditure (REE), and laboratory parameters during 5 years of GH treatment. In the entire group, mean (95% CI) height SDS increased significantly during 5 years of GH treatment from -1.78 (-2.52; -1.04) to 0.11 (-0.66; 0.87). Fat mass percentage SDS decreased significantly during the first year of GH, and lean body mass (LBM) SDS and LBM index increased significantly during 5 years of treatment. IGF-1 and IGF-BP3 levels rose rapidly during GH treatment, and the IGF-1/IGF-BP3 molar ratio remained relatively low. Thyroid hormone levels, fasting serum glucose, and insulin levels remained normal. In the prepubertal group, median (interquartile range [IQR]) height SDS, LBM SDS, and LBM index also increased. REE was normal at start and did not change during 1 year of treatment. Five patients reached adult height and their median (IQR) height SDS was 0.67 (-1.83; -0.01). GH treatment in patients with TS14 normalizes height SDS and improves body composition. There were no adverse effects or safety concerns during GH treatment."

Genetic diagnosis of PWS can generally be made within the first few months of life; however, a delayed diagnosis of PWS is frequently reported. Although the clinical characteristics of perinatal and neonatal patients with PWS have been reported, there are no such reports on the clinical characteristics of these patients in Japan. This retrospective, single-center study involved 177 Japanese patients with PWS and their medical data regarding the perinatal and neonatal periods were evaluated. The median maternal age at birth was 34 years; 12.7% of the mothers had a history of assisted reproductive technology (ART). Of the mothers, 13.5% reported polyhydramnios and 4.3% had oligohydramnios. Decreased fetal movement during pregnancy was reported by 76% of the mothers.

In patients with hypothalamic dysfunction, neurobehavioral dysfunction is also often present. Currently, no effective treatment has been found for hypothalamic obesity (HO). We hypothesize that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be an effective treatment for patients with hypothalamic dysfunction, aiming to treat HO as well as the neurobehavioral dysfunction. A systematic search was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases for studies published until May 2022 reporting on DBS for the treatment of HO. Three studies met the predetermined inclusion criteria, with in total six patients treated with DBS for HO, of which five patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and one patient with HO after treatment for craniopharyngioma (CP). Targets of DBS included the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). In patients with PWS, LHA-DBS was associated with a mean increase of Body Mass Index (BMI) (+5.8%), with no change in hormonal levels, results of blood workup, sleep, or neuropsychological evaluation. In the patient with CP, NAcc-DBS was associated with a decrease in BMI (-8.7%) and a subjective increase in mental health, energy and willingness to act, and no feeling of increased appetite. No objective measurements on neurobehavioral function were reported. No severe adverse events were reported in these cases. Mild to moderate adverse events included hypomanic symptoms and infection. All patients with a described follow-up period (<i>n</i> = 5) were able to sustain the treatment for at least 6 months with few interruptions. There is limited research reporting on DBS for HO. The effectiveness differed across studies and the evidence is limited. Although there may be potential for DBS treatment in the severe-refractory condition of HO in patients with CP, more research is needed for target selection and evaluation of effectiveness."

Our aim is to identify the molecular basis of OCA in two families and lay the foundation for prenatal diagnosis. <b>Methods:</b> Four types of OCA-causing mutations in the TYR, <i>p</i>, TYRP1, or SLC45A2 genes were screened. Linkage analysis was performed because the mutations found in the <i>p</i> gene violated the laws of classical Mendelian heredity. Primer-walking sequencing combined with microsatellite and single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis was used to ascertain deletion ranges. Bioinformatics methods were used to assess the pathogenicity of the new mutations. <b>Results:</b> Proband 1 was diagnosed as OCA2 with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) due to a novel atypical paternal deletion (chromosome 15: 22330347-26089649) and a pathogenic mutation, c.1327G>A (Val443Ile), in the <i>p</i> gene of the maternal chromosome. The prenatal diagnosis results for family 1 indicated the fetus was a heterozygous carrier (c.1327G>A in the <i>p</i> gene) with a normal phenotype. Proband 2 was diagnosed as OCA2 with Angelman syndrome (AS) due to a typical maternal deletion of chromosome 15q11-q13 and a novel mutation, c.1514T>C (Phe505Ser), in the <i>p</i> gene of the paternal chromosome. This novel mutation c.1514T>C (Phe505Ser) in the <i>p</i> gene was predicted as a pathogenic mutation. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study has shown clear genotype-phenotype correlations in patients affected by distinct deletions of the PWS or AS region and missense mutations in the <i>p</i> gene.

In the last years, the app Face2Gene proved to be a helpful support for the diagnosis of genetic diseases by analyzing features detected in one or more facial images of affected individuals. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of the app in patients with Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We enrolled 23 pediatric patients with clinically or genetically diagnosed SRS and 29 pediatric patients with genetically confirmed PWS. One frontal photo of each patient was acquired. Top 1, top 5, and top 10 sensitivities were analyzed. Correlation with the specific genetic diagnosis was investigated. When available, photos of the same patient at different ages were compared. In the SRS group, Face2Gene showed top 1, top 5, and top 10 sensitivities of 39%, 65%, and 91%, respectively. In 41% of patients with genetically confirmed SRS, SRS was the first syndrome suggested, while in clinically diagnosed patients, SRS was suggested as top 1 in 33% of cases (p = 0.74). Face2Gene performed better in younger patients with SRS: in all patients in whom a photo taken at a younger age than the age of enrollment was available, SRS was suggested as top 1, albeit with variable degree of probability. In the PWS group, the top 1, top 5, and top 10 sensitivities were 76%, 97%, and 100%, respectively. PWS was suggested as top 1 in 83% of patients genetically diagnosed with paternal deletion of chromosome 15q11-13 and in 60% of patients presenting with maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 (p = 0.17). The performance was uniform throughout the investigated age range (1-15 years). In addition to a thorough medical history and detailed clinical examination, the Face2Gene app can be a useful tool to support clinicians in identifying children with a potential diagnosis of SRS or PWS. • Several genetic syndromes present typical facial features that may provide clues for the diagnosis. • Memorizing all syndromic facial characteristics is a challenging task for clinicians. • Face2Gene may represent a useful support for pediatricians for the diagnosis of genetic syndromes. • Face2Gene app can be a useful tool to integrate in the diagnostic path of patients with SRS and PWS."

The clinical features of this condition include childhood obesity, hyperphagia, infantile hypotonia, hypogonadism, short stature, and characteristic facial features. The leading cause of morbidity and mortality in PWS is hyperphagia and resultant obesity. Here, we highlight the effectiveness of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists by reporting an interesting case of successful rapid weight loss in an adult with PWS using GLP-1 agonists - exenatide and liraglutide. To the best of our knowledge, this report presents the first clinical evidence supporting the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists in the treatment of genetic obesity syndromes; our patient lost a total of 125 lbs on GLP-1 analog and continues to lose weight."

    "abstract": "Growth hormone (GH) therapy can increase linear growth in patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD), Turner syndrome (TS), Noonan syndrome (NS), and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), although outcomes vary by disease state. To assess growth and identify factors associated with growth response with long-term GH therapy. Data from pediatric patients with GHD, TS, NS, and PWS obtained at GH treatment initiation (baseline) and annually for 5 years in the ANSWER Program and NordiNet® IOS were analyzed retrospectively. Height standard deviation score (HSDS) was assessed over time, and multivariate analyses determined variables with significant positive effects on growth outcomes in each patient cohort. Data from patients with GHD (n = 12 683), TS (n = 1307), NS (n = 203), and PWS (n = 102) were analyzed. HSDS increased over time during GH treatment in all cohorts. Factors with significant positive effects on <b>Δ</b>HSDS were younger age at GH initiation and lower HSDS at baseline (all cohorts) and higher GH dose (GHD and TS only); sex had no effect in any cohort. The modeling analysis showed that <b>Δ</b>HSDS was greatest in year 1 and attenuated over consecutive years through year 5. Estimated least-squares mean <b>Δ</b>HSDS values at year 5 by cohort were 1.702 (females) and 1.586 (males) in GHD, 1.033 in TS, 1.153 in NS, and 1.392 in PWS. Long-term GH therapy results in large increases in HSDS in patients with GHD, TS, NS, and PWS. Greater gains in HSDS can be obtained with higher GH doses and earlier initiation of treatment."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder displaying different clinical features, including obesity and bone impairment. LIGHT/TNFSF14 is a cytokine produced by immune cells affecting both fat and bone metabolism. The present study aimed to evaluate LIGHT serum levels in 28 children and 52 adult PWS patients compared to age and sex-matched controls, as well as correlations with parameters of bone and fat metabolism. Median serum LIGHT levels were significantly increased in pediatric PWS with respect to controls [255.82 (284.43) pg/ml vs 168.11 (76.23) pg/ml, p ≤ 0.02] as well as in adult PWS compared to controls [296.85 (895.95) pg/ml vs 134.18 (141.18) pg/ml, p ≤ 0.001]. In pediatric PWS, LIGHT levels were positively correlated with weight-SDS, height-SDS, and glucose levels, and negatively with total 25 (OH) vitamin D, cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Additionally, LIGHT levels were negatively correlated with total BMD and fat mass. In adult PWS, LIGHT levels were positively correlated with weight, HDL cholesterol and PTH, and negatively with glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium, phosphorus, 25(OH)Vitamin D as well as with instrumental parameters of bone and fat quality. Consistently, multiple regression analysis showed that LIGHT serum levels in pediatric and adult PWS were predicted by different parameters including 25 (OH) Vitamin D as well as DXA parameters of bone and fat quality. In PWS children and adults the high levels of LIGHT could represent a marker of the altered bone and fat metabolism."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the profiles of neuroendocrine peptides regulating appetite-mainly nesfatin-1 and spexin-in children with PWS undergoing growth hormone treatment and reduced energy intake. Twenty-five non-obese children (aged 2-12 years) with PWS and 30 healthy children of the same age following an unrestricted age-appropriate diet were examined. Serum concentrations of nesfatin-1, spexin, leptin, leptin receptor, total adiponectin, high molecular weight adiponectin, proinsulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, and total and functional IGF-binding protein-3 concentrations were determined using immunoenzymatic methods. The daily energy intake in children with PWS was lower by about 30% (<i>p</i> < 0.001) compared with the controls. Daily protein intake was similar in both groups, but carbohydrate and fat intakes were significantly lower in the patient group than the controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Similar values for nesfatin-1 in the PWS subgroup with BMI Z-score < -0.5 and the control group, while higher values in the PWS subgroup with BMI Z-score ≥ -0.5 (<i>p</i> < 0.001) were found. Spexin concentrations were significantly lower in both subgroups with PWS than the controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>p</i> = 0.005). Significant differences in the lipid profile between the PWS subgroups and the controls were also observed. Nesfatin-1 and leptin were positively related with BMI (<i>p</i> = 0.018; <i>p</i> = 0.001, respectively) and BMI Z-score (<i>p</i> = 0.031; <i>p</i> = 0.027, respectively) in the whole group with PWS. Both neuropeptides also correlated positively in these patients (<i>p</i> = 0.042). Altered profiles of anorexigenic peptides-especially nesfatin-1 and spexin-in non-obese children with Prader-Willi syndrome during growth hormone treatment and reduced energy intake were found. These differences may play a role in the etiology of metabolic disorders in Prader-Willi syndrome despite the applied therapy."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic disorder with three PWS molecular genetic classes and presents as severe hypotonia, failure to thrive, hypogonadism/hypogenitalism and developmental delay during infancy. Hyperphagia, obesity, learning and behavioral problems, short stature with growth and other hormone deficiencies are identified during childhood. Those with the larger 15q11-q13 Type I deletion with the absence of four non-imprinted genes (<i>NIPA1, NIPA2, CYFIP1, TUBGCP5</i>) from the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 region are more severely affected compared with those with PWS having a smaller Type II deletion. <i>NIPA1</i> and <i>NIPA2</i> genes encode magnesium and cation transporters, supporting brain and muscle development and function, glucose and insulin metabolism and neurobehavioral outcomes. Lower magnesium levels are reported in those with Type I deletions. The <i>CYFIP1</i> gene encodes a protein associated with fragile X syndrome. The <i>TUBGCP5</i> gene is associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and compulsions, more commonly seen in PWS with the Type I deletion. When the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 region alone is deleted, neurodevelopment, motor, learning and behavioral problems including seizures, ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and autism may occur with other clinical findings recognized as Burnside-Butler syndrome. The genes in the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 region may contribute to more clinical involvement and comorbidities in those with PWS and Type I deletions."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder due to lack of genes expression inherited from the paternal chromosome 15q11-q13 region usually from paternal deletions, maternal uniparental disomy 15 or imprinting defect. There are two different nutritional stages reported in an individual with PWS; first stage during infancy marked by feeding and growth difficulties and second stage where hyperphagia starts and leads to development of obesity. However, the exact mechanism of hyperphagia development, from having difficulties in feeding during early years to insatiable appetite after they grow is still unknown and is the focused in this review. The keywords used for literature search such as \"Prader-Willi syndrome\", \"hyperphagia\", \"obesity\", and \"treatment\" were used to create the search strings by using synonyms in order to retrieve the relevant records from PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct. The possible mechanism of hyperphagia can be classed into hormonal abnormalities such as increase in ghrelin and leptin from infancy to adulthood. Low level of hormones was observed in the thyroid, insulin and peptide YY at certain ages. Neuronal abnormalities contributed by Orexin A and brain structure alteration was documented at 4-30 years old. Treatment in the form of drugs such as livoletide, topiramate, and diazoxide could potentially alleviate these abnormalities and make hyperphagia less prominent in PWS. The approaches are important to regulate the hormonal changes and neuronal involvement as potentially controlling hyperphagia and obesity."

Our objective was to compare changes in body mass index (BMI) after metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) for the treatment of obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) in PWS. A systematic review of MBS in PWS was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central, identifying 254 citations. Sixty-seven patients from 22 articles met criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Patients were organized into 3 groups: laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), gastric bypass (GB), and biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). No mortality within 1 year was reported in any of the 3 groups after a primary MBS operation. All groups experienced a significant decrease in BMI at 1 year with a mean reduction in BMI of 14.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (P < .001). The LSG groups (n = 26) showed significant change from baseline in years 1, 2, and 3 (P value at year 3 = .002) but did not show significance in years 5, 7, and 10. The GB group (n = 10) showed a significant reduction in BMI of 12.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in the first 2 years (P = .001). The BPD group (n = 28) had a significant reduction in BMI through 7 years with an average reduction of 10.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (P = .02) at year 7. Individuals with PWS who underwent MBS had significant BMI reduction sustained in the LSG, GB, and BPD groups for 3, 2, and 7 years, respectively.

In PWS, growth hormone treatment is given primarily to improve body composition, yet lean body mass (LBM) does not normalize. Male hypogonadism is frequent in PWS and becomes evident during puberty. While LBM increases in normal boys during puberty, it is not known whether LBM and muscle mass concomitantly increase in PWS during spontaneous or induced puberty. To describe the peripubertal increment in muscle mass in boys with PWS undergoing growth hormone treatment. Single-center, retrospective descriptive study, using data from 4 years before until 4 years after onset of puberty. Primary referral centre for PWS. Thirteen boys diagnosed with genetically proven PWS. The mean age at onset of puberty was 12.3 years; the mean observation period before (after) onset of puberty was 2.9 (3.1) years. Puberty was induced upon pubertal arrest. All boys received internationally standardized growth hormone treatment. Lean mass index (LMI) determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. LMI increased by 0.28 kg/m2 per year before puberty and by 0.74 kg/m2 per year after the onset of puberty. The time before puberty explained less than 10% of the variation in LMI, whereas the time after puberty onset explained about 25%. Boys with PWS showed a recognizable increment in LMI during both spontaneous and induced puberty compared with the prepubertal phase, which was within the trajectories of normal boys. Therefore, timely testosterone substitution in the absence or at arrest of puberty during growth hormone treatment is important to optimize peak LBM in PWS."

This non-interventional, multicenter, cross-sectional French study involved children aged 3-17 years treated with daily growth hormone injections. Based on a recent validated dyad questionnaire, the mean overall life interference total score (100 = most interference) was described, with treatment adherence and QOL, using the Quality of Life of Short Stature Youth questionnaire (100 = best). All analyses were performed according to treatment duration prior to inclusion. Among the 275/277 analyzed children, 166 (60.4%) had only growth hormone deficiency (GHD). In the GHD group, the mean age was 11.7 ± 3.2 years; median treatment duration was 3.3 years (interquartile range 1.8-6.4). The mean overall life interference total score was 27.7 ± 20.7 (95% CI (24.2; 31.2)), with non-significant correlation with treatment duration (P = 0.1925). Treatment adherence was good (95.0% of children reported receiving >80% of planned injections over the last month); it slightly decreased with treatment duration (P = 0.0364). Children's overall QOL was good (81.5 ± 16.6 and 77.6 ± 18.7 according to children and parents, respectively), but subscores of the coping and treatment impact domains were <50. Similar results were observed in all patients independently of the condition requiring treatment. This real-life French cohort confirms the treatment burden of daily growth hormone injections, as previously reported in an interventional study."

    "abstract": "Continual advances in our understanding of the human genome have led to exponential increases in known single nucleotide variants. The characterization of each of the variants lags behind. For researchers needing to study a single gene, or multiple genes in a pathway, there must be ways to narrow down pathogenic variants from those that are silent or pose less pathogenicity. In this study, we use the <i>NHLH2</i> gene which encodes the nescient helix-loop-helix 2 (Nhlh2) transcription factor in a systematic analysis of all missense mutations to date in the gene. The <i>NHLH2</i> gene was first described in 1992. Knockout mice created in 1997 indicated a role for this protein in body weight control, puberty, and fertility, as well as the motivation for sex and exercise. Only recently have human carriers of <i>NHLH2</i> missense variants been characterized. Over 300 missense variants for the <i>NHLH2</i> gene are listed in the NCBI single nucleotide polymorphism database (dbSNP). Using in silico tools, predicted pathogenicity of the variants narrowed the missense variants to 37 which were predicted to affect NHLH2 function. These 37 variants cluster around the basic-helix-loop-helix and DNA binding domains of the transcription factor, and further analysis using in silico tools provided 21 SNV resulting in 22 amino acid changes for future wet lab analysis. The tools used, findings, and predictions for the variants are discussed considering the known function of the NHLH2 transcription factor. Overall use of these in silico tools and analysis of these data contribute to our knowledge of a protein which is both involved in the human genetic syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and in controlling genes involved in body weight control, fertility, puberty, and behavior in the general population, and may provide a systematic methodology for others to characterize variants for their gene of interest."

    "abstract": "Rare autosomal trisomies (RATs) other than common aneuploidies can be detected using noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT). However, conventional karyotyping is insufficient for evaluating diploid fetuses with uniparental disomy (UPD) due to trisomy rescue. Using the diagnostic process for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), we aim to describe the need for additional prenatal diagnostic testing for confirming UPD in fetuses diagnosed with RATs via NIPT and its clinical implications. NIPT was performed using the massively parallel sequencing (MPS) method, and all pregnant women with RATs underwent amniocentesis. After confirming the normal karyotype, short tandem repeat (STR) analysis, methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR), and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) were performed to detect UPD. Overall, six cases were diagnosed with RATs. There was a suspicion of trisomies of chromosomes 7, 8, and 15 in two cases each. However, these cases were confirmed to have a normal karyotype using amniocentesis. In one of six cases, PWS caused by maternal UPD 15 was diagnosed using MS-PCR and MS-MLPA. We propose that in cases where RAT is detected by NIPT, UPD should be considered following trisomy rescue. Even if amniocentesis confirms a normal karyotype, UPD testing (such as MS-PCR and MS-MLPA) should be recommended for accurate assessment, as an accurate diagnosis can lead to appropriate genetic counseling and improved overall pregnancy management."

The study group consisted of patients with Aicardi syndrome, Brugada syndrome, Phelan- McDermid syndrome, trichothiodystrophy, LEOPARD syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Seckel syndrome, trisomy 18 (Edwards' syndrome), Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome, West syndrome, Williams syndrome, 47,XYY syndrome, 16p13 deletion syndrome, and 13q1.3 deletion syndrome. Seven patients (50%) were girls and seven (50%) were boys (mean age, 56.7 ±32.9 months; median [range] age: 45.5 [27-153] months). There were high rates of consanguinity (50%), cesarean section delivery (71%), and hospitalization in the intensive care unit (78.5%). No patients had a family history of immunodeficiency. On admission, all patients exhibited humoral and/or cellular immune system abnormalities. During the follow-up period, all T-cell abnormalities were improved after immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IGRT), while B-cell abnormalities persisted. These findings suggested that the patients predominantly had antibody deficiencies associated with mild T-cell abnormalities because of recurrent infections. The rates of infections and hospitalizations were significantly reduced after IGRT (p < 0.001); the rate of intensive care unit admission also significantly decreased (from 78.5% to 21.4%). Two of the three oxygen-dependent patients exhibited improvement therein. IGRT was discontinued in two patients with significant clinical improvement during follow-up. An immunological evaluation should be considered in pediatric patients with rare syndromes and recurrent infections. IGRT may help to improve the prognoses of these patients."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic condition, which affects one in 25,000 births and results in various phenotypes. It leads to a wide range of metabolic and endocrine disorders including growth delay, hypogonadism, narcolepsy, lack of satiety and compulsive eating, associated with mild to moderate cognitive impairment. Prognosis is especially determined by the complications of obesity (diabetes, cardiorespiratory diseases) and by severe behavioral disorders marked by impulsivity and compulsion. This heterogeneous clinical picture may lead to mis- or delayed diagnosis of comorbidities. Moreover, when diagnosis is made, treatment remains limited, with high interindividual differences in drug response. This may be due to the underlying genetic variability of the syndrome, which can involve several different genetic mutations, notably deletion or uniparental disomy (UPD) in a region of chromosome 15. Here, we propose to determine whether subjects with PWS differ for clinical phenotype and treatment response depending on the underlying genetic anomaly. We retrospectively included all 24 PWS patients who were referred to the Reference Center for Rare Psychiatric Disorders (GHU Paris Psychiatrie and Neurosciences) between November 2018 and July 2022, with either deletion (<i>N</i> = 8) or disomy (<i>N</i> = 16). The following socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded: age, sex, psychiatric and non-psychiatric symptoms, the type of genetic defect, medication and treatment response to topiramate, which was evaluated in terms of eating compulsions and impulsive behaviors. We compared topiramate treatment doses and responses between PWS with deletion and those with disomy. Non-parametric tests were used with random permutations for <i>p</i>-value and bootstrap 95% confidence interval computations. First, we found that disomy was associated with a more severe clinical phenotype than deletion. Second, we observed that topiramate was less effective and less tolerated in disomy, compared to deletion. These results suggest that a pharmacogenomic-based approach may be relevant for the treatment of compulsions in PWS, thus highlighting the importance of personalized medicine for such complex heterogeneous disorders."

They carried monoallelic PPARG variants except a homozygous patient with congenital generalized lipodystrophy. Among heterozygous patients aged 16 or more (n = 24), 92% had diabetes, 96% partial lipodystrophy (median age at diagnosis 24 and 37 years), 78% hypertriglyceridaemia, 71% liver steatosis, and 58% hypertension. The mean BMI was 26 ± 5.0 kg/m2. Women (n = 16) were frequently affected by acute pancreatitis (n = 6) and/or polycystic ovary syndrome (n = 12). Eleven women obtained one or several pregnancies, all complicated by diabetes (n = 8), hypertension (n = 4), and/or hypertriglyceridaemia (n = 10). We analysed perinatal data of patients according to the presence (n = 8) or absence (n = 9) of a maternal dysmetabolic environment. The median gestational age at birth was low in both groups (37 and 36 weeks of amenorrhea, respectively). As expected, the birth weight was higher in patients exposed to a foetal dysmetabolic environment of maternal origin. In contrast, 85.7% of non-exposed patients, in whom the variant is, or is very likely to be, paternally-inherited, were small for gestational age. Lipodystrophy-related PPARG variants induce early metabolic complications. Our results suggest that placental expression of PPARG pathogenic variants carried by affected foetuses could impair prenatal growth and parturition. This justifies careful pregnancy monitoring in affected families."

A retrospective study of all adult patients living with craniopharyngioma referred to the sleep clinic, who received a sleep interview, nocturnal polysomnography, multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT), and 18-h bed rest polysomnography. Their sleep measurements were compared with those of age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Of 54 patients screened with craniopharyngioma, 42 were analyzed, 80% of whom complained of excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep testing revealed that 6 (14.3%) of them had secondary narcolepsy (including one with cataplexy), and 11 (26.2%) had central hypersomnia associated with a medical disorder. Compared with controls, patients were more frequently obese, had a shorter mean sleep latency on MSLT, and slept longer on the first night. There was a nonsignificant trend for patients with (vs. without) narcolepsy and hypersomnia to be younger, to have a higher body mass index, to be more likely to have received radiation therapy, and to have more severe damage to the hypothalamus after surgery. Treatment with stimulants (modafinil, pitolisant, and methylphenidate) was beneficial in 9/10 patients. Nearly half of the patients with craniopharyngioma and sleep disorders have a central disorder of hypersomnolence (narcolepsy and hypersomnia), which should be investigated and lead to considerations beyond sleep apnea syndrome in these obese patients."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare and complex genetic disease, with numerous implications on metabolic, endocrine, neuropsychomotor systems, and with behavioural and intellectual disorders. Rare disease patient registries are important scientific tools (1) to collect clinical and epidemiologic data, (2) to assess the clinical management including the diagnostic delay, (3) to improve patients' care and (4) to foster research to identify new therapeutic solutions. The European Union has recommended the implementation and use of registries and databases. The main aims of this paper are to describe the process of setting up the Italian PWS register, and to illustrate our preliminary results. The Italian PWS registry was established in 2019 with the aims (1) to describe the natural history of the disease, (2) to determine clinical effectiveness of health care services, (3) to measure and monitor quality of care of patients. Information from six different variables are included and collected into this registry: demographics, diagnosis and genetics, patient status, therapy, quality of life and mortality. A total of 165 patients (50.3% female vs 49.7% male) were included into Italian PWS registry in 2019-2020 period. Average age at genetic diagnosis was 4.6 years; 45.4% of patients was less than 17 years old aged, while the 54.6% was in adult age (> 18 years old). Sixty-one percent of subjects had interstitial deletion of the proximal long arm of paternal chromosome 15, while 36.4% had uniparental maternal disomy for chromosome 15. Three patients presented an imprinting centre defect and one had a de novo translocation involving chromosome 15. A positive methylation test was demonstrated in the remaining 11 individuals but the underlying genetic defect was not identified. Compulsive food-seeking and hyperphagia was present in 63.6% of patients (prevalently in adults); 54.5% of patients developed morbid obesity. Altered glucose metabolism was present in 33.3% of patients. Central hypothyroidism was reported in 20% of patients; 94.7% of children and adolescents and 13.3% of adult patients is undergoing GH treatment. The analyses of these six variables allowed to highlight important clinical aspects and natural history of PWS useful to inform future actions to be taken by national health care services and health professionals."

    "title": "A questionnaire-based survey of medical conditions in adults with Prader-Willi syndrome in Japan: implications for transitional care.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisystem disorder with increased mortality predominantly due to obesity-associated complications; therefore, the management of obesity has been centric to therapeutic strategies for PWS. Although a multidisciplinary team approach has been successful for this purpose during childhood, it is generally difficult to implement during adulthood because of the lack of a structured transitional care program. A more detailed understanding of the current medical conditions of adults with PWS is needed to establish this program; however, limited information is currently available on this issue in Japan. Accordingly, we performed a questionnaire-based survey on 425 patients with PWS. There were 162 adult patients aged 18 years or older with median body mass indexes (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of 29.4 and 30.4 in males and females, respectively. The frequencies of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension in adults with PWS were 40.4 and 19.4%, respectively. Growth hormone (GH) therapy during childhood correlated with lower rates of T2DM and hypertension during adulthood. Among adult patients, 54% were treated by pediatricians, whereas 44% were seen by internists with an endocrinologist/diabetologist being the most prevalent. Adult patients treated with GH during childhood showed a higher rate of being seen by pediatricians than those without, demonstrating that the multidisciplinary team approach, typically applied with GH therapy, may be continuously provided even after they reach adulthood. These results emphasize the importance of the seamless provision of the multidisciplinary team approach, which is of clinical importance for establishing an optimal transitional care program for PWS."

    "abstract": "This paper reviews how sleep is impacted in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), focusing on sleep-related breathing disturbances and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Hypothalamic dysfunction may underlie several aspects of the PWS phenotype. Central sleep apnea (CSA) can persist beyond infancy. Nocturnal hypoventilation is common and may occur without central or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Adenotonsillectomy, a mainstay of OSA treatment, may cause velopharyngeal insufficiency. Growth hormone (GH) is considered safe, but close surveillance for OSA remains important. Cardiac autonomic dysfunction occurs during slow wave sleep and may increase the risk of cardiovascular events. EDS and narcolepsy are also common. Modafinil and pitolisant are treatment options currently being studied. Sleep disorders are prevalent in individuals with PWS. Sleep-related breathing disorders present as CSA in infancy and later in life as OSA and hypoventilation. GH therapy has improved the clinical outcomes of patients with PWS, but close surveillance and treatment for OSA is recommended. EDS can persist even after sleep-related breathing disorders are treated, and some individuals may even develop narcolepsy. Early recognition and treatment of sleep-related disorders may prevent morbidity and result in improved survival of patients with PWS."

    "abstract": "We sought to examine the modern surgical treatment of spinal deformity associated with sister imprinting disorders, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS), with emphasis on the specific complications encountered in these patient populations. Fifteen patients with PWS and 5 patients with AS who underwent surgical intervention for spinal deformity between 2000 and 2018 were identified. Postoperative complications were classified using the modified Clavien-Dindo-Sink (CDS) system and further categorized into specific subtypes including excessive drainage, dehiscence, implant failure, infection, and delayed wound healing. Perioperative and final follow-up radiographic data were analyzed. Mean age at surgery was 12.9 years (range, 4-21 years) with mean follow-up of 46.1 months (range, 1-145 months). There were postoperative complications in 17 patients (85%). Ten major complications (CDS ≥ 3) occurred in 9 patients (45%). These included 5 infections requiring reoperation, 1 seroma requiring drainage, 2 severe cervical-thoracic deformities requiring reoperation, 1 implant failure requiring reoperation, and 1 death secondary to fungal sepsis and thromboembolic disease. Eight additional patients (40%) had minor complications (CDS 1 or 2). Eight intraoperative complications occurred in 5 patients (25%), including loss of neuromonitoring signals and cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Surgical intervention for scoliosis in PWS and AS continues to have high complication rates secondary to medical and behavioral comorbidities found in these patient populations. The exact etiology of the high complication rates encountered cannot be definitively stated, but both syndromes frequently present with a number of unique features that may predispose patients to develop surgical complications.

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disease. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide hormone that impacts fear, and social recognition. Intranasal administration of oxytocin can be utilized to treat PWS patients. The results of published trials assessing the effects of intranasal oxytocin in PWS are variable. The current systematic review aims to investigate the efficacy of oxytocin in Prader-Willi patients. We conducted a systematic literature search on Pubmed, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to March 2022 for relevant interventional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the effect of oxytocin in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. We assessed the quality of included trials using the Cochrane tool risk of bias 1. We performed the meta-analysis with Revman software version 5.4. In addition, we visualized our results using forest plots. We assessed the heterogeneity by using the Chi-square test. Relevant to hyperphagia, the data extracted in three studies comprising 92 patients did not show positive outcomes of oxytocin compared to placebo (MD = 0.18; 95% CI: -0.44, 0.80; P = 0.56). Three studies that included 94 patients revealed no significant effects regarding weight between oxytocin and placebo (MD = 0.30; 95% CI: -0.22, 0.83; P = 0.25). The Aberrant Behaviour Checklist found that group-administered oxytocin improved behaviour compared to their counterpart who received a placebo. Oxytocin didn't have significant effects on hyperphagia or weight. To establish the impact of oxytocin in Prader-Willi patients, additional prospective, large-sample randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to avoid controversy."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder produced by a lack of expression of paternally derived genes in the 15q11-13 region. Research has generally focused on its genetic and behavioral expression, but only a few studies have examined epigenetic influences. Prenatal testosterone or the maternal testosterone-to-estradiol ratio (MaTtEr) has been suggested to play an important role in the development of the 'social brain' during pregnancy. Some studies propose the 2D:4D digit ratio of the hand as an indirect MaTtEr measure. The relationship between social performance and MaTtEr has been studied in other neurodevelopmental conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but to our best knowledge, it has never been studied in PWS. Therefore, our study aims to clarify the possible existence of a relationship between social performance-as measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)-and MaTtEr levels using the 2D:4D ratio. We found that, as a group, PWS individuals have shorter index and ring fingers than the control group, but no significant difference in the 2D:4D ratios. The 2D:4D ratio showed a correlation only with Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behavior Subscale, where a positive correlation only for male individuals with PWS was found. Considering only PWS with previous GH treatment during childhood/adolescence (PWS-GH), index and ring fingers did not show differences in length with the control group, but the 2D:4D ratio was significantly higher in the right or dominant hand compared to controls."

The current multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach for PWS focues on morphological MRI (mMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) to uncover brain alterations. This technique offers another perspective to understand potential neurodevelopmental and neuropathological processes of PWS, in addition to specific molecular gene expression patterns, various clinical manifestations and metabolic phenotypes. Multimodal MRI studies of PWS patients demonstrated common brain changes in the volume of gray matter, the integrity of the fiber tracts and the activation and connectivity of some networks. These findings mainly showed that brain alterations in the frontal reward circuit and limbic system were related to molecular genetics and clinical manifestations (e.g., overwhelming eating, obsessive compulsive behaviors and skin picking). Further exploration using a large sample size and advanced MRI technologies, combined with artificial intelligence algorithms, will be the main research direction to study the structural and functional changes and potential pathogenesis of PWS."

    "abstract": "With the increasing worldwide application of the Prechtl general movements assessment (GMA) beyond its original field of the early prediction of cerebral palsy (CP), substantial knowledge has been gained on early neuromotor repertoires across a broad spectrum of diagnostic groups. Here, we aimed to profile the neuromotor functions of infants with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and to compare them with two other matched groups. One group included infants with CP; the other included patients who were treated at the same clinic and turned out to have inconspicuous developmental outcomes (IOs). The detailed GMA, i.e., the motor optimality score-revised (MOS-R), was used to prospectively assess the infants' (<i>N</i> = 54) movements. We underwent cross-condition comparisons to characterise both within-group similarities and variations and between-group distinctions and overlaps in infants' neuromotor functions. Although infants in both the PWS and the CP groups scored similarly low on MOS-R, their motor patterns were different. Frog-leg and mantis-hand postures were frequently seen in the PWS group. However, a PWS-specific general movements pattern was not observed. We highlight that pursuing in-depth knowledge within and beyond the motor domain in different groups has the potential to better understand different conditions, improve accurate diagnosis and individualised therapy, and contribute to deep phenotyping for precision medicine."

    "title": "The Long Way of Oxytocin from the Uterus to the Heart in 70 Years from Its Discovery.",
    "abstract": "The research program on oxytocin started in 1895, when Oliver and Schafer reported that a substance extracted from the pituitary gland elevates blood pressure when injected intravenously into dogs. Dale later reported that a neurohypophysial substance triggers uterine contraction, lactation, and antidiuresis. Purification of this pituitary gland extracts revealed that the vasopressor and antidiuretic activity could be attributed to vasopressin, while uterotonic and lactation activity could be attributed to oxytocin. In 1950, the amino-acid sequences of vasopressin and oxytocin were determined and chemically synthesized. Vasopressin (CYFQNCPRG-NH<sub>2</sub>) and oxytocin (CYIQNCPLG-NH<sub>2</sub>) differ by two amino acids and have a disulfide bridge between the cysteine residues at position one and six conserved in all vasopressin/oxytocin-type peptides. This characterization of oxytocin led to the Nobel Prize awarded in 1955 to Vincent du Vigneaud. Nevertheless, it was only 50 years later when the evidence that mice depleted of oxytocin or its receptor develop late-onset obesity and metabolic syndrome established that oxytocin regulates energy and metabolism. Oxytocin is anorexigenic and regulates the lean/fat mass composition in skeletal muscle. Oxytocin's effect on muscle is mediated by thermogenesis via a pathway initiated in the myocardium. Oxytocin involvement in thermogenesis and muscle contraction is linked to Prader-Willi syndrome in humans, opening exciting therapeutic avenues."

    "title": "Clinical Trials in Prader-Willi Syndrome: A Review.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex, genetic, neurodevelopmental disorder. PWS has three molecular genetic classes. The most common defect is due to a paternal 15q11-q13 deletion observed in about 60% of individuals. This is followed by maternal disomy 15 (both 15 s from the mother), found in approximately 35% of cases. the remaining individuals have a defect of the imprinting center that controls the activity of imprinted genes on chromosome 15. Mild cognitive impairment and behavior problems in PWS include self-injury, anxiety, compulsions, and outbursts in childhood, impacted by genetic subtypes. Food seeking and hyperphagia can lead to morbid obesity and contribute to diabetes and cardiovascular or orthopedic problems. The control of hyperphagia and improving food-related behaviors are the most important unmet needs in PWS and could be addressed with the development of a new therapeutic agent, as currently no approved therapeutics exist for PWS treatment. The status of clinical trials with existing results for the management of obesity and hyperphagia in PWS will be discussed in this review, including treatments such as beloranib, setmelanotide, a diazoxide choline controlled-release tablet (DCCR), an unacylated ghrelin analogue, oxytocin and related compounds, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, surgical intervention, and transcranial direct-current stimulation."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare and multisystemic genetic disorder that is characterized by severe hypotonia, hyperphagia, short stature, and global developmental delay. Although early recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment has been proven to rescue some symptoms and bring additional benefits to PWS patients, studies in patients under 2 years old are scarce. Thus, this study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of rhGH treatment for young children. A total of 96 genetically confirmed Chinese PWS infants or toddlers (47 males) followed between 2013 and 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Sixty-five infants (early treatment group) started rhGH treatment during their first year, and 31 toddlers (later treatment group) started at the age of 1-2 years. Auxological parameters, carbohydrate metabolism parameters, thyroid function, liver function, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and radiographs were acquired before the initiation of the treatment and every 3-6 months thereafter. Height/length, weight, and weight for height were expressed as standard deviation scores (SDSs) according to WHO child growth standards. The mean SDS of length/height in the early treatment group was significantly higher than that in the later treatment group throughout the observation period (all P < 0.001). The change in the length SDS between the two groups at 1 year old and 4 years old was 1.50 (95% CI, 0.88-2.13) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.16-1.10), respectively. Compared to the later treatment group, the weight SDS in the early treatment group increased by 0.94 (95% CI, 0.37-1.52) at 1 year old and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.28-1.39) at 2 years old. No statistical significance was found after 2.5 years of age. No significant differences were observed in IGF-1, incidence of liver dysfunction, hypothyroidism or spinal deformity between the two groups. rhGH treatment improved growth and body composition in infants and toddlers. Furthermore, an early start of rhGH treatment is expected to have more efficacy than the later treatment group without an increase in adverse effects."

We aimed to examine adiposity in children of women with type 2 diabetes from the Metformin in Women with Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy (MiTy) trial, with and without in-utero exposure to metformin, up to 24 months of age. MiTy Kids is a follow-up study that included infants of women who participated in the MiTy randomised controlled trial, receiving either oral 1000 mg metformin twice daily or placebo. Caregivers and researchers remained masked to the type of medication (metformin or placebo) mothers received during their pregnancy. Anthropometric measurements, including weight, height, and skinfold thicknesses, were taken at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. At 24 months, linear regression was used to compare the BMI Z score and sum of skinfolds in the metformin versus placebo groups, adjusted for confounders. Fractional polynomials were used to assess growth trajectories. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01832181. Of the 465 eligible children, 283 (61%) were included from 19 centres in Canada and Australia. At 24 months, there was no difference between groups in mean BMI Z score (0·84 [SD 1·52] with metformin vs 0·91 [1·38] with placebo; mean difference 0·07 [95% CI -0·31 to 0·45], p=0·72) or mean sum of skinfolds (23·0 mm [5·2] vs 23·8 mm [5·4]; mean difference 0·8 mm [-0·7 to 2·3], p=0·31). Metformin was not a predictor of BMI Z score at 24 months of age (mean difference -0·01 [95% CI -0·42 to 0·37], p=0·92). There was no overall difference in BMI trajectory but, in males, trajectories were significantly different by treatment (p=0·048); BMI in the metformin group was higher between 6 and 24 months. Children of women with type 2 diabetes were approximately 1 SD heavier than the WHO reference population. Anthropometrics were similar in children exposed and those not exposed to metformin in utero; hence, overall, data are reassuring with regard to the use of metformin during pregnancy in women with type 2 diabetes and the long-term health of their children.

    "abstract": "Oxytocin (OT) is a neurohormone that regulates the so-called \"social brain\" and is mainly studied in adulthood. During postnatal development, the mechanisms by which the OT system structures various behaviors are little studied. Here we present the dynamic process of postnatal development of the OT system as well as the OT functions in the perinatal period that are essential for shaping social behaviors. Specifically, we discuss the role of OT, in the newborn, in integrating and adapting responses to early sensory stimuli and in stimulating suckling activity. Sensory dialogue and suckling are involved in mother-infant bonds and structure future social interactions. In rodents and humans, neurodevelopmental diseases with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), such as Prader-Willi and Schaaf-Yang syndromes, are associated with sensory, feeding and behavioral deficits in infancy. We propose that in early postnatal life, OT plays a key role in stimulating the maturation of neural networks controlling feeding behavior and early social interactions from birth. Administration of OT at birth improves sensory integration of environmental factors and the relationship with the mother as well as sucking activity as we have shown in mouse models and in babies with Prader-Willi syndrome. Long-term effects have also been observed on social and cognitive behavior. Therefore, early feeding difficulties might be an early predictive marker of ASD, and OT treatment a promising option to improve feeding behavior and, in the longer term, social behavioral problems."

So far, <i>PHIP</i> alterations appear to be a rare cause of DD/ID. \"Omics\" technologies such as exome sequencing or array analyses have led to the identification of distinct types of alterations of <i>PHIP</i>, including, truncating variants, missense substitutions, splice variants and large deletions encompassing portions of the gene or the entire gene as well as adjacent genomic regions. We collected clinical and genetic data of 23 individuals with <i>PHIP</i>-associated Chung-Jansen syndrome (CHUJANS) from all over Europe. Follow-up investigations (e.g. Sanger sequencing, qPCR or Fluorescence-in-situ-Hybridization) and segregation analysis showed either <i>de novo</i> occurrence or inheritance from an also (mildly) affected parent. In accordance with previously described patients, almost all individuals reported here show developmental delay (22/23), learning disability or ID (22/23), behavioral abnormalities (20/23), weight problems (13/23) and characteristic craniofacial features (i.e. large ears/earlobes, prominent eyebrows, anteverted nares and long philtrum (23/23)). To further investigate the facial gestalt of individuals with CHUJANS, we performed facial analysis using the GestaltMatcher approach. By this, we could establish that <i>PHIP</i> patients are indistinguishable based on the type of <i>PHIP</i> alteration (e.g. missense, loss-of-function, splice site) but show a significant difference to the average face of healthy individuals as well as to individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS, OMIM #176270) or with a <i>CUL4B</i>-alteration (Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked, syndromic, Cabezas type, OMIM #300354). Our findings expand the mutational and clinical spectrum of CHUJANS. We discuss the molecular and clinical features in comparison to the published individuals. The fact that some variants were inherited from a mildly affected parent further illustrates the variability of the associated phenotype and outlines the importance of a thorough clinical evaluation combined with genetic analyses for accurate diagnosis and counselling."

    "abstract": "The earlier initiation of growth hormone (GH) treatment for patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) who are younger than 2 years has become more prevalent. Because free thyroxine (FT4) levels are low during this period, GH may induce further reductions; however, limited information is currently available on this issue. Therefore, we herein performed age-dependent and time-course analyses of thyroid hormone levels in GH-treated PWS children. This retrospective analysis included genetically diagnosed PWS patients (N = 37, median age of 26 months). An age-dependent analysis was performed by subdividing subjects based on age [a younger group aged between 1 and 24 months (N = 16) and an older group between 25 and 84 months (N = 21)] and was followed by a multiple regression analysis with adjustments for sex and the cumulative GH dose per bodyweight. A time-course analysis of subjects who had not received levothyroxine during the first 18 months of GH treatment (N = 28) was conducted. A one-month treatment with GH decreased FT4 levels in the older group, but not in the younger group, and this was associated with increases in thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. A positive correlation was noted between age and decreases in FT4 levels independent of the cumulative GH dose per bodyweight. The time-course analysis revealed no changes in FT4 levels in the younger group, while transient decreases were observed in the older group. In conclusion, GH treatment causes age-dependent changes in FT4 levels. This result will help clinicians establish a therapeutic strategy to decide the necessity of levothyroxine supplementation in GH-treated children with PWS."

    "abstract": "Makorin RING finger protein 3 (MKRN3) is an important factor located on chromosome 15 in the imprinting region associated with Prader-Willi syndrome. Imprinted <i>MKRN3</i> is expressed in hypothalamic regions essential for the onset of puberty and mutations in the gene have been found in patients with central precocious puberty. The pubertal process is largely controlled by epigenetic mechanisms that include, among other things, DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides of puberty-related genes. In the present study, we investigated the methylation status of the <i>Mkrn3</i> promoter in the hypothalamus of the female mouse before, during and after puberty. Initially, we mapped the 32 CpG dinucleotides in the promoter, the 5'UTR and the first 50 nucleotides of the coding region of the <i>Mkrn3</i> gene. Moreover, we identified a short CpG island region (CpG islet) located within the promoter. Methylation analysis using bisulfite sequencing revealed that CpG dinucleotides were methylated regardless of developmental stage, with the lowest levels of methylation being found within the CpG islet region. In addition, the CpG islet region showed significantly lower methylation levels at the pre-pubertal stage when compared with the pubertal or post-pubertal stage. Finally, <i>in silico</i> analysis of transcription factor binding sites on the <i>Mkrn3</i> CpG islet identified the recruitment of 29 transcriptional regulators of which 14 were transcriptional repressors. Our findings demonstrate the characterization and differential methylation of the CpG dinucleotides located in the <i>Mkrn3</i> promoter that could influence the transcriptional activity in pre-pubertal compared to pubertal or post-pubertal period. Further studies are needed to clarify the possible mechanisms and effects of differential methylation of the <i>Mkrn3</i> promoter."

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous group of early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders known to be highly heritable with a complex genetic architecture. Abnormal brain developmental trajectories that impact synaptic functioning, excitation-inhibition balance and brain connectivity are now understood to play a central role in ASD. Ongoing efforts to identify the genetic underpinnings still prove challenging, in part due to phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity.This review focuses on parent-of-origin effects (POEs), where the phenotypic effect of an allele depends on its parental origin. POEs include genomic imprinting, transgenerational effects, mitochondrial DNA, sex chromosomes and mutational transmission bias. The motivation for investigating these mechanisms in ASD has been driven by their known impacts on early brain development and brain functioning, in particular for the most well-documented POE, genomic imprinting. Moreover, imprinting is implicated in syndromes such as Angelman and Prader-Willi, which frequently share comorbid symptoms with ASD. In addition to other regions in the genome, this comprehensive review highlights the 15q11-q13 and 7q chromosomal regions as well as the mitochondrial DNA as harbouring the majority of currently identified POEs in ASD."

This is a retrospective case-control, multicenter study. Data were collected among 8 different Italian Hospitals (outpatient clinics), over a period of four years (2016-2020). We included 192 genetically confirmed PWS and 192 CNT patients, aged 3-18 years, matched 1:1 for age, gender, BMI-SDS, Tanner stage, sun exposure, and month of recruitment. No statistically significant differences in 25OHD levels were observed between the PWS population and the CNT (PWS 24.0 ng/mL vs CNT 22.5 ng/mL, p > 0.05), OR = 0.89 (95% CI 0.58-1.35). We observed a slight, although non-significant, reduction in 25OHD levels comparing NW and OB populations. HOMA-IR, puberty onset, genotype and GHT (previous or ongoing) did not show statistically significant correlation with 25OHD levels. Our findings could be useful for clinicians to optimize the therapeutic management as well as to increase awareness of PWS."

    "abstract": "This study longitudinally investigated mental health indicators, body mass index (BMI), and access to school and health-care services in children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and community controls (CC) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The parents of 71 children (34 PWS and 37 CC) aged 6-17 years completed an online questionnaire during the initial COVID-19 lockdown (T0) and the subsequent partial (T1) and full re-opening (T2). We examined access to school and health-care services, BMI, and mental health (DSM-5 Parent/Guardian Rated Cross-Cutting Syndrome Measure) across the three time-points. For BMI and DSM-5 measure, we tested within- (Friedman's ANOVA repeated measures) and between- (robustified linear mixed-models, rLMM) group differences over time. Around 30% of PWS children maintained contact with medical personnel through telemedicine. PWS children kept contact with both teachers and classmates at a lower rate than CC. At all time-points, BMI was higher in PWS than CC. During partial reopening, while children with PWS had a decrease in BMI, CC showed an increase, with a significant interaction time*group interaction. Mental symptoms significantly declined in both groups, although in CC the decrease was greater than in PWS. PWS children were at a disadvantage during the COVID-19 outbreak for lower access to school than CC. The improvement of mental health in both groups with the reopening confirms the importance of social activities outside the family. The decrease in BMI in the PWS group indicates the positive role of caregivers' monitoring on eating habits of children."

    "title": "Chromosomal Microarray Study in Prader-Willi Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "A high-resolution chromosome microarray analysis was performed on 154 consecutive individuals enrolled in the DESTINY PWS clinical trial for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Of these 154 PWS individuals, 87 (56.5%) showed the typical 15q11-q13 deletion subtypes, 62 (40.3%) showed non-deletion maternal disomy 15 and five individuals (3.2%) had separate unexpected microarray findings. For example, one PWS male had Klinefelter syndrome with segmental isodisomy identified in both chromosomes 15 and X. Thirty-five (40.2%) of 87 individuals showed typical larger 15q11-q13 Type I deletion and 52 individuals (59.8%) showed typical smaller Type II deletion. Twenty-four (38.7%) of 62 PWS individuals showed microarray patterns indicating either maternal heterodisomy 15 subclass or a rare non-deletion (epimutation) imprinting center defect. Segmental isodisomy 15 was seen in 34 PWS subjects (54.8%) with 15q26.3, 15q14 and 15q26.1 bands most commonly involved and total isodisomy 15 seen in four individuals (6.5%). In summary, we report on PWS participants consecutively enrolled internationally in a single clinical trial with high-resolution chromosome microarray analysis to determine and describe an unbiased estimate of the frequencies and types of genetic defects and address potential at-risk genetic disorders in those with maternal disomy 15 subclasses in the largest PWS cohort studied to date."

    "title": "Profiles of autism characteristics in thirteen genetic syndromes: a machine learning approach.",
    "abstract": "Phenotypic studies have identified distinct patterns of autistic characteristics in genetic syndromes associated with intellectual disability (ID), leading to diagnostic uncertainty and compromised access to autism-related support. Previous research has tended to include small samples and diverse measures, which limits the generalisability of findings. In this study, we generated detailed profiles of autistic characteristics in a large sample of > 1500 individuals with rare genetic syndromes. Profiles of autistic characteristics based on the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) scores were generated for thirteen genetic syndrome groups (Angelman n = 154, Cri du Chat n = 75, Cornelia de Lange n = 199, fragile X n = 297, Prader-Willi n = 278, Lowe n = 89, Smith-Magenis n = 54, Down n = 135, Sotos n = 40, Rubinstein-Taybi n = 102, 1p36 deletion n = 41, tuberous sclerosis complex n = 83 and Phelan-McDermid n = 35 syndromes). It was hypothesised that each syndrome group would evidence a degree of specificity in autistic characteristics. To test this hypothesis, a classification algorithm via support vector machine (SVM) learning was applied to scores from over 1500 individuals diagnosed with one of the thirteen genetic syndromes and autistic individuals who did not have a known genetic syndrome (ASD; n = 254). Self-help skills were included as an additional predictor. Genetic syndromes were associated with different but overlapping autism-related profiles, indicated by the substantial accuracy of the entire, multiclass SVM model (55% correctly classified individuals). Syndrome groups such as Angelman, fragile X, Prader-Willi, Rubinstein-Taybi and Cornelia de Lange showed greater phenotypic specificity than groups such as Cri du Chat, Lowe, Smith-Magenis, tuberous sclerosis complex, Sotos and Phelan-McDermid. The inclusion of the ASD reference group and self-help skills did not change the model accuracy. The key limitations of our study include a cross-sectional design, reliance on a screening tool which focuses primarily on social communication skills and imbalanced sample size across syndrome groups. These findings replicate and extend previous work, demonstrating syndrome-specific profiles of autistic characteristics in people with genetic syndromes compared to autistic individuals without a genetic syndrome. This work calls for greater precision of assessment of autistic characteristics in individuals with genetic syndromes associated with ID."

The primary end point was change from baseline in hyperphagia using the Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (HQ-CT). Other end points included Global Impression Scores, and changes in body composition, behaviors, and hormones. In DESTINY PWS, a 13-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, 127 participants with PWS aged 4 years and older with hyperphagia were randomly assigned 2:1 to diazoxide choline extended-release tablet (DCCR) or placebo. DCCR did not significantly improve hyperphagia (HQ-CT least-square mean (LSmean) [SE] -5.94 [0.879] vs -4.27 [1.145]; P = .198), but did so in participants with severe hyperphagia (LSmean [SE] -9.67 [1.429] vs -4.26 [1.896]; P = .012). Two of 3 secondary end points were improved (Clinical Global Impression of Improvement [CGI-I]; P = .029; fat mass; P = .023). In an analysis of results generated pre-COVID, the primary (HQ-CT; P = .037) and secondary end points were all improved (CGI-I; P = .015; Caregiver Global Impression of Change; P = .031; fat mass; P = .003). In general, DCCR was well tolerated with 83.3% in the DCCR group experiencing a treatment-emergent adverse event and 73.8% in the placebo group (not significant). DCCR did not significantly improve hyperphagia in the primary analysis but did in participants with severe baseline hyperphagia and in the pre-COVID analysis. DCCR treatment was associated with significant improvements in body composition and clinician-reported outcomes."

    "abstract": "Previous studies in mice have utilized Magel2 gene deletion models to examine the consequences of its absence. We report the generation, molecular validation and phenotypic characterization of a novel rat model with a truncating Magel2 mutation modeling variants associated with Schaaf-Yang syndrome-causing mutations. Within the hypothalamus, a brain region in which human MAGEL2 is paternally expressed, we demonstrated, at the level of transcript and peptide detection, that rat Magel2 exhibits a paternal, parent-of-origin effect. In evaluations of behavioral features across several domains, juvenile Magel2 mutant rats displayed alterations in anxiety-like behavior and sociability measures. Moreover, the analysis of peripheral organ systems detected alterations in body composition, cardiac structure and function, and breathing irregularities in Magel2 mutant rats. Several of these findings are concordant with reported mouse phenotypes, indicating the conservation of MAGEL2 function across rodent species. Our comprehensive analysis revealing impairments across multiple domains demonstrates the tractability of this model system for the study of truncating MAGEL2 mutations."

Intranasal carbetocin, an oxytocin analog, was investigated as a selective oxytocin replacement therapy. To evaluate safety and efficacy of intranasal carbetocin in PWS. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial with long-term follow-up. Twenty-four ambulatory clinics at academic medical centers. A total of 130 participants with PWS aged 7 to 18 years. Participants were randomized to 9.6 mg/dose carbetocin, 3.2 mg/dose carbetocin, or placebo 3 times daily during an 8-week placebo-controlled period (PCP). During a subsequent 56-week long-term follow-up period, placebo participants were randomly assigned to 9.6 mg or 3.2 mg carbetocin, with carbetocin participants continuing at their previous dose. Primary endpoints assessed change in hyperphagia (Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials [HQ-CT]) and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale [CY-BOCS]) during the PCP for 9.6 mg vs placebo, and the first secondary endpoints assessed these same outcomes for 3.2 mg vs placebo. Additional secondary endpoints included assessments of anxiousness and distress behaviors (PWS Anxiousness and Distress Behaviors Questionnaire [PADQ]) and clinical global impression of change (CGI-C). Because of onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, enrollment was stopped prematurely. The primary endpoints showed numeric improvements in both HQ-CT and CY-BOCS which were not statistically significant; however, the 3.2-mg arm showed nominally significant improvements in HQ-CT, PADQ, and CGI-C scores vs placebo. Improvements were sustained in the long-term follow-up period. The most common adverse event during the PCP was mild to moderate flushing. Carbetocin was well tolerated, and the 3.2-mg dose was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in hyperphagia and anxiousness and distress behaviors in participants with PWS. NCT03649477."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to test the effect of a new training programme on emotional competencies, named EMO-T, and to show the value of an integrative developmental approach. This approach postulates that the emotion regulation disturbances commonly observed in neurodevelopmental disorders are the consequence of potential disruptions in the prerequisite emotion skills. This integrative approach is particularly suitable in the case of complex and multidimensional disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a rare genetic disease. We examined the emotion expression, recognition, comprehension, and regulation skills in 25 PWS children aged 5-10 and 50 typically developing children (TD) aged 3-10. After a pre-test session, half of the PWS children participated in the EMO-T programme with their regular therapist for 6 weeks, while the other half continued their usual rehabilitation programme. Two post-test sessions were conducted, one at the end of the programme and one 3 months later. At pre-test, PWS children displayed a deficit in the four emotional competencies (EC). PWS children who participated in the EMO-T programme showed a significant and sustainable post-test improvement regarding voluntary expression and emotion recognition abilities, such that the level reached was no longer different from the baseline level of TD children. They also tended to improve in their emotion regulation, although they received no specific training in this skill. These results support that emotion regulation abilities require prerequisite emotion skills, which should be more fully considered in current training programmes. Because emotion regulation disorders strongly impact all areas of life, an integrative developmental approach appears crucial especially in the case of neurodevelopmental disorders. Further studies should be conducted to explore this perspective."

    "title": "Diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome by targeted nanopore long-read sequencing.",
    "abstract": "The CpG island flanking the promoter region of SNRPN on chromosome 15q11.2 contains CpG sites that are completely methylated in the maternally derived allele and unmethylated in the paternally derived allele. Both unmethylated and methylated alleles are observed in normal individuals. Only the methylated allele is observed in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, whereas only the unmethylated allele is observed in those with Angelman syndrome. Hence, detection of aberrant methylation at the differentially methylated region is fundamental to the molecular diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndromes. Traditionally, bisulfite treatment and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme treatment or methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) have been used. We here developed a long-read sequencing assay that can distinguish methylated and unmethylated CpG sites at 15q11.2 by the difference in current intensity generated from nanopore reads. We successfully diagnosed 4 Prader-Willi syndrome patients and 3 Angelman syndrome patients by targeting differentially methylated regions. Concurrent copy number analysis, homozygosity analysis, and structural variant analysis also allowed us to precisely delineate the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, including gross deletion, uniparental heterodisomy, uniparental isodisomy, or imprinting defect. Furthermore, we showed allele-specific methylation in imprinting-related differentially methylated regions on chromosomes 6, 7, 11, 14, and 20 in a normal individual together with 4 Prader-Willi patients and 3 Angelman syndrome patients. Hence, presently reported method is likely to be applicable to the diagnosis of imprinting disorders other than Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome as well."

The aim of this study was to determine the clinically relevant copy number variants in patients diagnosed with global developmental delay/intellectual disability in our population, using the chromosomal microarray analysis. We analyzed 189 patients diagnosed with global developmental delay/intellectual disability, presented in Clinical Emergency Hospital for Children, Cluj-Napoca. The patients were completely clinically investigated, including dysmorphic and internal malformations evaluation, psychiatric, neuropsychological and metabolic evaluation, standard karyotyping. Genomic analysis was done using chromosomal microarray analysis. Pathogenic findings (including uniparental disomy) and variants of unknown significance were detected in 53 of 189 patients (28.04%). Pathogenic copy number variants and uniparental disomy were observed in 35 of 189 patients (18.51%). Two patients presented uniparental disomy for chromosome 15, one with clinical phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome and the other with clinical phenotype with Angelman syndrome. Within the category of pathogenic findings, the recurrent copy number variants were seen in 21 of 35 patients (60%). The increased percentage of pathogenic structural variants observed in patients with global developmental delay/intellectual disability analyzed by chromosomal microarray technique supports its use in patients with a non-specific phenotype such as these neurodevelopmental disorders. The high percentage of recurrent pathogenic variants between these findings is a finding that support their initial evaluation when a genetic testing algorithm could be a useful option."

    "abstract": "The nonapeptide oxytocin (OT) is a master regulator of the social brain in early infancy, adolescence, and adult life. Here, we review the postnatal dynamic development of OT-system as well as early-life OT functions that are essential for shaping social behaviors. We specifically address the role of OT in neonates, focusing on its role in modulating/adapting sensory input and feeding behavior; both processes are involved in the establishing mother-infant bond, a crucial event for structuring all future social interactions. In patients and rodent models of Prader-Willi and Schaaf-Yang syndromes, two neurodevelopmental diseases characterized by autism-related features, sensory impairments, and feeding difficulties in early infancy are linked to an alteration of OT-system. Successful preclinical studies in mice and a phase I/II clinical trial in Prader-Willi babies constitute a proof of concept that OT-treatment in early life not only improves suckling deficit but has also a positive long-term effect on learning and social behavior. We propose that in early postnatal life, OT plays a pivotal role in stimulating and coordinating the maturation of neuronal networks controlling feeding behavior and the first social interactions. Consequently, OT therapy might be considered to improve feeding behavior and, all over the life, social cognition, and learning capabilities."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisystemic complex genetic disorder caused by the loss of paternally expressed genes in the human chromosome region 15q11.2-q13. It is characterized by severe hypotonia and feeding difficulties in early infancy, followed in later infancy or early childhood by excessive eating and gradual development of morbid obesity. Motor milestones and language development are delayed and most patients have intellectual disability. Here we describe a rare PWS case caused by mosaic imprinting defect in the region 15q11.2-q13 of paternal origin. The proband was a male child with a clinical presentation of global developmental delay and hypotonia with specific facial features. Karyotype of the child was noted as mosaic: 45XY,der(15)?t(15;21),-21[26]/46,XY[24]. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a deletion of 22.7 Mb in size at chr15q11.2q21.1 region and a deletion of 2.1 Mb in size at chr21q22.3 region. The Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification(MS-MLPA) of the 15q11.2-q13 region showed that the loading ratio of methylated alleles was 70% and that of unmethylated alleles was 30%(50% normal), which confirmed that the loss of mosaic imprinted defects in the paternal allele led to the diagnosis of PWS. We propose that complete clinical criteria for PWS should not be considered sensitive in diagnosing partial atypical PWS due to mosaic imprinting defects. In contrast, clinical suspicion based on less restrictive criteria followed by multiple techniques is a more powerful approach."

Polysomnography during the first years of life is performed mainly to rule out sleep-disordered breathing; however, sleep-related movement disorders can constitute a significant contributor to sleep disruption in this age group. Almost no studies have investigated the presence of periodic limb movements during sleep and underlying iron deficiency in infants, especially in those born preterm or with an underlying genetic syndrome. In this retrospective study we included infants 3-24 months referred for polysomnography for snoring or frequent nocturnal awakenings. All children had bloodwork (ferritin and haemoglobin) conducted within 3 months of the overnight sleep study. We studied 79 infants, including 31 (39.2%) full-term without diagnosis, 10 (12.7%) born premature, 16 (20.3%) with Down syndrome, 15 (19.0%) with Prader-Willi syndrome, and the remaining seven (8.9%) had various disorders. Compared with those with Down syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome and full-term infants, those with prematurity showed a statistically significant elevated periodic limb movement index and lower ferritin levels than the other groups. Both ferritin (r = -0.18) and haemoglobin (r = -0.30) were negatively correlated with periodic limb movement index; however, this correlation reached statistical significance only for haemoglobin. Iron deficiency is associated with increased periodic leg movements during sleep in infants. Infants with prematurity had higher periodic limb movement index and lower ferritin levels than infants with Down syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome or without diagnosis."

This study explored the time effect on psychomotor development, anthropometric indexes, and safety for infants and young children with PWS. A phase 3, single-arm, multicenter, self-controlled study was conducted in six sites. Patients received rhGH at 0.5 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day for first four weeks, and 1 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day thereafter for up to 52 weeks. Motor development was measured using Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-second edition, mental development using Griffiths Development Scales-Chinese (GDS-C). Height standard deviation score (SDS), body weight SDS, and body mass index (BMI) SDS were also assessed. Thirty-five patients were enrolled totally. Significant improvements were observed in height, body weight, and BMI SDS at week 52; GDS-C score showed significant improvement in general quotient (GQ) and sub-quotients. In a linear regression analysis, total motor quotient (TMQ), gross motor quotient (GMQ), and fine motor quotient were negatively correlated with age; however, treatment may attenuate deterioration of TMQ and GMQ. Changes in GQ and locomotor sub-quotient in < 9-month group were significantly higher than ≥ 9-month group. Mild to moderate severity adverse drug reactions were reported in six patients. Fifty-two-week treatment with rhGH improved growth, BMI, mental development, and lessened the deterioration of motor function in infants and young children with PWS.

Sixty participants with PWS will be randomised to receive either progressive resistance training (experimental) or non-progressive exercise (placebo control). Participants will be aged 13 to 60 years, be able to follow simple instructions in English and have no contraindications to performing progressive resistance training. The experimental group will complete progressive resistance training two times weekly for 24 weeks supervised by an exercise professional at a community gym. The control group will receive all aspects of the intervention except progressive overload. Outcomes will be assessed at week 25 (primary endpoint) and week 52 by a blinded assessor. The primary outcome is muscle strength assessed using one repetition maximum for upper limb and lower limb. Secondary outcomes are muscle mass, functional strength, physical activity, community participation, health-related quality of life and behaviour. Health economic analysis will evaluate cost-effectiveness. Process evaluation will assess safety and intervention fidelity, investigate mechanism of impact, explore participant experiences and identify contextual factors affecting implementation.

Specifically, studies on autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, cerebral palsy, Angelman syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, Williams-Beuren syndrome, Cri-du-chat syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and West syndrome were searched. The objectives are to review observational and computational studies on the emergence of (pre-)babbling vocalisations and outline findings on acoustic characteristics of early verbal functions. A comprehensive review of the literature was performed including observational and computational studies focusing on spontaneous infant vocalisations at the pre-babbling age of TD children, individuals with genetic or neurodevelopmental disorders. While there is substantial knowledge about early vocal development in TD infants, the pre-babbling phase in infants with neurodevelopmental and genetic syndromes is scarcely scrutinised. Related approaches, paradigms, and definitions vary substantially and insights into the onset and characteristics of early verbal functions in most above-mentioned disorders are missing. Most studies focused on acoustic low-level descriptors (e.g. fundamental frequency) which bore limited clinical relevance. This calls for computational approaches to analyse features of infant typical and atypical verbal development. Pre-babbling vocalisations as precursor for future speech-language functions may reveal valuable signs for identifying infants at risk for atypical development. Observational studies should be complemented by computational approaches to enable in-depth understanding of the developing speech-language functions. By disentangling features of typical and atypical early verbal development, computational approaches may support clinical screening and evaluation."

Prevention and management of obesity, which represents the main cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients, is essential. Ketogenic diet (KD) is used in the treatment of various disorders, however knowledge of its effect in PWS is lacking. The present study assesses the characteristics of patients with PWS who were on KD. This is a retrospective, cross-sectional descriptive study investigating the subjects with PWS, who had received KD for at least 6 months. Ten patients with PWS [median age 52.5 (47-77) months] complied with KD. The median treatment period was 16.5 [11-52] months. Of the daily calorie, 75%-85% were from fat, and 15%-25% from protein + carbohydrate. The baseline body weight standard deviation (SD) score before diet therapy was 2.10 [-1.11-4.11], whereas it was 0.05 [-0.92-1.2] at final evaluation (p = .007). The baseline median BMI SD score before diet therapy was 3.05 [-0.21-3.72], whereas it was 0.41 [-0.87-1.57] at final evaluation (p = .002). The height SD score remained unchanged. Mild hypercholesterolaemia was the most common biochemical abnormality during treatment with KD. Our results indicate that KD might have a favourable effect on weight management in PWS."

To determine whether a presentation of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and progressive neurologic symptoms was caused by uniparental isodisomy, a detailed clinical and molecular characterization was performed. A combination of clinical, molecular, and imaging data was included in this study. We present the case of a 12-year-old boy with a blended phenotype of PWS and hereditary spastic paraplegia type 11 (HSP-<i>SPG11</i>) caused by maternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 15 (UPiD(15)mat) covering a loss-of-function variant in <i>SPG11</i> (NM_025137.4: c.733_734del; p.Met245ValfsTer2). Although symptoms in early childhood including hypotonia, global developmental delay, hyperphagia, obesity, and seizures were consistent with PWS, additional features of progressive spastic paraparesis, parkinsonism, and cognitive decline in later childhood were atypical. Brain MR imaging showed thinning of the corpus callosum and signal abnormalities of the forceps minor, consistent with a \"ears of the lynx\" sign. Exome sequencing confirmed a frameshift variant in <i>SPG11</i> located in the PWS imprinting region on chromosome 15. This case highlights that atypical clinical features in patients with well-described imprinting disorders should lead to investigations for recessive conditions caused by variants in genes that localize to the region of homozygosity, including autosomal recessive forms of HSP."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex neurodevelopmental genetic disorder due to lack of paternal expression of critical imprinted genes in the 15q11.2-q13.1 chromosomal region, generally from a paternal deletion. Predominant features include infantile hypotonia, a poor suck with failure to thrive, craniofacial features, and developmental and behavioral problems including self-injury and childhood onset of obesity. In addition to severe obesity, patients with PWS present with other symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction. We examined the features seen in Prader-Willi syndrome and searched the literature for evidence of autonomic nervous system involvement in this rare obesity-related disorder and illustrative findings possibly due to autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Additionally, we reviewed the literature in relation to childhood obesity syndromes and compared those syndromes to the syndromic obesity found in Prader-Willi syndrome. We report autonomic nervous system-related symptoms associated with childhood obesity impacting features seen in Prader-Willi syndrome and possibly other obesity-related genetic syndromes. We compiled evidence of both an autonomic route for the obesity seen in PWS and other autonomic nervous system-related dysfunctions. These include decreased salvation, sleep disordered breathing, increased pain and thermal threshold instability, delayed gastric emptying, altered blood pressure readings, and pupillary constriction responses as evidence of autonomic nervous system involvement.

    "title": "Do the diverse phenotypes of Prader-Willi syndrome reflect extremes of covariation in typical populations?",
    "abstract": "The phenotypes of human imprinted neurogenetic disorders can be hypothesized as extreme alterations of typical human phenotypes. The imprinted neurogenetic disorder Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) features covarying phenotypes that centrally involve altered social behaviors, attachment, mood, circadian rhythms, and eating habits, that can be traced to altered functioning of the hypothalamus. Here, we conducted analyses to investigate the extent to which the behavioral variation shown in typical human populations for a set of PWAS-associated traits including autism spectrum cognition, schizotypal cognition, mood, eating, and sleeping phenotypes shows covariability that recapitulates the covariation observed in individuals with PWS. To this end, we collected data from 296 typical individuals for this set of phenotypes, and showed, using principal components analysis, evidence of a major axis reflecting key covarying PWS traits. We also reviewed the literature regarding neurogenetic syndromes that overlap in their affected traits with PWS, to determine their prevalence and properties. These findings demonstrate that a notable suite of syndromes shows phenotypic overlap with PWS, implicating a large set of imprinted and non-imprinted genes, some of which interact, in the phenotypes of this disorder. Considered together, these findings link variation in and among neurogenetic disorders with variation in typical populations, especially with regard to pleiotropic effects mediated by the hypothalamus. This work also implicates effects of imprinted gene variation on cognition and behavior in typical human populations."

    "title": "Comparison of Body Composition, Muscle Strength and Cardiometabolic Profile in Children with Prader-Willi Syndrome and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Pilot Study.",
    "abstract": "Syndromic and non-syndromic obesity conditions in children, such as Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), both lower quality of life and increase risk for chronic health complications, which further increase health service utilization and cost. In a pilot observational study, we compared body composition and muscle strength in children aged 7−18 years with either PWS (n = 9), NAFLD (n = 14), or healthy controls (n = 16). Anthropometric and body composition measures (e.g., body weight, circumferences, skinfolds, total/segmental composition, and somatotype), handgrip strength, six minute-walk-test (6MWT), physical activity, and markers of liver and cardiometabolic dysfunction (e.g., ALT, AST, blood pressure, glucose, insulin, and lipid profile) were measured using standard procedures and validated tools. Genotyping was determined for children with PWS. Children with PWS had reduced lean body mass (total/lower limb mass), lower handgrip strength, 6MWT and increased sedentary activity compared to healthy children or those with NAFLD (p < 0.05). Children with PWS, including those of normal body weight, had somatotypes consistent with relative increased adiposity (endomorphic) and reduced skeletal muscle robustness (mesomorphic) when compared to healthy children and those with NAFLD. Somatotype characterizations were independent of serum markers of cardiometabolic dysregulation but were associated with increased prevalence of abnormal systolic and diastolic blood pressure Z-scores (p < 0.05). Reduced lean body mass and endomorphic somatotypes were associated with lower muscle strength/functionality and sedentary lifestyles, particularly in children with PWS. These findings are relevant as early detection of deficits in muscle strength and functionality can ensure effective targeted treatments that optimize physical activity and prevent complications into adulthood."

    "abstract": "Objective: Prader−Willi (PWS; OMIM#176270) syndrome is a clinically distinct genetic disorder, caused by an abnormality in the 15q11-q13 region, referred to as the critical region. One of the most popular concepts existing in modern sciences, not only within psychology, but also in the aspect of all sciences that are related to human life and its course, is the quality of life (QoL). Though it is known that health-related quality of life in children with PWS can be reduced, less is understood about the impact on the family. We aimed to identify factors related to the quality of life of children with PWS and the impact of the disease on family functioning. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey. The subjects were 46 parents of children with PWS. The Computer Assisted Self-Interviewing (CASI) method was used; the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory and the PedsQL Family Impact Module. Results: The PedsQL mean score was 49.0; (min−max: 5.6−90.8; SD = 16.8), with the highest scores in the Emotional Functioning (EF) (EF; 55.9; min−max: 5.0−100.0; SD = 22.0), and the lowest in the Social Functioning (SF) (SF; 42.7; min−max: 5.0−85.0; SD = 18.7) 56.4 (SD ± 14.7). The child’s age does not affect the quality of life, there were no statistically significant (p > 0.05). families have difficulties in performing daily activities (total score 27.6; SD 16.7), support family functioning (total score 28.9; SD 18.8) and effects physical domain (total score 27.7; SD 15.7). Conclusion: Research on the QoL of patients with PWS and their families is very important in order to assess the QoL, but also to provide the perspective of an active change in the perspective of a better treatment process, rehabilitation and communication in society."

    "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisystem genetic imprinting disorder mainly characterized by hyperphagia and childhood obesity. Extensive structural alterations are expected in PWS patients, and their influence on brain nuclei should be early and profound. To date, few studies have investigated brain nuclei in children with PWS, although functional and structural alterations of the cortex have been reported widely. <b>Methods:</b> In the current study, we used T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to investigate alterations in brain nuclei by three automated analysis methods: shape analysis to evaluate the shape of 14 cerebral nuclei (bilateral thalamus, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens), automated segmentation methods integrated in Freesurfer 7.2.0 to investigate the volume of hypothalamic subregions, and region of interest-based analysis to investigate the volume of deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Twelve age- and sex-matched children with PWS, 18 obese children without PWS (OB) and 18 healthy controls participated in this study. <b>Results:</b> Compared with control and OB individuals, the PWS group exhibited significant atrophy in the bilateral thalamus, pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, right caudate, bilateral hypothalamus (left anterior-inferior, bilateral posterior, and bilateral tubular inferior subunits) and bilateral DCN (dentate, interposed, and fastigial nuclei), whereas no significant difference was found between the OB and control groups. <b>Discussion:</b> Based on our evidence, we suggested that alterations in brain nuclei influenced by imprinted genes were associated with clinical manifestations of PWS, such as eating disorders, cognitive disability and endocrine abnormalities, which were distinct from the neural mechanisms of obese children."

    "title": "Adrenal insufficiency in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome.",
    "abstract": "The generalized dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the most likely cause of hypogonadism, inadequate growth hormone secretion, excessive appetite and associated obesity, impaired body temperature regulation, and hypothyroidism. The syndrome is also related to an increased risk of central adrenal insufficiency, although its prevalence remains unknown. The results of the studies in which different methods of pharmacological stimulation were used do not provide conclusive outcomes. As a result, there are no clear guidelines with regard to diagnosis, prevention, or long-term care when adrenal insufficiency is suspected in patients with PWS. Currently, most patients with PWS are treated with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH). It has been confirmed that rhGH therapy has a positive effect on growth, body composition, body mass index (BMI), and potentially on psychomotor development in children with PWS. Additionally, rhGH may reduce the conversion of cortisone to cortisol through inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. However, its influence on basal adrenal function and adrenal stress response remains unexplained in children with PWS. This paper reviews the literature related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction in the PWS patient population with a focus on children."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized by obesity, growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism, and a high prevalence of premature adrenarche despite reported hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction. While idiopathic premature adrenarche is associated with accelerated pre-pubertal growth and advanced bone age, the consequences of elevated adrenal androgens on growth and bone maturation in PWS remain unknown. This study therefore sought to describe age-related changes in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and their effects on growth and bone maturation in PWS. This retrospective observational study included 62 children with PWS. Simple and multiple regression models were constructed to relate age and BMI-SDS with DHEAS levels. Height velocity was compared to age and sex-based norms with t-tests and two-way ANOVA. Patterns in bone age Z-score were examined with two-way ANOVA, and the contributions of age, BMI-SDS, and DHEAS to bone age Z-score were analyzed with multiple regression. DHEAS levels rose earlier and were less strongly correlated with age in males and females with PWS (R<sup>2</sup>=0.12 and 0.30) compared to healthy controls (R<sup>2</sup>=0.89 and 0.88) in a pattern unrelated to BMI-SDS (adjusted R<sup>2</sup>=0.076, p=0.10 for age, and 0.29 for BMI-SDS). Mid-childhood height velocity was increased in males and preserved in females with PWS before declining at the age of expected puberty (p<0.0001). Peri-adrenarchal bone age was advanced in a manner associated with DHEAS but not BMI-SDS (p<0.0001; adjusted R<sup>2</sup>=0.48, p=0.0014 for DHEAS, and 0.78 for BMI-SDS). An obesity-independent increase in adrenal androgens is associated with accelerated mid-childhood growth and bone maturation in PWS."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by hyperphagia, obesity, developmental delay and intellectual disability. Studies suggest dysfunctional signaling of the neuropeptide oxytocin as one of the key mechanisms in PWS, and administration of oxytocin via intranasal or systemic routes yielded promising results in both humans and mouse models. However, a detailed assessment of the oxytocin system in mouse models of PWS such as the Magel2-deficient Magel2<sup>tm1.Stw</sup> mouse, is lacking. In the present study, we performed an automated counting of oxytocin cells in the entire paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus of Magel2<sup>tm1.Stw</sup> and wild-type control mice and found a significant reduction in the caudal part, which represents the parvocellular subdivision. In addition, based on the recent discovery that some astrocytes express the oxytocin receptor (OTR), we performed detailed analysis of astrocyte numbers and morphology in various brain regions, and assessed expression levels of the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein, which was significantly decreased in the hypothalamus, but not other brain regions in Magel2<sup>tm1.Stw</sup> mice. Finally, we analyzed the number of OTR-expressing astrocytes in various brain regions and found a significant reduction in the nucleus accumbens of Magel2<sup>tm1.Stw</sup> mice, as well as a sex-specific difference in the lateral septum. This study suggests a role for caudal paraventricular nucleus oxytocin neurons as well as OTR-expressing astrocytes in a mouse model of PWS, provides novel information about sex-specific expression of astrocytic OTRs, and presents several new brain regions containing OTR-expressing astrocytes in the mouse brain."

    "abstract": "Although scoliosis is commonly seen in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, the patterns and extent of the deformity may change along their growth. Increased body weight is another issue in these patients, and its relationship with scoliosis is still controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate scoliosis in patients with PWS, and its relationship with BMI. This was a retrospective cohort study in which a series of radiographic images and BMI from each patient were collected, and the data were rearranged following the age at which they were recorded. These patients were subsequently labeled as non-Scoliotic (<10°), Moderate (10° - 39°), and Severe (≥40°) according to their final Cobb angle, also as Normal (≤85%), Overweight (86%-95%), and Obese (≥95%) according to final BMI percentage. Thirty-four patients with age from 1 to 20 years old were recruited for this study, and the mean length of follow-up was 6.6 years. The prevalence of scoliosis was 71% (24 patients in Moderate, and 9 patients in Severe), and 65.6% were either overweight (11 patients) or obese (10 patients). The mean BMI percentage in non-scoliotic patients was 93.10 ± 13.84, which was significantly higher than that of the scoliotic groups ( P = 0.0180). When looking at the longitudinal change, the non-Scoliotic group had high BMI since childhood, and obese patients had less spine deformity also from early childhood. In this study, we found that the prevalence of scoliosis in Taiwanese population with PWS was 71% without gender preference. Not every patient had a high BMI, and obese patients seemed to have significantly less chance to develop scoliosis. Level III."

    "abstract": "Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is widely used to screen for common fetal chromosomal aneuploidies. However, the ability of NIPT-Plus to detect copy number variation (CNV) is debatable. Accordingly, we assessed the efficiency of NIPT-Plus to detect clinically significant fetal CNV. We performed a prospective analysis of 31,260 singleton pregnancies, included from June 2017 to December 2020. Cell-free fetal DNA was directly sequenced using the semiconductor sequencing platform for women with high-risk CNV with clinically significant results. Fetal karyotyping and chromosomal microarray analysis (or next-generation sequencing) are recommended for invasive diagnostic procedures. Women at low risk with no other abnormal results continued their pregnancies. We analyzed the expanded NIPT results, diagnostic test results, and follow-up information to evaluate its performance in detecting fetal CNV. Of the 31,260 pregnant women who received NIPT-Plus, 31,256 cases were tested successfully, a high risk of clinically significant CNV was detected in 221 cases (0.71%); 18 women refused further diagnosis; 203 women underwent invasive prenatal diagnosis; and 78 true positive cases and 125 false positive cases, with an overall positive predictive value (PPV) of 38.42% and a false positive rate of 0.40%. For known microdeletion/microduplication syndromes (n = 27), the PPVs were 75% DiGeorge syndrome (DGS), 80% 22q11.22 microduplication, 50% Prader-Willi syndrome, and 50% cri-du-chat. For the remaining clinically significant fetal CNVs (n = 175), the combined PPVs were 46.5% (CNVs > 10 Mb) and 28.57% (CNVs ≤ 10 Mb). NIPT-Plus screening for CNV has certain clinical value. NIPT-Plus yielded relatively high PPVs for 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome and DGS, and low to moderate PPVs for other CNVs."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare congenital disease with genetic alterations in chromosome 15. Although genetic disorders and DNA methylation abnormalities involved in PWS have been investigated to a significant degree, other anomalies such as those in erythrocytes may occur and these have not been clearly elucidated. In the present study, we uncovered slight anemia in children with PWS that was associated with increased red blood cell (RBC) distribution width (RDW) and contrarily reduced hematocrit (HCT) values. Intriguingly, the increased ratio in RDW to HCT allowed sufficient differentiation between the PWS patients from the healthy controls and, importantly, with individuals exhibiting conventional obesity. Further morphologic examinations revealed a significant deformity in erythrocytes and mild hemolysis in PWS patients. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations unveiled compromised membrane skeletal assembly and membrane lipid composition, and revealed a reduced F-actin/G-actin ratio in PWS patients. We ascribed these phenotypic changes in erythrocytes to the observed genetic defects, including DNA methylation abnormalities. Our collective data allowed us to uncover RBC deformation in children with PWS, and this may constitute an auxiliary indicator of PWS in early childhood."

We evaluated the social validity. Both participants improved their social communication skills during online socialisation with partners. Participants with Prader Willi syndrome enjoyed participating in this study. Elderly conversational partners reported a slight decrease in loneliness following online socialisation. The use of textual prompts and constant time delay may be helpful to promote opportunities for interaction among segments of the population potentially at risk of social isolation during online socialisation."

Studies on phenotypical characteristics in TS14 are scarce and patients with TS14 often experience delay in diagnosis, which has adverse effects on their health. TS14 is often characterized as either Prader-Willi-like, Silver-Russell-like or as a Silver-Russell spectrum disorder. This study describes 15 patients with TS14 who visited the Dutch Reference Center for Prader-Willi-like from December 2018 to January 2022. Eight patients had UPD(14)mat and seven a methylation defect. The most common symptoms were intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR) (100%), hypotonia (100%), precocious puberty (89%), small for gestational age (SGA) birth (67%), tube feeding after birth (53%) and psycho-behavioral problems (53%). Median (interquartile range (IQR)) IQ was 91.5 (84.25; 100.0), whilst many patients were enrolled in special education (54%). The median (IQR) fat mass % (FM%) SDS was 2.53 (2.26; 2.90) and lean body mass (LBM) SDS -2.03 (-3.22; -1.28). There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between patients with a UPD(14)mat and a methylation defect. Our patients share a distinct phenotype consisting of IUGR, SGA birth, precocious puberty, hypotonia, tube feeding after birth, psycho-behavioral problems and abnormal body composition with a high FM% and low LBM. Whilst similarities with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) exist, TS14 is a discernible syndrome, deserving a tailored clinical approach. Testing for TS14 should be considered in patients with a PWS or SRS phenotype in infancy if PWS/SRS testing is negative."

This multicentre, randomised, 14-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial followed by a 52-week open-label period, was performed at 12 sites (hospitals, clinics, and universities) in the USA, Canada, the UK, France, and Spain. Patients aged 6 years or older were included if they had a clinical diagnosis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome or Alström syndrome and obesity (defined as BMI >97th percentile for age and sex for those aged 6-15 years and ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for those aged ≥16 years). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a numerical randomisation code to receive up to 3·0 mg of subcutaneous setmelanotide or placebo once per day during the 14-week double-blind period, followed by open-label setmelanotide for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint, measured in the full analysis set, was the proportion of patients aged 12 years or older who reached at least a 10% reduction in bodyweight from baseline after 52 weeks of setmelanotide treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03746522. Between Dec 10, 2018, and Nov 25, 2019, 38 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive setmelanotide (n=19) or placebo (n=19; 16 with Bardet-Biedl syndrome and three with Alström syndrome in each group). In terms of the primary endpoint, 32·3% (95% CI 16·7 to 51·4; p=0·0006) of patients aged 12 years or older with Bardet-Biedl syndrome reached at least a 10% reduction in bodyweight after 52 weeks of setmelanotide. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events were skin hyperpigmentation (23 [61%] of 38) and injection site erythema (18 [48%]). Two patients had four serious adverse events (blindness, anaphylactic reaction, and suicidal ideation); none were considered related to setmelanotide treatment. Setmelanotide resulted in significant bodyweight reductions in patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome; however, these results were inconclusive in patients with Alström syndrome.

The most frequent endocrine disturbances include hypogonadism and growth hormone (GH) deficiency. Hypothyroidism and central adrenal insufficiency can also be observed but are less frequent. The transition of individuals with PWS from adolescence to adult life is challenging because of multiple comorbidities and complex disabilities. Individuals and caregivers face psychological, medical and social issues. This period of profound changes is thus prone to disruptions, and the main risks being the worsening of the medical situation and loss to follow-up of the individuals. Medical care may be poorly adapted to the needs of individuals because of a lack of knowledge concerning the syndrome and also lack of the necessary specific skills. A multidisciplinary panel composed of several experts in PWS met in November 2021 during an European Reference Network on Rare Endocrine Conditions (Endo-ERN) webinar. They presented complementary aspects of PWS from the perspective of the transition including psychiatric, pediatric and adult endocrinological and parent's and patient's points of view and shed light on the best way to approach this pivotal period."

    "abstract": "Imprinting disorders, which affect growth, development, metabolism and neoplasia risk, are caused by genetic or epigenetic changes to genes that are expressed from only one parental allele. Disease may result from changes in coding sequences, copy number changes, uniparental disomy or imprinting defects. Some imprinting disorders are clinically heterogeneous, some are associated with more than one imprinted locus, and some patients have alterations affecting multiple loci. Most imprinting disorders are diagnosed by stepwise analysis of gene dosage and methylation of single loci, but some laboratories assay a panel of loci associated with different imprinting disorders. We looked into the experience of several laboratories using single-locus and/or multi-locus diagnostic testing to explore how different testing strategies affect diagnostic outcomes and whether multi-locus testing has the potential to increase the diagnostic efficiency or reveal unforeseen diagnoses. We collected data from 11 laboratories in seven countries, involving 16,364 individuals and eight imprinting disorders. Among the 4721 individuals tested for the growth restriction disorder Silver-Russell syndrome, 731 had changes on chromosomes 7 and 11 classically associated with the disorder, but 115 had unexpected diagnoses that involved atypical molecular changes, imprinted loci on chromosomes other than 7 or 11 or multi-locus imprinting disorder. In a similar way, the molecular changes detected in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and other imprinting disorders depended on the testing strategies employed by the different laboratories. Based on our findings, we discuss how multi-locus testing might optimise diagnosis for patients with classical and less familiar clinical imprinting disorders. Additionally, our compiled data reflect the daily life experiences of diagnostic laboratories, with a lower diagnostic yield than in clinically well-characterised cohorts, and illustrate the need for systematising clinical and molecular data."

    "abstract": "Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) display developmental delays, cognitive impairment, excessive hunger, obesity, and various behavioral abnormalities. Current PWS treatments are limited to strict supervision of food intake and growth hormone therapy, highlighting the need for new therapeutic strategies. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) functions downstream of hypothalamic feeding circuitry and has roles in energy homeostasis and behavior. In this preclinical study, we assessed the translational potential of hypothalamic adeno-associated virus (AAV)-BDNF gene therapy as a therapeutic for metabolic dysfunction in the <i>Magel2</i>-null mouse model of PWS. To facilitate clinical translation, our BDNF vector included an autoregulatory element allowing for transgene titration in response to the host's physiological needs. Hypothalamic BDNF gene transfer prevented weight gain, decreased fat mass, increased lean mass, and increased relative energy expenditure in female <i>Magel2</i>-null mice. Moreover, BDNF gene therapy improved glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and circulating adipokine levels. Metabolic improvements were maintained through 23 weeks with no adverse behavioral effects, indicating high levels of efficacy and safety. Male <i>Magel2</i>-null mice also responded positively to BDNF gene therapy, displaying improved body composition, insulin sensitivity, and glucose metabolism. Together, these data suggest that regulating hypothalamic BDNF could be effective in the treatment of PWS-related metabolic abnormalities."

    "abstract": "Although acute respiratory infections or diseases such as asthma commonly cause respiratory distress in a pediatric patient, neuromuscular disorders must be considered as a possible etiology in patients with significant hypotonia, neurological deficits, and gross developmental delay. We present a case where a patient's lack of response to initial asthma exacerbation therapy led to a reconsideration of the original diagnosis and adaptation of the management plan. Our patient presented with a rare combination of two congenital disorders that cause hypotonia: Prader-Willi syndrome and Moebius syndrome. This case underlines the importance of considering atypical etiologies in pediatric patients with respiratory distress, while also illustrating the effectiveness of the atypical use of Dornase alfa in a patient with underlying neuromuscular disorders."

    "abstract": "People with rare disorders face significant global health inequalities; the challenge is how to raise awareness and develop a nucleus of experts in a country who are then able to provide guidance to others in that country. The International Prader-Willi Syndrome Organisation (IPWSO) established Project ECHO<sup>®</sup> with the aim of facilitating the sharing of knowledge and the building of international partnerships to reduce global health inequalities for a particular rare genetically-determined neurodevelopmental disorder, Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). Four different ECHO programmes were established for the following groups: (a) Individuals (usually parents) who had taken on a leadership role in their country; (b) health professionals interested in PWS; (c) professional care providers supporting children and adults with PWS; and (d) a Latin American ECHO in Spanish. The programme started in 2020 and an evaluation was undertaken after one year to determine: the extent to which IPWSO had been able to recruit and retain individuals globally; the nature and extent of any benefits gained from the sessions; and examples of how individual involvement in the programme had led to local benefits. The methods included analysing routinely kept process indicators and survey data from the attendees of one component of the programme (the Leadership ECHO), together with a qualitative analysis of survey data and recorded interviews of attendees from countries of differing socio-economic status. We describe the IPWSO ECHO programme and report on the outcomes from the evaluation of one aspect of the programme, the Leadership ECHO. Attendance of the Leadership ECHO sessions was satisfactory, with a mean of 24.7 participants, with participants attending a mean of 5.67 sessions, i.e., 30% of sessions. There was also good global reach, with individuals attending from 34 countries, although there were notable geographic regions with very limited representation. Feedback and interviews demonstrated the positive impact of the programme with some early evidence of positive developments at national level. Families and professionals from countries with a range of expertise and services offered to people with PWS remained engaged throughout the ECHO programme, established networks of support and fostered the development of good practice."

    "abstract": "Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS) is caused by truncating mutations in <i>MAGEL2</i>, mapping to the Prader-Willi region (15q11-q13), with an observed phenotype partially overlapping that of Prader-Willi syndrome. MAGEL2 plays a role in retrograde transport and protein recycling regulation. Our aim is to contribute to the characterisation of SYS pathophysiology at clinical, genetic and molecular levels. We performed an extensive phenotypic and mutational revision of previously reported patients with SYS. We analysed the secretion levels of amyloid-β 1-40 peptide (Aβ<sub>1-40</sub>) and performed targeted metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles in fibroblasts of patients with SYS (n=7) compared with controls (n=11). We also transfected cell lines with vectors encoding wild-type (WT) or mutated MAGEL2 to assess stability and subcellular localisation of the truncated protein. Functional studies show significantly decreased levels of secreted Aβ<sub>1-40</sub> and intracellular glutamine in SYS fibroblasts compared with WT. We also identified 132 differentially expressed genes, including non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as <i>HOTAIR</i>, and many of them related to developmental processes and mitotic mechanisms. The truncated form of MAGEL2 displayed a stability similar to the WT but it was significantly switched to the nucleus, compared with a mainly cytoplasmic distribution of the WT MAGEL2. Based on the updated knowledge, we offer guidelines for the clinical management of patients with SYS. A truncated MAGEL2 protein is stable and localises mainly in the nucleus, where it might exert a pathogenic neomorphic effect. Aβ<sub>1-40</sub> secretion levels and <i>HOTAIR</i> mRNA levels might be promising biomarkers for SYS. Our findings may improve SYS understanding and clinical management."

    "title": "Genetics of Obesity in Humans: A Clinical Review.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is a complex multifactorial disorder with genetic and environmental factors. There is an increase in the worldwide prevalence of obesity in both developed and developing countries. The development of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) has increased the discovery of genetic associations and awareness of monogenic and polygenic causes of obesity. The genetics of obesity could be classified into syndromic and non-syndromic obesity. Prader-Willi, fragile X, Bardet-Biedl, Cohen, and Albright Hereditary Osteodystrophy (AHO) syndromes are examples of syndromic obesity, which are associated with developmental delay and early onset obesity. Non-syndromic obesity could be monogenic, polygenic, or chromosomal in origin. Monogenic obesity is caused by variants of single genes while polygenic obesity includes several genes with the involvement of members of gene families. New advances in genetic testing have led to the identification of obesity-related genes. Leptin (<i>LEP</i>), the leptin receptor (<i>LEPR</i>), proopiomelanocortin (<i>POMC</i>), prohormone convertase 1 (<i>PCSK1</i>), the melanocortin 4 receptor (<i>MC4R</i>), single-minded homolog 1 (<i>SIM1</i>), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<i>BDNF</i>), and the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 gene (<i>NTRK2</i>) have been reported as causative genes for obesity. NGS is now in use and emerging as a useful tool to search for candidate genes for obesity in clinical settings."

    "abstract": "We present a patient with a complex phenotype including diagnoses of Ebstein's anomaly and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) as well as additional congenital anomalies and genetic variants with potential clinical effects. This is the first reported case of both diagnoses present in the same patient. The diagnosis of Ebstein's anomaly was made on prenatal ultrasound. She presented with neonatal hypotonia, feeding problems, and dysmorphic features, followed by later onset weight gain, leading to a diagnosis of PWS. Further evaluations revealed Blaschkoid hyperpigmentation, laryngeal cleft, and pigmentary retinopathy. Whole exome sequencing determined a likely pathogenic variant in alkaline phosphatase gene and several mitochondrial DNA variants. We discuss the known genetic mechanisms of PWS and compare them to the heterogenous genetic associations of Ebstein's anomaly. The standard of care treatment for PWS is growth hormone therapy, which is associated with right-sided heart failure risks. This case illustrates the need to complete the diagnostic work up in all patients, as well as the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach for optimal outcomes."

    "title": "Severity Scoring Cutoff for MLPA and Its Diagnostic Yield in 332 North Indian Children with Developmental Delay.",
    "abstract": "Chromosomal aberrations/rearrangements are the most common cause of intellectual disability (ID), developmental delay (DD), and congenital malformations. Traditionally, karyotyping has been the investigation of choice in such cases, with the advantage of being cheap and easily accessible, but with the caveat of the inability to detect copy number variations of sizes less than 5 Mb. Chromosomal microarray can solve this problem, but again the problems of expense and poor availability are major challenges in developing countries. The purpose of this study is to find the utility of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) as a middle ground, in a resource-limited setting. We also attempted to establish an optimum cutoff for the de Vries score, to enable physicians to decide between these tests on a case-to-case basis, using only clinical data. A total of 332 children with DD/ID with or without facial dysmorphism and congenital malformations were studied by MLPA probe sets P245. Assessment of clinical variables concerning birth history, facial dysmorphism, congenital malformations, and family history was done. We also scored the de Vries scoring for all the patients to find a suitable cutoff for MLPA screening. In our study, the overall detection rate of MLPA was 13.5% (45/332). The majority of patients were DiGeorge's syndrome with probe deletion in 22q11.21 in 3.3% (11/332) followed by 15q11.2 del in 3.6% (12/332, split between Angelman's and Prader-Willi's syndromes). Also, 3.0% (10/332) of patients were positive for Williams-Beuren's syndrome 7q11.23, 1.8% (6/332) for Wolf--Hirschhorn's syndrome 4p16.3, 1.2% (4/332) for 1p36 deletion, and 1% for each trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I 8q23.3 duplication syndrome and cri du chat syndrome. The optimum cutoff of de Vries score for MLPA testing in children with ID and/or dysmorphism came out to be 2.5 (rounded off to 3) with a sensitivity of 82.2% and specificity of 66.7%. This is the largest study from India for the detection of chromosomal aberrations using MLPA common microdeletion kit P245. Our study suggests that de Vries score with a cutoff of 3 or more can be used to offer MLPA as the first tier test for patients with unexplained ID, with or without facial dysmorphism and congenital malformations."

    "abstract": "Based on the genetic contribution, childhood obesity can be classified into 3 groups: common polygenic obesity, syndromic obesity, and monogenic obesity. More genetic causes of obesity are being identified along with the advances in the genetic testing. Genetic obesities including syndromic and monogenic obesity should be suspected and evaluated in children with early-onset morbid obesity and hyperphagia under 5 years of age. Patients with syndromic obesity have early-onset severe obesity associated specific genetic syndromes including Prader-Willi syndrome, Bardet-Biedle syndrome, and Alstrom syndrome. Syndromic obesity is often accompanied with neurodevelopmental delay or dysmorphic features. Nonsyndromic monogenic obesity is caused by variants in single gene which are usually involved in the regulation of hunger and satiety associated with the hypothalamic leptin-melanocortin pathway in central nervous system. Unlike syndromic obesity, patients with monogenic obesity usually show normal neurodevelopment. They would be presented with hyperphagia and early-onset severe obesity with additional clinical symptoms including short stature, red hair, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, pituitary insufficiencies, diabetes insipidus, increased predisposition to infection or intractable recurrent diarrhea. Identifying patients with genetic obesity is critical as new innovative therapies including melanocortin 4 receptor agonist have become available. Early genetic evaluation enables to identify treatable obesity and provide timely intervention which may eventually achieve favorable outcome by establishing personalized management."

    "abstract": "To facilitate the development of new therapies for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), we sought to develop a reliable and valid assessment of anxiousness and distress, common characteristics that have a significant negative impact on individuals with PWS and their families. The PWS Anxiousness and Distress Behaviors Questionnaire (PADQ) was developed with extensive input from clinical experts, as well as caregivers of individuals with PWS, who participated in iterative sets of qualitative interviews. The psychometric properties of the PADQ were subsequently demonstrated in a cross-sectional evaluation using data from the Global PWS Registry provided by > 400 caregivers and confirmed using data from a phase 3 clinical trial of an oxytocin analogue (intranasal carbetocin, LV-101). Qualitative interview participants consistently endorsed the content of the PADQ and were confident they could accurately respond to each item based on their observations of their child's behavior. Analysis of cross-sectional data supported the computation of a total PADQ score, as well as the reliability and validity of the measure. The results of analyses using longitudinal clinical trial data confirmed these properties and provided evidence for the responsiveness of the PADQ, further supporting its appropriateness for the evaluation of new treatments targeting anxiousness and distress in PWS. The current body of evidence supports the conclusion that the PADQ measures observable behaviors that are meaningful to patients and their families and provides a valid and reliable method to assess beneficial treatment effects for some of the most challenging behaviors associated with PWS."

It combines ectopic posterior pituitary stalk interruption and anterior pituitary hypoplasia with hormonal deficiencies. The phenotype is highly heterogeneous and obesity/overweight seems to be underreported in the literature. To identify patients with PSIS and obesity or overweight, describe their phenotype, and compare them with patients with PSIS without overweight/obesity. Sixty-nine children and young adults with PSIS in a Toulouse cohort from 1984 to 2019 were studied. We identified 25 obese or overweight patients (OB-OW group), and 44 were nonobese/overweight (NO group). Then the groups were compared. All cases were sporadic. The sex ratio was 1.6. The main reason for consultation in both groups was growth retardation (61% in OB-OW group, 77% in NO group). History of neonatal hypoglycemia was more common in the OB-OW than in the NO group (57% vs 14%, P = .0008), along with extrapituitary malformations (64% vs 20%, P < 0001). The incidence of caesarean section was higher in the OB-OW group (52%) than in the NO group (23%), although not significant (P = .07). Patients with PSIS who are obese/overweight display interesting phenotypic differences that suggest hypothalamic defects. Studies are needed that include additional information on hormonal levels, particularly regarding oxytocin and ghrelin."

Those with the typical 15q11-q13 Type I deletion compared with the smaller Type II deletion have more severe neurobehavioral problems and differ by the absence of four genes in the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 region. Two of the genes encode magnesium transporters supporting brain and neurological function and we report on magnesium levels in the two deletion groups of PWS participants. We measured baseline plasma magnesium and analyzed data from a PWS cohort with and without the Type I or Type II deletion. Significantly lower plasma magnesium levels were found in PWS participants with the larger Type I deletion and more so with females with Type I deletion compared with females having the Type II deletion, although magnesium levels remained within normal range in both subgroups. Those with PWS and the larger 15q11-q13 Type I deletion were more clinically affected than those with the smaller Type II deletion. Two of the four genes missing in those with the larger deletion code for magnesium transporters and may impact magnesium levels. Our study showed lower magnesium levels in those with the larger deletion which could contribute to neurobehavioral differences seen in the two separate 15q11-q13 deletion subtypes and in addition affect both glucose and insulin metabolism impacting comorbidities but will require more research."

Prader--Willi syndrome (PWS) is one of the most common causes of syndromic obesity with varied clinical manifestations across different lifespan. Herewith, we describe clinical and molecular characteristics of eight PWS who were diagnosed in an obesity clinic of tertiary care hospital. Clinically suspected cases of PWS were screened between January 2014 and January 2022. Detailed history and clinical examination were done to look for typical features of PWS like characteristic facial appearance, short stature, obesity, hyperphagia, delayed puberty or hypogonadism, diabetes mellitus, developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, learning disabilities or abnormal behavior. All were evaluated, with 75 g oral glucose tolerance tests (GTT), HbA1c, Free T4, TSH, LH, FSH, testosterone, and growth hormone level. Intelligent quotient (IQ) of each patient was assessed by a psychiatrist using Binet-Kamat test. Molecular confirmation of clinically suspected PWS was done by either Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) or Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) methods. Based on clinical and molecular characteristics, eight were diagnosed as PWS. Except one, all were male with characteristic facies, mean age of study cohort was 12 years and mean BMI of 44.58. Obesity, short stature, hyperphagia, hypotonia, and mild to moderate mental retardation were noted in entire (100%) PWS study population. All male PWS patients had cryptorchidism, which was bilateral in six patients and unilateral (right undescended testes) in one. Apart from obesity, short stature, other endocrine associations noted were diabetes mellitus in 50% and subclinical hypothyroidism in 37% of PWS. Molecular characteristics of PWS were confirmed by Methylation-specific PCR in seven and by FISH method in one. Prader-Willi syndrome should be kept in mind in case of childhood or adolescent obesity with short stature, hypotonia, cryptorchidism, and developmental delay or cognitive dysfunction. Judicious use of molecular diagnostic testing should be made in all clinically suspected cases. Early diagnosis and appropriate management of this complex disorder by a multidisciplinary team will improve the quality of life and treatment outcome."

Adolescents (n = 31, aged 12-17 years; Tanner stage 2-5) and children (n = 24, aged 6-11 years; Tanner stage <2) with PWS and obesity were included. Patients were randomized 2:1 to liraglutide 3.0 mg (or maximum-tolerated dose) or placebo for 16 weeks, after which placebo was stopped. Liraglutide was continued for 52 weeks. All patients followed a structured diet and exercise program throughout the trial. The coprimary endpoints were change in body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS) from baseline to 16 and 52 weeks. Secondary endpoints included other weight-related parameters, hyperphagia, and safety. Change in BMI SDS from baseline to weeks 16 and 52 was not significantly different between treatments in adolescents (estimated treatment difference: -0.07 at week 16 and -0.14 at week 52) and children (-0.06 and -0.07, respectively). Changes in other weight-related parameters between treatments were not significant. At week 52, hyperphagia total and drive scores were lower in adolescents treated with liraglutide vs no treatment. The most common adverse events with liraglutide were gastrointestinal disorders. Although the coprimary endpoints were not met, changes in hyperphagia total and drive scores in adolescents warrant further studies on liraglutide in this population."

This study assessed the agreement between parents' and clinical researchers' ratings of behavioral problem severity in children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) and chromosome 15 imprinting disorders. The cohort comprised 123 children (64% males), aged 3-17 years, with FXS (n = 79), Prader-Willi (PWS; n = 19), Angelman (AS; n = 15), and Chromosome 15q duplication (n = 10) syndromes. Specific items from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition and Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition mapping to corresponding behavioral domains were selected ad-hoc, to assess behavioral problems. Inter-rater agreement for the cohort was slight for self-injury (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) = 0.12), fair for tantrums/aggression (0.24) and mannerisms/stereotypies (0.25), and moderate for hyperactivity (0.48). When stratified by diagnosis, ICC ranged from poor (0; self-injury, AS and PWS) to substantial (0.48; hyperactivity, females with FXS). The high level of inter-rater disagreement across most domains suggests that parents' and researchers' assessments led to discrepant appraisal of behavioral problem severity. These findings have implications for treatment targets and outcome measure selection in clinical trials, supporting a multi-informant approach."

This retrospective single-center study included all women referred to our fetal-medicine center between 2013 and 2020 after ultrasound detection of isolated bilateral clubfoot. Genetic counseling was offered in which the woman was offered an amniocentesis for CMA and targeted investigation for Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), Steinert's disease and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). 34 women were referred, 18 of them consented to undergo genetic studies by amniocentesis (18/34; 52.9%). Pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) were found in 2/18 (11.1%) of cases. One of these CNVs was directly linked to the clubfoot pathology (a deletion in 5q31.1 containing PITX1 gene). Four fetuses (4/18, 22.2%) had variants of unknown significance (VUS). No PWS, SMA or Steinert's disease was found. No case diagnosed with isolated clubfoot prenatally had additional anomalies postnatally. In the case of bilateral isolated clubfoot detected at the antenatal ultrasound, invasive prenatal testing should be offered, and if accepted, a CMA should be done, as pathogenic variations were observed in up to 11.1% of women who got amniocentesis. The findings of this study do not support the systematic recommendation of molecular studies for PWS, SMA, Steinert's disease."

Hormone deficiencies such as hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, and growth hormone deficiency are common. The combination of hypotonia, low physical activity, and hypogonadism might lead to a decrease in bone mass and increase in fracture risk. Moreover, one would expect an increased risk of scoliosis due to hypotonia and low physical activity. To study the prevalence and risk factors for skeletal problems (reduced bone mineral density, fractures, and scoliosis) in adults with PWS. We retrospectively collected patient characteristics, medical history, medication, biochemical measurements, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans, and spinal X-rays and reviewed the current literature. We included 354 adults with PWS (median age 31 years; 43% males), of whom 51 (14%) had osteoporosis (T-score below -2.5) and 143 (54%) had osteopenia (T-score -1 to -2.5). The most prevalent modifiable risk factors for osteoporosis were hypogonadism, insufficient dairy intake, sedentary lifestyle, and corticosteroid use. Male sex was associated with osteoporosis (P = .005). Growth hormone treatment was not associated with osteoporosis. A history of vertebral fractures was present in 10 (3%) and nonvertebral fractures in 59 (17%). Scoliosis was present in 263 (80%), but no modifiable risk factors were identified. Besides scoliosis, osteoporosis is common in adults with PWS. Based on the literature and the risk factors for osteoporosis found in our cohort, we provide practical clinical recommendations to avoid skeletal complications in these vulnerable patients."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder with an early phenotype characterized by neonatal hypotonia, failure to thrive, and immature genitalia. The onset of hyperphagia in childhood and developmental, physical and neuropsychiatric characteristics indicate atypical brain development and specifically hypothalamic dysfunction. Whether the latter is a consequence of disruption of hypothalamic pathways for genetic reasons or due to a failure of hypothalamic development remains uncertain. Twenty participants with Prader-Willi syndrome, 40 age-matched controls and 42 obese participants underwent structural MRI scanning. The whole hypothalamus and its subnuclei were segmented from structural acquisitions. The Food-Related Problem Questionnaire was used to provide information relating to eating behaviour. All hypothalamic nuclei were significantly smaller in the Prader-Willi group, compared with age and gender matched controls (<i>P</i> < 0.01) with the exception of the right anterior-inferior nucleus (<i>P</i> = 0.07). Lower whole hypothalamus volume was significantly associated with higher body mass index in Prader-Willi syndrome (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Increased preoccupation with food was associated with lower volumes of the bilateral posterior nuclei and left tubular superior nucleus. The whole hypothalamus and all constituent nuclei were also smaller in Prader-Willi syndrome compared with obese participants (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Connectivity profiles of the hypothalamus revealed that fractional anisotropy was associated with impaired satiety in Prader-Willi syndrome (<i>P</i> < 0.05). We establish that hypothalamic structure is significantly altered in Prader-Willi syndrome, demonstrating that hypothalamic dysfunction linked to eating behaviour is likely neurodevelopmental in nature and furthermore, distinctive compared with obesity in the general population."

However, the central neuronal links between hypothalamic oxytocinergic neurons and the autonomic nervous system remain unclear. Here we show that oxytocinergic neurons in the rat paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), a pivotal site for energy homeostasis, innervate sympathetic premotor neurons in the rostral medullary raphe region (rMR) to stimulate brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and cardiovascular functions. Oxytocin receptor stimulation in the rMR evokes BAT thermogenesis and tachycardia. In vivo optogenetic stimulation of the PVH→rMR long-range oxytocinergic pathway, using a virus-mediated system for amplified gene expression in oxytocinergic neurons, not only elicits BAT thermogenic and cardiac responses but also potentiates sympathetic responses evoked by glutamatergic transmission in the rMR. The PVH→rMR oxytocinergic pathway connects the hypothalamic circuit for energy homeostasis to thermogenic and cardiac sympathetic outflow, and, therefore, its defects may cause obesity and impaired thermoregulation, as seen in Prader-Willi syndrome."

    "title": "Linking oxytocin and arginine vasopressin signaling abnormalities to social behavior impairments in Prader-Willi syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder. Global hypothalamic dysfunction is a core feature of PWS and has been implicated as a driver of many of PWS's phenotypic characteristics (e.g., hyperphagia-induced obesity, hypogonadism, short stature). Although the two neuropeptides (i.e., oxytocin [OXT] and arginine vasopressin [AVP]) most implicated in mammalian prosocial functioning are of hypothalamic origin, and social functioning is markedly impaired in PWS, there has been little consideration of how dysregulation of these neuropeptide signaling pathways may contribute to PWS's social behavior impairments. The present article addresses this gap in knowledge by providing a comprehensive review of the preclinical and clinical PWS literature-spanning endogenous neuropeptide measurement to exogenous neuropeptide administration studies-to better understand the roles of OXT and AVP signaling in this population. The preponderance of evidence indicates that OXT and AVP signaling are indeed dysregulated in PWS, and that these neuropeptide pathways may provide promising targets for therapeutic intervention in a patient population that currently lacks a pharmacological strategy for its debilitating social behavior symptoms."

    "title": "Is Hip Medial Ultrasound More Accurate Than Radiography for Determining the Status of Hip Reduction in Children Treated With a Spica Cast? A Retrospective Diagnostic Accuracy Study.",
    "abstract": "Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is the most common hip abnormality in children. Closed or open reduction and cast immobilization are the most commonly used treatments for patients aged 6 to 18 months with dislocation; they are also used in children younger than 6 months when brace treatment is not effective. During cast immobilization, surgeons need reliable and timely imaging methods to assess the status of hip reduction to ensure successful treatment and avoid complications. Several methods are used, but they have disadvantages. We developed and, in this study, evaluated a hip medial ultrasound method to evaluate the status of hip reduction in children treated with a spica cast. Is hip medial ultrasound more accurate than radiography for determining the status of hip reduction in children treated with a spica cast? Between November 2017 and December 2020, we treated 136 patients with closed or open reduction and spica casting for DDH in our department. These children were 3 to 18 months old at the time of surgical reduction and had a specific medical history, physical examination findings, or AP radiographic evidence of unilateral or bilateral DDH. None had a concomitant femoral/acetabular osteotomy procedure in these hips. All patients underwent hip medial ultrasound, AP radiography, and MRI under sedation within 2 to 7 days after open or closed reduction. The examination time was from the second day after reduction to enable the patient to recover from anesthesia. MRI was performed within 7 days after reduction because of a few long appointment times, and ultrasound and AP radiography were always performed 1 or 2 days before MRI. Based on that, 65% (88 of 136 [88 hips]) of patients were excluded due to the absence of MRI, ultrasound, or AP radiography; 3% (4 of 136 [4 hips]) of patients were excluded because of concurrent congenital spina bifida, Larson syndrome, or Prader-Willi syndrome; and 1% (1 of 136 [1 hip]) of patients were excluded because the patient underwent MRI before ultrasound. A total of 32% (43 of 136 [43 hips]) of patients were eligible for analysis in this cross-sectional diagnostic study, and these 43 patients underwent AP radiography, ultrasound, and MRI. In this retrospective study, the mean age at the time of surgery was 10 ± 4 months (male:female ratio 5:38; unilateral DDH: 34; bilateral DDH: 9). To ensure the independence of the results, the study was limited to one hip per patient (in patients with bilateral DDH, the right hip was evaluated). The reduction of 43 hips (left:right ratio 26:17; closed:open reduction ratio 30:13) was evaluated by MRI, hip medial ultrasound, and radiography. Children with spica casts were placed in the supine position, which is necessary to expose the perineum for ultrasound. We used a broad-spectrum, microconvex, and intracavitary probe. The acetabular medial wall was identified by the triradiate cartilage of the ischial tuberosity and the pubis superior, and the femoral head was identified by the femoral neck. Then, the acetabulum coronal midsectional plane was used to determine the positions of the femoral head and acetabulum and to measure the triradiate cartilage-femoral distance. MRI examinations were performed using a 1.5-T MRI system with an eight-channel body coil. Each reviewer evaluated each reduction independently. Additionally, to further assess the hip medial ultrasound method's reliability and reproducibility, we investigated the interobserver and intraobserver agreement in evaluating the reduction using hip medial ultrasound. Using ultrasound or radiography, the reviewers classified hips as reduced, uncertain status, or dislocated. MRI was considered the gold standard for assessing hip reduction, and the reviewers classified hips as reduced or dislocated by MRI. Patients with hips with an uncertain reduction status according to ultrasound or radiography were retained in the analysis. Thus, the test results of radiography and ultrasound were classified into three classifications (positive, negative, or uncertain) in the present study. The test was considered positive or negative when patients were assessed with dislocation or without dislocation, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ultrasound and radiography were calculated and compared. We combined uncertain and positive into the positive classification to be conservative in the statistical choices. The specificity, sensitivity, PPV, and NPV were analyzed based on this premise. Furthermore, a subgroup analysis was conducted by sex. MRI evaluation revealed that 41 hips were reduced and two hips were dislocated. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of ultrasound were 100% (95% CI 16% to 100%), 95% (95% CI 84% to 99%), 50% (95% CI 7% to 93%), and 100% (95% CI 91% to 100%), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of radiography were 50% (95% CI 1% to 99%), 68% (95% CI 52% to 82%), 7% (95% CI 0% to 34%), and 97% (95% CI 82% to 100%), respectively. Ultrasound showed a higher specificity (95% versus 68%; p < 0.001) and PPV (50% versus 7%; p = 0.02) than radiography. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of ultrasound were 100% (95% CI 16% to 100%), 94% (95% CI 81% to 99%), 50% (95% CI 7% to 93%), and 100% (95% CI 90% to 100%), respectively, for female patients (with only five male patients, we could not perform these analyses in this group). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of radiography were 50% (95% CI 1% to 99%), 64% (95% CI 46% to 79%), 7% (95% CI 0% to 34%), and 96% (95% CI 79% to 100%), respectively, for female patients. The κ values for intra- and interobserver reliability both were 1.0. Hip medial ultrasound can directly visualize the femoral head and acetabulum. Hip medial ultrasound is more reliable than radiography as a preliminary evaluation method and does not involve irradiation. We recommend using hip medial ultrasound during outpatient follow-up visits for patients younger than 2 years treated with hip reduction and cast immobilization. Level III, diagnostic study."

    "abstract": "Mutations and aberrant gene expression during cellular differentiation lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), which results from the deletion of an imprinted locus on paternally inherited chromosome 15. We analyzed chromatin-associated RNA in human induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) upon depletion of hybrid small nucleolar long non-coding RNAs (sno-lncRNAs) and 5' snoRNA capped and polyadenylated long non-coding RNAs (SPA-lncRNAs) transcribed from the locus deleted in PWS. We found that rapid ablation of these lncRNAs affects transcription of specific gene classes. Downregulated genes contribute to neurodevelopment and neuronal maintenance, while upregulated genes are predominantly involved in the negative regulation of cellular metabolism and apoptotic processes. Our data reveal the importance of SPA-lncRNAs and sno-lncRNAs in controlling gene expression in iPSCs and provide a platform for synthetic experimental approaches in PWS studies. We conclude that ncRNAs transcribed from the PWS locus are critical regulators of a transcriptional signature, which is important for neuronal differentiation and development."

The purpose of this study was to learn about the experiences of parents regarding disclosing information to their children with genetic conditions. A questionnaire was sent to 378 parents of children and adolescents with the following genetic syndromes: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, Kabuki syndrome, Williams syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Sotos syndrome. Findings were analyzed using descriptive statistics for multiple-choice questions. Of the parents surveyed, 158 (41.8%) responded to the questionnaires. The average age of children with genetic syndromes was 12 years. Sixty-seven parents had disclosed relevant information to their children, whereas 91 had not. Among them (who had disclosed information), out of 53 respondents who answered that their affected child had siblings, 50 had disclosed the genetic condition of the affected child to the siblings as well. Sixty-eight out of 91 respondents who had not told information to affected child were planning to disclose the information in the future. Many respondents who had disclosed information did not regret this. They felt good talking about genetic conditions, and had talked about genetic conditions with the affected children following disclosure. This study contributed to our understanding of the attitudes of parents towards disclosing information to children with genetic syndromes."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic multisystemic disease that is the most common inherited cause of severe childhood obesity. PWS patients are prone to significant oral and systemic health issues that detrimentally affect quality of life and decrease longevity. This report documents full-mouth pre-prosthetic surgical and restorative care in an adult PWS patient. The patient, a 29-year-old male, presented to the clinic accompanied by his guardians (parents) with the chief complaint that \"My Teeth are breaking down and I would like to get them fixed\". Periodontal and prosthetic comprehensive clinical and radiographic exams revealed a severely worn dentition, deep anterior overbite, altered passive eruption with generalized biofilm-induced gingivitis, and altered occlusal vertical dimension. Full mouth crown lengthening surgery combined with full mouth prosthodontic reconstruction was performed under parenteral sedation and local anesthesia. Completion of treatment was successful, and the patient was placed on a 3-month periodontal maintenance interval. Full mouth periodontal surgical and prosthodontic reconstruction on a PWS patient has not previously been reported in the literature. This case underscores the potential need for complex dental care in patients with this syndrome."

    "abstract": "To describe the clinical presentation and long-term clinical features of a molecularly confirmed cohort with Cohen syndrome. Twelve patients with Cohen syndrome aged 0.2-13.9 years from 8 families with a median follow-up of 7 years were enrolled to the study. Genetic analyses were made by VPS13B and whole-exome sequencing analyses. Biallelic VPS13B variants, including 3 nonsense, 1 frameshift, and 1 splice-site variant, and a multiexon deletion were detected. Prader-Willi syndrome-like features such as hypotonia, small hands, round face with full cheeks, almond-shaped eyes, and micrognathia were observed in all infantile patients. Beginning from age 4 years, it was noticed that the face gradually elongated and became oval. The typical facial features of Cohen syndrome such as a long face, beak-shaped nose, and open-mouth appearance with prominent upper central incisors became evident at age 9. Other Cohen syndrome features including retinopathy (11/11), neutropenia (11/12), truncal obesity (5/12), and myopia (5/11) were detected at the median ages of 7.8, 7, 7.5, and 5 years, respectively. Eleven patients aged older than 5 years at their last examination had severe speech delay. A differential diagnosis of Cohen syndrome in the infancy should be made with Prader-Willi syndrome, and that the typical facial features for Cohen syndrome is prominent at age 9 years, when retinopathy, neutropenia, and truncal obesity become evident. Moreover, adding the severe speech delay to the diagnostic criteria should be considered."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare and complex genetic disorder with multiple effects on the metabolic, endocrine, and neurological systems, as well as behavioral and intellectual difficulties. Despite advances in understanding the genetic basis of obesity in PWS, there are conflicting data on its management. Therefore, the present manuscript aims to provide an update on the nutritional treatment and pharmacological approach in adult patients with PWS. The management of obesity in patients with PWS is challenging and requires the cooperation of an experienced multidisciplinary team, including the nutritionist. An adequate clinical evaluation including nutritional and biochemical parameters should be performed to tailor the best therapeutic strategy. Both lifestyle and pharmacological interventions may represent useful strategies to prevent the high rate of morbidity and mortality related to PWS. The use of bariatric surgery is still controversial. Although it is imperative to adopt an obesity prevention strategy in childhood, there is promising evidence for the treatment of obesity in adulthood with current obesity medications in conjunction with lifestyle interventions."

    "abstract": "The behavioural phenotype of Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) implies a specific emotional and social-interactive burden for the caregivers of the individuals with PWS. The aim of the study was to perform an in-depth exploratory analysis of experiences of the familial caregivers of individuals with PWS. The study was carried out using a sociological methodology of the grounded theory (qualitative research). A purposively selected sample of 20 familial caregivers of children/adults with PWS was invited to take part in individual, semi-structured in-depth interviews which included questions pertaining to coping with problems arising from the condition, including its impact on social interactions, as well as to the meanings of PWS. The core category emerging from our analysis emphasized \"experiencing PWS as a crisis\". The phases in the process of experiencing PWS were specified, each of which is characterised by specific cognitive, emotional and social problems, implying relevant requirements in the care of individuals with PWS. I. Crisis in response to the diagnosis; II. Crisis in response to lack of control over the hunger of individuals with PWS; III. Crisis in response to the social milieu's failure to understand the nature of the condition; IV. Crisis in response to attempts to plan the future of individuals with PWS. The specificity of the PWS caregiver's experience is primarily determined by the need to reconstruct the entire family's lifestyle. The experiences of caregivers of PWS persons, at the time when they were available for study, had the characteristics of crisis. Moreover the psychosocial consequences of PWS were not subject to normalization and attempts to attribute any meaningful existential sense to the PWS were ineffective in the time period under scrutiny. Identifying phases of the PWS experience process from the perspective of the caregivers of individuals with PWS may be used to profile interventions supporting PWS individuals' families in a manner corresponding to the flow of the illness experience."

    "abstract": "Adenotonsillar hypertrophy is the most common pathogenetic contributor to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in childhood, and adenotonsillectomy is the standard initial treatment. Here, we summarize the most recent evidence on the efficacy and complications of adenotonsillectomy and explore knowledge gaps in clinical management. Favorable adenotonsillectomy effects have been reported in children with very severe OSAS [apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;20 episodes/h] and extremely severe OSAS (AHI &gt;100 episodes/h), without postoperative mortality, need for endotracheal intubation, prolonged hospital stay or re-admission after hospital discharge. However, the risk of residual OSAS after adenotonsillectomy, which may reach 30-60%, has not been thoroughly established. Behavior, OSAS-related symptoms and quality of life improve postoperatively even in children with AHI 1-5 episodes/h. Natural history of enuresis resolution is accelerated postadenotonsillectomy and office-based systemic blood pressure is decreased in OSAS and hypertension. However, which children younger than 2 years should undergo adenotonsillectomy instead of adenoidectomy only to prevent recurrence of OSAS symptoms and revision surgery remains unclear. Adenotonsillectomy in children with Prader-Willi syndrome is frequently accompanied by postoperative residual OSAS while complications are not uncommon. In the last 2 years, several studies have provided evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of adenotonsillectomy as treatment intervention for otherwise healthy children with OSAS."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder based on a loss of paternally expressed genes in chromosome segment 15q11-13. Behavioral traits such as temper outbursts, stereotypic, and ritualistic behavior, as well as an increased risk of psychosis accompany the syndrome, representing a major issue in the treatment of adults with PWS. Up to now, no treatment guideline for these conditions in PWS exist. This study aimed to retrospectively analyze the effect and adverse effects of treatment with aripiprazole for temper outbursts in 10 adults with PWS. Aripiprazole was prescribed for temper outbursts (n = 10). Treatment outcome was assessed using the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and -Improvement Scale (CGI-I). Treatment success (CGI-I < 3) was observed in 70% of cases, with adverse effects from mild to partly serious extent in 60% of cases. The major adverse effect observed was increased daytime sleepiness. In total, 50% of the individuals were treated successfully for temper outbursts. The BMI did not change significantly in the successfully treated group after 6 months of treatment. Aripiprazole can be a treatment option for temper outbursts in people with PWS. Although a high rate of side effects was detected, their severity led to discontinuation in only 20% of the cases. Furthermore, the absence of weight gain makes aripiprazole interesting especially for the PWS population."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) in infants is characterized by hypotonia and poor sucking with feeding difficulties. Two autopsy cases of sudden unexpected death during sleep after tube feeding are described herein. For one, gastric aspiration caused by the possible milk regurgitation was suspected. Immunohistochemical examination of lung sections was performed using three antibodies to human α-lactalbumin, human gross cystic disease fluid protein 15, and cow whey β-lactoglobulin. Five cases of sudden unexpected infant death occurring earlier than at 6 months old were selected as controls. Marked immune-staining for infant formula in one PWS subject was evident within terminal bronchioles and alveoli with granular and amorphous features. However, no positive staining was apparent in the other subject, who exhibited contrasting features in milk distribution. Among control cases, one showed mild staining in the bronchiole, but the others did not. The antibody to β-lactoglobulin reacted specifically with formula, with no nonspecific background. Gastric contents in the airway can be a difficult issue because of the consequent terminal gasping. However, because of an episode of antemortem symptoms of potential regurgitation, and from findings at autopsy such as petechiae, we inferred that fatal regurgitation occurred in this PWS infant after tube feeding. Several clinical reports have described milk aspiration, but this pathological report is the first related to aspiration in PWS during tube feeding."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic imprinting disorder that is characterized by obesity, short stature, and hypogonadism. Hypogonadism is characterized by normal luteinizing hormone (LH), high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), low testosterone, low inhibin B, and relatively low anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). Only a few cases of central precocious puberty (CPP) have been reported in PWS, and follow-up for CPP with PWS is not established. Hence, we present a boy with PWS accompanied by CPP. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) therapy was started at 7 years of age, CPP was adequately arrested, and GnRHa therapy was discontinued at 11.3 years of age. Growth hormone (GH) therapy was started at 12 years of age due to inadequate growth. He grew close to his final height, and his testes developed with normal LH, increased FSH, normal testosterone, and reduced AMH corresponding to puberty at 13.5 years of age. The features of 16 patients with PWS with CPP, including our patient, were summarized. Out of seven male patients, five were treated with GnRHa, as well as four out of nine female patients. Out of 16 patients, 6 were assessed with pubertal development over 13 years of age. Pubertal development was considered to be restored in four patients who had GnRHa therapy discontinuation. We should carefully follow-up on pubertal development in CPP. GnRHa therapy is useful for adequate puberty blockage, and pubertal development could be restored with GnRHa therapy discontinuation. Pubertal development in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) varies from hypogonadism to precocious puberty. Pubertal development assessment based on clinical features and hormone levels is needed in central precocious puberty (CPP) treatment with PWS. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) therapy is useful for CPP with PWS, and pubertal development can be restored with GnRHa therapy discontinuation."

Facial images of 15 Caucasian adult individuals with PWS (8 males, 42 ± 5 years; 7 females, 37 ± 8 years; BMI 38.87 ± 8.92 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were acquired through stereophotogrammetry. From the 3D coordinates of 38 landmarks, linear distances and angles were calculated; they were expressed as z-score values by referring to 403 healthy subjects matched for age and sex and compared by Student's <i>t</i>-test with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Patients underwent auxological and biochemical assessment of endocrine/metabolic dysfunction and nocturnal respiratory function. An exploratory correlation analysis was performed to investigate their associations with the facial phenotype; uncorrected <i>p</i>-values were used. Individuals with PWS showed decreased bifrontal diameter, facial depths, palpebral fissures, mandibular ramus length, lower vermillion height, and modified relative position of exocanthia and nasion. Since these characteristics did not show any associations with clinical and biochemical markers of PWS, they could constitute robust distinctive facial features and contribute to the diagnosis of the disorder. Individuals with PWS showed also a larger mandibular width with smaller gonial angles, thinner upper vermillion, greater inclination of the orbit relative to the Frankfurt plane, and a smaller angle of the auricles versus the facial midplane. Relationships between these facial anthropometric features and body composition, glucidic metabolism indexes, nocturnal hypoxemia episodes, or duration of GH treatment were found, suggesting their potentially useful role in the clinical monitoring and management of the disease. However, they need to be confirmed by subsequent dedicated studies."

    "abstract": "Hyperphagia and obesity profoundly affect the health of children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). The <i>Magel2</i> gene among the genes in the Prader-Willi syndrome deletion region is expressed in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC). Knockout of the <i>Magel2</i> gene disrupts POMC neuronal circuits and functions. Here, we report that loss of the <i>Magel2</i> gene exclusively in ARC<sup>POMC</sup> neurons innervating the medial amygdala (MeA) causes a reduction in body weight in both male and female mice fed with a high-fat diet. This anti-obesity effect is associated with an increased locomotor activity. There are no significant differences in glucose and insulin tolerance in mice without the <i>Magel2</i> gene in ARC<sup>POMC</sup> neurons innervating the MeA. Plasma estrogen levels are higher in female mutant mice than in controls. Blockade of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), but not estrogen receptor-α (ER-α), reduces locomotor activity in female mutant mice. Hence, our study provides evidence that knockdown of the <i>Magel2</i> gene in ARC<sup>POMC</sup> neurons innervating the MeA reduces susceptibility to diet-induced obesity with increased locomotor activity through activation of central GPER."

PRISMA 2020 guidelines were followed with the flowchart, table of included studies, list of excluded studies, and checklist provided. Filters applied included human research and English. Only original research articles were included in the final set, but review articles were used to identify secondary citations of primary studies. All articles were reviewed for appropriateness by 2 authors and summarized. Inclusion criteria were met by 145 articles (Down syndrome = 29, FXS = 55, tuberous sclerosis complex = 11, Williams syndrome = 18, Prader-Willi syndrome = 24, Angelman syndrome = 8). Each syndrome review was summarized separately and further subdivided into articles related to underlying neurobiology, behaviors associated with ED, assessment, and targeted intervention. FXS had the most thorough research base, followed by Down syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome, with the other syndromes having more limited available research. Very limited research was available regarding intervention for all disorders except FXS. Core underlying characteristics of S-IDs appear to place youth at higher risk for ED, but further research is needed to better assess and treat ED in S-IDs. Future studies should have a standard assessment measure of ED, such as the Emotion Dysregulation Inventory, and explore adapting established curricula for ED from the neurotypical and autism spectrum disorder fields."

    "title": "Dysregulated adipose tissue expansion and impaired adipogenesis in Prader-Willi syndrome children before obesity-onset.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic imprinting disorder resulting from the expression loss of genes on the paternally inherited chromosome 15q11-13. Early-onset life-thriving obesity and hyperphagia represent the clinical hallmarks of PWS. The noncoding RNA gene SNORD116 within the minimal PWS genetic lesion plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome. Despite advancements in understanding the genetic basis for PWS, the pathophysiology of obesity development in PWS remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we aimed to investigate the signatures of adipose tissue development and expansion pathways and associated adipose biology in PWS children without obesity-onset at an early stage, mainly from the perspective of the adipogenesis process, and further elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. We collected inguinal (subcutaneous) white adipose tissues (ingWATs) from phase 1 PWS and healthy children with normal weight aged from 6 M to 2 Y. Adipose morphology and histological characteristics were assessed. Primary adipose stromal vascular fractions (SVFs) were isolated, cultured in vitro, and used to determine the capacity and function of white and beige adipogenic differentiation. High-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed in adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSCs) to analyze transcriptome signatures in PWS subjects. Transient repression of SNORD116 was conducted to evaluate its functional relevance in adipogenesis. The changes in alternative pre-mRNA splicing were investigated in PWS and SNORD116 deficient cells. In phase 1 PWS children, impaired white adipose tissue (WAT) development and unusual fat expansion occurred long before obesity onset, which was characterized by the massive enlargement of adipocytes accompanied by increased apoptosis. White and beige adipogenesis programs were impaired and differentiated adipocyte functions were disturbed in PWS-derived SVFs, despite increased proliferation capacity, which were consistent with the results of RNA-seq analysis of PWS AdMSCs. We also experimentally validated disrupted beige adipogenesis in adipocytes with transient SNORD116 downregulation. The transcript and protein levels of PPARγ, the adipogenesis master regulator, were significantly lower in PWS than in control AdMSCs as well as in SNORD116 deficient AdMSCs/adipocytes than in scramble (Scr) cells, resulting in the inhibited adipogenic program. Additionally, through RNA-seq, we observed aberrant transcriptome-wide alterations in alternative RNA splicing patterns in PWS cells mediated by SNORD116 loss and specifically identified a changed PRDM16 gene splicing profile in vitro. Imbalance in the WAT expansion pathway and developmental disruption are primary defects in PWS displaying aberrant adipocyte hypertrophy and impaired adipogenesis process, in which SNORD116 deficiency plays a part. Our findings suggest that dysregulated adiposity specificity existing at an early phase is a potential pathological mechanism exacerbating hyperphagic obesity onset in PWS. This mechanistic evidence on adipose biology in young PWS patients expands knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of PWS obesity and may aid in developing a new therapeutic strategy targeting disturbed adipogenesis and driving AT plasticity to combat abnormal adiposity and associated metabolic disorders for PWS patients."

    "abstract": "Growth hormone (GH) is an injectable medication originally used to replace the deficiency of the hormone, but has expanded to treating conditions that may reduce growth and adult height even when the body maintains endogenous GH production. In the United States, there are 8 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications for pediatric GH therapy: GH deficiency, Prader-Willi Syndrome, small for gestational age (SGA) without catch-up growth, idiopathic short stature, Turner syndrome, SHOX gene haploinsufficiency, Noonan Syndrome, and chronic renal insufficiency. We characterize the growth patterns and effects of GH treatment in each of these indications. We also review patterns of growth that warrant referral to a pediatric endocrinologist, as well as safety updates. This review is intended to guide practitioners on the initial evaluation and management of patients with short stature, and the indications for GH therapy."

    "title": "Effects of Restrictive Bariatric Surgery on Congenital Prader-Willi Syndrome: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Hyperphagia leading to obesity is the most common cause of mortality and morbidity in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). It has been classified as the most common genetic cause of the development of life-threatening obesity resulting from a defect in satiety, with an onset during early childhood. Abnormalities in the feedback from gut peptides, including ghrelin, may contribute to the satiety defect; autonomic dysfunction may also play a role in impaired satiety. Usually, pharmacological treatment is ineffective in managing obesity in these patients. A 19-year-old male child with Prader-Willi syndrome presented with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and impaired glycemic control. The patient had complained of hyperphagia since early childhood, but food intake increased aggressively in the last few years, which resulted in morbid obesity. The patient was treated with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, and the residual stomach volume was 100 ml. The intervention resulted in a 37.1% weight reduction after one year of surgery with well-controlled blood sugar levels. The patient also reported improved overall quality of life, mood, and functionality. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy can be offered to obese Prader-Willi syndrome patients with heightened mortality, particularly because no other effective alternative therapy is available."

    "title": "Atypical 15q11.2-q13 Deletions and the Prader-Willi Phenotype.",
    "abstract": "Background: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder resulting from the lack of expression of the PWS region (locus q11-q13) on the paternally derived chromosome 15, as a result of a type I or II paternal deletion (50%), maternal uniparental disomy (43%), imprinting defect (4%) or translocation (<1%). In very rare cases, atypical deletions, smaller or larger than the typical deletion, are identified. These patients may have distinct phenotypical features and provide further information regarding the genotype−phenotype correlation in PWS. Methods: A prospective study in eight patients (six males and two females) with an atypical deletion in the PWS region accompanies an overview of reported cases. Results: All patients had hypotonia (100%) and many had typical PWS facial characteristics (75%), social and emotional developmental delays (75%), intellectual disabilities (50%), neonatal feeding problems and tube feeding (63%), history of obesity (50%), hyperphagia (50%) and scoliosis (50%). All males had cryptorchidism. Two patients had two separate deletions in the PWS critical region. Conclusions: Our findings provide further insight into PWS genotype−phenotype correlations; our results imply that inclusion of both SNURF-SNPRN and SNORD-116 genes in the deletion leads to a more complete PWS phenotype. A larger deletion, extending further upstream and downstream from these genes, does not cause a more severe phenotype. Conventional PWS methylation testing may miss small deletions, which can be identified using targeted next generation sequencing. PWS’s phenotypic diversity might be caused by differentially methylated regions outside the 15q11.2 locus."

    "title": "Reference Genes across Nine Brain Areas of Wild Type and Prader-Willi Syndrome Mice: Assessing Differences in <i>Igfbp7</i>, <i>Pcsk1</i>, <i>Nhlh2</i> and <i>Nlgn3</i> Expression.",
    "abstract": "Prader−Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the deletion or inactivation of paternally expressed imprinted genes at the chromosomal region 15q11−q13. The PWS-critical region (PWScr) harbors tandemly repeated non-protein coding IPW-A exons hosting the intronic SNORD116 snoRNA gene array that is predominantly expressed in brain. Paternal deletion of PWScr is associated with key PWS symptoms in humans and growth retardation in mice (PWScr model). Dysregulation of the hypothalamic−pituitary axis (HPA) is thought to be causally involved in the PWS phenotype. Here we performed a comprehensive reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis across nine different brain regions of wild-type (WT) and PWScr mice to identify stably expressed reference genes. Four methods (Delta Ct, BestKeeper, Normfinder and Genorm) were applied to rank 11 selected reference gene candidates according to their expression stability. The resulting panel consists of the top three most stably expressed genes suitable for gene-expression profiling and comparative transcriptome analysis of WT and/or PWScr mouse brain regions. Using these reference genes, we revealed significant differences in the expression patterns of Igfbp7, Nlgn3 and three HPA associated genes: Pcsk1, Pcsk2 and Nhlh2 across investigated brain regions of wild-type and PWScr mice. Our results raise a reasonable doubt on the involvement of the Snord116 in posttranscriptional regulation of Nlgn3 and Nhlh2 genes. We provide a valuable tool for expression analysis of specific genes across different areas of the mouse brain and for comparative investigation of PWScr mouse models to discover and verify different regulatory pathways affecting this complex disorder."

    "title": "Deleting Snord115 genes in mice remodels monoaminergic systems activity in the brain toward cortico-subcortical imbalances.",
    "abstract": "The neuronal-specific SNORD115 has gathered interest because its deficiency may contribute to the pathophysiology of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), possibly by altering post-transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding the serotonin (HTR2C) receptor. Yet, Snord115-KO mice do not resume the main symptoms of PWS, and only subtle-altered A-to-I RNA editing of Htr2c mRNAs was uncovered. Because HTR2C signaling fine-tunes the activity of monoaminergic neurons, we addressed the hypothesis that lack of Snord115 alters monoaminergic systems. We first showed that Snord115 was expressed in both monoaminergic and non-monoaminergic cells of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) harboring cell bodies of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons, respectively. Measuring the tissue level of monoamines and metabolites, we found very few differences except that the content of homovanillic acid-a metabolite of dopamine-was decreased in the orbitofrontal and prefrontal cortex of Snord115-KO mice. The latter effects were, however, associated with a few changes in monoamine tissue content connectivity across the 12 sampled brain regions. Using in vivo single-cell extracellular recordings, we reported that the firing rate of VTA dopaminergic neurons and DRN serotonergic neurons was significantly increased in Snord115-KO mice. These neural circuit dysfunctions were not, however, associated with apparent defects in binge eating, conditioned place preference to cocaine, cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion or compulsive behavior. Altogether, our multiscale study shows that the absence of Snord115 impacts central monoaminergic circuits to an extent that does not elicit gross behavioral abnormalities."

    "abstract": "The prosocial neuropeptide oxytocin is being developed as a potential treatment for various neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Early studies using intranasal oxytocin in patients with ASD yielded encouraging results and for some time, scientists and affected families placed high hopes on the use of intranasal oxytocin for behavioral therapy in ASD. However, a recent Phase III trial obtained negative results using intranasal oxytocin for the treatment of behavioral symptoms in children with ASD. Given the frequently observed autism-like behavioral phenotypes in Prader-Willi and Schaaf-Yang syndromes, it is unclear whether oxytocin treatment represents a viable option to treat behavioral symptoms in these diseases. Here we review the latest findings on intranasal OT treatment, Prader-Willi and Schaaf-Yang syndromes, and propose novel research strategies for tailored oxytocin-based therapies for affected individuals. Finally, we propose the critical period theory, which could explain why oxytocin-based treatment seems to be most efficient in infants, but not adolescents."

Following previous report on feasibility and acceptability of a remote, play-based parent-training program (Zyga, Russ, & Dimitropoulos, 2018), we now report on preliminary efficacy of this program to enhance pretend play skills and social cognitive skills in preschoolers with PWS. Results across two studies demonstrated efficacy when live-coaching play sessions incorporated children into the intervention. Increases in play skills were observed for children with the mUPD subtype of PWS who underwent intervention, compared with children with mUPD who were waitlisted. Children with DEL subtype were less likely to respond to intervention. Implications for results are discussed."

The majority of individuals with AS also have seizures and microcephaly. Some individuals with mosaic AS have been reported to have expressive language and milder levels of developmental delay. We report a male patient presenting with mild to moderate intellectual disability, hyperphagia, obesity, and the ability to communicate verbally. His phenotype was suggestive of Prader-Willi syndrome. However, methylation testing was positive for Angelman syndrome and additional methylation specific multiplex ligation-dependent amplification (MS-MLPA) study revealed low-level mosaicism for AS. A broader phenotypic spectrum should be considered for AS as patients with atypical presentations may otherwise elude diagnosis."

A total of 18 adults with PWS were recruited in this study. Of these participants, 10 regularly attended an SSCW and 8 did not. All of the participants were asked to wear accelerometers for eight continuous days for measuring their PA and SB. The independent sample <i>t</i>-test was used. The results showed that the adults with PWS who attended the SSCW engaged in more moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and daily steps than those who did not. By stratifying between daytime/nighttime on weekdays, we found the participants who attended the SSCW had higher total PA, MVPA, daily steps, as well as lower total sedentary time, during the daytime on weekdays than those who did not. Policies or programs promoting PA and reducing SB among adults with PWS should thus consider providing structured programs or courses in a community center."

To explore the clinical relevance of ROH in prenatal diagnoses, we reviewed 5063 fetal samples subjected to single nucleotide polymorphism array at our center over 5 years. ROH cases meeting our reporting threshold were further analyzed. ROHs were detected in 22 fetuses (0.43%, 22/5063), of which, 77.3% (17/22) showed a ROH on a single chromosome and 22.7% (5/22) showed multiple ROHs on different chromosomes. Among 5063 fetuses undergoing invasive prenatal diagnoses owing to various indications, five cases were identified as UPDs with a rate of ~1/1000. We observed clinically relevant UPDs in two cases related to Prader-Willi syndrome and transient neonatal diabetes mellitus. Of note, one case showed 50% mosaicism for trisomy 2 in amniotic fluid, whereas a complete UPD (2) was observed in umbilical cord blood. Trio whole-exome sequencing was performed for three cases. Clinically relevant variants were identified in two cases, one of which, NM_000302:c.2071_2072insCC (p.R693Qfs*122) in PLOD1 located in the ROH, may be related to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliotic type, 1. Overall, 72.7% (16/22) of the ROH carriers showed ultrasound abnormalities, of whom eight (50%, 8/16) had adverse perinatal outcomes. Our study demonstrates that the clinical relevance of ROHs should be examined regarding fetuses with ROHs occurring on imprinted chromosomes or those derived from consanguineous parents in prenatal diagnoses; imprinting disorders and/or autosomal recessive diseases attributed to ROHs should be considered during genetic counseling."

    "abstract": "Prader−Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex, rare genetic disorder caused by a loss of expression of paternally expressed genes on chromosome 15q11.2-q13. The most common underlying genotypes are paternal deletion (DEL) and maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD). DELs can be subdivided into type 1 (DEL-1) and (smaller) type 2 deletions (DEL-2). Most research has focused on behavioral, cognitive and psychological differences between the different genotypes. However, little is known about physical health problems in relation to genetic subtypes. In this cross-sectional study, we compare physical health problems and other clinical features among adults with PWS caused by DEL (N = 65, 12 DEL-1, 27 DEL-2) and mUPD (N = 65). A meta-analysis, including our own data, showed that BMI was 2.79 kg/m2 higher in adults with a DEL (p = 0.001). There were no significant differences between DEL-1 and DEL-2. Scoliosis was more prevalent among adults with a DEL (80% vs. 58%; p = 0.04). Psychotic episodes were more prevalent among adults with an mUPD (44% vs. 9%; p < 0.001). In conclusion, there were no significant differences in physical health outcomes between the genetic subtypes, apart from scoliosis and BMI. The differences in health problems, therefore, mainly apply to the psychological domain."

Longitudinal, retrospective, analytical study of Prader-Willis syndrome patients using data between 1989 and 2021. Growth hormone therapy was offered to eligible patients. The analysis included all Prader-Willis syndrome patients, with a comparison between treated and untreated patients; a longitudinal analysis of patients receiving growth hormone therapy (baseline, 12 and 36 months of follow-up) was also carried out. The statistical analysis was carried out using STATA® v13.0. Out of 38 patients with Prader-William syndrome, 61% were male. The median age at diagnosis was four months and 61% received growth hormone therapy. The patients who reached adulthood, or 18 years old, had a median near-adult height, Z-score of -2.71, and their median body mass index indicated class 2 obesity, regardless of growth hormone therapy. Patients had a lower body mass index in the growth hormone group (35 vs 51 kg/m2, p < 0.042) near-adult height. This case series represents the first national study that included patients on growth hormone therapy after the National Health Service started supporting the treatment for Prader-Willi syndrome patients and supports its use, reinforcing the positive effects on growth and body mass index. Longer follow-up studies are needed to analyse the effect of growth hormone on patient metabolic profiling, body composition and cognitive level."

Variable findings have been reported about the phenotypic differences among PWS genetic subtypes. A total of 110 PWS patients were diagnosed from 8,572 pediatric patients included from July 2013 to December 2021 by MLPA and MS-MLPA assays. Atypical deletions were defined by genomic CNV-sequencing. Maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) was subgrouped by microsatellite genotyping. Clinical data were collected for phenotype-genotype associations. Twenty-one patients received growth hormone (GH) treatment, and the anthropometric and laboratory parameters were evaluated and compared. Genetically, the 110 patients with PWS included 29 type I deletion, 56 type II deletion, 6 atypical deletion, 11 heterodisomy UPD, and 8 isodisomy UPD. The UPD group had significantly higher maternal age (31.4 ± 3.4 vs 27.8 ± 3.8 years), more anxiety (64.29% vs 26.09%) and autistic traits (57.14% vs 26.09%), and less hypopigmentation (42.11% vs 68.24%) and skin picking (42.86% vs 71.01%) than the deletion group. The type I deletion group was diagnosed at earlier age (3.7 ± 3.3 vs 6.2 ± 3.2 years) and more common in speech delay (95.45% vs 63.83%) than the type II. The isodisomy UPD group showed a higher tendency of anxiety (83.33% vs 50%) than the heterodisomy.

To present a rare case with an unexpected diagnosis, highlighting the usefulness of requesting a complete thyroid profile in every hypotonic male infant without a specific cause. A 10-month-old male infant with severe axial and peripheral hypotonia, global weakness with little spontaneous mobility, without head support or stable sitting. Complete metabolic and peripheral neurophysiological studies were performed. Genetic studies for spinal muscular atrophy, Prader Willi syndrome, and myotonic dystrophy were also performed. The trio exome analysis detected a probably pathogenic variant c.359C>T;p.(Ser120Phe), hemizygous in exon 1 of the SLC16A2 gene, inherited from the mother. Thyroid abnormalities as increased free triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and delayed myelination were ob served. MCT8 deficiency should be considered in the case of the male infant with unex plained hypotonia and weakness without a determined cause. The diagnosis is guided by a thyroid profile including free T3 hormone, because it presents a characteristic thyroid profile with decreased free thyroxine (T4), increased free T3, and normal or slightly elevated TSH levels. In this case, the implementation of the trio exome analysis allows establishing an early certain diagnosis."

MKRN3, a maternal imprinted gene located on 15q11.2-q13 region, encodes makorin ring finger protein 3, whose deficiency causes precocious puberty, an extremely rare symptom in PWS. This study aimed to evaluate MKRN3 levels in patients with PWS and to analyze its correlation with sexual hormone levels, insulin resistance and Body Mass Index (BMI). We performed an observational cross-sectional study and enrolled 80 patients with genetically confirmed diagnosis of PWS with median age of 9.6 years. MKRN3 levels were measurable in 49 PWS patients with a geometric mean of 34.9 ± 22 pg/ml (median: 28.4). Unmeasurable levels of MKRN3 were found in 31 patients. No statistically significant differences were found between patients with and without measurable MKRN3 levels for any clinical, biochemical, or genetic characteristics. However, MKRN3 levels were inversely correlated with HOMA-IR index (p: 0.005) and HbA1c (p: 0.046) values. No statistically significant correlations were found between MKRN3 and LH, estradiol and testosterone concentrations, pubertal development and genetic defect, whereas a direct correlation with FSH was found (p: 0.007). The typical genetic defect of PWS should lead to unmeasurable levels of the MKRN3 protein due to the inactivation of the paternal allele. Measurable circulating MKRN3 could suggest the possible involvement of tissue-specific imprinting mechanisms and other regulatory factors in gene expression. Correlations with HOMA-IR index, HbA1c, and FSH suggest peripheral actions of MKRN3, but future studies are warranted to investigate this topic."

Reverse transcription-PCR first determined the cDNA sequences of the four bovine sno-lncRNAs. A gene structure analysis showed that sno-lncRNA1 lacks introns, but sno-lncRNA2 and sno-lncRNA3 have one and two introns respectively. The three sno-lncRNAs have similar snoRNA ends. Moreover, the three have similar snoRNAs at their 5' and 3' ends. The head-to-tail orientation has six sno-lncRNA copies arranged between bovine SNORD116-6 and SNORD116-12. Moreover, only a copy of sno-lncRNA4 was located between SNORD116-3 and SNORD116-4. The expression of the four sno-lncRNAs was analyzed in the bovine heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, muscle, fat, brain, and placenta tissues. The monoallelic expression of sno-lncRNA4 was determined in bovine tissues. The results showed that the four sno-lncRNAs are widely expressed in the nine tissues, although sno-lncRNA3 and sno-lncRNA4 were undetected in the placenta. Moreover, an informative single nucleotide polymorphism (rs448706424) revealed the allelic expression of sno-lncRNA4 in exon 2 of sno-lncRNA4.

Both daughters display symptoms consistent with haploinsufficiency of the SHOX gene and PWS. We explored the architecture of the derivative chromosomes and investigated effects on gene expression in patient-derived neural cells. First, a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification methylation assay was used to determine the methylation status of the PWS-region revealing maternal UPD15 in daughter 2, explaining her clinical symptoms. Next, short read whole genome sequencing and 10X genomics linked read sequencing was used to pinpoint the exact breakpoints of the translocation. Finally, we performed transcriptome sequencing on neuroepithelial stem cells from the mother and from daughter 1 and observed biallelic expression of genes in the PWS region (including SNRPN) in daughter 1. In summary, our multi-omics analysis highlights two different PWS mechanisms in one family and provide an example of how structural variation can affect imprinting through long-range interactions."

Hospitalizations involving PWS were compared to hospitalizations without a PWS diagnosis matched based on demographic and hospital factors. In total, 540 hospitalizations (95% CI: 513-567) included a diagnosis of PWS. Median age at time of admission was 22 years, with an interquartile range of 6.3-37.8 years. Respiratory conditions accounted for 110 (20.4%) of primary discharge diagnoses, with infectious conditions for 70 (13.0%) and digestive conditions for 65 (12.0%). Hospitalizations involving PWS were significantly more likely to involve respiratory failure (OR 5.49; 95% CI 3.86-7.80), septicemia (OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.97-3.96), or intestinal obstruction and ileus (OR 6.29; 95% CI 3.70-10.7) compared to matched hospitalizations without PWS. Obesity was diagnosed in 230 PWS hospitalizations (42.6%; OR 3.86, 95% CI 3.17-4.72 relative to non-PWS hospitalizations). These results point to an ongoing need for the improved diagnosis and treatment of PWS complications, and highlight the importance of specific billing codes for rare diseases to enhance the collection of real world evidence."

We have also assessed quality of life in relation to trauma manifestations. In addition, we have evaluated demographic characteristics such as living setting of PWS patients as well as PWS symptom severity. Data of this observational study were obtained by means of the Life Events Checklist DMS-5, the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist DSM-5, the abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire, the Lancashire Quality of Life Profile questionnaire, and a short demographic inventory. The study sample includes 98 adults aged 19 to 80 years (<i>M</i> = 49, <i>SD</i> = 15), who are relatives of 69 individuals with PWS aged 0 to 58 years (<i>M</i> = 19, <i>SD</i> = 13). Participants were recruited via the two Dutch patient associations PWS and the Dutch Digital Center of Expertise PWS. Life time prevalence of traumatic events (93%) was higher in family members of PWS patients (\"PWS relatives\") than in the general Dutch population (81%). Of those who reported any traumatic event, almost half reported <i>PWS-related</i> events. The prevalence of probable PTSD was higher in PWS relatives (12.1%) than the general lifetime prevalence of PTSD (worldwide, and in the Netherlands 7.4%). Predominant trauma symptoms in PWS relatives were \"negative changes in arousal and reactivity\" and \"negative changes in cognition and mood;\" both significantly negatively related to quality of life. Symptom severity of PWS individuals, as well as the associated trauma symptom severity of their relatives increased with age of the PWS individual. The presence of trauma symptoms was less frequent among relatives of PWS individuals living in a care facility. Having a relative with PWS is associated with higher prevalence of traumatic experiences and greater vulnerability to PTSD. Raising awareness in health care professionals of trauma symptoms in PWS relatives may contribute to effective treatment of their psychosocial stress. In addition, timely interventions might prevent family members from developing psychopathology like PTSD."

All patients had hyponatremia during infancy and presented with clinical symptoms, such as convulsions. All three patients improved with intravenous fluids and fluid restriction, with no sequelae. We report three pediatric cases of symptomatic hyponatremia of unknown cause in PWS. In patients with PWS, especially those with neurological symptoms such as convulsions, it is necessary to take hyponatremia into consideration."

    "title": "Alteration of serum leptin and LEP/LEPR promoter methylation in Prader-Willi syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder based on a loss of paternally expressed but maternally imprinted genes in chromosome region 15q11-13. PWS individuals typically show insatiable appetite with subsequent obesity representing the major mortality factor unless food intake is inhibited. The neurobiological basis of PWS-typical hyperphagia has remained poorly understood. Many PWS-typical abnormalities are based on hypothalamic dysregulation, a region in which hunger and satiety are hormonally regulated, with the hormone leptin being a main long-term regulator of satiety. Previous studies in PWS have inconsistently shown leptin alterations solely in early childhood, without investigating the leptin system on an epigenetic level. The present study investigates serum leptin levels (S-leptin) and DNA methylation of the leptin (LEP) and leptin receptor gene (LEPR) promoter in 24 individuals with PWS compared to 13 healthy controls matched for sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) and relates the results to the extent of hyperphagia in PWS. S-Leptin levels were obtained by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay. LEP/LEPR-promoter DNA methylation was assessed by bisulfite-sequencing, hyperphagia by Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (HQ-CT). PWS and control groups differed significantly in S-leptin levels with higher S-leptin in PWS. Methylation analysis showed significant differences in mean promoter methylation rate both for LEP and LEPR with a lower methylation rate in PWS. LEPR, but not LEP methylation correlated significantly with S-leptin levels. S-leptin and both LEP and LEPR methylation did not correlate with HQ-CT scores in PWS. The present study is the first to show significantly elevated S-leptin levels in an adult PWS cohort combined with an altered, downregulated LEP and LEPR promoter methylation status compared to sex-, age- and BMI-matched controls. Analogous to previous studies, no link to the behavioral dimension could be drawn. Overall, the results suggest an increased leptin dysregulation in PWS, whereby the findings partly mirror those seen in non-syndromic obesity."

    "title": "Infant Social Withdrawal Behavior: A Key for Adaptation in the Face of Relational Adversity.",
    "abstract": "As a result of evolution, human babies are born with outstanding abilities for human communication and cooperation. The other side of the coin is their great sensitivity to any clear and durable violation in their relationship with caregivers. Infant sustained social withdrawal behavior (ISSWB) was first described in infants who had been separated from their caregivers, as in Spitz's description of \"hospitalism\" and \"anaclitic depression.\" Later, ISSWB was pointed to as a major clinical psychological feature in failure-to-thrive infants. Fraiberg also described freezing behavior as one of the earliest modes of infant defense in the face of adverse situations threatening the infant's ability to synchronize with caregivers. We hypothesize that ISSWB behaviors are associated with poor vagal brake functioning and that an impaired social engagement system is induced by an impoverished and/or dangerous environment. Recent research using animal models highlight the neurobiology and the genetics of the social Approach/Withdrawal Behavior in infants. The present paper is therefore a plea for social withdrawal behavior to be attributed a more important role as a major psychological defensive mechanism in infancy, and for research into early development and early intervention to make more practical and theoretical use of this concept, thus decreasing the challenge of translation in social neurosciences. This work presents several situations involving developmental hazards in which assessment of ISSWB by means of the Alarm Distress Baby Scale (ADBB) has proven useful, i.e., malnutrition, effects of major maternal depression and or traumatization, assessing social withdrawal in infants with an chronic organic illness (congenital heart disease, Prader-Willi syndrome, cleft lip and/or palate Prader-Willy syndrome, Fetal alcohol syndrome) or assessing ISSWB in out of home placed infants during parental visitation. Relationships between ISSWB and other biophysiological behavioral systems are discussed, particularly links with attachment processes and Porges's polyvagal theory."

    "abstract": "Individuals with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) have reduced mobility, which may be due to altered gait biomechanics. This study compared lower extremity intersegmental coordination and joint kinetics in adults with and without PWS. Walking biomechanics were evaluated in 10 adults with PWS and 10 controls without and 10 with obesity. The foot-shank and shank-thigh coordination was evaluated using modified vector coding and compared between groups using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. The total support moment was summed from the ankle, knee, and hip extensor moments; and relative joint contributions were expressed as a percentage and compared between groups using one-way MANOVA. The group with PWS had greater exclusive shank segment rotation during later stance compared with controls with (p < 0.001) and without obesity (p < 0.001). The group with PWS also had a smaller absolute total support moment than controls with obesity during early and late stance (both p < 0.001), and lower normalized total support moment compared to controls without obesity during early stance (p = 0.019) and compared to controls with obesity during late stance (p = 0.004). Extensor moment contributions was similar between groups during early and late stance (all p > 0.05). Findings suggest a flat-footed gait pattern in PWS during late stance, which may negatively influence propulsion and speed. Moreover, those with PWS had lower total support moments than controls during early and late stance, but similar relative extensor contributions when walking at self-selected speeds. As such, improving overall torque generation in the lower extremity may be useful to improve stability and mobility during gait in PWS."

    "abstract": "Irisin is a myokine involved in the browning of white adipose tissue and regulation of energy expenditure, glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Debated evidence exists on the metabolic role played by irisin in children with overweight or obesity, while few information exist in children with Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS), a condition genetically prone to obesity. Here we assessed serum irisin in relation to the metabolic profile and body composition in children and adolescents with and without PWS. In 25 PWS subjects [age 6.6-17.8y; body mass index standard deviation score (BMI SDS) 2.5 ± 0.3] and 25 age, and BMI-matched controls (age 6.8-18.0y; BMI SDS, 2.8 ± 0.1) we assessed irisin levels and metabolic profile inclusive of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In PWS, we recorded lower levels of fat-free mass (FFM) (p <0.05), fasting (p<0.0001) and 2h post-OGTT insulin (p<0.05) and lower insulin resistance as expressed by homeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (p<0.0001). Irisin levels were significantly lower in PWS group than in controls with common obesity (p<0.05). In univariate correlation analysis, positive associations linked irisin to insulin OGTT<sub>0</sub> (p<0.05), insulin OGTT<sub>120</sub> (p<0.005), HOMA-IR (p<0.05) and fasting C-peptide (p<0.05). In stepwise multivariable regression analysis, irisin levels were independently predicted by insulin OGTT<sub>120</sub>. These results suggest a link between irisin levels and insulin sensitivity in two divergent models of obesity."

Previous studies reported health problems in adults with PWS. However, studies on younger adults are lacking, and there are no specific studies of endocrine and metabolic illness in this age group. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 68 individuals with PWS aged 19 to 34 years at Samsung Medical Center. The prevalence of endocrine and metabolic illnesses were compared with those in an age-, sex-, and BMI-matched healthy control group. Young adults with PWS had a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (35.3% vs. 4.4%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (50.0% vs. 5.4%), hypertension (30.8% vs. 16.1%), dyslipidemia (38.2% vs. 14.7%), decreased bone density (26.4% vs. 0.9%), and sleep apnea (32.3% vs. 4.4%) than controls (all p < 0.05). The PWS group that maintained recombinant human growth (rhGH) treatment in adulthood had a lower probability of having a BMI ≥ 30 at the last follow-up (odds ratio = 0.106 (0.012−0.948), p = 0.045). Endocrine and metabolic illnesses in individuals with PWS may have already started in the early teens; therefore, appropriate screening and early intervention are important. Better understanding of the natural history of PWS and age-related complications will lead to better-quality medical care for individuals with PWS."

This observational study was conducted to investigate the progression of OSAS in pediatric patients with PWS, who had not undergone upper airway surgery, through a longitudinal follow-up of their annual polysomnography results. Annual body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score, sleep efficiency and stages, central apnea index (CAI), obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI), and oxygen saturation nadir values were longitudinally analyzed. At enrollment, of 22 patients (10 boys and 12 girls) aged 11.7 ± 3.9 years, 20 had OSAS. During the 4-year follow-up, only two patients had a spontaneous resolution of OSAS. The average BMI and BMI z-score increased gradually, but CAI and OAHI showed no significant differences. After statistical adjustment for sex, age, genotype, growth hormone use, and BMI z-score, OAHI was associated with the BMI z-score and deletion genotype. In conclusion, OSAS is common in patients with PWS, and rarely resolved spontaneously. Watchful waiting may not be the best OSAS management strategy. Weight maintenance and careful selection of surgical candidates are important for OSAS treatment in patients with PWS."

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate differences in sleep-breathing parameters obtained by overnight cardiorespiratory polygraphy in 13 adult PWS patients and 13 individuals with non-syndromic obesity as controls matched by age, sex, and BMI. In all subjects' anthropometric parameters, body composition using bioimpedance analysis and overnight cardiorespiratory monitoring parameters were obtained. Ten (76.9%) PWS patients were diagnosed with OSAS, most notably nine (69.2%) and one PWS (7.7%) with mild and severe OSAS, respectively. Compared with the control group, PWS patients had evidence of higher apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) (p = 0.04) and oxyhaemoglobin desaturation index (ODI) (p = 0.009). However, no differences were found between the two groups regarding OSAS categories or diagnosis of nocturnal respiratory failure. In the PWS group, there were no significant correlations among AHI, ODI and hypoxemia index (T90) and anthropometric measurements, fat mass (FM), and FM percentage (%). Conversely, in the control group, the sleep-related respiratory indices evaluated correlated positively with BMI, waist circumference, FM and FM%. This study confirmed that AHI and ODI indices were worse in PWS than in age, sex and BMI-matched controls. The lack of their significant association with the anthropometric parameters and FM supported the existence of PWS-related mechanisms in OSAS pathophysiology that are independent of visceral obesity and FM."

Instrumented gait analysis (IGA) using wearable technology offers a potentially feasible solution to measure \"real-world' neurological and motor dysfunction in these groups. Children (50% female; 6-16 years) diagnosed with PWS (n = 9) and AS (n = 5) completed 'real-world' IGA assessments using the Physilog®5 wearable. PWS participants completed a laboratory assessment and a 'real-world' long walk. The AS group completed 'real-world' caregiver-assisted assessments. Mean and variability results for stride time, cadence, stance percentage (%) and stride length were extracted and compared across three different data reduction protocols. The wearables approach was found to be feasible, with all participants able to complete at least one assessment. This study also demonstrated significant agreement, using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), between laboratory and 'real-world' assessments in the PWS group for mean stride length, mean stance % and stance % CV (n = 7, CCC: 0.782-0.847, P = 0.011-0.009).

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex and multisystem neurobehavioral disease, which is caused by the lack of expression of paternally inherited imprinted genes on chromosome15q11.2-q13.1. The clinical manifestations of PWS vary with age. It is characterized by severe hypotonia with poor suck and feeding difficulties in the early infancy, followed by overeating in late infancy or early childhood and progressive development of morbid obesity unless the diet is externally controlled. Compared to Western PWS patients, Chinese patients have a higher ratio of deletion type. Although some rare disease networks, including PWS Cooperation Group of Rare Diseases Branch of Chinese Pediatric Society, Zhejiang Expert Group for PWS, were established recently, misdiagnosis, missed diagnosis and inappropriate intervention were usually noted in China. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an integrated multidisciplinary approach to facilitate early diagnosis and optimize management to improve quality of life, prevent complications, and prolong life expectancy. Our purpose is to evaluate the current literature and evidences on diagnosis and management of PWS in order to provide evidence-based guidelines for this disease, specially from China."

    "abstract": "People with neurodevelopmental disabilities, including Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), are at heightened risk for the negative sequalae of loneliness, including depression and anxiety. While societal factors such as stigma or limited social opportunities contribute to loneliness, so too do deficits in social cognition and social skills. People with PWS have specific difficulties recognizing affect in others, accurately interpreting social interactions, and taking the perspectives of others. These features, combined with hyperphagia, rigidity, and insistence on sameness conspire to impede the abilities of people with PWS to make and sustain friendships and reduce feelings of loneliness. We developed and administered an intervention, Building Our Social Skills (BOSS), that aimed to improve social skill deficits in PWS. The 10-week intervention was administered on-line via Zoom to 51 young people with PWS in the U.S. (M age = 20.8, SD = 6.42). Two clinicians co-led groups of 6-8 participants in 30-min sessions, 3 times per week, and also trained 4 graduate students to co-lead groups with high fidelity. We used a pre-post intervention and 3-month follow-up design, with no control group, and mitigated this design limitation by triangulating across informants and methodologies. Specifically, parents completed the widely used Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and participants were individually interviewed about their friendships and loneliness. Interview responses were reliably coded by independent raters. Repeated measure multivariate analyses, with baseline values entered as covariates, revealed significant pre-to post-test improvements in the SRS's social cognition, motivation and communication subscales (<i>p</i>'s < 0.001), with large effect sizes ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <msubsup><mrow><mtext>n</mtext></mrow> <mrow><mtext>p</mtext></mrow> <mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow> </msubsup> </math> = 0.920, 0.270, and 0.204, respectively). Participant and parental reports of loneliness were correlated with the CBCL's Internalizing domain, specifically the Anxiety/Depressed subdomain. Over time, parents reported getting along better with peers, increased contact with friends, more friends and less loneliness. Participants also reported significantly less loneliness and more friends. This mixed method, proof-of-concept study demonstrated the feasibility of delivering an on-line social skills intervention to young people with PWS. As no differences were found between clinician vs. graduate student outcomes, the BOSS curriculum holds considerable promise for wider dissemination and implementation in the PWS community."

Individuals with PWS display a specific behavioral phenotype and have a higher susceptibility than the general population for certain psychiatric conditions, especially psychosis. An impairment of the oxytocin system has been described in Prader-Willi syndrome, but has not yet been investigated in detail on the epigenetic level. Recent studies have pointed out altered methylation patterns of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) in various psychiatric disorders, including psychosis. In this study, we investigated methylation rates of CpG dinucleotides in the promoter region of the oxytocin receptor gene via bisulfite-sequencing using DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples of 31 individuals with PWS and 14 controls matched for age, sex, and BMI. Individuals with PWS show significantly lower methylation in the intron 1 region of the OXTR than neurotypical controls (p = 0.012). Furthermore, male PWS subjects with psychosis show significantly lower methylation of the OXTR exon 1 region than those without psychosis (p = 0.002). Transcription factor binding site analysis revealed E2F1 as a transcription factor potentially binding to the exon 1 region. E2F1 is physiologically regulated by Necdin, an anti-apoptotic protein whose corresponding gene is located within the PWS locus. This study provides evidence of a disruption of the Oxytocin system on an epigenetic level in PWS in general and in individuals with PWS and psychosis."

    "abstract": "Segmental chromosome duplications are an important evolutionary mechanism to produce new gene functions. Once an initial duplication takes place, the probability of a second event (structural change) increases. Segmental duplications (SDs) occur in many sizes and configurations. It has long been thought that SDs contribute to rapid evolution in primate genes. SDs tend to cluster around core duplicons, evolutionarily conserved sequences that are often shared between primate species. Many known SDs are associated with predisposition to human chromosome abnormalities and genetic diseases. Chromosome abnormalities in which SDs are implicated as the etiology include deletions, interstitial duplications, inversions, supernumerary marker chromosomes and translocations. Genomic abnormalities include DiGeorge and Velocardiofacial syndromes, Williams-Beuren syndrome, Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, cat eye syndrome, and many more. Segmental duplications also may play an important role in the etiology of some cancers. Most models for the likely mechanism of SD formation and expansion are based upon misalignment between juxtaposed non-allelic segmental duplications, followed by recombination."

    "abstract": "Obesity is a global medical problem; its common form is known as diet-induced obesity (DIO); however, there are several rare genetic disorders, such as Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), that are also associated with obesity (genetic-induced obesity, GIO). The currently available therapeutics for treating DIO and GIO are very limited, and they result in only a partial improvement. Cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), a constituent of Cannabis sativa, gradually decarboxylates to cannabidiol (CBD). Whereas the anti-obesity properties of CBD have been reasonably identified, our knowledge of the pharmacology of CBDA is more limited due to its instability. To stabilize CBDA, a new derivative, CBDA-O-methyl ester (HU-580, EPM301), was synthesized. The therapeutic potential of EPM301 in appetite reduction, weight loss, and metabolic improvements in DIO and GIO was tested in vivo. EPM301 (40 mg/kg/d, i.p.) successfully resulted in weight loss, increased ambulation, as well as improved glycemic and lipid profiles in DIO mice. Additionally, EPM301 ameliorated DIO-induced hepatic dysfunction and steatosis. Importantly, EPM301 (20 and 40 mg/kg/d, i.p.) effectively reduced body weight and hyperphagia in a high-fat diet-fed <i>Magel2</i><sup>null</sup> mouse model for PWS. In addition, when given to standard-diet-fed <i>Magel2</i><sup>null</sup> mice as a preventive treatment, EPM301 completely inhibited weight gain and adiposity. Lastly, EPM301 increased the oxidation of different nutrients in each strain. All together, EPM301 ameliorated obesity and its metabolic abnormalities in both DIO and GIO. These results support the idea to further promote this synthetic CBDA derivative toward clinical evaluation in humans."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare complex genetic disease that is associated with pathological disorders that include endocrine disruption, developmental, neurological, and physical problems as well as intellectual, and behavioral dysfunction. In early stage, PWS is characterized by respiratory distress, hypotonia, and poor sucking ability, causing feeding concern and poor weight gain. Additional features of the disease evolve over time. These include hyperphagia, obesity, developmental, cognitive delay, skin picking, high pain threshold, short stature, growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism, strabismus, scoliosis, joint laxity, or hip dysplasia. The disease is associated with a shortened life expectancy. There is no cure for PWS, although interventions are available for symptoms management. PWS is caused by genetic defects in chromosome 15q11.2-q13, and categorized into three groups, namely Paternal deletion, Maternal uniparental disomy, and Imprinting defect. PWS is confirmed through genetic testing and DNA-methylation analysis. Studies revealed that at least two key proteins namely MAGEL-2 and NECDIN along with two proteases PCSK1 and PCSK2 are linked to PWS. Herein, we summarize our current understanding and knowledge about the role of these proteins and enzymes in various biological processes associated with PWS. The review also describes how loss and/or impairment of functional activity of these macromolecules can lead to hormonal disbalance by promoting degradation of secretory granules and via inhibition of proteolytic maturation of precursor-proteins. The present review will draw attention of researchers, scientists, and academicians engaged in PWS study and will help to identify potential targets and molecular pathways for PWS intervention and treatment."

Currently, there is no systematic literature review on the scope and characteristics of pediatric GH registries. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to identify worldwide registries reported on pediatric GH treatment and to provide a summary of their main characteristics. Pediatric GH registries were identified through a systematic literature review. The search was performed on all related literature published up to January 30th, 2021. Basic information on pediatric GH registries, their type and scope, purpose, sources of data, target conditions, reported outcomes, and important variables were analyzed and presented. Twenty two articles, reporting on 20 pediatric GH registries, were included in this review. Industrial funding was the most common funding source. The main target conditions included in the pediatric GH registries were: growth hormone deficiency, Turner syndrome, Prader Willi syndrome, small for gestational age, idiopathic short stature, and chronic renal insufficiency. The main objectives in establishing and running pediatric GH registries were assessing the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, describing the epidemiological aspects of target growth conditions and populations, serving public health surveillance, predicting and measuring treatment outcomes, exploring new and useful aspects of GH treatment, and improving the quality of patient care. This systematic review provides a global perspective on pediatric GH registries which can be used as a basis for the design and development of new GH registry systems at both national and international levels."

Data were collected through Rare Disease Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) from four study centers which evaluated patients with PWS. The Behavior Assessment System for Children 2nd edition (BASC-2) was chosen to provide behavioral assessment. Data from 330 participants ((64% 15q11-q13 deletion (DEL), 36% maternal disomy 15 (UPD)) were separated into three age groups and analyzed, 68% of whom were still actively receiving recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment.

Participants who were on rhGH treatment showed lower scores for parent-reported hyperactivity and aggression (<i>p</i> = 0.04, 0.04, respectively), and a trend for anger control (<i>p</i> = 0.06) and teacher-reported attention problems and aggression (<i>p</i> = 0.01, 0.004, respectively). Additional adjusted analyses were undertaken and significant differences were noted in the GH versus non-GH treated groups for only teacher-reported aggression, which increased in the No GH treated patient group (<i>p =</i> 0.03). This study showed documented differences in PWS behavior by molecular class and rhGH treatment. RhGH therapy may be beneficial for certain behaviors in patients with PWS; however, observed differences need more studies for confirmation in the future."

We investigated the effects of long-term GH on body composition, anthropometrics and cognition in young children with PWS compared to untreated controls and assessed whether starting GH in the first year of life is optimal and safe. An open-label, prospective study was performed, comparing GH-treated children with untreated controls, and comparing children who started GH in the first year of life (subgroup A) with children who started between 2-5 years (subgroup C). A total of 82 GH-treated children with PWS and 22 age-matched controls with PWS were included. The main outcome measures were body composition, anthropometrics, IQ, and safety parameters. After 8 years, GH-treated children had significantly better body composition and were taller than age-matched controls. Subgroup A had a lower FM% trajectory during treatment than subgroup C and showed a greater and longer-term increase in the LBM index. After 8 years, subgroup A had a lower trunk/peripheral fat ratio (<i>p</i> = 0.043) and higher IQ (<i>p</i> = 0.043). No adverse effects of starting GH in the first year were found. Children with PWS who received long-term GH had a better body composition and growth than untreated age-matched controls and starting GH in the first year of life was optimal and safe."

    "title": "Prader-Willi Syndrome: Possibilities of Weight Gain Prevention and Treatment.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic disorder which involves the endocrine and neurologic systems, metabolism, and behavior. The aim of this paper is to summarize current knowledge on dietary management and treatment of PWS and, in particular, to prevent excessive weight gain. Growth hormone (GH) therapy is the recommended standard treatment for PWS children, because it improves body composition (by changing the proportion of body fat and lean body mass specifically by increasing muscle mass and energy expenditure), linear growth, and in infants, it promotes psychomotor and IQ development. In early childhood, the predominant symptom is hyperphagia which can lead to early onset, severe obesity with different obesity-related comorbidities. There are several studies on anti-obesity medications (metformin, topiramate, liraglutide, setmelanotide). However, these are still limited, and no widely accepted consensus guideline exists concerning these drugs in children with PWS. Until there is a specific treatment for hyperphagia and weight gain, weight must be controlled with the help of diet and exercise. Below the age of one year, children with PWS have no desire to eat and will often fail to thrive, despite adequate calories. After the age of two years, weight begins to increase without a change in calorie intake. Appetite increases later, gradually, and becomes insatiable. Managing the progression of different nutritional phases (0-4) is really important and can delay the early onset of severe obesity. Multidisciplinary approaches are crucial in the diagnosis and lifelong follow-up, which will determine the quality of life of these patients."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome is the most frequent genetic cause of obesity and is often complicated by glucose metabolism alterations. Conventional therapies prescribed for type 2 diabetes frequently failed to achieve adequate glycemic control in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. Beneficial effects of glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists exenatide and liraglutide have been reported for the management of type 2 diabetes in Prader-Willi syndrome, but no data are currently available in this population on the use of semaglutide. We report for the first time the use of semaglutide 1 mg per week in a 33-yearold man with Prader-Will syndrome complicated by poorly controlled diabetes and severe obesity. After 12 months of semaglutide treatment, we observed an important reduction in glycated hemoglobin levels (11.1% to 7.2%) and body weight (99.5 kg to 94.3 kg), with a notable decrease in fat mass and insulin requirements. Interestingly, our patient had already tried liraglutide therapy in adjunction to metformin and insulin therapy, reporting no substantial efficacy. The beneficial effects of semaglutide on glycemic control and weight reduction provide a promising treatment for diabetes and obesity in Prader-Willi syndrome, even where other glucagons like peptide-1 receptor agonists have failed. Further studies are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome."

This often necessitates testosterone treatment, but limited data are available to guide testosterone treatment in adult men with PWS. We aimed to evaluate the serum testosterone concentrations and adverse effects of testosterone treatment in individuals with PWS attending a specialist obesity management service. A retrospective audit was undertaken at Austin Health, Melbourne between January 2010 and April 2021. Main outcome measures were testosterone formulation and dose, serum total testosterone concentration, and prevalence of polycythemia and behavioral disturbance. Data were available for eight individuals with median baseline age 19 years (range, 19-42) and BMI 37 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range, 27-71). Six men had obstructive sleep apnea; none were smokers. Baseline testosterone concentration was 1.8 nmol/L (IQR, 1.1-3.3) with hematocrit 0.43. Testosterone formulations were intramuscular testosterone undecanoate (TU) 1000 mg (n = 5), transdermal testosterone gel 50 mg daily (n = 1), and oral TU 80-120 mg daily (n = 2). Median total testosterone concentration was 9.7 nmol/L (IQR, 8.5-14.7). Nine of 25 (36%) hematocrit results in six patients measured >0.50 (range, 0.50-0.56). Intramuscular TU was well tolerated and was the only formulation to achieve serum total testosterone concentrations in the adult male reference range. Worsening behavioral disturbance resulted in treatment discontinuation in one individual. Our experience reinforces the need to regular monitoring of hematocrit in men with PWS treated with testosterone. However, a worsening of behavior problems was uncommon in this series."

    "abstract": "In recent years, more studies have observed that patients with Prader-Willi syndrome have lower insulin levels and lower insulin resistance than body mass index-matched controls, which may suggest protected glucose metabolism. The PubMed and Web of Science online databases were searched to identify relevant studies published in the English language using the terms \"Prader-Willi syndrome\" with \"glucose\", \"insulin\", \"diabetes mellitus\", \"fat\", \"adipo*\", \"ghrelin\", \"oxytocin\", \"irisin\" or \"autonomic nervous system\". The prevalence of impaired glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes mellitus and some other obesity-associated complications in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome tends to be lower when compared to that in general obesity, which is consistent with the hypothetically protected glucose metabolism. Factors including adipose tissue, adiponectin, ghrelin, oxytocin, irisin, growth hormone and the autonomic nervous system possibly modulate insulin sensitivity in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. Although lower insulin levels, lower IR and protected glucose metabolism are widely reported in PWS patients, the causes are still mysterious. Based on existing knowledge, we cannot determine which factor is of utmost importance and what are the underlying mechanisms, and further research is in urgent need."

We aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of intensive medical weight loss interventions (very-low-energy diets [VLED] and/or pharmacotherapy) in individuals with PWS attending a specialist obesity management service. A retrospective audit was undertaken of individuals with PWS attending the Austin Health Weight Control Clinic between January 2010-April 2021. Main outcome measures were weight outcomes, duration of use, and adverse effects. Data were available for 18 patients, of whom 15 were treated with intensive weight loss interventions. Median (interquartile range, IQR) age at baseline was 20 years (19-32) with median body weight 90 kg (75-118) and BMI 37 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (30-51). Median weight loss during VLED (n = 7) was 14 kg (1-20 kg) over 60 weeks. Median weight loss with phentermine-topiramate (n = 7) was 17 kg (IQR 9-19 kg) over 56 weeks. Median weight loss with liraglutide 0.6-3 mg (n = 7), prescribed with topiramate in 3 individuals, was 9 kg (2-14 kg) over 96 weeks. Naltrexone-bupropion resulted in weight loss in 2 of 4 individuals. Thirteen individuals achieved ≥10% weight loss but only 5 individuals maintained ≥10% weight loss at last follow-up. Five individuals discontinued pharmacotherapy due to adverse effects. VLED and pharmacotherapy can achieve substantial weight loss in some individuals with PWS though non-adherence results in substantial weight regain. Adverse effects were ascribed to phentermine and topiramate, whereas liraglutide was well-tolerated in this population."

    "abstract": "Craniopharyngiomas are tumors located in the hypothalamic region which leads to obesity in about 50% of cases. Long-term efficacy and safety of bariatric surgery are lacking in this peculiar population. The aim of this study is to determine the 5-year weight loss and resolution of type 2 diabetes (T2D) after bariatric surgery in patients operated on craniopharyngioma who had developed hypothalamic obesity. This is a multicenter french retrospective case-control study. Subjects with craniopharyngioma (n = 23) who underwent sleeve gastrectomy (SG) (n = 9) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) (n = 14) (median age 35 years [25;43] and BMI 44.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [40.7; 51.0]; 8/23 with T2D) were individually matched to 2 subjects with common obesity for age, gender, preoperative body mass index, T2D, and type of surgery. TWL% after 1 and 5 years was lower in the craniopharyngioma group than in the control group: 23.1 [15.4; 31.1] (23/23) vs 31.4 [23.9; 35.3] at 1 year (p = 0.008) (46/46) and 17.8 [7.1; 21.9] (23/23) vs 26.2 [18.9; 33.9] at 5 years (p = 0.003) (46/46). After RYGB, TWL% was lower in the craniopharyngioma group compared to the control group (p < 0.001) and comparable after SG both at 1 and 5 years. No difference between the two groups was observed in T2D remission rate and in early and late adverse events. No hormonal deficiency-related acute disease was reported. Bariatric surgery induced a significant weight loss in the craniopharyngioma group at 1 and 5 years, but less than in common obesity. SG may be more effective than RYGB but this remains to be demonstrated in a larger cohort."

    "abstract": "Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder caused by the absence of expression of the paternal copies of maternally imprinted gene(s) located at 15q11-q13. While the physical and medical characteristics of PWS, including short stature, hyperphagia and endocrine dysfunction are well-characterized, systematic investigation of the long-recognized psychiatric manifestations has been recent. Here, we report on the first remote (web-based) assessment of neurobehavioral traits, including psychosis-risk symptoms (Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief Version; PQ-B) and sleep behaviors (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), in a cohort of 128 participants with PWS, of whom 48% had a paternal deletion, 36% uniparental disomy, 2.4% an imprinting mutation and 13% unknown mutation (mean age 19.3 years ± 8.4; 53.9% female). We aimed to identify the most informative variables that contribute to psychosis-risk symptoms. Multiple domains of cognition (accuracy and speed) were also assessed in a subset of PWS participants (<i>n</i> = 39) using the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (Penn-CNB). Individuals with PWS reported a range of psychosis-risk symptoms, with over half reporting cognitive disorganization (63.1%) and about one third reporting unusual beliefs (38.6%) and/or suspiciousness (33.3%). Subjectively-reported sleep quality, nap frequency, sleep duration, sleep disturbance, and daytime dysfunction were significant predictors of psychosis-risk symptom frequency and severity (all <i>p's</i> < 0.029). Sleep disturbance ratings were the strongest predictors of psychosis-risk symptoms. Regarding cognition, individuals with PWS showed the most prominent deficits in accuracy on measures of social cognition involving faces, namely Face Memory, Age Differentiation and Emotion Recognition, and greatest slowing on measures of Attention and Emotion Recognition. However, there were no significant differences in psychosis-risk symptoms or cognitive performance as a function of PWS genetic subtype. PWS is associated with a high prevalence of distressing psychosis-risk symptoms, which are associated with sleep disturbance. Findings indicate that self/parent-reported neurobehavioral symptoms and cognition can be assessed remotely in individuals with PWS, which has implications for future large-scale investigations of rare neurogenetic disorders."

One hundred and thirty PWS patients (87 boys and 43 girls) aged from newborn to 15 years (y) (median 1.25 y, mean, SD: 2.95 ± 3.45 y), were surveyed in this study. Serum thyroid hormone levels were examined at least once per3-6 months during the 2 years follow-up study. Central hypothyroidism (C-HT) was identified as low/normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and low free thyroxine 4 (FT4). All study participants had normal neonatal TSH screening test results. The prevalence of C-HT is 36.2% (47/130). No C-HT cases were diagnosed in PWS either below 1 month (m) or above 12 y. The prevalence of C-TH would be increased with age before 3 y until reaching the peak, followed by a gradual decline over the years. The prevalence of C-HT varies significantly at different ages (Pearson's χ2 = 19.915; p < 0.01). However, there is no correlation between the C-HT prevalence and nutritional phases (Pearson's χ2 = 4.992; p = 0.288), genotypes (Pearson's χ2 = 0.292; p = 0.864), or rhGH therapy (Pearson's χ2 = 1.799; p = 0.180). This study suggests the prevalence of C-TH was increased with the age before 3 y, and reached the peak in the 1 to 3 y group, then gradually declined over the years. There is no correlation between C-HT prevalence and nutritional phases, genotypes, or rhGH treatment."

Among the 36 subjects, 17 subjects were allocated to the probiotic group for daily use of the BL-11 probiotic and 19 subjects were allocated to the placebo group. Groupwise and longitudinal differences in salivary microbiota abundances, biodiversity metrics, and height were analyzed. Linear correlations were found between identified differentially abundant salivary microbiota and clinical parameters. Salivary microbiome α-diversity was found to be higher in the probiotic-treated group at week 12 relative to placebo controls (P < 0.05). Leptotrichia, Paracoccus, and Faecalibacterium were found to be more abundant in the probiotic-treated group (P < 0.05). Salivary microbiota abundance and predicted functional profiling abundance correlations were found to be associated with anti-inflammation, anti-obesity, toxin degradation, and anti-oxidative injury effects (Q < 0.1). Several oral taxa also displayed correlations with social behavior severity scores in the probiotic-treated group (Q < 0.1). The findings suggest novel salivary microbiota compositional changes in response to the oral supplementation of BL-11 probiotic in individuals with PWS. The observed differentially abundant taxa between groups post-treatment were highly correlated with interventional effects on growth and social behaviors, although further investigation is warranted.

The aim of our study was to describe the concentrations of serum asprosin in children with PWS compared to those with overweight/obesity and normal weight, and to explore the postprandial change in asprosin concentrations in participants with PWS and BMI-z matched controls. We enrolled 52 children, 23 with PWS, 8 with overweight/obesity, and 21 with normal weight. Fasting levels of asprosin, glucose, and insulin were collected in all children, and postprandial asprosin and fasting levels of acyl ghrelin (AG) and leptin were also determined in a subsample of participants. There were no significant differences among groups in fasting levels of asprosin, glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR. Fasting serum asprosin and 1-h post-meal serum asprosin did not differ in children with PWS nor in BMI-z matched controls. Fasting asprosin showed an adjusted positive correlation with glucose in children with obesity (r = 0.93, <i>p</i> = 0.007) but not in children with PWS nor children with normal weight.

Currently, there is no cure for this condition but treatments for general obesity are often used in patients with HS, including surgery, medication and counselling. However, these are mostly ineffective and no medications that are specifically approved for the treatment of HS are available.

Forty-seven patients with lipodystrophy including generalized lipodystrophy (GLD; n = 28) and partial lipodystrophy (PLD; n = 19) received metreleptin over the last decade. At baseline, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) patient age was 29.3 (16.6-47.6) years, body mass index was 23.8 (21.2-25.7) kg/m<sup>2</sup> and serum leptin was 3.2 (1.0-4.9) ng/mL, 94% of patients had diabetes (66% insulin-treated), 53% had hypertension and 87% had dyslipidaemia.

For SRY FISH, we artificially mixed fresh blood of male and female with various ratios and then compared the results of metaphase and interphase SRY FISH. Using a bio-cell chip, we performed interphase FISH in 168 patients with microdeletion syndromes and compared the results with manual interphase. The concordance rate between the results of metaphase and interphase was 100% in microdeletion syndrome. In the disorders of gender development, SRY FISH showed 100% concordance between interphase and metaphase when we counted 50 metaphase cells and 100 interphase cells. Comparison with mixtures of male and female blood at various ratios also showed 100% concordance. The results of bio-cell chip showed 100% concordance between previous interphase FISH results. Considering the complete concordance between interphase and metaphase in microdeletion syndrome, the application of interphase FISH without performing metaphase FISH can be a screening test for microdeletion syndrome. Confirmation by metaphase FISH can be performed only in cases with abnormal results by interphase FISH."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genomic imprinting disorder predominantly caused by the absence of paternally expressed imprinted genes at chromosome 15q11.2-q13. The PCSK1 gene is vital for the processing of hypothalamic POMC to ACTH and α-MSH, leading to food intake suppression and increased energy expenditure. The aim of this study was to investigate whether our PWS patient had a defect in genes involved in the hypothalamic melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) pathway. A 27-year-old Greek man with PWS presented to the Adult Endocrine Clinic with morbid obesity and hyperphagia. He also had obstructive sleep apnea, growth hormone deficiency, gonadal failure and metabolic disturbances. At 6 years of age, chromosomal testing confirmed PWS with a deletion in the q11q13 region of the long arm of paternal chromosome 15. At the age of 27 years, further genetic testing was conducted, and next generation sequencing revealed a PCSK1_pN221D_HET mutation which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Our findings suggest that different genetic abnormalities may be present in an individual with PWS and that patients with PWS may need to be investigated for PCSK1 mutations, as the finding may potentially offer a novel treatment perspective for them."

The prevalence of central adrenal insufficiency (CAI) using dynamic testing ranges from rare to 60%. We compared routine morning plasma cortisol (MPC) and ACTH levels in large cohorts of PWS and control children to address CAI. Retrospective analysis of MPC and ACTH levels was undertaken in 128 PWS growth hormone (GH)-treated children under medical care before considering dynamic testing for CAI and 128 non-syndromic control children with short stature evaluated for GH deficiency. The average MPC level in PWS was 9.7 ± 3.7 μg/dL with no difference in age, gender or PWS genetic subtype and 13.4 ± 5.7 μg/dL in the control group. MPC levels were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in PWS but in the normal range. The morning plasma ACTH level in the PWS group was 22.1 <b>±</b> 8.0 pg/mL with one individual having an initial low plasma ACTH level (8 pg/mL), but normal upon repeat. MPC levels in PWS are normal and comparable with control children, without evidence or increased risk of CAI. Lower but normal MPC levels were seen in PWS and suggestive of reduced local regeneration of cortisol from cortisone in adipose tissue by the GH-IGF-I system. Hence, MPC measures alone or in combination with ACTH should be considered for initial screening for CAI in PWS but prior to dynamic testing<b>.</b>"

    "abstract": "It is known that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may cause neurologic damage. Rapid-onset obesity, hypoventilation, hypothalamus dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) syndrome is a disease of unknown etiology with a progressive course and unclear outcomes. The etiology of ROHHAD syndrome includes genetic, epigenetic, paraneoplastic, and immune-mediated theories, but to our knowledge, viral-associated cases of the disease have not been described yet. Here we present the case of a 4-year-old girl who developed a ROHHAD syndrome-like phenotype after a COVID-19 infection and the results of 5 months of therapy. She had COVID-19 pneumonia, followed by electrolyte disturbances (hypernatremia and hyperchloremia), hypocorticism and hypothyroidism, central hypoventilation-requiring prolonged assisted lung ventilation-bulimia, and progressive obesity with hypertriglyceridemia, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperinsulinemia. The repeated MRI of the brain and hypothalamic-pituitary region with contrast enhancement showed mild post-hypoxic changes. Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome as well as PHOX2B-associated variants was ruled out. Treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and monthly courses of intravenous immunoglobulin led to a dramatic improvement. Herein the first description of ROHHAD-like syndrome is timely associated with a previous COVID-19 infection with possible primarily viral or immune-mediated hypothalamic involvement."

    "abstract": "Despite the increased use of array comparative genomic hybridisation, duplications of Xq remain rarely reported in the literature. Xq21.1q21.31 duplication has previously been reported only once in a boy with features of Prader Willi syndrome (PWS). We report 2 malesiblings with maternally inherited duplication of Xq21.1q21.31 who demonstrate a variable phenotype. The proband has Prader Willi-like features such as global developmental delay, autism, obesity, short hands, and small genitalia with a history of food seeking behaviour, while his younger brother has isolated speech delay with some autistic features under evaluation. Both siblings have features such as bitemporal narrowing and small hands. It is therefore likely that the phenotype of duplications in this region is broader than PWS phenocopy, and further cases would be required to elucidate this."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to review bariatric procedure outcomes among patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) mutations, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and hypothalamic obesity. Systematic published literature review used the following search terms: \"Prader-Willi syndrome,\" \"Bardet-Biedl syndrome,\" \"hyperphagia,\" \"bariatric surgery,\" \"MC4R\"/\"melanocortin 4 receptor\", \"hypothalamic obesity,\" and \"bariatric procedure.\" Information collected included demographics, genetics, anthropometry, procedure type, outcomes, and complications, with inclusion of case series and clinical reports given the rarity of the disorders. For PWS, postoperative weight-change percentage and BMI up to 14 years following surgery were analyzed using general linear mixed models, with descriptive outcomes for other conditions. A total of 54 publications were identified, with variable follow-up periods for 202 patients (114 with PWS, 43 with MC4R mutations, 7 with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and 38 with hypothalamic obesity) among bariatric procedures. Weight loss of patients with PWS was greatest within 1 year of surgery, with weight-change percentage not significantly different from 0 at 5 years. Long-term results in other conditions were variable and featured suboptimal weight loss and increased reoperation risk. Bariatric procedures among hyperphagic individuals, including those with PWS, report variable results and outcomes. Benefits of bariatric surgery may be less durable in hyperphagic disorders in comparison with other patients with severe obesity."

It is also unclear if laboratory testing of D-dimer concentration might be useful to screen for thrombosis in PWS. Here, we surveyed the thrombosis history of 883 individuals with PWS and evaluated the D-dimer concentration in a subset of 214 asymptomatic individuals, ages 5-55. A history of at least one blood clot was reported by 3.6% of respondents. Thrombosis increased with age, but no significant difference was found on the basis of sex or family history. Genetic subtype was a significant factor when considering only those with a known subtype, and individuals with a history of edema had significantly more blood clots. In the D-dimer sub-study, ≈15% of participants had high D-dimer concentrations, and 3.7% had D-dimer values more than twice the normal upper limit. One participant with a high D-dimer result was found to have a blood clot. No significant differences in D-dimer results were found on the basis of age, sex, genetic subtype, family history of blood clots, edema history, or BMI. The D-dimer test does not appear to be a sensitive and specific screening tool for blood clots in asymptomatic individuals with PWS."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare, genetic, multisymptomatic, neurodevelopmental disease commonly associated with sleep alterations, including sleep-disordered breathing and central disorders of hypersomnolence. Excessive daytime sleepiness represents the main manifestation that should be addressed by eliciting the detrimental effects on quality of life and neurocognitive function from the patients' caregivers. Patients with PWS have impaired ventilatory control and altered pulmonary mechanics caused by hypotonia, respiratory muscle weakness, scoliosis and obesity. Consequently, respiratory abnormalities are frequent and, in most cases, severe, particularly during sleep. Adults with PWS frequently suffer from sleep apnoea syndrome, sleep hypoxemia and sleep hypoventilation. When excessive daytime sleepiness persists after adequate control of sleep-disordered breathing, a sleep study on ventilatory treatment, followed by an objective measurement of excessive daytime sleepiness, is recommended. These tests frequently identify central disorders of hypersomnolence, including narcolepsy, central hypersomnia or a borderline hypersomnolent phenotype. The use of wake-enhancing drugs (modafinil, pitolisant) is discussed in multidisciplinary expert centres for these kinds of cases to ensure the right balance between the benefits on quality of life and the risk of psychological and cardiovascular side effects."

To study body composition, we analyzed percentage of fat mass, percentage of lean mass, and muscle-mass surrogate variables from dual X-ray absorptiometry. Biochemical parameters analyzed included IGF-I, glucose metabolism, and myokines (myostatin, irisin, and IL6). To explore muscle function, we used dynamometer-measured handgrip strength, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). To study brain activation, we acquired functional magnetic resonance images during three motor tasks of varying complexity. After one year of treatment, we observed an increase in lean mass and its surrogates, a decrease in fat mass, improvements in TUG test and BBS scores, and increased neural activation in certain cerebellar areas. The treatment did not significantly worsen glucose metabolism, and no side-effects were reported. Our findings support the benefits of rhGH treatment in adults with Prader-Willi syndrome and growth-hormone deficiency on body composition and suggest that it may also improve balance and brain neural activation."

Baseline amyloid burden was strongly associated to cortical thinning progression, especially in the temporo-parietal regions. At TP3, tau deposition negatively correlated with cortical atrophy in regions where tau usually accumulates at later Braak stages. <b>Discussion</b>: A higher amount of amyloid accumulation triggers a cascade of changes of disease-causing processes that eventually lead to dementia. As expected, we found that regions where tau usually accumulates were those also displaying high levels of cortical atrophy."

In this study, we aim to evaluate dynamic changes in the quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) spectrum during attention tasks in patients with PWS. <b>Method:</b> From January to June 2019, 10 patients with PWS and 10 age-matched neurotypical control participants were recruited at Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital. Each participant completed Conners' continuous performance test, third edition (CPT-3), tasks with simultaneous EEG monitoring. The dynamic changes in the quantitative EEG spectrum between the resting state and during CPT-3 tasks were compared. <b>Results:</b> Behaviorally, patients with PWS experienced significant attention problems, indicated by the high scores for several CPT-3 variables. The theta/beta ratio of the resting-state EEG spectrum revealed no significant differences between the control participants and patients with PWS. During CPT-3 tasks, a significant decrease in the alpha power was noted in controls compared with that in patients with PWS. The attention-to-resting alpha power ratio was positively correlated with many CPT-3 variables. After adjusting for genotype, age, intelligence, and body mass index, the attention-to-resting alpha power ratio was still significantly correlated with participants' commission errors. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study provides evidence that attention problems are frequently observed in patients with PWS, while attention impairment can be demonstrated by dynamic changes in the quantitative EEG spectrum."

Patients with PWS show abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) patterns. However, there are very few reports on EEG findings in patients with SYS. A SYS patient was included in this study. Detailed neurological examinations and EEG were performed from neonate to infant ages. Sanger sequencing was performed. Our patient presented abnormal EEG findings and had diffuse brain dysfunction symptoms including a reduced level of consciousness, diminished spontaneous movements, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and hypoventilation from early after birth. As she grew older and her background activity of EEG normalized, her neurodevelopmental symptoms remained but improved. Sanger sequencing of this patient revealed a novel, heterozygous c.2005C > T, truncating mutation in the MEGAL2 gene. We described an SYS-associated, time-dependent, EEG pattern in a patient with SYS. Our findings of longitudinal EEG changes in a patient with SYS revealed a specific pattern of how affected individuals develop brain function."

Mean age at the time of first admission was 27 ± 7 years, body weight (BW) was 97 kg ± 29 kg and height was 1.53 ± 0.09 m. Twenty-four patients (40%) showed BW loss after 6 years of follow-up, seventeen (28%) remained stable and nineteen (32%) gained BW. Responsiveness in term of BW reduction was less frequent in patients with the UPD karyotype, karyotype del15 being more frequent among responsive patients. Furthermore, responsive PWS subjects had a higher BMI (47 vs. 36 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), waist (123 vs. 106 cm) and hip (136 vs. 118 cm) circumferences than non-responsive at the time of first hospitalization.

We compared two variables necessary to diagnose intellectual disability: intellectual performance, using the Weschler scales, and adaptive behavior, using the DABS scale. The scores were analyzed by means of non-parametric statistical tests. Group 1 (<i>n</i> = 10) obtained higher and statistically significant scores in Total Intelligence Quotient (TIQ), General Ability Index (GAI), and General Adaptive Behavior (GAB), implying better cognitive and adaptive performance compared to Group 2.

A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed in 180 patients with genetically confirmed PWS (96 females), aged 17.6 ± 12 years. Eighty-five subjects (47%) were obese. One hundred and fifty subjects (83.3%) were on GHT, while 30 patients had never been treated. Overall, 150 subjects (83.3%) were affected by scoliosis, 80.2% of children and adolescents and 87.8% of adults. A mild degree of scoliosis was observed in 58 patients (38.7%), moderate in 43 (28.7%) and severe in 49 (32.6%). Median age at diagnosis of scoliosis was 6.3 years, while the severe forms were diagnosed earlier (median age: 3.8 years). The cumulative probability at 5 years of age was equal to 0.403 and almost doubled at 15 years. No significant associations were found between scoliosis and genotype, gender, pubertal stage, GHT and BMI. A corset was prescribed to 75 subjects (50%) at a median age of 7.5 years, while 26 subjects (17.3%) underwent surgery at a median age of 13.1 years. Our data indicate that scoliosis is one of the major concerns for PWS patients that increases with age, and therefore suggest the need for regular systematic monitoring of spinal deformity from paediatric age."

A 34-year-old pregnant woman underwent noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) in a hospital that was not certified by the Japanese Association of Medical Sciences. The results of trisomy 13, 18, and 21 were negative; however, a possible abnormality in chromosome 15 was indicated by the Z-score. Genetic counseling was not performed; thus, the woman did not understand the implication of this result. Therefore, she continued with the pregnancy and delivered a boy weighing 1892 g with hypogonadism at 38 weeks and 5 days. The infant was diagnosed with Prader-Willi syndrome caused by uniparental disomy derived from trisomy rescue. The NIPT results may have reflected placental mosaicism, emphasizing the importance of understanding the limitations of NIPT due to the presence of congenital chromosomal abnormalities that cannot be detected by NIPT platforms."

While this suggests functional involvements of subcortical, limbic, and brainstem areas, developmental abnormalities in such structures remain to be investigated systematically. Twenty-one Japanese individuals with PWS and 32 healthy controls with typical development were included. T<sub>1</sub>-weighted three-dimensional structural magnetic resonance images were analyzed for subcortical, limbic, and brainstem structural volumes, with age as a covariate, using a model-based automatic segmentation tool. Correlations were determined between each volume measurement and behavioral characteristics as indexed by questionnaires and block test scores for hyperphagia (HQ), autistic and obsessional traits, non-verbal intelligence (IQ), and maladaptive behavior (VABS_mal). Compared with the control group, the PWS group showed significantly reduced relative volume ratios per total intracranial volume (TIV) in thalamus, amygdala, and brainstem structures, along with TIV and native volumes in all substructures. While the brainstem volume ratio was significantly lower in all age ranges, amygdala volume ratios were significantly lower during early adulthood and negatively correlated to HQ and VABS_mal but positively correlated to Kohs IQ. Thus, limbic and brainstem volume alterations and differential volume trajectories may contribute to the developmental and behavioral pathophysiology of PWS."

The purpose of this study was to determine the inter- and intra-observer reliability of the assessment tool in a population of infants with PWS. This was a reliability and agreement study. This was a cross-sectional study with15 infants with PWS born at an average gestational age of 38 weeks. Standardized video recordings of 15 infants with PWS (corrected ages of 3 to 5 months) were independently assessed by three observers. Kappa and ICC statistics were applied in inter- and intra- observer reliability analyses. The overall reliability ICC values of the \"Motor Optimality Score\" (MOS) ranged from 0.84 to 0.98, and the pairwise agreement ranged between 0.86 and 0.95 for inter- observe reliability. In addition, ICC values for the MOS ranged between 0.95 and 0.98 for tester agreement in intra-observer reliability. Complete agreement reliability (100%) was achieved in the subcategories of \"Fidgety Movements\" and \"Movement Character\" for the inter- and intra-observer reliability. Moderate to high inter- and intra-observer reliability were found in the subcategories of \"Repertoire of Co-Existent Other Movements\", \"Quality of Other Movements\" and \"Posture\", with kappa values ranging between 0.63 and 1.00. There were high levels of inter-and intra-observer agreement in the \"Assessment of Motor Repertoire-3 to 5 Months\" for infants with PWS.

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome arises as a consequence of absent paternal copies of maternally imprinted genes at 15q11-13. Such gender-of-origin imprinted genes are expressed in the brain and also in mammalian placenta where paternally expressed imprinted genes drive foetal nutritional demand. We hypothesise that the PWS phenotype is the result of the genotype impacting two pathways: first, directly on brain development and secondly, on placental nutritional pathways that results in its down-regulation and relative foetal starvation. The early PWS phenotype establishes the basis for the later characteristic phenotype. Hyperphagia. and other phenotypic characteristics arise as a consequence of impaired hypothalamic development. Hypothalamic feeding pathways become set in a state indicative of starvation, with a high satiety threshold and a dysfunctional neurophysiological state due to incorrect representations of reward needs, based on inputs that indicate a false requirement for food. Our hypotheses, if confirmed, would lead to novel and effective interventions."

The objective of this study was to examine whether daytime sleepiness was associated with these emotional/behavioral problems, independent of nighttime sleep-disordered breathing, or the duration of sleep. Caregivers of individuals with PWS (aged 3 to 25 years) completed the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ), Epworth Sleepiness Scale for Children and Adolescents (ESS-CHAD), and the parent version of the Developmental Behavior Checklist (DBC-P). Sleep adequacy was adjusted for age by computing sleep duration against age-specific recommendations. The associations between ESS-CHAD and the total DBC and its subscale scores were evaluated by linear regression, adjusted for sleep-related breathing difficulties, sleep adequacy, and body mass index (BMI). There were 54 responses for individuals with PWS (including 22 males) aged 4.4-24.0 (mean 12.5) years. Daytime sleepiness predicted a substantial proportion of the variance in total DBC-P scores in the unadjusted model (28%; β = 0.028; p < 0.001) and when adjusted for sleep adequacy, BMI, and sleep-related breathing difficulties (29%; β = 0.023; p = 0.007). This relationship was not moderated by BMI Z-scores, but the relationship was more prominent for children younger than 12 years than for children older than 12 years.Conclusions: These findings provide preliminary novel evidence that daytime sleepiness may drive the expression of emotional/behavioral disturbances, and should be explored as a potential modifiable risk factor for these disturbances in PWS, particularly pre-adolescent children."

The objective of this study is to investigate the relationships of LM and FM, particularly fat distribution, with bone mineral parameters. This is a retrospective and cross-sectional study.

LM, FM, and BMD and bone mineral content in the total body less head and the lumbar spine were measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, in addition to subcutaneous/visceral adipose tissue (SAT/VAT), and the ratio of VAT to SAT (V/S) by computed tomography at the umbilical level. Bone mineral apparent density was calculated to correct for bone size. LM positively correlated with bone mineral parameters after controlling for age, sex, growth hormone (GH) treatment, and FM. Although FM did not correlate with bone mineral parameters, compartment-specific analysis revealed that SAT positively and V/S negatively correlated with bone mineral parameters after controlling for age, sex, GH treatment and LM. A compartment-specific effect of FM on bone mineral parameters was noted such that SAT was a positive predictor for BMD independent of LM in prepubertal children with PWS."

Impaired social responsiveness was identified in 20 (76.9%) participants, and manifest to marked difficulties in social functioning were identified in 13 (50%). Participants with impaired social responsiveness (SRS ≥ 60) had significantly worse scores in functionality measured with the PSP (U = 12.5; p = 0.009) and with three of the four PSP main areas. Moreover, scores for the Social Cognition domain of the SRS correlated positively with the Socially useful activities (p < 0.05) and Personal and social relationships (p < 0.01) main areas of the PSP. These results suggest that difficulties in social skills should be assessed in all psychosocial evaluations of patients with PWS."

    "title": "Free Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF)-I in Children with PWS.",
    "abstract": "In children with Prader−Willi syndrome (PWS), the standard growth hormone (GH) dose often results in high immunoreactive IGF-I levels. These high immunoreactive IGF-I levels lead to concern because their long-term effects are unknown. As a result, clinicians have to lower the GH dose, which worsens body composition and quality of life. As clinical features do not seem to correspond to immunoreactive IGF-I values, it is questionable whether immunoreactive IGF-I is a suitable marker for GH dosing, or whether another parameter better reflects IGF-I bioavailability and bioactivity. We, therefore, investigate serum immunoreactive IGF-I, free IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels in 70 GH-treated children with PWS. Our study showed that, although immunoreactive IGF-I levels were high (>2 SDS) in the vast majority of prepubertal and pubertal children, free IGF-I SDS levels were <0 SDS in most and <1 SDS in all. Free IGF-I correlated with the immunoreactive IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 ratio. We conclude that there is a major discrepancy between immunoreactive and free IGF-I levels. While in the majority of GH-treated children with PWS, immunoreactive IGF-I levels were high, free IGF-I levels were <0 SDS in most. Our data appear to be very reassuring and suggest that free IGF-I levels should also be taken into consideration when the immunoreactive IGF-I levels are >2 SDS in GH-treated children with PWS."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic disorder requiring interdisciplinary team monitoring and intensive care by parents. So far there is little information on people with PWS in Brazil. Our aim was to describe health problems and treatments used by people with PWS in Brazil and their relationship to their parents' quality of life. Parents answered questionnaires about their child's medical and exercise history, behavior problems, sociodemographic characteristics, and their own quality of life. Results: The responses of the participants showed similar health problems as in other countries. Anxiety and tantrums were the behavioral problems most commonly cited by parents. Parents of people with PWS had lower scores in respect of quality of life than the Brazilian population. Behavioral problems in individuals with PWS were negatively associated with their parents' quality of life. Behavioral and medical conditions in the children were associated with reduced quality of life in the parents. We conclude that heath care should not only be directed toward those with PWS, but also their parents."

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to validate the Italian version of the Hyperphagia Questionnaire (HQ), a 11-items questionnaire developed to assess hyperphagia in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). This is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by endocrine dysfunction, hypotonia, intellectual disability, psychiatric disorders and obesity. Parents of 219 individuals with PWS (age range 3-54 years; M<sub>age</sub> = 17.90; 108 Males), recruited in 12 hospitals in Italy responded to HQ during routine visits. In function of the level of analyses the sample was divided into two subgroups (<18> years) or into four age-subgroups (2.5-4.5; 4.5-8; 8-18; >18 years) corresponding to different clinical stages. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the three hyperphagic subdimensions of the original structure (behavior, drive, and severity), but one item was dropped out, reducing the final version to 10 items. Using multi-group CFA, HQ showed satisfactory indexes of measurement invariance by age. Good indexes of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's Omega coefficients) were found for each subdimension. The three hyperphagia subdimensions positively converged with other food-related measures: emotional overeating, food enjoyment, food responsiveness, and satiety responsiveness. A significant increase of all hyperphagic subdimensions was found across age groups. Higher hyperphagic levels were found in participants with higher body mass index. Hyperphagic drive differently increased in function of the interaction between age and underlying genetic mechanisms. The Italian version of the HQ is a psychometrically valid and reliable instrument for assessing hyperphagia in individuals with PWS. This tool may prove useful to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacologic and rehabilitative treatments."

    "abstract": "Since the first national guideline for managing obesity in adults and children in Canada was published in 2007, new evidence has emerged and guideline standards have evolved. Our purpose is to describe the protocol used to update the Canadian clinical practice guideline for managing pediatric obesity. This guideline will update the pediatric components of the 2007 Canadian clinical practice guideline for the management of obesity. In partnership with Obesity Canada, we began preliminary work in 2019; activities are scheduled for completion in 2022. The guideline will follow standards developed by the National Academy of Medicine and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group. Guideline development will be informed by 5 complementary literature reviews: a scoping review that focuses on clinical assessment in pediatric obesity management and 4 systematic reviews to synthesize evidence regarding families' values and preferences as well as the safety and effectiveness of interventions (psychological and behavioural; pharmacotherapeutic; and surgical). We will use standard systematic review methodology, including summarizing and assessing the certainty of evidence and determining the strength of recommendations. Competing interests will be managed proactively according to recommendations from the Guidelines International Network. Diverse stakeholders, including families and clinicians, will be engaged throughout guideline development. The guideline will support Canadian families and clinicians to make informed, value-sensitive and evidence-based clinical decisions related to managing pediatric obesity. The guideline and accompanying resources for end-users will be published in English and French, and we will partner with Obesity Canada to optimize dissemination using integrated and end-of-project knowledge translation."

    "abstract": "The present study investigated decision-making in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) using the Soochow Gambling Task (SGT). The objective was to assess whether adults with PWS have impaired hot executive functions and whether the deficit is specific to PWS or linked to intellectual disabilities. The SGT performance of 26 adults with PWS was compared to that of 26 healthy adults matched on chronological age, and to that of 26 adults with intellectual disabilities but without PWS, matched on intellectual quotient level and chronological age. The PWS adults showed an absence of learning pattern over trials in the SGT, unlike the healthy individuals, and showed equivalent performances to adults with intellectual disabilities. The results suggest a deficit of hot executive functions in PWS, which is linked to intellectual disabilities and not specific to the syndrome."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes that tVNS has the potential to be a new treatment for some of the behaviour difficulties that may affect people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism, particularly those people born with specific neurodevelopmental syndromes. Behaviours, such as emotional outbursts, physical aggression, and self-injury are a relative common occurrence in these groups and have a significant impact on wellbeing and quality of life for the individuals and their families. Such behaviours have generally been understood through the lens of learning theory, the likelihood of their occurrence being shaped and reinforced by the responses of others. However, when vagus nerve stimulation has been used to treat epilepsy improvements in cognition, behaviour, and general wellbeing have been noted suggesting that with these behaviours other causal mechanisms are also important. More recently incidental findings from a proof of concept study where vagus nerve stimulation was given, using an implanted device, to people with the genetically determined neurodevelopmental disorder, Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), findings of benefit supported the above view. A second study, this time using tVNS, reported a similar result. In this paper we review the evidence for the use of tVNS for behavioural problems, consider the challenges when conducting trials in this population, and reflect on what the preliminary observations in people with PWS tell us about the possible mechanisms that underpin such behaviours."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a human genetic condition that affects up to 1 in 10,000 live births. Affected infants present with hypotonia and developmental delay. Hyperphagia and increasing body weight follow unless drastic calorie restriction is initiated. Recently, our laboratory showed that one of the genes in the deleted locus causative for PWS, <i>Snord116</i>, maintains increased expression of hypothalamic <i>Nhlh2</i>, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. We have previously also shown that obese mice with a deletion of <i>Nhlh2</i> respond to a conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) diet with weight and fat loss. In this study, we investigated whether mice with a paternal deletion of <i>Snord116</i> (<i>Snord116<sup>m+/p-</sup></i>) would respond similarly. We found that while <i>Snord116<sup>m+/p-</sup></i> mice and mice with a deletion of both <i>Snord116</i> alleles were not significantly obese on a high-fat diet, they did lose body weight and fat on a high-fat/CLA diet, suggesting that the genotype did not interfere with CLA actions. There were no changes in food intake or metabolic rate, and only moderate differences in exercise performance. RNA-seq and microbiome analyses identified hypothalamic mRNAs, and differentially populated gut bacteria, that support future mechanistic analyses. CLA may be useful as a food additive to reduce obesity in humans with PWS."

    "abstract": "Acylated ghrelin (AG) stimulates appetite and is elevated compared to its unacylated (UAG) counterpart in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). GLWL-01 is a selective, reversible inhibitor of ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT), the enzyme that converts UAG into AG. This work aimed to assess the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of GLWL-01 in the treatment of PWS patients. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 crossover study was conducted with 2 active treatment periods of 28 days in 19 patients (aged 16-65 years; body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28) with genetically confirmed PWS. The study took place in 7 hospital-based study centers in the United States and Canada. Patients received placebo or GLWL-01 (450 mg twice daily) orally after lead-in placebo and washout periods. The Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials and Caregiver Global Impression of Change were used to measure reductions in hyperphagia. Plasma concentrations of AG and UAG were evaluated as correlates. Treatment resulted in statistically significant differences compared to placebo in plasma AG (P = .0002), UAG (P = .0488), and AG/UAG (P = .0003). GLWL-01 did not statistically significantly reduce hyperphagia-related behavior or bring about changes in global clinical end points, as assessed by caregivers. Anthropometric and clinical parameters correlated with obesity did not statistically significantly change in response to treatment. Less than half of patients reported a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). No deaths, serious adverse events, or severe TEAEs were reported. GLWL-01 is safe and well tolerated. Pharmacological parameters confirmed the inhibition of GOAT following administration of GLWL-01. Patients' eating behaviors, BMI, blood glucose, and total cholesterol, among other similar measures, were not modified."

Systematic literature searches were performed in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science from January 2010 to March 2021. Literature selection process, data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Study protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021240455). We included 25 studies in the qualitative synthesis. The estimated prevalence of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) was 1/4,000-10,000 in the general population of children; the prevalence of Short Stature HOmeoboX Containing gene deficiency (SHOX-D) was 1/1,000-2,000 in the general population of children; the birth prevalence of Turner syndrome was 1/2,500; the birth prevalence of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) was 1/15,000. Treatment adherence was suboptimal, with a range of non-adherent patients of 10-30%. The main reasons for suboptimal adherence were forgetfulness, being away from home, pain/discomfort caused by the injection. Economic studies reported a total cost for a complete multi-year course of GH treatment of almost 100,000 euros. A study showed that drug wastage can amount up to 15% of consumption, and that in some Italian regions there could be a considerable over- or under-prescribing. In general, patients and caregivers considered the GH treatment acceptable. There was a general satisfaction among patients with regard to social and school life and GH treatment outcomes, while there was a certain level of intolerance to GH treatment among adolescents. Studies on PWS patients and their caregivers showed a lower quality of life compared to the general population, and that social stigma persists. Growth failure conditions with approved GH treatment in Italy constitute a significant burden of disease in clinical, social, and economic terms. GH treatment is generally considered acceptable by patients and caregivers. The total cost of the GH treatment is considerable; there are margins for improving efficiency, by increasing adherence, reducing drug wastage and promoting prescriptive appropriateness."

This confers a potential utility in revealing autosomal recessive (AR) diseases and uniparental disomy (UPD). Results of genetic testing among pediatric patients from 2015 to 2019 were evaluated. Diagnostic findings with detected ROH from large consecutive case series in the literature were reviewed. Of 2050 pediatric patients, 65 (3%) had one or more ROH and 31 (53%) had follow-up whole exome sequencing (WES) and methylation studies. Seven homozygous variants were detected and four of them from three patients (9.6%) were within the detected ROH and classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for AR diseases. One patient (3%) had segmental UPD15q for a diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome. Additive diagnostic yield from ROH reporting was at least 0.2% (4/2050) of pediatric patients. These results were consistent with findings from several large case series reported in the literature. Detecting ROH had an estimated baseline predictive value of 10% for AR diseases and 3% for UPD. Consanguinity revealed by multiple ROH was a strong predictor for AR diseases. These results provide evidence for genetic counseling and recommendation of follow-up WES and methylation studies for pediatric patients reported with ROH."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex multisystem genetic disorder with distinct genetic and clinical features. Among other clinical symptoms, PWS is characterized by severe infantile hypotonia with feeding problems, childhood onset hyperphagia, obesity, scoliosis, short stature combined with growth hormone deficiency and developmental delay. PWS is associated with facial dysmorphology, orofacial dysfunction, oral abnormalities, low salivary flow and subsequent severe tooth wear. Little is known about the craniofacial growth direction or dental and skeletal relationships in individuals with PWS in different ages. The purpose of this study was to assess the craniofacial and dentoalveolar characteristics and to investigate the craniofacial growth direction separately in children, young adults and adults with PWS, using a cephalometric analysis of lateral cephalograms. Lateral cephalograms of 42 individuals with a confirmed genetic diagnosis of PWS were analysed and divided into three groups according to their age: Children (< 12 years), young adults (12-20 years) and adults (> 20 years). Cephalometric variables were compared between PWS patients and controls by age and sex. Significant deviations and distinct craniofacial patterns were found in children, young adults and adults with PWS compared with the control group. Children showed retrognatic mandible with a skeletal class II relationship, posterior growth direction and longer anterior face height. The young adults had smaller cranial base angle, a skeletal class II pattern and a higher anterior lower face than the control group. Adults with PWS had a prognathic mandible, skeletal class III relationship with anterior growth direction, more retroclined lower incisors and proclined upper incisors than the controls. Similar results were found when comparing the three groups with PWS; the adults had a prognathic mandible, skeletal class III pattern and anterior growth direction. Children had a retropositioned mandibula, skeletal class II relationship and posterior growth direction. This study may contribute to a better understanding of the craniofacial growth pattern in children, young adults and adults with PWS and may have a clinical importance when planning dental treatment, such as prosthodontics and/or orthodontics."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), is a genetically determined neurodevelopmental disorder, associated with intellectual disabilities and a high incidence of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and respiratory disorders. We hypothesised that COVID-19, a viral infection which more severely affects people with these conditions, would, in people with PWS, present atypically and result in severe outcomes. A structured on-line questionnaire was piloted with parents and professionals at the International Prader-Willi Syndrome Organization (IPWSO) and promoted internationally through their global network. Family members/other carers were asked to complete if someone they cared for with PWS was strongly suspected or confirmed as having COVID-19. Over 1 year of the pandemic 72 responses were received, 47 adults, 25 children. The following underlying conditions were present: 16 people with PWS were overweight and 18 obese, five had diabetes mellitus and 18 sleep apnoea. Main presenting symptoms were raised temperature, fatigue/daytime sleepiness, dry cough, headache/pain, and feeling unwell, with illnesses generally lasting less than a week. Length of illness was not significantly related to age, BMI, sex, or genetic subtype. No one was ventilated or in an intensive care unit or died, one person was in hospital for four days needing oxygen. Contrary to our hypothesis, the PWS cohort had asymptomatic infection or mild illness. A possible explanation, supported by anecdotal evidence from parents and professional carers, is that people with PWS have a degree of innate immunity to viral infections. However, likely selection effects and a relatively low number of responses means that further evidence is needed to test this hypothesis."

With predisposing risk factors present for rectal damage and prolapse in this syndrome, the incidence must be higher and therefore underreported. These risk factors include skin and rectal picking, self-stimulation, altered pain sensation, decreased muscle mass, strength and physical activity with hypotonia, and gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances. Pertinent literature was reviewed and analyzed that focused on clinical features and behavior seen in PWS as underrecognized risk factors for developing rectal damage and prolapse. An illustrative case is presented as the second patient reported with PWS and a prolapsed rectum. A discussion of predisposing behavioral and clinical risk factors is presented including for self-stimulation, rectal picking, chronic constipation, decreased gut motility, reduced water intake, and a restricted diet. Although a paucity of cases do exist, physical, behavioral, and GI findings common in PWS may contribute to rectal prolapse requiring better awareness and proactive surveillance, management, and treatment protocols for patients affected with this rare obesity-related genetic disorder."

    "abstract": "Clinical experience and a growing body of evidence suggest that sleep disturbances are common in people with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). PWS is a rare neuroendocrine disorder characterized by early hypotonia and feeding difficulties; developmental delays; endocrinopathies; and behavioral concerns, especially rigidity, anxiety, and behavioral outbursts. PWS is also characterized by decreased resting energy expenditure and transition to hyperphagia and obesity. We propose that, for many people with PWS, clinical diagnosis and management of sleep disorders is an unmet need. We present current information to suggest disordered sleep is a significant burden for individuals with PWS and often overlooked. While central and obstructive sleep apnea are more widely recognized in PWS, other sleep disorders have increasingly gained recognition, including hypersomnia, narcolepsy-like phenotypes, and insomnia. Sleep disorders can impact behavior, cognition, and quality of life and health for individuals with PWS. Our goal is to bring sleep disorders to the forefront of therapeutic intervention for patients with PWS. This paper presents a review of the literature and recommendations for clinical practice based on published research and our clinical experience as sleep specialists, geneticists, psychiatrists, pediatricians, otolaryngologists, and pulmonologists with extensive experience with this patient population. We recommend that management of sleep be considered an integral part of successful medical management of PWS. Further research concerning sleep problems in PWS is urgently needed to develop best practices and work toward a consensus statement for medical management to meet the needs of people with PWS.

Children with NDDs frequently suffer from sleep disturbances, with a higher prevalence than that of the general pediatric population. These problems tend to be chronic and may cause additional cognitive and behavioral difficulties, often affecting the whole family's well-being. Sleep behaviors are also related to other important developmental skills, such as attention and listening. Investigating sleep disorders in children with NDDs is therefore crucial in clinical practice. For a systematic approach in clinical practice, we propose the use of a short and easy to remember sleep screening tool."

We characterized the perinatal and neonatal features of PWS, compared them with those of healthy newborns and assessed the prenatal and neonatal differences between the genetic subtypes. A cohort study in children with PWS. The prevalence of variables was compared with healthy infants (PLUTO cohort) and to population statistics from literature. 244 infants with PWS and 365 healthy infants. Data on prenatal and neonatal variables in both cohorts. Population statistics were collected through an extensive literature search. A higher prevalence of maternal age >35 years was found in PWS compared to healthy infants and population statistics, and the highest maternal age was found in the mUPD group. Higher prevalence of polyhydramnios, caesarean section, labour induction and breech presentation, and lower birth weight SDS was found in PWS compared to healthy infants. High prevalences of decreased fetal movements (78.5%), hypotonia (100%), cryptorchism (95.9%) and poor sucking/tube feeding (93.9%) were found in PWS. This study presents an overview of prenatal and neonatal variables in infants with PWS compared to healthy infants.

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare, multisystemic, genetic disorder involving the hypothalamus. It is caused by loss of expression of paternally inherited genes in chromosome 15 q11-13 region. The estimated incidence is around 1 in 20.000 births. PWS is characterized by a complex lifelong trajectory involving neurodevelopmental, nutritional, endocrine, metabolic, and behavioral changes. The major symptoms are hypotonia, short stature, hypogonadism, and eating disorders ranging from anorexia in infancy to hyperphagia, a deficit of satiety, and a high risk of severe obesity. The patients display intellectual disability comprising cognitive deficit, delayed motor and language development, learning deficits, impaired social skills, and emotional regulation. Behavioral features including temper outbursts, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms and rigidity are common and become more apparent with increasing age. Almost all have hypogonadism and growth hormone deficiency. Central adrenal insufficiency is rare whereas central hypothyroidism occurs in up to 30% of children with PWS. The prevalence of obesity increases with age from almost none in early childhood to more than 90% in adulthood. Up to 25% of adults with obesity have type 2 diabetes. Obesity and its complications are the major causes of comorbidity and mortality in PWS. As there is no specific treatment, care consists of comprehensive management of feeding disorders, a restricted, controlled diet, regular exercise, hormone substitution, and screening and treatment of comorbidities. Here we present the course of PWS from birth to adulthood in 2 patients and discuss their symptoms in relation to the literature."

Clinical manifestations of PWS depends on age. In early infancy, PWS patients is characterized by hypotonia and failure to thrive. Later in life, they can also exhibit hyperphagia, obesity, short stature, hypogonadism, behavioral issues and cognitive disability. Multiple sleep abnormalities including obstructive and/or central sleep apnea, daytime hypersomnolence, and impaired responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia have been described in patients with PWS. Recent studies also demonstrated an increased risk of seizures in PWS patients. Electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) is an age-limited epilepsy with various seizure types, neurophysiological and motor impairment. The classic electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern of ESES involves continuous epileptic activity at 2-3 Hz occupying greater than 85% of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Treatment of the ESES syndrome consists of anti-epileptic drugs in routine cases, and corticosteroids, gamma globulins, the ketogenic diet, and surgery in refractory cases. In this project, we describe ESES during polysomnography in a 5-year-old female with PWS and no history of seizure disorder. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report on ESES in a PWS patient."

Subjects were paired with an opposite-sex mate at 30 months of age (one year post-treatment). We examined pair affiliative behavior in the home cage during the first four months and tested for behavioral components of pair bonding at one week and four months post-pairing. We assessed long-term changes in brain glucose uptake using <sup>18</sup>FDG positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Our results showed that OXT-treated animals were more affiliative across a number of measures, including tail twining, compared to SAL treated subjects (tail twining is considered the \"highest\" type of affiliation in titi monkeys). Neuroimaging showed no treatment differences in glucose uptake between SAL and OXT-treated animals; however, females showed higher glucose uptake in whole brain at 23 months, and in both the whole brain and the social salience network at 33 months of age compared to males. Our results suggest that chronic IN OXT administration during development can have long-term effects on adult social behavior."

This qualitative case study aimed to identify and describe lifestyle themes of an adolescent with PWS that resulted in maintenance of a healthy body mass index (BMI). The 16-year-old female demonstrated failure to thrive upon birth and underwent 9 months supplemented tube feeding, achieving 50<sup>th</sup> percentile weight for height. Throughout childhood she received treatment of physical, occupational, and speech therapies, and has maintained a healthy BMI ranging from 25-50<sup>th</sup> percentile weight for height. Two video interviews were completed separately. Qualitative analysis of the transcribed data identified two overarching themes for maintaining a healthy BMI in this adolescent: 1) adolescent and parent individual characteristics; and 2) family dynamics and lifestyle. Adolescent and parental characteristics included: high level of cognitive function for diagnosis, mild hyperphagia, desire for a regimented schedule, parental type A personalities, intentionality in parental decisions/actions. Family lifestyle characteristics included strong parental involvement and well-defined expectations for their daughter, purposeful integration of physical activity into lifestyle, and presence of a strong family support system. The convergence of multiple optimal influences provided an ideal health outcome in the adolescent."

    "title": "Neuropsychiatric features of Prader-Willi syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by hypotonia and poor feeding in infancy which progresses to hyperphagia in early-mid childhood, as well as developmental delays, a spectrum of behavioral and psychiatric concerns, endocrinopathies, orthopedic issues, and less commonly, seizures, sleep apnea, and narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. This study used data in the Global PWS Registry (N = 893) to explore the onset and severity over time of the neuropsychiatric features reported in individuals with PWS and explored its associations with sleep disorders, seizures, and psychiatric symptoms. Results demonstrate that seizures are more common in the deletion subtype and that narcolepsy and cataplexy are more common in individuals who have sleep-related seizures. Finally, this work shows that anxiety and compulsive behaviors are persistent features of PWS that may arise early in childhood, and that anxiety is associated with higher frequency of other comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. In conclusion, this study is one of the largest to date characterizing sleep disorders and neuropsychiatric characteristics of individuals with PWS and reports on the novel association between sleep disorders and seizures. This study is also one of the first to offer details on the nature of the progression of these features in individuals with PWS."

    "abstract": "Although leptin/melanocortin pathway pathologies in hypothalamus are thought to be the main cause of early-onset obesity and hyperphagia in PWS and BBS, the exact mechanism is still not known. To measure serum concentrations of a-MSH, BDNF and AGRP in a group of children with BBS or PWS. We recruited 12 subjects with PWS, 12 subjects with BBS, 28 obese controls (OC) and 26 lean controls (LC) matched for age, sex and puberty. Serum a-MSH, BDNF and AGRP levels were measured by the ELISA method. The mean a-MSH level was lower in PWS than those of OC and LC (3729 ± 1319, 5211 ± 829 and 5681 ± 565 pg/ml, respectively, p < 0.001), and mean a-MSH was lower in OC than LC (p < 0.05). The mean BDNF level of PWS was higher than those of OC and LC (565 ± 122, 482 ± 102 and 391 ± 74 pg/ml, respectively, p < 0.001). On the other hand, mean a-MSH level of BBS was lower than those of OC and LC (4543 ± 658, 5211 ± 829 and 5681 ± 565 pg/ml, respectively, p < 0.001), and mean a-MSH was lower in OC than LC (p < 0.05). The mean BDNF level of BBS was higher than those of OC and LC (583 ± 115, 482 ± 102 and 391 ± 74 pg/ml, respectively, p < 0.001). Additionally, both in PWS and BBS, the mean BDNF level was higher in OC than LC (p < 0.01). Regarding AGRP level, there was no difference both in BBS and PWS compared to OC. We found that the serum a-MSH levels of PWS and BBS groups are significantly lower compared to those of obese and lean controls. Therefore, we can speculate that the circulating a-MSH level does properly reflect its central production, and the serum a-MSH level might be a good biomarker to detect a-MSH deficiency in individuals suspected to have BBS or PWS, and also in those with POMC, PCSK1, and LEPR deficiency."

    "title": "A Case Report of Hyperestrogenism in Prader-Willi Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is associated with multiple endocrinopathies, including hypogonadism. The mechanism underlying hypogonadism in PWS is thought to be secondary to hypothalamic dysfunction, primary gonadal defect, or a combination of both. Here, we present a case of hyperestrogenism in PWS due to concomitant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and therapeutic considerations regarding hormone replacement therapy (HRT). An 18-year-old woman with PWS transferred to adult care from pediatrics was found to have hyperestrogenism (specifically, elevated estrone with normal estradiol levels). Additionally, she demonstrated oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism, meeting diagnostic criteria for PCOS. After 3 months of therapy with cyclic medroxyprogesterone alone, she developed normal withdrawal bleeding. Given the elevated estrone and normal estradiol levels, our patient's hyperestrogenism is thought to be a direct result of her hyperandrogenism due to peripheral conversion. Prolonged exposure to unopposed estrogen is an established risk factor for endometrial cancer development in PCOS; thus, this was taken into account regarding her HRT, and she was treated with cyclic progesterone alone. Women with PWS are typically treated with combined estrogen and progesterone HRT; however, our case, a unique presentation of PCOS in PWS, demonstrated the importance of tailoring HRT to a patient's specific needs."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder associated with emotional/behavioral disturbances. These difficulties are well documented in the literature, but the positive attributes of these individuals are not described. Taking a strengths-based approach, the aim of this study was to describe the emotional/behavioral strengths and difficulties in children and young people with PWS from their parent caregivers' perspectives. Parent caregivers of 52 individuals with PWS aged 4-24 years (median = 12.1 years; including 22 males) completed the parent form of the Developmental Behavior Checklist (DBC-P), including its original two open-ended questions regarding positive traits. Prevalences of emotional/behavioral disturbances were comparable to those reported in previous literature: common behaviors of concern across studies being skin-picking (75%), impulsivity (69%), poor sense of danger (67%), lying (67%), and tantrums (54%). Total DBC-P scores showed that just over half (n = 28, 54%) had scores indicative of clinically significant behavior problems. However, thematic analysis of caregivers' written comments regarding their children's strengths resolved into three themes: warmth (94%), persistence (41%), and skills (41%). Warmth encompassed friendliness, happiness, and empathy. A strength-based approach to behavioral difficulties in PWS provides a more balanced view of the children and a more holistic foundation for interventions."

    "abstract": "Irisin is a peptide secreted by skeletal muscle following exercise that plays an important role in bone metabolism. Numerous experiments in vitro and in mouse models have shown that the administration of recombinant irisin promotes osteogenesis, protects osteocytes from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, prevents disuse-induced loss of bone and muscle mass, and accelerates fracture healing. Although some aspects still need to be elucidated, such as the dose- and frequency-dependent effects of irisin in cell cultures and mouse models, ample clinical evidence is emerging to support its physiological relevance on bone in humans. A reduction in serum irisin levels, associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures, was observed in postmenopausal women and in both men and women during aging, Recently, cohort studies of subjects with secondary osteoporosis showed that these patients have lower circulating levels of irisin, suggesting that this myokine could be a novel marker to monitor bone quality in this disease. Although there are still few studies, this review discusses the emerging data that are highlighting the involvement of irisin in some diseases that cause secondary osteoporosis."

This study aimed to develop and validate the Pediatric-Youth Hyperphagia Assessment for Prader-Willi syndrome (PYHAP) as a tool targeting children and adolescents. After an extensive literature review and qualitative interviews, the final version of the PYHAP with 14 questions in 3 domains (verbal [5], behavior [4], and social [5]) was developed and tested at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, Korea from July 2018 to September 2019. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed to confirm construct validity. The correlations between the PYHAP and the Korean Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire (K-CEBQ) were calculated to evaluate convergent and discriminant validity. Criterion validity and the validity of the response categories were also tested. Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the PYHAP was 0.91. The fit indices for CFA were good (comparative fit index, 0.87; standardized root mean squared residual, 0.08). The domains of the PYHAP were closely correlated with the relevant domains of the K-CEBQ. The accuracy of the PYHAP score for predicting uncontrolled hyperphagia was good (area under the curve, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.65 to 0.85). The PYHAP was confirmed to be a reliable and valid tool to evaluate hyperphagia in children and adolescents with PWS via caregivers' assessments. It is recommended to use the PYHAP to communicate with parents or caregivers about patients' hyperphagia or to monitor and manage extreme behaviors in children with PWS."

    "abstract": "Skin barrier damage is present in the patients with hereditary disorders of the magnesium channel, but the molecular mechanism has not been fully understood. We found that the expressions of hyaluronan synthase (HAS), HAS2 and HAS3 are influenced by MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration in human keratinocyte-derived HaCaT cells. The exposure of cells to a high concentration (5.8 mM) of MgCl<sub>2</sub> induced the elevation of HAS2/3 expression, which was inhibited by mRNA knockdown of nonimprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome-like domain containing 4 (NIPAL4). Similarly, the content of hyaluronic acid (HA) was changed according to MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration and the expression of NIPAL4. The MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation increased the reporter activities of HAS2/3, which were inhibited by NIPAL4 knockdown, indicating that the expressions of HAS2/3 are up-regulated at the transcriptional level. The reporter activities and mRNA levels of HAS2/3, and the production of HA were inhibited by CHIR-99021, a glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) inhibitor, and naphthol AS-E, a cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB) inhibitor. Furthermore, the mutation in putative CREB-binding sites of promoter region in HAS2/3 genes inhibited the MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation-induced elevation of promoter activity. Our results indicate that the expressions of HAS2/3 are up-regulated by MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation in HaCaT cells mediated through the activation of GSK3 and CREB. Magnesium may play a pivotal role in maintaining the skin barrier function and magnesium supplementation may be useful to enhance moisturization and wound repair in the skin."

While higher magnetic fields have certain advantages, optimized techniques with specific considerations are required to ensure rational and safe use in children and those with pediatric neurological disorders (PNDs). Here, we summarize our initial experience with clinical translational studies that utilized 7 tesla (T)-MRI in the fields of developmental neurology. T2-reversed images and three-dimensional anisotropy contrast imaging enabled the depiction of targeted pathological brain structures with better spatial resolution. Diffusion imaging and susceptibility-weighted imaging enabled visualization of intracortical, subcortical, and intratumoral microstructures <i>in vivo</i> within highly limited scan times appropriate for patients with PNDs. 7T-MRI appears to have significant potential to enhance the depiction of the structural and functional properties of the brain, particularly those associated with atypical brain development."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare complex genetic disorder that results from a lack of expression of the paternally inherited chromosome 15q11-q13. PWS is characterized by hypotonia and feeding difficulty in early infancy and development of morbid obesity aggravated by uncontrolled hyperphagia after childhood and adolescent. Dysmorphic facial features, delayed motor and language development, various degrees of cognitive impairment, and behavioral problems are common in PWS. Without early, intensive nutritional therapy along with behavioral modification, PWS patients develop severe obesity associated with type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, right-side heart failure, and other obesity-related metabolic complications. Hypothalamic dysfunction in PWS can lead to several endocrine disorders, including short stature with growth hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, central adrenal insufficiency, and hypogonadism. In this review, we discuss the natural history of PWS and the mechanisms of hyperphagia and obesity. We also provide an update on obesity treatments and recommendations for screening and monitoring of various endocrine problems that can occur in PWS."

Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) is one of the molecular techniques used to analyze this syndrome. This study aimed to evaluate the concordance of the test results of MS-MLPA with conventional techniques in the diagnosis of PWS in Thai patients. Forty leftover specimens from routine genetic testing (MS-PCR and FISH) were tested to obtain MS-MLPA results. By comparison, perfect concordance was shown between the result of MS-MLPA and those of conventional techniques. In conclusion, MS-MLPA is an accurate and cost-effective assay that can be used to confirm PWS diagnosis with explicit deletion of affected genes."

    "abstract": "Newborn screening for Angelman syndrome (AS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), and chromosome 15 duplication syndrome (Dup15q) may lead to benefit from early diagnosis and treatment. To examine the feasibility of newborn screening for these chromosome 15 imprinting disorders at population scale. In this diagnostic study, the validation data set for the first-tier SNRPN test, called methylation-specific quantitative melt analysis (MS-QMA), included 109 PWS, 48 AS, 9 Dup15q, and 1190 population control newborn blood spots (NBS) and peripheral tissue samples from participants recruited from January 2000 to December 2016. The test data set included NBS samples from 16 579 infants born in 2011. Infants with an NBS identified as positive for PWS, AS, or Dup15q by the first-tier test were referred for droplet digital polymerase chain reaction, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and low-coverage whole-genome sequencing for confirmatory testing. Data analyses were conducted between February 12, 2015, and August 15, 2020. In the validation data set, the median age for the 77 patients with PWS was 3.00 years (IQR, 0.01-44.50 years); for the 46 patients with AS, 2.76 years (IQR, 0.028 to 49.00 years); and for the 9 patients with Dup15q, 4.00 years (IQR, 1.00 to 28.00 years). Thirty-eight patients (51.4%) in the PWS group, 20 patients (45.5%) in the AS group, and 6 patients (66.7%) in the Dup15q group who had sex reported were male. The validation data set showed MS-QMA sensitivity of 99.0% for PWS, 93.8% for AS, and 77.8% for Dup15q; specificity of 100% for PWS, AS, and Dup15q; positive predictive and negative predictive values of 100% for PWS and AS; and a positive predictive value of 87.5% and negative predictive value of 100% for Dup15q. In the test data set of NBS samples from 16 579 infants, 92 had a positive test result using a methylation ratio cut-off of 3 standard deviations from the mean. Of these patients, 2 were confirmed to have PWS; 2, AS; and 1, maternal Dup15q. With the use of more conservative PWS- and AS-specific thresholds for positive calls from the validation data set, 9 positive NBS results were identified by MS-QMA in this cohort. The 2 PWS and 2 AS calls were confirmed by second-tier testing, but the 1 Dup15q case was not confirmed. Together, these results provided prevalence estimates of 1 in 8290 for both AS and PWS and 1 in 16 579 for maternal Dup15q, with positive predictive values for first-tier testing at 67.0% for AS, 33.0% for PWS, and 44.0% for combined detection of chromosome 15 imprinting disorders for the validation data set. The findings of this diagnostic study suggest that it is feasible to screen for all chromosome 15 imprinting disorders using SNRPN methylation analysis, with 5 individuals identified with these disorders out of 16 579 infants screened."

    "abstract": "Rare genetic forms of obesity are linked to impaired energy balance (i.e., eating behaviour and energy expenditure) involving hypothalamic pathways. More than 60 genes coding for proteins located in the hypothalamic leptin/melanocortin pathway contribute to the development of these rare forms of obesity. The ambition of the French National Protocol for the Diagnosis and Care (PNDS) of Obesity of Rare Causes was to establish practical recommendations for assessment and management at all ages. This report is available on the website of the French Health Authority (HAS). In addition to severe obesity, patients often display obesity-related comorbidities and neuropsychological/psychiatric disorders. These complex conditions make clinical management particularly challenging. Early diagnosis is critical for the organization of coordinated specialized multidisciplinary care, with mandatory interaction between caregivers, social partners and families. Strategies to prevent aggravation of obesity consist in limiting access to food, establishing a reassuring daily eating environment, and the practice of sustained adapted supervised daily physical activity. The implementation of genetic diagnosis in clinical practice now enables a personalized medicine approach with access to new drug therapies, and improves the analysis of the risk/benefit ratio of bariatric surgery."

    "abstract": "Gut-microbiota-targeted nutrition intervention has achieved success in the management of obesity, but its underlying mechanism still needs extended exploration. An obese Prader-Willi syndrome boy lost 25.8 kg after receiving a high-fiber dietary intervention for 105 days. The fecal microbiome sequencing data taken from the boy on intervention days 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 105, along with clinical indexes, were used to construct a metagenome-scale metabolic network. Firstly, the abundances of the microbial strains were obtained by mapping the sequencing reads onto the assembly of gut organisms through use of reconstruction and analysis (AGORA) genomes. The nutritional components of the diet were obtained through the Virtual Metabolic Human database. Then, a community model was simulated using the Microbiome Modeling Toolbox. Finally, the significant Spearman correlations among the metabolites and the clinical indexes were screened and the strains that were producing these metabolites were identified. The high-fiber diet reduced the overall amount of metabolite secretions, but the secretions of folic acid derivatives by <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i> strains were increased and were significantly relevant to the observed weight loss. Reduced metabolites might also have directly contributed to the weight loss or indirectly contribute by enhancing leptin and decreasing adiponectin. Metagenome-scale metabolic network technology provides a cost-efficient solution for screening the functional microbial strains and metabolic pathways that are responding to nutrition therapy."

Pituitary hormone deficiencies, caused by hypothalamic dysfunction, are common and hypogonadism is the most prevalent. Untreated hypogonadism can cause osteoporosis, which is already an important issue in PWS. Therefore, timely detection and treatment of hypogonadism is crucial. To increase understanding and prevent undertreatment, we (1) performed a cohort study in the Dutch PWS population, (2) thoroughly reviewed the literature on female hypogonadism in PWS and (3) provide clinical recommendations on behalf of an international expert panel. For the cohort study, we retrospectively collected results of a systematic health screening in 64 female adults with PWS, which included a medical questionnaire, medical file search, medical interview, physical examination and biochemical measurements. Our data show that hypogonadism is frequent in females with PWS (94%), but is often undiagnosed and untreated. This could be related to unfamiliarity with the syndrome, fear of behavioral changes, hygienic concerns, or drug interactions. To prevent underdiagnosis and undertreatment, we provide practical recommendations for the screening and treatment of hypogonadism in females with PWS."

To conclude, the development of taVNS devices has entered a new era, thus the update speed and quality of taVNS devices will be considerably improved in the future. This article reviewed the history and classification of taVNS devices. The correlation between the effectiveness and stimulation parameters from taVNS devices still remains unclear. There is a lack of standard or harmonization among different taVNS devices. Strategies, including further comparative research and establishment of standard, have been recommended in this article to promote the future development of taVNS devices."

The perspectives of those with PWS are also important for rapidly evolving clinical trials aimed at treating symptoms of PWS. Twenty-one young people with PWS were administered a semi-structured interview that assessed how they perceive their syndrome and clinical trials. Transcribed interviews were reliably coded using content-driven, applied thematic analyses. Five themes emerged: struggles with chronic hunger and food-seeking that impede goals and relationships; struggles with anxiety and outbursts, schedule changes and school; distancing from PWS; needs for clinical trials that cure PWS, reduce hunger or anxiety, and lead to improved outcomes; and needs for advocacy and awareness of PWS. Findings shed new light on the self-perceptions of those with PWS and have important implications for current interventions and future clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Emotional and behavioural problems linked to changes to expectations - resistance to change - are linked to disability in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Prader-Willi (PWS) and fragile X syndromes (FXS). Structuring routines is best practice for minimising current resistance to change. But complete structure is impractical and flexibility in early life may actually reduce later resistance by supporting cognitive development. We aimed to examine the psycho-social context of families with children at risk of developing resistance to change so as to identify design requirements for an intervention that strikes a beneficial balance between structure and flexibility. Thirty-six caregivers of children aged 4-12 years (17 ASD, 15 PWS, and 4 FXS) took part in an interview designed collaboratively with 12 professional stakeholders. Children need to feel like they are in control of flexibility but they also need support in choice making, understanding plans (using individually tailored visuals) and anxiety reduction. Caregivers need an accessible approach that they have full control over, and which they can tailor for their child. Caregivers also need clear guidance, education and support around structure and flexibility. We propose a digital approach which addresses the needs identified. It tackles the most perplexing challenge by presenting flexibility to children in the context of a game that children can feel they have full control over, whilst caregivers can maintain control in reality. Furthermore, individualised support for children and caregivers would be enabled."

However, the consequences for phylogenetic conservation were heterogeneous along the gene sequence. The standard snoRNA elements necessary for RNA stability and association with dedicated core proteins were the most conserved, in agreement with the hypothesis that SNORD116 generate genuine snoRNAs. In addition, one of the two antisense elements typically involved in RNA target recognition was largely dominated by a unique sequence present in at least one subset of gene paralogs in most species, likely the result of a selective effect. In agreement with a functional role, this ASE exhibited a hybridization capacity with putative mRNA targets that was strongly conserved in eutherians. Moreover, transient downregulation experiments in human cells showed that Snord116 controls the expression and splicing levels of these mRNAs. The functions of two of them, diacylglycerol kinase kappa and Neuroligin 3, extend the description of the molecular bases of PWS and reveal unexpected molecular links with the Fragile X syndrome and autism spectrum disorders."

    "abstract": "To verify the accuracy of different indices of glucose homeostasis in recognizing the metabolic syndrome in a group of adult patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), 102 PWS patients (53 females/49 males), age ±SD 26.9 ± 7.6 yrs, Body Mass Index (BMI) 35.7 ± 10.7, were studied. The following indices were assessed in each subject during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): 1 h (>155 mg/dL) and 2 h (140-199 mg/dL) glucose levels, the oral disposition index (ODI), the insulinogenic index (IGI), the insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were evaluated at baseline, 1 h and 2 h. Although minor differences among indices were found, according to the ROC analysis, no index performed better in recognizing MetS. Furthermore, the diagnostic threshold levels changed over the years and therefore the age-related thresholds were calculated. The easily calculated HOMA-IR at baseline may be used to accurately diagnose MetS, thus avoiding more complicated procedures."

    "title": "Respiratory failure after scoliosis correction surgery in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome: Two case reports.",
    "abstract": "Sleep-disordered breathing, including hypoventilation and obstructive sleep apnea, is often observed in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Particularly in adolescence, scoliosis causes a progressive restrictive pulmonary pattern, leading to hypoventilation, so timely corrective surgery is required. However, the effect is controversial. In addition, since mental retardation of PWS, patient effort-based respiratory tests may be less reliable. So far, no studies have accurately reported on the comparison of respiratory function before and after corrective surgery, and appropriate respiratory function measurement method in PWS. We present two cases of adolescent PWS with typical characteristics, including obesity, mental retardation, and scoliosis. Two boys, aged 12 and 13, diagnosed with PWS, both underwent scoliosis correction surgery. Before and immediately after surgery, arterial blood tests showed no abnormalities and no respiratory symptoms occurred. However, after 6-7 mo, both patients complained of daytime sleepiness, difficulty sleeping at night, dyspnea on exertion, and showed cyanosis. Hypercapnia and hypoxia were confirmed by polysomnography and transcutaneous CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring during sleep and were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and alveolar hypoventilation. It was corrected by nighttime noninvasive ventilation application and normal findings of arterial blood gas were maintained after 6-8 mo follow-up. Even after scoliosis surgery, \"periodic\" monitoring of respiratory failure with an \"objective\" test method is needed for timely respiratory support."

This study aimed to describe the nature and prevalence of SDB in school-aged children with PWS in the growth hormone era. This retrospective single-center chart review included children aged 6-18 years with PWS who had overnight polysomnography not involving respiratory support over 5 years (2012-2017). The main outcome measures were the presence of obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, or hypoventilation defined by an elevated transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide (TcPCO<sub>2</sub>) as per standard pediatric criteria. Seventeen children (8 males; median age 11.6 years, range 6.6-16.1 years) were included. Fifteen demonstrated SDB of different types: central sleep apnea (18%), obstructive sleep apnea (24%), both obstructive and central sleep apnea (29%), or hypoventilation without obstructive or central sleep apnea (18%). Twelve (71%) children had evidence of hypoventilation. Those with hypoventilation had a higher central apnea-hypopnea index but no difference in the obstructive apnea-hypopnea index, age, sex, growth parameters, or the presence of scoliosis or sleep-related symptoms compared with those without hypoventilation. Sleep-related hypoventilation is common in school-aged children with PWS. The presence of central sleep apnea, including the quantification of central hypopneas, but not obstructive sleep apnea or clinical factors, predicted the presence of hypoventilation. Long-term polysomnography surveillance in children with PWS should include identification of central hypopneas and measurement of continuous pCO<sub>2</sub>. Schaefer J, Davey MJ, Nixon GM.

We detected the common c.316G > A, p.(Gly106Arg) pathogenic de novo substitution in a 10-year-old patient with HSP and drug-resistant eyelid myoclonia with absences. In order to assess the significance of this association, we reviewed the literature to find that 25/110 (23%) SPG6 cases are complex, including a heterogeneous spectrum of comorbidities, in which epilepsy is most represented (10%), but also featuring peripheral neuropathy (5.5%), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (3.6%), memory deficits (3.6%) or cognitive impairment (2.7%), tremor (2.7%) and dystonia (0.9%). From this literature review and our single case experience, two main conclusions can be drawn. First, SPG6 is an AD-HSP with both pure and complex presentation, and frequent occurrence of epilepsy within the spectrum of genetic generalized epilepsies (absences, bilateral tonic-clonic, bilateral tonic-clonic with upper limbs myoclonic seizures and eyelid myoclonia with absences).

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder based on a loss of paternally expressed genes in chromosome region 15q11-13. In addition to typical characteristics such as hyperphagia, PWS is evidenced by a certain behavioral phenotype. Common indicators are repetitive behaviors, temper tantrums, and self-injurious behaviors such as skin- and/or rectal picking. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) was previously described as a promising therapeutic option for skin picking in PWS. In this case series, we retrospectively investigated the effect of pharmacotherapy with NAC in 14 individuals with PWS suffering from skin- and/or rectal picking. Treatment success was determined using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I). The Clinical Global Impression-Efficacy index (CGI-EI) was used to put treatment success and side effects into perspective. Six of fourteen patients, all of which were female, showed improvement in symptoms (dosage 1800-2400 mg/day), whereas six patients did not show any change during treatment. Moreover, two male patients treated for solitary rectal picking showed new onset of skin picking. Across all cases, a CGI-I of 3 (corresponding to minimal improvement) was seen after 3 months of treatment, with a CGI-EI of 1.6 (corresponding to moderate efficacy). NAC remains a reasonable therapeutic option in certain cases of skin picking in PWS but provides only limited efficacy compared to previous studies on the topic. There was a higher rate of adverse drug reactions than previously reported. The results particularly suggest caution in future treatment in individuals with solitary rectal picking and reduced efficacy when coadministered with neuroleptics."

Pediatric multidisciplinary (MD) care has improved life expectancy, however, transfer to internal medicine is hindered by the lack of adequate MD care for adults. We have launched an MD outpatient clinic providing syndrome-specific care for adults with CRGS, which, to our knowledge, is the first one worldwide in the field of internal medicine. Between 2015 and 2020, we have treated 720 adults with over 60 syndromes. Eighty-nine percent of the syndromes were associated with endocrine problems. We describe case series of missed diagnoses and patients who had undergone extensive diagnostic testing for symptoms that could actually be explained by their syndrome. Based on our experiences and review of the literature, we provide an algorithm for the clinical approach of health problems in CRGS adults. We conclude that missed diagnoses and needless invasive tests seem common in CRGS adults. Due to the increased life expectancy, an increasing number of patients with CRGS will transfer to adult endocrinology. Internist-endocrinologists (in training) should be aware of their special needs and medical pitfalls of CRGS will help prevent the burden of unnecessary diagnostics and under- and overtreatment."

Indeed, interventions targeting the gut microbiome are being actively investigated as a therapeutic strategy to tackle these diseases. Given that obesity and mental health symptoms are both hallmarks of Prader-Willi syndrome, targeting the gut microbiome may be a promising therapeutical strategy. Only a few studies have investigated the gut microbiome in the context of Prader-Willi syndrome and assessed the efficacy of probiotic supplementation as a therapeutic strategy for this disease. Here, we review the knowledge obtained to this date regarding the gut microbiome in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome. The limited evidence available indicate that probiotic supplementation improves some metabolic and mental health aspects, however further studies are warranted to determine whether targeting the gut microbiome may constitute a safe and efficient strategy to treat individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome."

Our aim was to describe the natural history of T2DM in patients with PWS before the age of 25 years and to develop screening and preventive strategies. Thirty-nine patients followed in the French PWS Reference Center were included (median age 25.6 years [23.7; 31.7]). Twenty-one had been treated with growth hormone (GH), fifteen had not, and three had an unknown status. The median age at T2DM diagnosis was 16.8 years (11-24) and the median BMI was 39 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [34.6; 45], with 34/35 patients living with obesity. The patients displayed frequent psychiatric (48.3% hospitalization,) and metabolic (56.4% hypertriglyceridemia,) comorbidities and a parental history of T2DM (35.7%) or overweight (53.6%) compared to the PWS general population. There was no difference in BMI and metabolic complications between the GH-treated and non-GH-treated groups at T2DM diagnosis. Patients with PWS who develop early T2DM have severe obesity, a high frequency of psychiatric and metabolic disorders, and a family history of T2DM and overweight. These results underline the need for early identification of patients at risk, prevention of obesity, and repeated blood glucose monitoring during the transition period."

    "abstract": "The rising frequency of ART-conceived births is accompanied by the need for an improved understanding of the implications of ART on gametes and embryos. Increasing evidence from mouse models and human epidemiological data suggests that ART procedures may play a role in the pathophysiology of certain imprinting disorders (IDs), including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Silver-Russell syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Angelman syndrome. The underlying molecular basis of this association, however, requires further elucidation. In this review, we discuss the epigenetic and imprinting alterations of in vivo mouse models and human iPSC models of ART. Mouse models have demonstrated aberrant regulation of imprinted genes involved with ART-related IDs. In the past decade, iPSC technology has provided a platform for patient-specific cellular models of culture-associated perturbed imprinting. However, despite ongoing efforts, a deeper understanding of the susceptibility of iPSCs to epigenetic perturbation is required if they are to be reliably used for modelling ART-associated IDs. Comparing the patterns of susceptibility of imprinted genes in mouse models and IPSCs in culture improves the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ART-linked IDs with implications for our understanding of the influence of environmental factors such as culture and hormone treatments on epigenetically important regions of the genome such as imprints."

    "abstract": "The behavior of offspring results from the combined expression of maternal and paternal genes. Genomic imprinting silences some genes in a parent-of-origin specific manner, a process that, among all animals, occurs only in mammals. How genomic imprinting affects the behavior of mammalian offspring, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we studied how the loss of the paternally inherited gene Magel2 in mouse pups affects the emission of separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations (USV). Using quantitative analysis of more than 1000 USVs, we characterized the rate of vocalizations as well as their spectral features from postnatal days 6-12 (P6-P12), a critical phase of mouse development that covers the peak of vocal behavior in pups. Our analyses show that Magel2 deficient offspring emit separation-induced vocalizations at lower rates and with altered spectral features mainly at P8. We also show that dams display altered behavior towards their own Magel2 deficient offspring at this age. In a test to compare the retrieval of two pups, dams retrieve wildtype control pups first and faster than Magel2 deficient offspring. These results suggest that the loss of Magel2 impairs the expression of separation-induced vocalization in pups as well as maternal behavior at a specific age of postnatal development, both of which support the pups' growth and development."

Penetrance is complete, though expressivity is quite variable even among the family members. Given that NF1 is a common hereditary condition, existence of a second genetic disorder in NF1 patients is not unexpected. During comprehensive evaluations of individuals with NF1, we encountered 11 patients with dual diagnosis who contributed to phenotypic complexity and challenges for long-term management. Examples include Prader-Willi Syndrome, Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease, Down syndrome, infantile myofibromatosis, Craniosynostosis, cleft lip and palate, 47,XYY, 22q11.2 duplication, 15q13.3 deletion syndrome, and BRCA2- and ATM- related cancer predisposition syndromes. Presence of dysmorphism, developmental delay, atypical tumors, and family history of other genetic disorders including cancers appears as determinants to consider a second genetic etiology and helps to differentiate from an extreme phenotypic spectrum of NF1. Clinicians should have high index of suspicion to exclude coexisting disorders, as apart from providing comprehensive medical care. This also has potential implications in genetic counseling. Long-term effects of the synergistic mechanisms leading to phenotypic complexity and patient outcomes are yet to be characterized, with follow-up needed."

However, no report is available regarding the relationship between psychiatric illness and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in patients with PWS. Therefore, we evaluated a behavioral assessment to address the lack of data on the association between psychiatric behavior and T2DM. This was a retrospective single-center study of patients with PWS. Patients with PWS whose blood tests were performed in our hospital between January 2018 and December 2019 and aged >10 years were included. We evaluated the data, including the behavioral patterns of Japanese PWS patients with T2DM. Overall, 114 patients were evaluated; 33 patients (28.9%) developed T2DM. The age of T2DM onset was 18.0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 14.6-21.4 years). The median body mass index at T2DM onset was 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (IQR, 30.0-37.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the absence of paternally expressed and maternally imprinted genes on chromosome 15q 11.2-13. It is associated with a certain behavioural phenotype, especially temper outbursts with verbal and physical aggression towards others. Recent studies show a promising therapeutic effect of serotonin reuptake inhibitors like sertraline on frequency and intensity of outbursts. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) (X p11.23) plays a crucial role in the metabolism of monoamines. Dysregulation in methylation of the CpG island spanning the promoter region and exon 1 of MAOA is implicated in impulsive and aggressive behaviour. In the present study, methylation rates of CpG dinucleotides in the MAOA promoter and exon 1 region were determined from DNA derived from whole blood samples of PWS patients (n = 32) and controls (n = 14) matched for age, sex and BMI via bisulfite sequencing. PWS patients were grouped into those showing temper outbursts, and those who do not. Overall, PWS patients show a significant lower methylation rate at the promoter/exon 1 region than healthy controls in both sexes. Furthermore, PWS patients, male as well female with temper outbursts show a significant lower methylation rate than those without temper outbursts (p < 0.001 and p = 0.006). The MAOA promoter/exon 1 region methylation seems to be dysregulated in PWS patients in sense of a hypomethylation, especially in those suffering from temper outbursts. This dysregulation probably plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of temper outbursts in PWS."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by hormonal dysregulation, obesity, intellectual disability, and behavioral problems. Most PWS cases are caused by paternal interstitial deletions of 15q11.2-q13.1, while a smaller number of cases are caused by chromosome 15 maternal uniparental disomy (PW-UPD). Children with PW-UPD are at higher risk for developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than the neurotypical population. In this study, we used expression analysis of PW-UPD neurons to try to identify the molecular cause for increased autism risk. <b>Methods:</b> Dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) from neurotypical control and PWS subjects were differentiated to neurons for mRNA sequencing. Significantly differentially expressed transcripts among all groups were identified. Downstream protein analysis including immunocytochemistry and immunoblots were performed to confirm the transcript level data and pathway enrichment findings. <b>Results:</b> We identified 9 transcripts outside of the PWS critical region (15q11.2-q13.1) that may contribute to core PWS phenotypes. Moreover, we discovered a global reduction in mitochondrial transcripts in the PW-UPD + ASD group. We also found decreased mitochondrial abundance along with mitochondrial aggregates in the cell body and neural projections of +ASD neurons. <b>Conclusion:</b> The 9 transcripts we identified common to all PWS subtypes may reveal PWS specific defects during neurodevelopment. Importantly, we found a global reduction in mitochondrial transcripts in PW-UPD + ASD neurons versus control and other PWS subtypes. We then confirmed mitochondrial defects in neurons from individuals with PWS at the cellular level. Quantification of this phenotype supports our hypothesis that the increased incidence of ASD in PW-UPD subjects may arise from mitochondrial defects in developing neurons."

Gut-brain hormones are an interrelated network that may be at least partially involved. We aimed to study the hormonal profile of PWS patients in comparison with obese and healthy controls. Thirty adult PWS patients (15 men; age 27.5 ± 8.02 years; BMI 32.4 ± 8.14 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), 30 obese and 30 healthy controls were studied before and after eating a hypercaloric liquid diet. Plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), leptin, total and active ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY), pancreatic polypeptide (PP), Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and amylin were determined at times 0', 30', 60' and 120'. Cluster analysis was used. When considering all peptides together, two clusters were established according to fasting hormonal standardized concentrations. Cluster 1 encompassed most of obese (25/30) and healthy controls (28/30). By contrast, the majority of patients with PWS were located in Cluster 2 (23/27) and presented a similar fasting profile with hyperghrelinemia, high levels of leptin, PYY, GIP and GLP-1, compared to Cluster 1; that may reflect a dysfunction of these hunger/satiety hormones. When peptide behavior over the time was considered, PP concentrations were not sustained postprandially from 60 min onwards in Cluster 2. BDNF and amylin did not help to differentiate the two clusters. Thus, cluster analysis could be a good tool to distinguish and characterize the differences in hormone responses between PWS and obese or healthy controls."

    "abstract": "Genomic imprinting is a term used for an intergenerational epigenetic inheritance and involves a subset of genes expressed in a parent-of-origin-dependent way. Imprinted genes are expressed preferentially from either the paternally or maternally inherited allele. Long non-coding RNAs play essential roles in regulating this allele-specific expression. In several well-studied imprinting clusters, long non-coding RNAs have been found to be essential in regulating temporal- and spatial-specific establishment and maintenance of imprinting patterns. Furthermore, recent insights into the epigenetic pathological mechanisms underlying human genomic imprinting disorders suggest that allele-specific expressed imprinted long non-coding RNAs serve as an upstream regulator of the expression of other protein-coding or non-coding imprinted genes in the same cluster. Aberrantly expressed long non-coding RNAs result in bi-allelic expression or silencing of neighboring imprinted genes. Here, we review the emerging roles of long non-coding RNAs in regulating the expression of imprinted genes, especially in human imprinting disorders, and discuss three strategies targeting the central long non-coding RNA <i>UBE3A-ATS</i> for the purpose of developing therapies for the imprinting disorders Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. In summary, a better understanding of long non-coding RNA-related mechanisms is key to the development of potential therapeutic targets for human imprinting disorders."

Here, we compared IGF-1 levels in PWS children to controls matched for age, sex, anthropometric parameters, and nutritional status. The retrospective analysis included genetically diagnosed PWS subjects (n = 65, median age; 14.0 months) and controls (n = 111, 14.3 months) matched for age, sex, anthropometric parameters (height-standard deviation score [SDS], weight-SDS, body mass index-SDS), and serum albumin levels, a marker for nutritional status. IGF-1 SDS was compared between PWS subjects and controls after adjustment for confounding variables. The GH provocation test was performed in 29 PWS subjects, and IGF-1 SDS was compared between GH-sufficient (n = 20) and GH-deficient (n = 9) subjects. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was performed to investigate the association between age and IGF-1 SDS. None had received GH or levothyroxine treatment. After adjustment for confounding variables, IGF-1 SDS was significantly lower in PWS subjects than controls (-1.56 vs. -1.01, p = .003), while it was not different between GH-sufficient and GH-deficient PWS subjects. Correlation analysis failed to show an association between age and IGF-1 SDS both in control and PWS groups. IGF-1 SDS is lower in very young children with PWS independent of anthropometric parameters and nutritional status, suggesting the presence of hypothalamic dysfunction of GH secretion."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a multi-system genetically determined neurodevelopmental disorder and the commonest cause of syndromal obesity. The development of hyperphagia in early childhood is part of the phenotype arising as a result of an impaired neural response to food intake and the inability to regulate food intake in line with energy needs. Severe obesity develops if access to food is not controlled. In this review we evaluate the evidence for increased morbidity and mortality in PWS in order to establish the extent to which it is directly related to the obesity; a consequence of the eating behaviour itself independent of obesity; or associated with other characteristics of the syndrome. Medline, Cochrane, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science and Scopus databases were used to systematically identify published material on PWS and hyperphagia and syndrome-related morbidity and mortality. One hundred and ten key papers were selected. Data on 500 people with PWS indicated that the average age of death was 21 years and obesity was, as expected, a significant factor. However, the behaviour of hyperphagia itself, independent of obesity, was also important, associated with choking, gastric rupture, and/or respiratory illness. Other syndrome-related factors increased the risk for, and seriousness of, co-morbid illness or accidents. We conclude that improving life-expectancy largely depends on managing the immediate non-obesity and obesity-related consequences of the hyperphagia, through improved support. The development of new treatments that significantly reduce the drive to eat are likely to decrease morbidity and mortality improving quality of life and life expectancy."

    "title": "Subtle Cardiovascular Abnormalities in Prader-Willi Syndrome Might Begin in Young Adulthood.",
    "abstract": "Objective Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are known to have a high mortality rate. However, little is known about the exact reason for this, particularly in adults, because so few reports have been published. The present study examined cardiovascular abnormalities to determine the cause of death in adults with PWS. Methods From September 2017 to April 2019, a total of 18 adults with PWS, and, no history of cardiovascular diseases, were enrolled. We investigated the levels of the cardiovascular biomarkers: high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and troponin T (TnT). To estimate the cardiac function, we measured the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), global longitudinal systolic strain (GLS) of the left ventricle, ratio of peak early mitral filling velocity (E) to early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/e' ratio), mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) using standard and tissue Doppler echocardiography. Results The mean patient age was 28±9 years old. There were 11 men, and the mean body mass index was 45.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Dyslipidemia (82%), diabetes mellitus (82%) and hypertension (83%) were commonly found as comorbidities. Most patients had elevated levels of hs-CRP (mean 1.007±0.538 mg/dL). The LVEF (mean 61%±5%) showed normal values, while the GLS (mean 15.0%±3.0%) was decreased. The TAPSE was mildly reduced (mean 16±3 mm). Conclusion These results suggest that subtle cardiovascular abnormalities have already begun in young adults with PWS. We need to manage obesity and the resultant obesity-related disorders in order to prevent heart failure and coronary atherosclerosis in PWS patients."

    "abstract": "To develop an insight scale for Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a genetically determined neurodevelopmental disorder with different psychopathological and behavioural problems. A sample of 36 PWS patients (58.3% women) attended at the Endocrinological Department of the Corporació Sanitària Parc Taulí (Sabadell, Barcelona) was evaluated. Insight was assessed by means of an adapted version of the Scale of Unawareness of Mental Disorder (SUMD), including three general insight dimensions: awareness of having a PWS, awareness of the effects of psychopharmacological medication and awareness of the social consequences, as well as three items that assess awareness of each particular symptom of the disease (obesity/overweight, excessive appetite and excessive food intake). The final Scale included six items and demonstrated an adequate internal consistency (Cronbach Alfa of 0.857 for Caregivers and 0.798 for Clinicians) but a high inter-rate variability. External validation using an Analytical-Visual Insight Scale was adequate. The Adapted version for Prader-Willi patients of the Scale of Unawareness of Mental Disorder (APW-SUD) showed adequate psychometric properties and it is an easy to administer means to assess insight in this population."

    "abstract": "To reduce transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many countries implemented lockdowns, causing the closure of childcare services. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown in March-April 2020 on children, adolescents, and young adults with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) living in Germany. We recruited 180 participants with a genetically confirmed PWS. All families completed a questionnaire, and participants underwent a post-lockdown assessment; the last examination before the lockdown was determined as the pre-lockdown assessment. We used bivariate analyses to compare pre- and post-lockdown outcomes. Weight standard deviation scores (SDS<sub>PWS</sub>) and body mass index (BMI)-SDS<sub>PWS</sub> remained stable or even decreased in some age groups. A statistically significant gain in lean body mass (LBM) was found in all groups <18 years of age. We observed an increase in IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations without a significant change in growth hormone (GH) dosage. Most families (95.4%) reported set mealtimes and implementation of structured activities (72.2%) during the lockdown period. We therefore suggest that the favorable development of weight/BMI and LBM was caused by an interplay of a suspected enhanced GH administration and continuous parental commitment. However, more intense behavioral problems were observed in 45.7%, which persisted post-lockdown in 33.7%."

    "title": "Arcuate Nucleus Overexpression of NHLH2 Reduces Body Mass and Attenuates Obesity-Associated Anxiety/Depression-like Behavior.",
    "abstract": "Nescient helix-loop-helix 2 (NHLH2) is a hypothalamic transcription factor that controls the expression of prohormone convertase 1/3, therefore having an impact on the processing of proopiomelanocortin and thus on energy homeostasis. Studies have shown that KO of <i>Nhlh2</i> results in increased body mass, reduced physical activity, and hypogonadism. In humans, a polymorphism of the <i>NHLH2</i> gene is associated with obesity; and in Prader-Willi syndrome, a condition characterized by obesity, hypogonadism and behavioral abnormalities, the expression of NHLH2 is reduced. Despite clinical and experimental evidence suggesting that NHLH2 could be a good target for the treatment of obesity, no previous study has evaluated the impact of NHLH2 overexpression in obesity. Here, in mice fed a high-fat diet introduced right after the arcuate nucleus intracerebroventricular injection of a lentivirus that promoted 40% increase in NHLH2, there was prevention of the development of obesity by a mechanism dependent on the reduction of caloric intake. When hypothalamic overexpression of NHLH2 was induced in previously obese mice, the beneficial impact on obesity-associated phenotype was even greater; thus, there was an 80% attenuation in body mass gain, reduced whole-body adiposity, increased brown adipose tissue temperature, reduced hypothalamic inflammation, and reduced liver steatosis. In this setting, the beneficial impact of hypothalamic overexpression of NHLH2 was a result of combined effects on caloric intake, energy expenditure, and physical activity. Moreover, the hypothalamic overexpression of NHLH2 reduced obesity-associated anxiety/depression behavior. Thus, we provide an experimental proof of concept supporting that hypothalamic NHLH2 is a good target for the treatment of obesity.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Obesity is a highly prevalent medical condition that lacks an effective treatment. The main advance provided by this study is the demonstration of the beneficial metabolic and behavioral outcomes resulting from the overexpression of NHLH2 in the hypothalamus. When NHLH2 was overexpressed simultaneously with the introduction of a high-fat diet, there was prevention of obesity by a mechanism dependent on reduced caloric intake. Conversely, when NHLH2 was overexpressed in previously obese mice, there was reduction of the obese phenotype because of a combination of reduced caloric intake, increased physical activity, and increased thermogenesis. In addition, the overexpression of NHLH2 reduced anxiety/depression-like behavior. Thus, NHLH2 emerges as a potential target for the combined treatment of obesity and its associated anxiety/depression-like behavior."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder which is often associated with significant behavioral challenges and poor intellectual functioning. Research has shown that individuals with PWS are more likely to experience mental health problems, have higher relapse rates, and are at risk of self-harming behavior. Although PWS is associated with mild intellectual disability, which in itself confers a higher mortality rate, suicidality in this population is so far unreported in the literature. We present the case of an 18-year-old male patient who was admitted to our facility following exogenous insulin administration with suicidal intent. The main clinical characteristics, self-harming behaviors, and suicide risk factors of patients with PWS are discussed in this report. The article's objective is to redirect clinicians' attention to carefully screen and treat the underlying behavioral problems in PWS patients."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized by hypotonia, distinctive facial features, hyperphagia, obesity, short stature, hypogonadism, intellectual disability, and behavior problems. Uncontrolled hyperphagia can lead to dangerous food-seeking behavior and with life-threatening obesity. Severe obesity is prone to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and can lead to cor pulmonale. This study reports on a case involving a 21-year-old man with PWS who developed OSA due to severe obesity, which led to cor pulmonale, a life-threatening complication. Multidisciplinary care provided in the intensive care unit included weight reduction, ventilation support, antipsychotics, sedative drugs, rehabilitation, and meticulous skin care. The patient did recover. To prevent severe obesity in adults with PWS, hyperphagia must be controlled, and the patient must also be managed by an endocrinologist throughout childhood."

A 40-year-old pregnant woman prenatally presented with polyhydramnios, decreased fetal movements, fetal growth restriction with normal Doppler study, and fetal cardiac rhabdomyoma, a possible new sonographic markers for PWS, at 31 weeks of gestation. The newborn had hypotonia and feeding difficulty. Molecular genetic study showed a normal copy number of the 15q11.2-q13.1 chromosomal region but hypermethylation pattern of this region, indicating PWS. Other than the combination of polyhydramnios, fetal growth restriction, and decreased fetal movements, cardiac rhabdomyoma was detected and possibly associated with PWS. In conclusion, PWS should be listed in differential diagnoses if fetuses having the following perinatal factors: polyhydramnios, decreased fetal movements, and growth restriction. Finally, cardiac rhabdomyoma, observed in this case, might possibly be associated with PWS, although further studies to confirm are needed."

Although anti-obesity medications (AOMs) are prescribed to this population, there are no consensus guidelines on acceptability, safety, and efficacy. We present literature review and case series on AOMs in youth with PWS. (2) Methods: we performed PubMed review from January 2000 to April 2021 utilizing keywords: \"Prader-Willi syndrome\" or \"PWS\" and \"medication\" including: topiramate, metformin, phentermine, liraglutide, orlistat, oxytocin, semaglutide, naltrexone-bupropion. For our case series, patients were identified through retrospective chart reviews from a multi-disciplinary PWS clinic. Eligibility criteria: age ≤ 18 years, genetically confirmed PWS, AOM use for at least 16 weeks, and recent anthropometric data. (3) Results: a literature search yielded 14 articles (3 topiramate, 1 metformin, 4 liraglutide, 5 oxytocin, 1 naltrexone-bupropion). All studies reported improved hyperphagia with variable BMI effects. Ten adolescents met case series eligibility (mean age 13.2 ± 2.6 years, 40% female; AOMs: 6 metformin, 5 topiramate, 2 semaglutide, 3 liraglutide). After AOM course, 60% had decreased or stable BMI z-score. No significant side effects. (4) Conclusions: results suggest AOMs may be useful for weight management in youth with PWS. Additional studies are required to validate findings and support AOM treatment guidelines."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic syndrome characterized by hyperphagia, intellectual disability, hypotonia and hypothalamic dysfunction. Adults with PWS often have hormone deficiencies, hypogonadism being the most common. Untreated male hypogonadism can aggravate PWS-related health issues including muscle weakness, obesity, osteoporosis, and fatigue. Therefore, timely diagnosis and treatment of male hypogonadism is important. In this article, we share our experience with hypogonadism and its treatment in adult males with PWS and present a review of the literature. In order to report the prevalence and type of hypogonadism, treatment regimen and behavioral issues, we retrospectively collected data on medical interviews, physical examinations, biochemical measurements and testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in 57 Dutch men with PWS. Fifty-six (98%) of the patients had either primary, central or combined hypogonadism. Untreated hypogonadism was associated with higher body mass index and lower hemoglobin concentrations. TRT was complicated by behavioral challenges in one third of the patients. Undertreatment was common and normal serum testosterone levels were achieved in only 30% of the patients. Based on the Dutch cohort data, review of the literature and an international expert panel discussion, we provide a practical algorithm for TRT in adult males with PWS in order to prevent undertreatment and related adverse health outcomes."

Recent studies have raised concerns that treatment during childhood may affect morbidity and mortality in adulthood, with specific controversies over cancer risk and cerebrovascular events. We will review 3 common referrals to a pediatric endocrinology clinic, followed by a summary of short- and long-term effects of rhGH beyond height outcomes. Methods to mitigate risk will be reviewed. Finally, this information will be applied to each clinical case, highlighting differences in counseling and clinical outcomes. rhGH therapy has been used for more than 3 decades.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma of MEN2B has a good prognosis if diagnosed by one year of age. However, diagnosis of MEN2B within the first year of life is markedly challenging owing to its high <i>de novo</i> occurrence and lack of clarity in terms of extra-endocrine symptoms that could aid early diagnosis. Herein, we present six cases of Japanese children with MEN2B harboring the p.Met918Thr <i>RET</i> variant. Exploratory data extraction was conducted using a questionnaire. The patients underwent thyroidectomy at a median age of 11 yr (range, 6-19 yr). Four of the six patients underwent neonatal hospitalization at birth without complications, and three tested positive for neuroblastoma screening at infancy. The patients presented at least one MEN2B-associated symptom before one year of age, including ganglioneuromas, pseudo-Hirschsprung disease, alacrima, bumpy lips, sucking disability, or decreased muscle tone, along with other suspected comorbidities, such as Williams or Prader-Willi syndrome. This case series demonstrates that MEN2B manifests through several extra-endocrine symptoms by the age of one year."

    "abstract": "Growth hormone (GH) is an important driver for somatic growth and increase in height in children. The development of recombinant human GH has greatly increased its availability, and hence the potential for its use and abuse. GH therapy should only be offered to patients with established and approved indications. Common pediatric indications for treatment include growth hormone deficiency, Turner syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, small for gestational age, chronic renal insufficiency, and idiopathic short stature. Before initiating treatment, the family should be counseled about the treatment goals, costs, and possible adverse effects from the treatment. It is important for patients to have realistic expectations from the treatment. The dose of GH should be individualized for the indication and will require titration in each patient based on response to the treatment and the adverse effects. Overall, GH has a good safety record. However, GH treatment has many potential and real adverse effects that need to be considered and monitored during treatment. Recently, safety concerns regarding the long-term effect of GH therapy on cardiovascular morbidity have come under scrutiny."

    "abstract": "There are many reports on rearrangements occurring separately in the regions of chromosomes 9p and 15q affected in the case under study. 15q duplication syndrome is caused by the presence of at least one extra maternally derived copy of the Prader-Willi/Angelman critical region. Trisomy 9p is the fourth most frequent chromosome anomaly with a clinically recognizable syndrome often accompanied by intellectual disability. Here we report a new case of a patient with maternally derived unique complex sSMC resulting in partial trisomy of both chromosomes 9 and 15 associated with intellectual disability. We characterise a supernumerary derivative chromosome 15: 47,XY,+der(15)t(9;15)(p21.2;q13.2), likely resulting from 3:1 malsegregation during maternal gametogenesis. Chromosomal analysis showed that a phenotypically normal mother is a carrier of balanced translocation t(9;15)(p21.1;q13.2). Her 7-year-old son showed signs of intellectual disability and a number of physical abnormalities including bilateral cryptorchidism and congenital megaureter. The child's magnetic resonance imaging showed changes in brain volume and in structural and functional connectivity revealing phenotypic changes caused by the presence of the extra chromosome material, whereas the mother's brain MRI was normal. Sequence analyses of the microdissected der(15) chromosome detected two breakpoint regions: HSA9:25,928,021-26,157,441 (9p21.2 band) and HSA15:30,552,104-30,765,905 (15q13.2 band). The breakpoint region on chromosome HSA9 is poor in genetic features with several areas of high homology with the breakpoint region on chromosome 15. The breakpoint region on HSA15 is located in the area of a large segmental duplication. We discuss the case of these phenotypic and brain MRI features in light of reported signatures for 9p partial trisomy and 15 duplication syndromes and analyze how the genomic characteristics of the found breakpoint regions have contributed to the origin of the derivative chromosome. We recommend MRI for all patients with a developmental delay, especially in cases with identified rearrangements, to accumulate more information on brain phenotypes related to chromosomal syndromes."

    "abstract": "Obesity has become a major public health concern worldwide, with current behavioral, pharmacological, and surgical treatments offering varying rates of success and adverse effects. Neurosurgical approaches to treatment of refractory obesity include deep brain stimulation (DBS) on either specific hypothalamic or reward circuitry nuclei, which might contribute to weight reduction through different mechanisms. We aimed to determine the safety and clinical effect of DBS in medical refractory obesity. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic review to identify all original studies - observational and experimental - in which DBS was performed to treat refractory obesity. From database inception to April 2021, we conducted our search in PubMed, Scopus, and LILACS databases using the following MeSH terms: \"Obesity\" OR \"Prader-Willi Syndrome\" AND \"Deep Brain Stimulation.\" The main outcomes were safety and weight loss measured with the body mass index (BMI). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methods were applied to evaluate the quality of evidence. This study protocol was registered with PROSPERO ID: CRD42019132929. Seven studies involving 12 patients met the inclusion criteria; the DBS target was the nucleus accumbens in four (57.1%), the lateral hypothalamic area in two (29.6%), and the ventral hypothalamus in one (14.3%). Further, 33% of participants had obesity secondary to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and 66.6% had primary obesity. The global BMI average at baseline was 46.7 (SD: 9.6, range: 32.2-59.1), and after DBS, 42.8 (SD: 8.8, range: 25-53.9), with a mean difference of 3.9; however, the delta in PWS patients was -2.3 and 10 in those with primary obesity. The incidence of moderate side effects was 33% and included manic symptoms (N = 2), electrode fracture (N = 1), and seizure (N = 1); mild complications (41.6%) included skin infection (N = 2), difficulties falling asleep (N = 1), nausea (N = 1), and anxiety (N = 1). Despite available small case series and case reports reporting a benefit in the treatment of refractory obesity with DBS, this study emphasizes the need for prospective studies with longer follow-ups in order to further address the efficacy and indications."

A 13-year-old Prader-Willi Syndrome female was treated by a T3-L5 posterior spine fusion for progressive scoliosis. Intraoperative neuromonitoring and immediate postoperative neurological examination were normal. Sixty hours after surgery, she developed a tetraplegia. The immediate MRI and CT scan of the spine were negative. Two days after, a new MRI revealed an ischemic cervical lesion at the level C5-C6. After 1 week, she gradually improved breathing and motility/sensibility at the extremities. After 4 months of intensive neurologic rehabilitation, the patient improved to ASIA grade D and was discharged. At 1-year follow, the neurologic recovery was nearly completed. We performed a systematic review of the literature through PubMed and Embase database focused on delayed postoperative cervical spinal cord lesion after a thoraco-lumbar fusion for spinal deformity. Only 14 cases of neurological injuries at levels above the site of surgery have been previously reported and never in Prader Willy Syndrome. All patients were adolescent and 86,7% were females but no specific risk factors were found. Delayed postoperative neurological deficit far from the surgical site can be considered a specific subgroup of these rare complication that can occur several hours after spine surgery, regardless of intraoperative complication. Despite the rarity of this complication, clinicians should be aware of it. Perioperative optimization of spinal cord perfusion and close neurological examination in first postoperative days may be helpful to quickly recognize and treat this complication."

All of them were treated in the Department of Endocrinology of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from May 2017 to December 2018. The clinical material, biochemical data, and peripheral blood samples of the patients were collected. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of patients, and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) was used to detect gene deletion or abnormal methylation. According to the results of detection, 35 patients were divided into two groups: paternal deletion group(<i>n</i>=27) and methylation abnormal group(<i>n</i>=8). The biochemical test results and the effect of growth hormone (GH) treatment of the two groups were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> MS-MLPA showed that 77% (27/35) of the patients were confirmed paternal deletion and 23% (8/35) were abnormal methylation. In terms of biochemical test results, the plasma concentrations of uric acid(UA) in the paternal deletion group were higher than that in the abnormal methylation group [(363±101) μmol/L vs (259±74) μ mol/L, <i>P</i>=0.019 ]. There is a linear relationship between body weight and uric acid level. After adjustment for weight., there was no significant difference in UA level between the two groups (<i>P</i>=0.101). Patients in both groups were treated with GH ((0.14±0.03) U/kg, QD). In paternal deletion group, patients were followed up for (26.0±13.6) months, and their height increased from (99.0±31.5) cm [(-0.3±1.1) SDS] to (107.5±27.0) cm [(0.7±0.9) SDS] (<i>P</i>=0.037). In the abnormal methylation group, patients were followed up for (25.8±11.6) months, and their height increased from (86.4±31.2) cm [(-0.7±1.8) SDS] to (95.6±26.5) cm [(0.0±1.6) SDS] (<i>P</i>=0.557).

The purpose of this retrospective study was to define the most commonly performed orthopedic procedures in pediatric patients with PWS and to characterize the peri-operative outcomes of these patients. The Kids Inpatient Database (KID) was queried to collect data and identify all pediatric patients with PWS who underwent orthopedic procedures from 2001 to 2012. A total of 3684 patients with PWS were identified, 334 of who underwent an orthopedic procedure. Population demographics, comorbidities, and specific procedures undergone were defined. The incidences of postoperative complications and length of associated hospital stay were additionally evaluated. Mean age of patients in this sample was 10.33 years (SD 4.5). The most common comorbidities included obesity (18.1%), chronic pulmonary disease (14.1%), hypothyroidism (5.1%), hypertension (5.1%), and uncomplicated diabetes (4%). Common procedures were spinal fusion (165/334, 49%) and lower extremity procedures (50/334, 15%). Complications included acute blood loss anemia, device related complications, pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary tract infections. The overall complication rate was 35.6%. Average hospital lengths of stay for patients undergoing spinal fusion was 6.68 days (SD 4.13), lower extremity orthopedic procedure was 5.65 days (SD 7.4), and all other orthopedic procedures was 7.74 days (SD 16.3). Orthopedic disorders are common in patients with PWS. Consequently, spinal fusions and lower extremity procedures are commonly performed in this patient population. Associated comorbid conditions may negatively impact surgical outcomes in these patients. This information should prove useful in the peri-operative management of patients with PWS undergoing orthopedic surgery and for shared decision making with families."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder caused by gene alterations on chromosome 15q11-q13, resulting in hyperphagia and neuroendocrine deficits. A comprehensive guide for dental treatment for PWS is lacking despite numerous case reports. The objective of this report was to develop a problem-focused list of the interrelationship between oral and systemic parameters of PWS and enable dentists in anticipating the unique treatment needs of children and individuals with PWS. Four pediatric patients with PWS presenting to an academic dental clinic were evaluated. A literature review spanning the last twenty years was performed to identify the pathophysiological impact of systemic problems on dental health and treatment. The four cases along with cases from the literature were used to enumerate salient oro-dental and systemic features influencing treatment decisions in dentistry. They formed the basis for collective recommendations and precautions for rendering dental treatment in patients with PWS. Sedation for dental treatment is contraindicated due to obesity (BMI over 95th percentile), hypotonia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and respiratory limitations (restricted ventilation due to weight on thoracic cage). Prolonged recovery from general anesthesia, OSA, and temperature dysregulation necessitate extended monitoring after dental rehabilitation under general anesthesia. Orthopedic problems and respiratory limitations exclude protective stabilization. Xerostomia and acidic saliva necessitate recommendations for oral rehydrating products. Periodontal assessment is necessary due to poor oral hygiene and diabetes mellitus. Early establishment of a dental home and risk-based frequency of dental care should address caries prevention and restorative needs."

    "title": "Transmission of a Novel Imprinting Center Deletion Associated With Prader-Willi Syndrome Through Three Generations of a Chinese Family: Case Presentation, Differential Diagnosis, and a Lesson Worth Thinking About.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic syndrome caused by the loss of function of genes in 15q11-q13 that are subject to regulation by genomic imprinting and expressed from the paternal allele only. The main clinical features of PWS patients are hypotonia during the neonatal and infantile stages, accompanied by delayed neuropsychomotor development, hyperphagia, obesity, hypogonadism, short stature, small hands and feet, mental disabilities, and behavioral problems. However, PWS has a clinical overlap with other disorders, especially those with other gene variations or chromosomal imbalances but sharing part of the similar clinical manifestations with PWS, which are sometimes referred to as Prader-Willi syndrome-like (PWS-like) disorders. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that significant obesity as a consequence of hyperphagia in PWS usually develops between the ages of 1 and 6 years, which makes early diagnosis difficult. Thus, PWS is often not clinically recognized in infants and, on the other hand, may be wrongly suspected in obese and intellectually disabled patients. Therefore, an accurate investigation is necessary to differentiate classical PWS from PWS-like phenotypes, which is imperative for further treatment. For PWS, it is usually sporadic, and very rare family history and affected siblings have been described. Here, we report the clinical and molecular findings in a three-generation family with a novel 550-kb microdeletion affecting the chromosome 15 imprinting center (IC). Overall, the present study finds that the symptoms of our patient are somewhat different from those of typical PWS cases diagnosed and given treatment in our hospital. The familial occurrence and clinical features were challenging to our diagnostic strategy. The microdeletion included a region within the complex small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide protein N (<i>SNRPN</i>) gene locus encompassing the PWS IC and was identified by using a variety of techniques. Haplotype studies suggest that the IC microdeletion was vertically transmitted from an unaffected paternal grandmother to an unaffected father and then caused PWS in two sibling grandchildren when the IC microdeletion was inherited paternally. Based on the results of our study, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) was applied successfully to exclude imprinting deficiency in preimplantation embryos before transfer into the mother's uterus. Our study may be especially instructive regarding accurate diagnosis, differential diagnosis, genetic counseling, and PGD for familial PWS patients."

    "title": "Thyroid Function in Adults with Prader-Willi Syndrome; a Cohort Study and Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic syndrome combining hypotonia, hyperphagia, a PWS-specific neurocognitive phenotype, and pituitary hormone deficiencies, including hypothyroidism. The low muscle mass associated with PWS causes a low energy expenditure due to a low basal metabolic rate. Combined with increased energy intake due to hyperphagia, this results in a high risk of obesity and associated cardiovascular disease. To reduce the high mortality in PWS (3% yearly), exercise is extremely important. As hypothyroidism can impair exercise tolerance, early detection is crucial. We performed a literature search for articles on hypothyroidism in PWS, measured thyroid hormone (TH) levels in 122 adults with PWS, and performed a medical file search for medication use. Hypothyroidism (low free thyroxin) was present in 17%, and often central in origin (80%). Triiodothyronine levels were lower in patients who used psychotropic drugs, while other TH levels were similar. One in six patients in our cohort of adults with PWS had hypothyroidism, which is more than in non-PWS adults (3%). We recommend yearly screening of free thyroxin and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels to avoid the negative effects of untreated hypothyroidism on basal metabolic rate, body mass index, and cardiovascular risk. Additionally, we recommend measuring TH concentrations 3-4 months after the start of growth hormone treatment."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterised by neurodevelopmental delays, hyperphagia, difficulties with social communication and challenging behaviours. Individuals require intensive supervision from caregivers which may negatively affect caregiver quality of life. This study used data collected in the Australasian PWS Registry (n = 50, mean age 11.2 years) to evaluate associations between child behaviours and caregiver mental well-being. Symptoms of sleep-related breathing disorder, child depression and social difficulties were associated with poorer caregiver mental and physical well-being. Growth hormone therapy use was associated with better caregiver mental and physical well-being. Optimising management of problematic behaviours and sleep disturbances have the potential to support caregivers who are the most vital network of support for individuals affected by PWS."

    "abstract": "<b>Background.</b> Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder causing quality of life impairments such as insatiable hunger (hyperphagia) and obesity. We explored caregivers' willingness to assume treatment risk in exchange for reduced hyperphagia according to a PWS-validated observer-reported outcome measure. <b>Methods.</b> We partnered with PWS patient organizations to develop a discrete-choice experiment exploring caregivers' benefit-risk tradeoffs for emerging PWS treatments. The treatment benefit was a reduction in hyperphagia (as measured by a 0-, 5-, or 10-point change on the Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials [HQ-CT]). Treatment risks included weight gain (none, 5%, 10%), added risk of skin rash (none, 10%, 20%), and risk of liver damage (none, 1 in 1000, 10 in 1000). Preference models were estimated using mixed logistic regression and maximum acceptable risk. We explored differences in preferences across familial caregivers of patients with and without hyperphagia. <b>Results.</b> Four hundred sixty-eight caregivers completed the online survey. The majority of caregivers reported that patients experienced hyperphagia (68%) and half of patients experienced obesity (52%). Caregivers of patients without hyperphagia were willing to accept greater weight gain (16.4% v. 8.1%, <i>P</i> = 0.004) and a higher risk of skin rash (11.7% v. 6.2% <i>P</i> = 0.008) as compared to caregivers of patients with hyperphagia. Caregivers of patients with hyperphagia would accept a higher risk of liver damage as compared to caregivers of patients without hyperphagia (11.9 out of 1000 v. 6.4 out of 1000, <i>P</i> = 0.04). <b>Conclusions.</b> This research demonstrates that caregivers are willing to accept risk in exchange for a five-point improvement on the HQ-CT, a smaller marginal improvement than had been previously classified as meaningful. Patient experience with hyperphagia is a modifier in how much risk caregivers will accept."

Given high rates of psychiatric comorbidity and potential risk factors for suicide in PWS, this study sought a first estimate of the prevalence of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempts (SA) in the PWS population and any characteristics associated with suicidality in this population. Using the Global Prader-Willi Syndrome Registry, we included all participants who had answered a question about SI. We examined the most recent data from the surveys about social, economic, and demographic factors, genetic subtype, and psychiatric symptoms and treatments. A chi-square analysis was used to compare registry participants who reported SI to those without reported SI. From 750 included survey respondents, 94 (12.5%) endorsed some history of SI. Of these, 25 (26.6%) also reported a history of SA, with an average age of 16.25 years at their first attempt. Those with a history of SI were predominantly male and adult age, and had higher rates of aggression and psychiatric comorbidities, therapies, and medications. This study indicates that the rate of SI and SA in PWS is comparable to the general population, and that suicide attempts in PWS typically begin in middle-teenage years. Despite unique challenges, individuals with PWS and their caregivers should be included in screens and psychoeducation for suicide and mental health concerns."

Original mechanism of diaphyseal and metaphyseal modeling defects has proved elusive. Studying rare syndromes can elucidate mechanisms of common disorders and identify potential therapeutic targets. <b>Methods:</b> We evaluated a family pedigree with craniometadiaphyseal dysplasia (CRMDD, OMIM 269300), a genetic disorder that is characterized by cortical-bone thinning, limb deformity, and absent of normal metaphyseal flaring and diaphyseal constriction. Systemic radiographic examination and serum hormone test were made for this rare disease. One patient and her two normal parents were examined by means of whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify the candidate pathogenic gene and rule out mucopolysaccharidosis and Prader-Willi Syndrome by means of Sanger sequencing. <b>Results:</b> There are several conspicuous radiographic characteristics: (1) bullet-shaped phalanges, (2) long and narrow pelvic inlet, absent of supra-acetabular constriction, (3) round rod-shaped long tubular bones, (4) prominent aiploic mastoid, (5) bending-shaped limb, genua varus and genu varum, and (6) congenital dislocation of elbow. Here, we did not find any wormian bones, and there are several typical clinical characteristics: (1) macrocephaly and wide jaw, (2) Avatar elf-shaped ears, pointed and protruding ears, (3) hypertrophy of limbs, (4) flat feet and giant hand phenomenon, (5) nail dystrophy, (6) limb deformity, (7) high-arched palate, (8) superficial hemangiomas, (9) tall stature, and intellectual disability. In this patient, we found biallelic frameshift deletion mutations in WRAP53, and those two mutations were transmitted from her parents respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> We describe her clinical and radiological findings and presented a new subtype without wormian bones and with a tall stature.

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a complex multisystem genetic disorder associated with several challenges for people with PWS themselves, and for their families and care givers. Support around access to food is a particular issue due to impaired satiety and, because of this, people with PWS eat excessive amounts of food (hyperphagia). Together with other aspects of the PWS phenotype including, in many cases, a reduced sensitivity to pain, hyperphagia results in life-threatening obesity and life-shortening complications for some people with PWS. Restrictions to liberty and/or access to food raise important legal and ethical considerations in the clinical management of children and adults with PWS. Particularly where disagreements arise and, in the absence of comprehensive guidance for care providers, the courts may be called upon to resolve these difficult issues. 1) To review case-law from English-speaking common law jurisdictions concerning support arrangements for people with PWS with a view to identifying issues that have required the intervention of the courts. 2) To identify principles on which to base clinical guidelines relating to the issues identified, ensuring that such guidelines are consistent with ethical and human rights imperatives. Westlaw, Westlaw AU, and Lexis Nexis were searched for case law concerning the treatment or support of a person with PWS. Fifteen cases from jurisdictions in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America met inclusion criteria. Areas requiring judicial decision making included a) detention in psychiatric hospital; b) support in least restrictive environments c) eligibility for support services; d) guardianship; e) access to special education.

Whether hypothyroidism is present in patients with PWS, and especially infants and young children, remains unclear. The aims of this study were to evaluate thyroid function in patients with PWS, to assess the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction, and to evaluate the effect of growth hormone on thyroid function. Subjects were 23 patients with PWS ages 3 months to 3 years who were followed for up to one year. Four patients were lost to follow-up after the first visit. The remaining 19 patients were treated with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH). PWS was diagnosed based on a genetic analysis. Free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were evaluated before and after growth hormone treatment. A total of 9 patients (9/23 = 39.1%) developed abnormal thyroid function. Five out of 23 patients (21.7%) had abnormal thyroid function before growth hormone treatment. Four patients developed thyroid dysfunction during the 3- to 9-month period of rhGH treatment. Of the 9 patients with abnormal thyroid function, 7 (5 boys, 2 girls) had central hypothyroidism, and the other 2 patients had subclinical hypothyroidism. TSH levels were higher in patients with PWS due to maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) than in patients with PWS due to a 15q11-q13 deletion. The prevalence of hypothyroidism was high in infants and young children with PWS. Thyroid function should be regularly monitored in patients with PWS at both diagnosis and follow-up."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic syndrome, caused by the loss of expression of the paternal chromosome 15q11-q13 region. Over the past years, many cases of patients with characteristics similar to PWS, but without a typical genetic aberration of the 15q11-q13 region, have been described. These patients are often labelled as Prader-Willi-like (PWL). PWL is an as-yet poorly defined syndrome, potentially affecting a significant number of children and adults. In the current clinical practice, patients labelled as PWL are mostly left without treatment options. Considering the similarities with PWS, children with PWL might benefit from the same care and treatment as children with PWS. This review gives more insight into the pheno- and genotype of PWL and includes 86 papers, containing 368 cases of patients with a PWL phenotype. We describe mutations and aberrations for consideration when suspicion of PWS remains after negative testing. The most common genetic diagnoses were Temple syndrome (formerly known as maternal uniparental disomy 14), Schaaf-Yang syndrome (truncating mutation in the MAGEL2 gene), 1p36 deletion, 2p deletion, 6q deletion, 6q duplication, 15q deletion, 15q duplication, 19p deletion, fragile X syndrome, and Xq duplication. We found that the most prevalent symptoms in the entire group were developmental delay/intellectual disability (76%), speech problems (64%), overweight/obesity (57%), hypotonia (56%), and psychobehavioral problems (53%). In addition, we propose a diagnostic approach to patients with a PWL phenotype for (pediatric) endocrinologists. PWL comprises a complex and diverse group of patients, which calls for multidisciplinary care with an individualized approach."

    "abstract": "The mainstay management of hyperphagia and obesity in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) relies on dietary restrictions, strict supervision and behavioural modifications, which can be stressful for the patient and caregiver. There is no established pharmacological strategy to manage this aspect of PWS. Theoretically, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) used in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may be efficacious in weight and glycaemic control of PWS patients. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to summarize the evidence on the use of GLP1-RA in PWS patients. Primary studies were searched in major databases using key concepts 'Prader-Willi syndrome' and 'GLP1 receptor agonist' and outcomes, 'weight control OR glycaemic control OR appetite regulation'. Ten studies included, summarizing GLP1-RA use in 23 PWS patients (age, 13-37 years), who had used either exenatide (n = 14) or liraglutide (n = 9) over a duration of 14 weeks to 4 years. Sixteen (70%) of these patients had T2DM. Ten patients experienced improvement in body mass index, ranging from 1.5 to 16.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> , while improvement in HbA1c was seen in 19 of 23 cases, ranging between 0.3% and 7.5%. All five studies reporting appetite or satiety showed improvement in satiety levels. There were no reported serious side effects. GLP1-RA appears safe in PWS patients and may have potential benefits for weight, glycaemic and appetite control. Nonetheless, we also highlight a significant gap in the literature on the lack of well-designed studies in this area, which limits the recommendation of GLP1-RA use in PWS patients at present."

Psychotic illness is common, particularly in patients with maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD), and antipsychotic medications can result in hyperprolactinemia. Information about hyperprolactinemia and its potential clinical consequences in PWS is sparse. Here, we present data from an international, observational study of 45 adults with PWS and hyperprolactinemia. Estimated prevalence of hyperprolactinemia in a subset of centres with available data was 22%, with 66% of those related to medication and 55% due to antipsychotics. Thirty-three patients were men, 12 women. Median age was 29 years, median BMI 29.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 13 had mUPD. Median prolactin was 680 mIU/L (range 329-5702). Prolactin levels were higher in women and patients with mUPD, with only 3 patients having severe hyperprolactinemia. Thyroid function tests were normal, 24 were treated with growth hormone, 29 with sex steroids, and 20 with antipsychotic medications. One patient had kidney insufficiency, and one a microprolactinoma. In conclusion, severe hyperprolactinemia was rare, and the most common aetiology of hyperprolactinemia was treatment with antipsychotic medications. Although significant clinical consequences could not be determined, potential negative long-term effects of moderate or severe hyperprolactinemia cannot be excluded. Our results suggest including measurements of prolactin in the follow-up of adults with PWS, especially in those on treatment with antipsychotics."

However, the prevalence of hyponatremia in PWS has rarely been reported. Our aim was to describe the prevalence and severity of hyponatremia in PWS. In October 2020, we performed a retrospective study based on the medical records of a large cohort of children and adults with PWS from seven countries. Among 1326 patients (68% adults), 34 (2.6%) had at least one episode of mild or moderate hyponatremia (125 ≤ Na < 135 mmol/L). The causes of non-severe hyponatremia were often multi-factorial, including psychotropic medication in 32%, EFI in 24% and hyperglycemia in 12%. No obvious cause was found in 29%. Seven (0.5%) adults experienced severe hyponatremia (Na < 125 mmol/L). Among these, five recovered completely, but two died. The causes of severe hyponatremia were desmopressin treatment for nocturnal enuresis (<i>n</i> = 2), EFI (<i>n</i> = 2), adrenal insufficiency (<i>n</i> = 1), diuretic treatment (<i>n</i> = 1) and unknown (<i>n</i> = 1). In conclusion, severe hyponatremia was very rare but potentially fatal in PWS. Desmopressin treatment for nocturnal enuresis should be avoided. Enquiring about EFI and monitoring serum sodium should be included in the routine follow-ups of patients with PWS."

SETDB1 is widely expressed in human tissues, methylating Histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) residues, promoting chromatin compaction and exerting negative regulation on gene expression. SETDB1 has a central role in normal physiology and nervous system development, having been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression, inactivation of the X chromosome, immune cells function, expression of retroelements and formation of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NB). SETDB1 has been frequently deregulated in carcinogenesis, being implicated in the pathogenesis of gliomas, melanomas, as well as in lung, breast, gastrointestinal and ovarian tumors, where it mainly exerts an oncogenic role. Aberrant activity of SETDB1 has also been implicated in several neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases, including schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, congenital heart defects and inflammatory bowel disease. Herein, we provide an update on the unique structural and biochemical features of SETDB1 that contribute to its regulation, as well as its molecular and cellular impact in normal physiology and disease with potential therapeutic options."

The aims of this retrospective study were to analyze interictal EEG findings in a group of PWS patients and to correlate them with genetic, clinical, and neuroimaging data. The demographic, clinical, genetic, EEG, and neuroimaging data of seventy-four patients were collected. Associations among the presence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities, genotype, and clinical and neuroimaging features were investigated. Four patients (5.4%) presented drug-sensitive epilepsy. Interictal paroxysmal EEG abnormalities-focal or multifocal-were present in 25.7% of the cases, and the normalization of the EEG occurred in about 25% of the cases. In 63.2% of the cases, the paroxysmal abnormalities were bilaterally localized over the middle-posterior regions. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on 39 patients (abnormal in 59%). No relevant associations were found between paroxysmal EEG abnormalities and all of the other variables considered. Interictal paroxysmal EEG abnormalities-in particular, with a bilateral middle-posterior localization-could represent an important neurological feature of PWS that is not associated with genotype, cognitive or behavioral endophenotypes, MRI anomalies, or prognosis."

The goal of this study was to establish the content validity (ie, evidence that an instrument measures an intended concept of interest) of the parent/caregiver version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale for Children and Adolescents (ESS-CHAD), a measure of daytime sleepiness, in PWS. Qualitative, dyadic semistructured video interviews were conducted with 18 caregivers and their children with PWS from April to June 2020. Concept elicitation and cognitive interview techniques were implemented. Thematic analyses allowed for examination of themes and data patterns. All caregivers (mean age 49 years) were mothers of individuals with PWS who experienced troublesome daytime sleepiness (mean age 14 years). The most prevalent observable signs/symptoms of daytime sleepiness were sleepy/sleepiness (n = 17; 94.4%), tired/tiredness (n = 16; 88.9%), exhaustion/exhausted (n = 5; 27.8%), anxious/stressed (n = 5; 27.8%), irritable/frustrated (n = 5; 27.8%), having tantrums/outbursts (n = 5; 27.8%), and lethargy (n = 4; 22.2%). Daytime sleepiness impacted various aspects of health including mental, emotional, physical, and social well-being. When caregivers were asked about the activities associated with daytime sleepiness, all salient concepts elicited mapped to the ESS-CHAD; saturation was met after the first 4 interviews. Only 2 concepts, after physical exertion and while inactive/bored, did not map. Caregiver statements indicated that these concepts, although related to daytime activities, were atypical of daily routines. The ESS-CHAD was well understood and relevant to caregivers. This study supports the content validity of the ESS-CHAD and its appropriateness for evaluating treatment efficacy of daytime sleepiness in PWS.

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations affecting paternal chromosome 15q11-q13, and characterized by hypotonia, hyperphagia, impaired cognition, and behavioural problems. Psychotic illness is a challenging problem for individuals with PWS and has different rates of prevalence in distinct PWS genotypes. Previously, we demonstrated behavioural and cognitive endophenotypes of relevance to psychiatric illness in a mouse model for one of the associated PWS genotypes, namely PWS-IC, in which deletion of the imprinting centre leads to loss of paternally imprinted gene expression and over-expression of Ube3a. Here we examine the broader gene expression changes that are specific to the psychiatric endophenotypes seen in this model. To do this we compared the brain transcriptomic profile of the PWS-IC mouse to the PWS-cr model that carries a deletion of the PWS minimal critical interval spanning the snoRNA Snord116 and Ipw. Firstly, we examined the same behavioural and cognitive endophenotypes of relevance to psychiatric illness in the PWS-cr mice. Unlike the PWS-IC mice, PWS-cr exhibit no differences in locomotor activity, sensory-motor gating, and attention. RNA-seq analysis of neonatal whole brain tissue revealed a greater number of transcriptional changes between PWS-IC and wild-type littermates than between PWS-cr and wild-type littermates. Moreover, the differentially expressed genes in the PWS-IC brain were enriched for GWAS variants of episodes of psychotic illness but, interestingly, not schizophrenia.

    "title": "Sleep disordered breathing in patients with Prader willi syndrome: Impact of underlying genetic mechanism.",
    "abstract": "Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in children with PWS. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the severity of SDB in patients with PWS using polysomnography (PSG), and assess the effect of the underlying genetic mechanism on PSG parameters. Children with PWS, referred to our sleep laboratory between March 2016 and January 2020 were enrolled. PSG parameters, demographic data, body mass index (BMI), and symptoms related to SDB were recorded. The effect of non-invasive ventilation strategies and the outcome of therapy on PSG parameters were evaluated. In our study, 64.5% of the patients had severe sleep apnea syndrome (total apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥10 events/hour). 22.6% had significantly high (>5 events/hour) central sleep apnea. Patients with a deletion had significantly lower initial and mean SaO<sub>2</sub>, longer sleep time SaO<sub>2</sub> under 90%, oxygen desaturation % and total AHI when compared to those with uniparental disomy. PSG parameters were similar between patients who did or didn't receive growth hormone treatment. The majority of the PWS patients had severe sleep apnea syndrome characterized mainly by hypopneas which were accompanied by central apneas. There was a more severe impact on oxygen parameters and total AHI in patients with deletions."

    "title": "Sleep-disordered breathing in Australian children with Prader-Willi syndrome following initiation of growth hormone therapy.",
    "abstract": "In children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), growth hormone (GH) improves height and body composition; however, may be associated with worsening sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Some studies have reported less SDB after GH initiation, but follow-up with polysomnography is still advised in most clinical guidelines. This retrospective, multicentre study, included children with PWS treated with GH at seven PWS treatment centres in Australia over the last 18 years. A paired analysis comparing polysomnographic measures of central and obstructive SDB in the same child, before and after GH initiation was performed with Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The proportion of children who developed moderate/severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) was calculated with their binomial confidence intervals. We included 112 patients with available paired data. The median age at start of GH was 1.9 years (range 0.1-13.5 years). Median obstructive apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) at baseline was 0.43/h (range 0-32.9); 35% had an obstructive AHI above 1.0/h. Follow-up polysomnography within 2 years after the start of GH was available in 94 children who did not receive OSA treatment. After GH initiation, there was no change in central AHI. The median obstructive AHI did not increase significantly (P = 0.13), but 12 children (13%, CI<sub>95%</sub> 7-21%) developed moderate/severe OSA, with clinical management implications. Our findings of a worsening of OSA severity in 13% of children with PWS support current advice to perform polysomnography after GH initiation. Early identification of worsening OSA may prevent severe sequelae in a subgroup of children."

    "title": "Patients with PWS and related syndromes display differentially methylated regions involved in neurodevelopmental and nutritional trajectory.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a paternal deficiency of maternally imprinted gene expression located in the chromosome 15q11-q13 region. Previous studies have demonstrated that several classes of neurodevelopmental disorders can be attributed to either over- or under-expression of specific genes that may lead to impairments in neuronal generation, differentiation, maturation and growth. Epigenetic changes that modify gene expression have been highlighted in these disorders. One recent study focused on epigenetic analysis and compared patients with PWS with patients with other imprinting disorders. No study, however, has yet focused on epigenetics in patients with PWS specifically by comparing the mutations associated with this syndrome. This study investigated the epigenetic modifications in patients with PWS and patients with PWS-related disorders caused by inactivation of two genes of the PWS chromosomal region, SNORD116 and MAGEL2. Our approach also aimed to compare the epigenetic modifications in PWS and PWS-related disorders. We compared genome-wide methylation analysis (GWAS) in seven blood samples from patients with PWS phenotype (five with deletions of the PWS locus, one with a microdeletion of SNORD116 and one with a frameshift mutation of MAGEL2 presenting with Schaaf-Yang syndrome), as well as two control patients. Controls were infants that had been studied for suspicion of genetic diseases that was not confirmed by the genetic analysis and the clinical follow-up. The analysis identified 29,234 differentially methylated cytosines, corresponding to 5,308 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), which matched with 2,280 genes. The DMRs in patients with PWS were associated with neurodevelopmental pathways, endocrine dysfunction and social and addictive processes consistent with the key features of the PWS phenotype. In addition, the separate analysis for the SNORD116 and MAGEL2 deletions revealed that the DMRs associated with the SNORD116 microdeletion were found in genes implicated in metabolic pathways and nervous system development, whereas MAGEL2 mutations mostly concerned genes involved in macromolecule biosynthesis. The PWS is associated with epigenetic modifications with differences in SNORD116 and MAGEL2 mutations, which seem to be relevant to the different associated phenotypes."

    "abstract": "Adequate sleep is important for proper neurodevelopment and positive health outcomes. Sleep disturbances are more prevalent in children with genetically determined neurodevelopmental syndromes compared with typically developing counterparts. We characterize sleep behavior in Rett (RTT), Angelman (AS), and Prader-Willi (PWS) syndromes to identify effective approaches for treating sleep problems in these populations. We compared sleep-related symptoms across individuals with these different syndromes with each other, and with typically developing controls. Children were recruited from the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network consortium registries; unaffected siblings were enrolled as related controls. For each participant, a parent completed multiple sleep questionnaires including Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (Sleep-Disordered Breathing), Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), and Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale. Sleep data were analyzed from 714 participants, aged two to 18 years. Young children with AS had more reported sleep problems than children with RTT or PWS. Older children with RTT had more reported daytime sleepiness than those with AS or PWS. Finally, all individuals with RTT had more evidence of sleep-disordered breathing when compared with individuals with PWS. Notably, typically developing siblings were also reported to have sleep problems, except for sleep-related breathing disturbances, which were associated with each of the genetic syndromes. Individuals with RTT, AS, and PWS frequently experience sleep problems, including sleep-disordered breathing. Screening for sleep problems in individuals with these and other neurogenetic disorders should be included in clinical assessment and managements. These data may also be useful in developing treatment strategies and in clinical trials."

    "abstract": "CPE encodes carboxypeptidase E, an enzyme that converts proneuropeptides and propeptide hormones to bioactive forms. It is widely expressed in the endocrine and central nervous system. To date, 4 individuals from 2 families with core clinical features including morbid obesity, neurodevelopmental delay, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, harboring biallelic loss-of-function (LoF) CPE variants, have been reported. We describe 4 affected individuals from 3 unrelated consanguineous families, 2 siblings of Syrian, 1 of Egyptian, and 1 of Pakistani descent, all harboring novel homozygous CPE LoF variants. After excluding Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), exome sequencing was performed in both Syrian siblings. The variants identified in the other 2 individuals were reported as research variants in a large-scale exome study and in the ClinVar database. Computational modeling of all possible missense alterations allowed assessing CPE tolerance to missense variants. All affected individuals were severely obese with neurodevelopmental delay and other endocrine anomalies. Three individuals from 2 families shared the same CPE homozygous truncating variant c.361C > T, p.(Arg121*), while the fourth carried the c.994del, p.(Ser333Alafs*22) variant. Comparison of clinical features with previously described cases and standardization according to the Human Phenotype Ontology terms indicated a recognizable clinical phenotype, which we termed Blakemore-Durmaz-Vasileiou (BDV) syndrome. Computational analysis indicated high conservation of CPE domains and intolerance to missense changes. Biallelic truncating CPE variants are associated with BDV syndrome, a clinically recognizable monogenic recessive syndrome with childhood-onset obesity, neurodevelopmental delay, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and hypothyroidism. BDV syndrome resembles PWS. Our findings suggest missense variants may also be clinically relevant."

Pelvic ultrasound findings and basal/stimulated gonadotrophins were compared with age-matched controls. Females:of 22 patients aged > 11, 9 had reached B4-5, while 5 were still at B2-3, and 6 remained prepubertal. Eight patients experienced menarche aged 9.8-21.4 years, none with a normal cycle. Uterine length and ovarian volumes were normal but uterine configuration remained immature, with low follicular counts. Gonadotrophins were unremarkable, serum oestradiol 129 (70-520) pmol/L. Only 5 patients received oestrogen replacement. Males:fifty-four (96%) patients were cryptorchid (9 unilateral). Weekly hCG injections resulted in unilateral/bilateral descent in 2/1 of 25 patients.

Despite invariable hypogonadism, few females and only half the males with PWS in this study received hormone replacement. Double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trials of sex steroids are required to address unproven behavioural concerns."

Using data from the Global PWS Registry, we performed a cross-sectional study of vision problems in PWS. Data, reported by caregivers who completed the Vision Survey in the Global PWS Registry between May of 2015 and March of 2020, were analyzed using descriptive statistics. There were 908 participants in this survey, with a mean age of 14.5 years (range 0-62 years). The prevalence of strabismus in this population was 40 %, with no statistically significant difference in prevalence by genetic subtype. Ninety-one percent of participants with strabismus were diagnosed before 5 years of age. Of those with strabismus, 42 % went on to have strabismus surgery, with 86 % of those having their first strabismus surgery before 5 years of age and 10.1 % having more than one strabismus surgery. Additional vision issues reported included myopia (41 %), hyperopia (25 %), astigmatism (25 %), and amblyopia (16 %). The prevalence of strabismus, amblyopia, and hyperopia are considerably higher in the PWS population represented in the Global PWS Registry as compared to the general population. People with PWS should be screened early and regularly for vision problems."

About 42 youth with PWS and 65 youth without PWS but with obesity (body fat percentage >95th percentile for age and sex), aged 8-16 years, participated. The intervention included preplanned PA sessions containing playground and console-based video games scheduled 4 days per week for 24 weeks. Families received training and curriculum materials. PA (accelerometry), MP (Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of MP), and health-related quality of life were obtained before (PRE), after completing the intervention (POST), and at FU. There were no significant changes in PA at any time point. At FU and POST, participants showed higher bilateral coordination (PRE = 9.3 [0.4], POST = 11.7 [0.5], and FU = 11.1 [0.6]); speed and agility (PRE = 9.2 [0.4], POST = 10.8 [0.4], and FU = 11.5 [0.5]); and strength (PRE = 8.0 [0.3], POST = 9.2 [0.3], and FU = 9.2 [0.3]) than at PRE. At FU (80.3 [2.1]) and POST (79.8 [1.7]), youth without PWS showed higher health-related quality of life than PRE (75.0 [1.8]). The improvements in MP and health-related quality of life at FU suggest long-term durability of intervention outcomes."

We evaluated the utility of methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) as a diagnostic tool and for demonstrating the relationship between molecular mechanisms and clinical presentation. We performed MS-MLPA using DNA samples from 93 subjects (45 PWS, 24 AS, and 24 non-PWS/AS controls) who had previously undergone MS-PCR for the diagnosis of PWS/AS. We compared the results of both assays, and patients' clinical phenotypes were reviewed retrospectively. MS-MLPA showed a 100% concordance rate with MS-PCR. Among the 45 PWS patients, 26 (57.8%) had a deletion of 15q11-q13, and the others (42.2%) had uniparental disomy 15 or an imprinting defect. Among the 24 AS patients, 16 (66.7%) had a deletion of 15q11-q13, 7 AS patients (29.2%) had uniparental disomy 15 or an imprinting defect, and one AS patient (4.2%) showed an imprinting center deletion. MS-MLPA has clinical utility for the diagnosis of PWS/AS, and it is superior to MS-PCR in that it can identify the molecular mechanism underlying the disease."

This study aimed to determine impairments in planning skills of adults with PWS, in relation with their intellectual disabilities, as well as the influence of food compulsions on their performance. A modified version of the Zoo Map from the Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome was used in three groups: a group of adults with PWS in comparison with two groups both matched on chronological age, one with typical development (TD) and one with intellectual disability (ID). Compared to TD adults, both adults with PWS and ID showed increased planning time and lower raw scores on the planning task. The execution time and the number of errors were higher in the PWS group compared to the comparison groups. All three groups performed worse in the non-food condition only for number of errors and raw score. Planning abilities were impaired in PWS adults. Results also showed that intellectual level plays a role in participants' performance. These findings are essential to understand the difficulties of people with PWS daily life."

Despite its transient expression, moto development is delayed and deficiencies in motor coordination are present at older ages, with no clear pathophysiological mechanism yet identified. The diverse motor coordination symptoms present in adult PWS patients could be, in part, the result of a common alteration(s) in basic motor control systems. We aimed to examine the motor system in PWS using functional MRI (fMRI) during motor challenge. Twenty-three adults with PWS and 22 matched healthy subjects participated in the study. fMRI testing involved three hand motor tasks of different complexity. Additional behavioral measurements of motor function were obtained by evaluating hand grip strength, functional mobility, and balance. Whole brain activation maps were compared between groups and correlated with behavioral measurements. Performance of the motor tasks in PWS engaged the neural elements typically involved in motor processing. While our data showed no group differences in the simplest task, increasing task demands evoked significantly weaker activation in patients in the cerebellum. Significant interaction between group and correlation pattern with measures of motor function were also observed. Our study provides novel insights into the neural substrates of motor control in PWS by demonstrating reduced cerebellar activation during movement coordination."

The combination of growth hormone treatment and multidisciplinary care (GHMDc) has greatly improved the health of children with PWS. Little is known about the effects of childhood GHMDc on health outcomes in adulthood. We retrospectively collected clinical data of 109 adults with PWS. Thirty-nine had received GHMDc during childhood and adolescence (GHMDc+ group) and sixty-three had never received growth hormone treatment (GHt) nor multidisciplinary care (GHMDc- group). Our systematic screening revealed fewer undetected health problems in the GHMDc+ group (10%) than in the GHMDc- group (84%). All health problems revealed in the GHMDc+ group had developed between the last visit to the paediatric and the first visit to the adult clinic and/or did not require treatment. Mean BMI and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus type 2 were significantly lower in the GHMDc+ group compared to the GHMDc- group. As all patients who received GHt were treated in a multidisciplinary setting, it is unknown which effects are the result of GHt and which are the result of multidisciplinary care. However, our data clearly show that the combination of both has beneficial effects. Therefore, we recommend continuing GHMDc after patients with PWS have reached adult age."

    "abstract": "Oxytocin (OXT) -\"the love hormone\"- has been involved in the anti-depressant activity of some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The exact mechanism underlying the OXT pathway in depression is not fully clear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of OXT analogue, carbetocin (CBT) and the SSRI, escitalopram (ESCIT) on depressive-like behaviors following maternal separation (MS). It is worthy to mention that intranasal CBT has been approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Prader-Willi syndrome. Adolescent Wistar albino maternally-separated rats were given CBT, (100 µg/animal/d via inhalation route), and, ESCIT, (20 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, per os ( p.o.)) either alone or in combination for 7 d. Repeated 3-h MS demonstrated increased immobility time in forced swim test (FST) and decreased locomotor activity in open field test. MS elevated plasma level of adrenocortico-trophic hormone (ACTH) but notably reduced plasma OXT, with no effect on hippocampal OXT-R expression. Following MS, hippocampal contents of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors (5HT1A-R), serotonin transporter (SERT) were increased. CBT and ESCIT corrected the behavioral dysfunction in FST and suppressed the high levels of ACTH. Additionally, both treatments boosted OXT level, reduced 5HT1A-R and normalized SERT contents, which reflects increased availability of serotonin. Finally, CBT markedly ameliorated the histopathological damage induced by MS and suppressed the increased glial fibrillary acidic protein. CBT and ESCIT manage depressive-like behavior by positively affecting serotonergic and oxytocinergic systems. Targeting OXT system -using CBT- ameliorated depressive like behaviors induced by maternal separation most probably via enhancing OXT plasma levels, attenuating hormonal ACTH and restoring the expression of hippocampal oxytocin and serotonin mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Prader-Labhart-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, behavioural problems, hypothalamic dysfunction, and specific dysmorphisms. Hypothalamic dysfunction causes growth hormone deficiency, dysregulation of energy balance, and hypogonadism. Although hypogonadism is prevalent in PWS, there are no clear guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. In particular, gonadal hormone substitution is a matter of debate due to concerns associated with the potentially induced aggressive behaviour, foremost in males, by sex steroids. In 2019, a workshop dedicated to hypogonadism was held prior to the 10th International PWS Organization Conference. In this context, we designed a questionnaire to assess \"the current standard of care\" of hypogonadism in children and adults with PWS, which was sent out to physicians caring for people with PWS worldwide. Responses were received from a total of 24 centres located in 19 countries. Participating centres treat a total number of at least 1,000 children and adults with PWS. Responses showed limited consensus on who should be treated or at what age treatment should commence. Remarkably, very few behavioural problems were attributed to hormone substitution. Based on our findings, we make recommendations to progress the knowledge on hypogonadism in PWS and improve daily practice."

    "abstract": "Growth hormone treatment for children with Prader Willi syndrome (PWS) has shown proven benefits not only in increasing final height but also with positive effects on body composition and motor development. In a recent letter to the editor, Hoybye and colleagues recommend growth hormone treatment for adults with PWS based exclusively on the genetic diagnosis and without regard for growth hormone secretory status. We question whether the benefits of growth hormone treatment in PWS adults, mainly improvement in body composition, are significant enough to justify the as yet unkown consequences of long-term treatment in an adult population. Morbidity and mortality in PWS are mainly due to complications of obesity, and growth hormone treatment does not result in a decrease in BMI or waist circumference. Increases in insulin-like factor-1 as a result of growth hormone treatment over the course of several decades in PWS adults raises concern over possible increase risk of cancer. Compliance with daily injections is likely to be poor. We suggest that efforts to provide appropriate dietary and exercise regimens may be more beneficial and cost-effective than advocating for growth hormone treatment for adults with PWS."

    "abstract": "Necdin was originally found in 1991 as a hypothetical protein encoded by a neural differentiation-specific gene transcript in murine embryonal carcinoma cells. Virtually all postmitotic neurons and their precursor cells express the necdin gene (Ndn) during neuronal development. Necdin mRNA is expressed only from the paternal allele through genomic imprinting, a placental mammal-specific epigenetic mechanism. Necdin and its homologous MAGE (melanoma antigen) family, which have evolved presumedly from a subcomplex component of the SMC5/6 complex, are expressed exclusively in placental mammals. Paternal Ndn-mutated mice totally lack necdin expression and exhibit various types of neuronal abnormalities throughout the nervous system. Ndn-null neurons are vulnerable to detrimental stresses such as DNA damage. Necdin also suppresses both proliferation and apoptosis of neural stem/progenitor cells. Functional analyses using Ndn-manipulated cells reveal that necdin consistently exerts antimitotic, anti-apoptotic and prosurvival effects. Necdin interacts directly with a number of regulatory proteins including E2F1, p53, neurotrophin receptors, Sirt1 and PGC-1α, which serve as major hubs of protein-protein interaction networks for mitosis, apoptosis, differentiation, neuroprotection and energy homeostasis. This review focuses on necdin as a pleiotropic protein that integrates molecular interaction networks to promote neuronal vitality in modern placental mammals."

Seventy-one children, aged 4-15 years: 24 with PWS, 23 with ASD, and 24 community controls, were assessed on two standardized parent-reported questionnaires: the child behavior check list (CBCL) and the autism spectrum quotient (AQ). Group differences were tested with one-way ANOVA. ASD had higher CBCL internalizing symptom scores (67.50±9.09) than PWS (56.62±9.02, Cohen's d=1.20). On specific CBCL items, PWS had more obsessionality than ASD, which, in turn, showed more impulsivity than PWS. ASD had higher AQ scores than PWS, with small to medium effect sizes (d's ranging from 0.22 to 0.53). The PWS phenotype was characterized by intense obsessionality, more marked than in ASD. ASD had greater psychopathology than PWS, especially of the internalizing type. Although limited by the small sample size, this study identified obsessionality as a common feature in PSW. Considering the negative impact on daily functioning, this symptom deserves clinical attention for specific treatment approaches."

Glucose metabolism parameters were favourable in groups 1 and 2, and the lipid profile was comparable in all groups. BA/CA was similar between the older groups. rhGH therapy was most effective in the youngest patients, before the nutritional phase of increased appetite. We did not observe worsening of metabolic parameters or BA/CA advancement in older patients during a comparable time of rhGH therapy."

Centrally, kisspeptin is involved in regulating reproductive function and can stimulate hypothalamic hormones such as GH. Peripherally, kisspeptin signaling influences energy and metabolic status. We evaluated the effect of 12-month GH treatment on plasma kisspeptin levels in 27 GH-deficient adult PWS patients and analyzed its relationship with metabolic and anthropometric changes. Twenty-seven matched obese subjects and 22 healthy subjects were also studied. Before treatment, plasma kisspeptin concentrations in PWS and obese subjects were similar (140.20 (23.5-156.8) pg/mL vs. 141.96 (113.9-165.6) pg/mL, respectively, <i>p =</i> 0.979)) and higher (<i>p =</i> 0.019) than in healthy subjects (124.58 (107.3-139.0) pg/mL); plasma leptin concentrations were similar in PWS and obese subjects (48.15 (28.80-67.10) ng/mL vs. 33.10 (20.50-67.30) ng/mL, respectively, <i>p =</i> 0.152) and higher (<i>p</i> < 0.001) than in healthy subjects (14.80 (11.37-67.30) ng/mL). After GH therapy, lean body mass increased 2.1% (<i>p =</i> 0.03), total fat mass decreased 1.6% (<i>p</i> = 0.005), and plasma kisspeptin decreased to levels observed in normal-weight subjects (125.1(106.2-153.4) pg/mL, <i>p =</i> 0.027).

    "abstract": "The chromosomal 15q11-q13 regions are structurally complex, and their abnormalities are associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy, Angelman syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome. A 6-year-old child was admitted to the hospital as a result of an \"epileptic status\" showing ASD, intractable epilepsy, and total developmental retardation. Chromosome gene detection showed repetitive variation in the 15q11-q13 regions, and the video electroencephalogram was abnormal. Although children are currently given antiepileptic treatment and rehabilitation training, intermittent seizures can still occur. The clinical phenotypes of 15q11-q13 repetitive syndrome are complex, and vary in severity. Children with intractable epilepsy, ASD, and language and motor retardation should be considered to have this syndrome, which requires confirmation by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and gene detection. These approaches can enable early rehabilitation treatment and improve the patients' quality of life."

Caregivers of 108 individuals with Prader-Willi, Angelman (AS), Chromosome 15q Duplication and fragile X (FXS) syndromes completed a modified Client Services Receipt Inventory and participants completed intellectual/developmental functioning and autism assessments. AS incurred the highest yearly costs per individual ($AUD96,994), while FXS had the lowest costs ($AUD33,221). Intellectual functioning negatively predicted total costs, after controlling for diagnosis. The effect of intellectual functioning on total costs for those with AS was significantly different to the other syndromes. The study highlights the significant costs associated with these syndromes, particularly AS, linked with severity of intellectual functioning."

    "abstract": "Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) often have comorbidities, especially obesity, that may constitute a risk factor for severe forms of COVID-19. We aimed to assess prevalence and medical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adults with PWS. From November 2020 to January 2021, we performed a detailed medical survey on 342 adults and 305 children with PWS followed in the French reference center. We obtained responses from 288 adults (84%) and 239 children (78%). From March 2020 to January 2021, 38 adults (13.2%) and 13 children (5.4%) with PWS had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mean age of adults was 34.1 ± 11.9 years and mean body mass index was 40.6 ± 12.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 82% had obesity and 37% had diabetes. Only 3 children (23%) had obesity and none had diabetes. Similar to the general population, the most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 were asthenia, fever, cough, headache and shortness of breath. All patients had a favorable outcome. PWS itself is not a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in children and adults. On the contrary, evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults with PWS seems more favorable than expected, given their comorbidities."

    "abstract": "As early as the 1920s, pathological studies of encephalitis lethargica allowed Von Economo to correctly identify hypothalamic damage as crucial for the profound associated sleep-related symptoms that helped define the condition. Only over the last 3 decades, however, has the key role of the hypothalamus in sleep-wake regulation become increasingly recognized. As a consequence, a close relation between abnormal sleep symptomatology and hypothalamic pathology is now widely accepted for a variety of medical disorders. Narcolepsy is discussed in some detail as the cardinal primary sleep disorder that is caused directly and specifically by hypothalamic pathology, most notably destruction of hypocretin (orexin)-containing neurons. Thereafter, various conditions are described that most likely result from hypothalamic damage, in part at least, producing a clinical picture resembling (symptomatic) narcolepsy. Kleine-Levin syndrome is a rare primary sleep disorder with intermittent symptoms, highly suggestive of hypothalamic involvement but probably reflecting a wider pathophysiology. ROHHAD (rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation) and Prader-Willi syndrome are also covered as hypothalamic syndromes with prominent sleep-related symptoms. Finally, sleep issues in several endocrine disorders are briefly discussed."

    "abstract": "MAGEL2 encodes the L2 member of the melanoma-associated antigen gene (MAGE) protein family, truncating mutations of which can cause Schaaf-Yang syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder. MAGEL2 is also inactivated in Prader-Willi syndrome, which overlaps clinically and mechanistically with Schaaf-Yang syndrome. Studies to date have only investigated the C-terminal portion of the MAGEL2 protein, containing the MAGE homology domain that interacts with RING-E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases to form protein complexes that modify protein ubiquitination. In contrast, the N-terminal portion of the MAGEL2 protein has never been studied. Here, we find that MAGEL2 has a low-complexity intrinsically disordered N-terminus rich in Pro-X<sub>n</sub>-Gly motifs that is predicted to mediate liquid-liquid phase separation to form biomolecular condensates. We used proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify MAGEL2-proximal proteins, then clustered these proteins into functional networks. We determined that coding mutations analogous to disruptive mutations in other MAGE proteins alter these networks in biologically relevant ways. Proteins identified as proximal to the N-terminal portion of MAGEL2 are primarily involved in mRNA metabolic processes and include three mRNA N 6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A)-binding YTHDF proteins and two RNA interference-mediating TNRC6 proteins. We found that YTHDF2 coimmunoprecipitates with MAGEL2, and coexpression of MAGEL2 reduces the nuclear accumulation of YTHDF2 after heat shock. We suggest that the N-terminal region of MAGEL2 may have a role in RNA metabolism and in particular the regulation of mRNAs modified by m<sup>6</sup>A methylation. These results provide mechanistic insight into pathogenic MAGEL2 mutations associated with Schaaf-Yang syndrome and related disorders."

    "abstract": "Genic copy number differences can have phenotypic consequences, but so far this has not been studied in detail in natural populations. Here, we analysed the natural variation of two families of tandemly repeated regulatory small nucleolar RNAs (SNORD115 and SNORD116) in the house mouse (Mus musculus). They are encoded within the Prader-Willi Syndrome gene region, known to be involved in behavioural, metabolic, and osteogenic functions in mammals. We determined that the copy numbers of these SNORD RNAs show substantial natural variation, both in wild-derived mice as well as in an inbred mouse strain (C57BL/6J). We show that copy number differences are subject to change across generations, making them highly variable and resulting in individual differences. In transcriptome data from brain samples, we found SNORD copy-number correlated regulation of possible target genes, including Htr2c, a predicted target gene of SNORD115, as well as Ankrd11, a predicted target gene of SNORD116. Ankrd11 is a chromatin regulator, which has previously been implicated in regulating the development of the skull. Based on morphometric shape analysis of the skulls of individual mice of the inbred strain, we show that shape measures correlate with SNORD116 copy numbers in the respective individuals. Our results suggest that the variable dosage of regulatory RNAs can lead to phenotypic variation between individuals that would typically have been ascribed to environmentally induced variation, while it is actually encoded in individual differences of copy numbers of regulatory molecules."

The conservation of the PWS genetic interval on chromosome 15q11-q13 in human, and a cluster of genes on mouse chromosome 7, has facilitated the use of mice as animal models for PWS. Some models faithfully mimic the loss of all gene expression from the paternally inherited PWS genetic interval, whereas others target smaller regions or individual genes. Collectively, these models have provided insight into the mechanisms, many of which lead to alterations in hypothalamic function, underlying the core symptoms of PWS, including growth retardation, hyperphagia and metabolism, reproductive maturation and endophenotypes of relevance to behavioral and psychiatric problems. Here we review and summarize these studies."

    "abstract": "Either physical damage or being born with a specific genetic abnormality can impact on the functioning of the hypothalamus, resulting in diverse physical manifestations and/or specific behavior disorders. The impact of physical damage due to craniopharyngioma (CP) and/or surgery to remove a craniopharyngioma is compared and contrasted with the impact resulting from the genetic abnormalities associated with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Similarities between PWS and CP posttreatment include hyperphagia and weight gain, low growth hormone levels, low bone density in adults, hypogonadism, disturbed temperature regulation, disturbed sleep and daytime sleepiness, memory difficulties, and problems with behavior and with peer relationships. These disturbances are an indication of the hypothalamus's central role in homeostasis. Most of the abnormalities appear to be more severe postoperatively in people with CP. Differences include higher ghrelin levels in PWS, complete absence of pituitary hormones in many cases of CP, higher incidence of thyroid dysfunction in CP, \"growth without growth hormone\" in obese children with CP, different types of diabetes (diabetes insipidus in CP and diabetes mellitus in PWS), and evidence of developmental delay and low IQ in people with PWS."

Despite increasing clarity on the underlying genetic defects, the molecular basis of the condition remains poorly understood. Hypothalamic dysfunction is widely recognized as the basis of the core symptoms of PWS, which include a deficiency in growth hormone and reproductive hormones, circadian rhythm abnormalities, and a lack of satiety, leading to an extreme obesity, among others. Genome-wide gene expression analysis (transcriptomics) offers an unbiased interrogation of complex disease pathogenesis and a potential window into the dysregulated pathways involved in disease. In this chapter, we review the findings from recent work investigating the PWS hypothalamic transcriptome, discuss the significance of the findings in relation to the clinical presentation and molecular underpinnings of PWS, and highlight future research directions."

Impaired hypothalamic development and function explain most of the phenotype that is characterized by a specific trajectory from anorexia at birth to excessive weight gain at later ages, which is accompanied by hyperphagia and early severe obesity, as well as by other hormonal deficiencies, behavioral deficits, and dysautonomia. In almost all patients, their endocrine dysfunction involves growth hormone deficiency and hypogonadism, which originate from a combination of both peripheral and hypothalamic origin, central hypothyroidism in 40%, precocious adrenarche in 30% of the cases, and in rare cases, also adrenocorticotropin deficiency and precocious puberty. In addition, the oxytocin (OXT) and ghrelin systems are impaired in most patients and involved in a poor suckling response at birth, and hyperphagia with food addiction, poor social skills, and emotional dysregulation. Current hormonal replacement treatments are the same as used in classical hormonal deficiencies, and recombinant human GH treatment is registered since 2000 and has dramatically changed the phenotype of these children. OXT and OXT analogue treatments are currently investigated as well as new molecules targeting the ghrelin system. The severe condition of PWS can be seen as a model to improve the fine description and treatments of hypothalamic dysfunction."

As hyperghrelinemia is found in patients with PWS and early-onset scoliosis (EOS) is highly prevalent in these patients, our aims were to explore (1) whether ghrelin levels differ between those with and without EOS and correlate with scoliosis severity, and (2) whether ghrelin levels in the first year of life are associated with the later development of EOS. We used a case control study design for the first question and a longitudinal design for the second. Patients with PWS having plasma ghrelin measurements recorded between 2013 and 2018 in our database were selected and 30 children < 10 years old with EOS and 30 age- and BMI-matched controls without EOS were included. The Cobb angle at diagnosis was recorded. In addition, 37 infants with a ghrelin measurement in the first year of life were followed until 4 years of age and assessed for EOS. Total ghrelin (TG), acylated (AG) and unacylated ghrelin (UAG), and the AG/UAG ratio were analyzed. EOS children had an AG/UAG ratio statistically significantly lower than controls. The Cobb angle was positively correlated with TG and UAG. TG and AG in the first year of life were higher in infants who later develop EOS without reaching a statistically significant difference. Our results suggest that ghrelin may play a role in the pathophysiology of EOS in PWS. Higher ghrelinemia in the first year of life required careful follow-up for EOS."

However, PWS children had higher inflammation levels than SO children throughout the trial, the gut microbiota of the two cohorts was similar. As some virulence factors (VFs) produced by the gut microbiota play a role in triggering host inflammation, this study compared the characteristics and changes of gut microbial VF genes of the two cohorts before and after the intervention using a fecal metagenomic dataset. We found that in both cohorts, the high-fiber diet reduced the abundance of VF, and particularly pathogen-specific, genes. The composition of VF genes was also modulated, especially for offensive and defensive VF genes. Furthermore, genes belonging to invasion, T3SS (type III secretion system), and adherence classes were suppressed. Co-occurrence network analysis detected VF gene clusters closely related to host inflammation in each cohort. Though these cohort-specific clusters varied in VF gene combinations and cascade reactions affecting inflammation, they mainly contained VFs belonging to iron uptake, T3SS, and invasion classes. The PWS group had a lower abundance of VF genes before the trial, which suggested that other factors could also be responsible for the increased inflammation in this cohort. This study provides insight into the modulation of VF gene structure in the gut microbiota by a high-fiber diet, with respect to reduced inflammation in obese children, and differences in VF genes between these two cohorts."

We report a case series of patients with PWS and AS evaluated through the MS-MLPA assay. We studied four patients with a clinical diagnosis of PWS and another with AS, evaluated as far as possible with karyotype and FISH, and with MS-MLPA assay for the 15q11-q13 region in all cases. In patients with PWS, neonatal hypotonia was the main reason for consultation and in three of them we identified a deletion of 15q11-q13 by MS-MLPA, also confirmed by FISH; and in the other one, an abnormal methylation pattern consistent with a maternal uniparental disomy. The patient with AS presented with a typical picture which led to the identification of a deletion in 15q11-q13 by MS-MLPA, also confirmed by FISH. The use of the MS-MLPA assay for the 15q11-q13 region was very useful for the diagnosis and identification of the genomic and epigenetic defects involved in either PWS and AS."

In accordance with this, the two different hypocretin receptors are also found throughout the brain. The hypocretin system is mainly involved in sleep-wake regulation, but also in reward mechanisms, food intake and metabolism, autonomic regulation including thermoregulation, and pain. The disorder most strongly linked to the hypocretin system is the primary sleep disorder narcolepsy type 1 caused by a lack of hypocretin signaling, which is most likely due to an autoimmune process targeting the hypocretin-producing neurons. However, the hypocretin system may also be affected, but to a lesser extent and less specifically, in various other neurological disorders. Examples are neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease, immune-mediated disorders such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and anti-Ma2 encephalitis, and genetic disorders such as type 1 diabetus mellitus and Prader-Willi Syndrome. A partial hypocretin deficiency may contribute to the sleep features of these disorders."

Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) is a marker of long-term systemic cortisol production. Cortisol awakening response (CAR) is the increase in cortisol level after awakening. A negative CAR might suggest hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis reactivity problems. Little is known about HCC and CAR in children with PWS. To investigate long-term cortisol levels in hair and CAR in children with PWS. Cross-sectional study. 41 children with PWS. Dutch PWS Reference Center. HCC and salivary cortisol measured by LCMS. Median (IQR) HCC was 1.90 (1.02-3.30) pg/mg at a median (IQR) age of 14.5 (8.20-19.0) years, with median HCC in age-matched references being 2.63 pg/mg. Five patients (13.2%) had HCC < 2.5th percentile for age and these patients had a repeatedly negative CAR. Median HCC was significantly lower in patients with negative CAR than in patients with normal CAR (1.00 (0.22-1.59) vs. 2.25 (1.47-3.26) pg/mg, p = 0.007). One patient had both HCC < 2.5th percentile and repeatedly low morning salivary cortisol levels and negative CAR, and was diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency by overnight metyrapone test. HCC were normal in the majority of children with PWS. Our data suggest that children with HCC < 2.5th percentile and (repeatedly) negative CAR might possibly have adrenal insufficiency or delayed HPA-axis responsiveness."

In adults, the syndrome is characterised by muscular hypotonia, a different body composition with more body fat than muscle mass, hyperphagia, behavioural problems, and cognitive dysfunction. Endocrine deficiencies are common, including growth hormone (GH) deficiency. Here, we present data from a cross-sectional study in adults with PWS with a focus on the long-term safety of GH treatment. A total of 22 patients (14 men) were treated with GH for a median of 20 years. Data on body composition, hormones, and metabolic parameters were retrieved from the patients' medical records. The median age was 27 years. The median GH dose was 0.5 mg/day. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) and blood lipids were normal, while fasting glucose and HbA1c were slightly elevated in three men with diabetes. Fat mass was less than fat free mass in all, though this was less pronounced in women. GH treatment did not negatively affect the metabolic profile, and none developed cardiovascular diseases or cancer. All adults on long-term GH treatment had a normal body composition and our results indicate that treatment was safe. However, PWS is a complex, multisystemic disease and continuous, individual considerations are required during GH treatment, especially in patients with risk factors for adverse effects."

Oxytocin (Oxt) together with Vasopressin (VP) regulate a diversity of physiological functions that are important for osmoregulation, reproduction, metabolism, and social behavior. Oxt/VP-like peptides have been identified in several invertebrate species and they are functionally related across the entire animal kingdom. Functional conservation enables future exploitation of invertebrate models to study Oxt's functions not related to pregnancy and the basic mechanisms of central Oxt/VP signaling. Specifically, Oxt is well known for its effects on uteri contractility and milk ejection as well as on metabolism and energy homeostasis. Moreover, the striking evidence that Oxt is linked to energy regulation is that Oxt- and Oxytocin receptor (Oxtr)-deficient mice show late onset obesity. Interestingly Oxt<sup>-/-</sup> or Oxtr<sup>-/-</sup> mice develop weight gain without increasing food intake, suggesting that a lack of Oxt reduce metabolic rate. Oxt is expressed in a diversity of skeletal muscle phenotypes and regulates thermogenesis and bone mass. Oxt may increases skeletal muscle tonicity and/or increases body temperature. In this review, the author compared the three most recent theories on the effects of Oxt on body composition."

However, the day-to-day implementation of PA programs is particularly challenging in these patients. This systematic review aimed (1) to describe habitual PA and sedentary behavior and (2) to assess the effects of PA interventions and to describe their implementation process, in children and adults with PWS. A systematic search of controlled trials, single-group interventions, observational, and qualitative studies published up to December 2020 was performed. Twenty-five studies were included. Habitual PA was found to be lower in patients with PWS compared to controls without obesity or with non-syndromic obesity. Habitual PA was positively associated with lean body mass and bone parameters in children with PWS, and these finding were strengthened by intervention studies reporting an increase in both outcomes after a PA program. PA programs also improved physical function (muscle strength, walking distance, and coordination), without significant effect on weight and fat mass. Attendance to exercise sessions was usually high and no serious adverse effect was reported. In conclusion, supervised PA programs are beneficial for children and adults with PWS. Support should be provided to families to facilitate their implementation in real-life settings."

PWS is most often caused by the loss of expression of a cluster of genes on chromosome 15q11.2-13. Patients with Prader-Willi-like syndrome (PWLS) display features of the PWS phenotype without a classical PWS genetic defect. We describe a 46-year-old patient with PWLS, including hypotonia, intellectual disability, hyperphagia, and pituitary hormone deficiencies. Routine genetic tests for PWS were normal, but a homozygous missense variant NM_003097.3(<i>SNRPN</i>):c.193C>T, p.(Arg65Trp) was identified. Single nucleotide polymorphism array showed several large regions of homozygosity, caused by high-grade consanguinity between the parents. Our functional analysis, the 'Pipeline for Rapid in silico, in vivo, in vitro Screening of Mutations' (PR<i>i</i>SM) screen, showed that overexpression of <i>SNRPN-p.Arg65Trp</i> had a dominant negative effect, strongly suggesting pathogenicity. However, it could not be confirmed that the variant was responsible for the phenotype of the patient. In conclusion, we present a unique homozygous missense variant in <i>SNURF-SNRPN</i> in a patient with PWLS.

Therapies that target hyperphagia are in development, but understanding the value of these therapies to inform patient-focused drug development (PFDD) requires valid data on disease burden. We estimated disease burden by measuring and comparing quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for 3 PWS health states relevant to current PFDD initiatives. Time trade-off (TTO) and a visual analog scale (VAS) were used to elicit PWS caregivers' values for 3 fixed health states for a standardized patient described with (1) untreated PWS, (2) PWS with controlled obesity, and (3) PWS with controlled obesity and hyperphagia. We excluded participants who left at least 1 TTO or VAS question blank or incomplete (noncompleters) and respondents who reported the same answer for all TTO scenarios (nontraders). The remaining group of respondents (traders) were used for all primary analyses. We assessed validity and bias of QALY estimates by comparing differences in health state valuations, treatment priorities, and characteristics among respondents who did and did not complete the TTO. A total of 458 respondents completed the survey, including 226 traders, 93 nontraders, and 139 noncompleters. Traders valued untreated PWS at 0.69 QALYs, PWS with controlled obesity at 0.79 QALYs, and controlled hyperphagia/obesity at 0.91 QALY (P < 0.01 for differences among health state values). Reported VAS ratings were similar for traders versus nontraders for untreated PWS (38.64 vs 38.95, P = 0.89) and PWS with controlled obesity (57.36 vs 55.14, P = 0.35) but varied for PWS with controlled obesity and hyperphagia (70.70 vs 64.46, P = 0.02). Exclusion of noncompleters did not introduce obvious bias because traders and noncompleters were similar in treatment priorities and characteristics. The exclusion of nontraders did not meaningfully alter mean or distribution of valuations. This study found that avoiding hyperphagia decreases the burden of PWS and that these results are robust, even once imposing strict inclusion criteria. Use of fixed health states to estimate QALYs addresses many of the complexities of measuring disease burden in rare and pediatric conditions, indicating the potential value of this approach to inform premarket decision makers in identifying outcome importance."

    "abstract": "Many genetic disorders associated with intellectual disability are characterized by unique behavioral phenotypes which may have serious psychological consequences such as increasing the risk for sexual abuse (SA). Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a severe neurogenetic syndrome with uncontrollable hyperphagia and high threshold for pain, is an excellent example of this issue. The absence of reports on SA in PWS highlights the lack of awareness to the topic. Our aim was to report on SA in individuals with PWS, describe its unique characteristics, and offer recommendations for its prevention. Caregivers of all individuals with genetically confirmed PWS living in the only two residential facilities designated for PWS in Israel were interviewed for a history of sexual behavior and abuse, and medical data were collected from their files. SA was reported in a quarter of the sample. In most of the cases (78%), food reward was used by the perpetrators to attract their victims. Age at SA ranged from 11 to 29 years. Most of the individuals did not disclose the event and some continued to initiate inappropriate sexual activity to obtain food. Characteristics unique to PWS, such as food-seeking behaviors and high threshold for pain, likely contribute to the risk for SA. These findings suggest that syndrome-specific programs for SA prevention should be considered for individuals with any genetic syndrome with behavioral problems that may increase SA risk."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder with executive deficits. Planning is one of the impaired executive functions implied in the regulation of behavior and everyday actions. We aimed to explore the feasibility and the effectiveness of a metacognitive strategy training designed to improve planning in adults with PWS using a double-blind between-group (training versus usual care) randomized controlled trial, with computerized tests and paper-pencil ecological outcome measures targeting planning, other executive functions, and achievement of personalized goal. Results showed better performances in several executive tasks and in achievement of personalized goals after both interventions, but better improvement for the experimental group (n = 27) compared to control (n = 26) only on the task assessing planning abilities. Interviews with occupational therapists demonstrated the feasibility of this training with this population. Despite a small number of sessions, the metacognitive strategy training showed encouraging results on planning abilities of patients."

    "abstract": "Previous reports indicate that growth hormone (GH) treatment for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) improves bone mineral density (BMD) only when initiated at a young age and not when initiated in adulthood. However, there are no data on BMD during long-term GH treatment of Japanese children and adolescents with PWS. Thus, this study aimed to investigate BMD changes among patients with PWS, who were undergoing GH treatment from childhood to adolescence. Sixty-seven pediatric patients with PWS who had GH treatment initiated during childhood between January 2003 and June 2020 were evaluated. To avoid underestimation, we used total body BMD, which was evaluated using dual-X-ray absorptiometry adjusted for the BMD z-score using patient height, sex, and age. In both sexes, age was negatively correlated with the BMD-standard deviation score (SDS) (male: <i>r</i>=-0.156 [p=0.042]; female: <i>r</i>=-0.197 [p=0.043]), which started to decrease in childhood. The BMD-SDS of patients with PWS decreases gradually despite GH treatment. As there are no clear recommendations about monitoring of bone health in patients with PWS, further studies are needed to improve the guidelines for screening of BMD and treatment of patients with PWS."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare and incurable congenital neurodevelopmental disorder, resulting from the absence of expression of a group of genes on the paternally acquired chromosome 15q11-q13. Phenotypical characteristics of PWS include infantile hypotonia, short stature, incomplete pubertal development, hyperphagia and morbid obesity. Hypothalamic dysfunction in controlling body weight and food intake is a hallmark of PWS. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that PWS subjects have abnormal neurocircuitry engaged in the hedonic and physiological control of feeding behavior. This is translated into diminished production of hypothalamic effector peptides which are responsible for the coordination of energy homeostasis and satiety. So far, studies with animal models for PWS and with human post-mortem hypothalamic specimens demonstrated changes particularly in the infundibular and the paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, both in orexigenic and anorexigenic neural populations. Moreover, many PWS patients have a severe endocrine dysfunction, e.g. central hypogonadism and/or growth hormone deficiency, which may contribute to the development of increased fat mass, especially if left untreated. Additionally, the role of non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes and microglia in the hypothalamic dysregulation in PWS is yet to be determined. Notably, microglial activation is persistently present in non-genetic obesity. To what extent microglia, and other glial cells, are affected in PWS is poorly understood. The elucidation of the hypothalamic dysfunction in PWS could prove to be a key feature of rational therapeutic management in this syndrome. This review aims to examine the evidence for hypothalamic dysfunction, both at the neuropeptidergic and circuitry levels, and its correlation with the pathophysiology of PWS."

    "title": "Behavioral features in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS): consensus paper from the International PWS Clinical Trial Consortium.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurodevelopmental genetic disorder associated with a characteristic behavioral phenotype that includes severe hyperphagia and a variety of other behavioral challenges such as temper outbursts and anxiety. These behaviors have a significant and dramatic impact on the daily functioning and quality of life for the person with PWS and their families. To date, effective therapies addressing these behavioral challenges have proven elusive, but several potential treatments are on the horizon. However, a limiting factor for treatment studies in PWS is the lack of consensus in the field regarding how to best define and measure the complex and interrelated behavioral features of this syndrome. The International PWS Clinical Trials Consortium (PWS-CTC, www.pwsctc.org ) includes expert PWS scientists, clinicians, and patient advocacy organization representatives focused on facilitating clinical trials in this rare disease. To address the above gap in the field, members of the PWS-CTC \"Behavior Outcomes Working Group\" sought to develop a unified understanding of the key behavioral features in PWS and build a consensus regarding their definition and description. The primary focus of this paper is to present consensus definitions and descriptions of key phenotypic PWS behaviors including hyperphagia, temper outbursts, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, rigidity, and social cognition deficits. Patient vignettes are provided to illustrate the interrelatedness and impact of these behaviors. We also review some available assessment tools as well as new instruments in development which may be useful in measuring these behavioral features in PWS."

    "abstract": "Dietary intervention is effective in human health promotion through modulation of gut microbiota. Diet can cause single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to occur in the gut microbiota, and some of these variations may lead to functional changes in human health. In this study, we performed a systematic SNP analysis based on metagenomic data collected from children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS, <i>n</i> = 17) and simple obese (SO) children (<i>n</i> = 19), who had better healthy conditions after receiving high-fiber diet intervention. We found that the intervention increased the SNP proportions of <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, and <i>Clostridium</i> and decreased those of <i>Bacteroides</i> in all children. Besides, the PWS children had <i>Collinsella</i> increased and <i>Ruminococcus</i> decreased, whereas the SO had <i>Blautia</i> and <i>Escherichia</i> decreased. There were much more BiasSNPs in PWS than in SO (4,465 vs 303), and only 81 of them appeared in both groups, of which 78 were from <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, and 51 were nonsynonymous mutations. These nonsynonymous variations were mainly related to pathways of environmental adaptation and nutrition metabolism, particularly to carbohydrate and nucleotide metabolism. In addition, dominant strains carrying BiasSNPs in all children shifted from <i>F. prausnitzii</i> AF32-8AC and <i>F. prausnitzii</i> 942/30-2 to <i>F. prausnitzii</i> SSTS Bg7063 and <i>F. prausnitzii</i> JG BgPS064 after the dietary intervention. Furthermore, although the abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> increased significantly by the intervention and became dominant strains responsible for nutrition metabolism, they had less BiasSNPs between the pre- and post-intervention group in comparison with <i>Faecalibacterium</i>. The finding of <i>F. prausnitzii</i> as important functional strains influenced by the intervention highlights the superiority of applying SNP analysis in studies of gut microbiota. This study provided evidence and support for the effect of dietary intervention on gut microbial SNPs, and gave some enlightenments for disease treatment."

    "abstract": "The Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS) is an autosomal dominant multi-system genetic disease caused by melanoma antigen L2 (MAGEL2) gene mutations imprinted by mothers and expressed by fathers on the 15q11-15q13 chromosomes in the critical region of Prader-Willi. MAGEL2 is a single exon gene and one of the protein-coding genes of the Prader-Willi domain. MAGEL2 is a matrilineal imprinted gene (i.e., the maternal chromosome is methylated). It is only expressed by unmethylated paternal alleles, and the individual is affected only when the variation occurs on the paternal allele. We reported a patient with MAGEL2 gene new site mutation who had mild intellectual disability, social fear, small hands and feet, obesity issues, dyskinesia, growth retardation, language lag and sexual development disorder. Whole-exome sequencing showed a heterozygous variation in the MAGEL2 gene, NM_019066.4:c.1687C > T (p.Q563X) and diagnosed as Schaaf-Yang syndrome. Patient was advised to reduce weight, control blood lipids, blood glucose through appropriate strengthening of exercise and diet control in the future. At the same time, the family members were advised to provide mental training to the patient to strengthen the contact and communication with the outside world and improve the autistic symptoms. Because of the patient's bilateral cryptorchidism, it is recommended that the patient should be treated with bilateral cryptorchidism reduction fixation. After a follow-up of the patient for 2 months, the patient is still walking unsteadily and requires an auxiliary reference material to walk normally. There is no significant change in height compared to before, and the weight has dropped by about 2 kg in the past 2 months. The symptoms of autism have improved slightly. The patient is willing to communicate with outsiders; his intelligence has not improved significantly, and his academic performance in school is still at the middle and lower levels. The pathogenesis of SYS is complex, involving multiple pathways such as Leptin-POMC, MAGEL2-USP7-TRIM27 complex and oxytocin. Our study has also found that certain fatal phenotypes such as respiratory distress have a high incidence at individual sites, and early detection and timely intervention may prolong the life span of patients. Therefore, for patients in whom SYS is highly suspected, gene detection should be carried out as soon as possible."

This study examined neural responses reflecting food cue salience in children with PWS and typical controls, age 3-12 years. Visual event-related potentials were recorded while participants in satiated state passively viewed photographs of high- and low-calorie foods, animals, and neutral objects. Contrary to the prediction, children with PWS did not demonstrate greater than typical neural responses to food, suggesting that it is not an exceptionally motivationally salient stimulus in PWS. Caregiver reports of greater hyperphagia were associated with neural responses to low-calorie foods suggesting accelerated and more fine-grained visual stimulus categorization in terms of edibility and caloric content. Overall, the findings align more closely with the altered satiety rather than increased food reward models of hyperphagia in PWS."

In the present study, we aim to evaluate the effects of Lact. reuteri supplementation on body mass index (BMI), social behaviors, and gut microbiota in individuals with PWS. We conducted a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 71 individuals with PWS aged 6 to 264 months (64.4 ± 51.0 months). Participants were randomly assigned to either receive daily Lact. reuteri LR-99 probiotic (6 × 10<sup>10</sup> colony forming units) or a placebo sachet. Groupwise differences were assessed for BMI, ASQ-3, and GARS-3 at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks into treatment. Gut microbiome data was analyzed with the QIIME2 software package, and predictive functional profiling was conducted with PICRUSt-2. We found a significant reduction in BMI for the probiotic group at both 6 weeks and 12 weeks relative to the baseline (P < 0.05). Furthermore, we observed a significant improvement in social communication and interaction, fine motor function, and total ASQ-3 score in the probiotics group compared to the placebo group (P < 0.05). Altered gut microbiota was observed in the probiotic group to favor weight loss and improve gut health. The findings suggest a novel therapeutic potential for Lact. reuteri LR-99 probiotic to modulate BMI, social behaviors, and gut microbiota in Prader-Willi syndrome patients, although further investigation is warranted.Trial registration Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR1900022646."

    "abstract": "Features of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) overlap with features of growth hormone (GH) deficiency, like small hands and feet, short stature, increased body fat, and low muscle mass and strength. In children with PWS, GH treatment (GHt) improves physical health and cognition. GHt has become the standard of care in PWS children, but in adults this is not yet the case. This work aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on GHt in PWS adults. Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched. Study selection included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized (un)controlled trials (NRCTs) that reported data for adults with PWS, who received GHt for at least 6 months. Data on body composition, body mass index (BMI), cardiovascular end points, bone, cognitive function, quality of life, and safety were extracted. Nine RCTs and 20 NRCTs were included. Body composition improved during 12 months of GHt with an increase in mean (95% CI) lean body mass of 1.95 kg (0.04 to 3.87 kg) and a reduction of mean (95% CI) fat mass of -2.23% (-4.10% to -0.36%). BMI, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, fasting glucose levels, and bone mineral density did not change during GHt. There were no major safety issues. GHt appears to be safe and improves body composition in adults with PWS. Because poor body composition is closely linked to the observed high incidence of cardiovascular morbidity in adults with PWS, improving body composition might reduce cardiovascular complications in this vulnerable patient group."

Clinical data including fetuses Age, birth weight, fetal movement, fetal position, amniotic fluid, mode of bith, crying, muscle tension, feeding, and cryptorchidism were collected to analyze the clinical characteristics of Chinese PWS patients in the perinatal period, and according to the mode of birty, birth weight and genotypes to perform subgroup analysis. The clinical manifestations of different subtypes were statistically analyzed by <i>t</i> test, χ<sup>2</sup> test or Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test. <b>Results:</b> Among the 226 PWS patients, 120 were males, and 106 were females. Among them, 100 (44.2%) patients were small for gestational age. Decreased fetal movement was the most common manifestation 202 cases (89.4%) during pregnancy, and other manifestations included polyhydramnios 71 cases (31.4%) and abnormal fetal position 58 cases (25.7%). One hundred and eighty-five (81.9%) patients were delivered by cesarean section and the frequency of abnormal fetal position was significantly higher (30.8%(57/185) <i>vs.</i> 2.4%(1/41),χ²=14.161,<i>P</i><0.01). As for abnormal manifestations after birth included hypotonia 221 cases (97.8%),220 cases (97.3%) showing weak crying, 116 cases among the total 120 males patients (96.7%) wanifested with cryptordnildism and 206 feeding difficulties (91.2%). In terms of genetic subtype, most of them (184/226, 81.4%) had a paternal deletion, while maternal age (35±5 <i>vs.</i> 29±5, <i>t</i>=-6.591, <i>P</i><0.01) and the frequency of polyhydramnios (47.6% (20/42) <i>vs.</i> 27.7% (51/185), χ²=6.286, <i>P</i>=0.012) were significantly higher in the non-deletion group. <b>Conclusions:</b> The main manifestations of PWS patients during the perinatal period are hypotonia, weak crying, feeding difficulties, decreased fetal movement, cryptorchidism and those patients are more likely to be born by cesarean section. In newborns with these characteristics, pediatricians should be aware of the possibility of PWS. In terms of the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes, polyhydramnios is more frequently observed in the non-deletion group."

Three molecular mechanisms have been known to cause PWS, including a deletion in the PWCR, uniparental disomy 15 and imprinting defects. We report the first case of PWS associated with a single-nucleotide <i>SNRPN</i> variant in a 10-year-old girl presenting with clinical features consistent with PWS, including infantile hypotonia and feeding difficulty, developmental delay with cognitive impairment, excessive eating with central obesity, sleep disturbances, skin picking and related behaviour issues. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a de novo mosaic nonsense variant of the <i>SNRPN</i> gene (c.73C>T, p.R25X) in 10% of DNA isolated from buccal cells and 19% of DNA from patient-derived lymphoblast cells. DNA methylation study did not detect an abnormal methylation pattern in the <i>SNRPN</i> locus. Parental origin studies showed a paternal source of an intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism within the locus in proximity to the <i>SNRPN</i> variant. This is the first report that provides evidence of a de novo point mutation of paternal origin in <i>SNRPN</i> as a new disease-causing mechanism for PWS. This finding suggests that gene sequencing should be considered as part of the diagnostic workup in patients with clinical suspicion of PWS."

To describe the frequency, the phenotype, and the genotype-phenotype relationship for heterozygous variants in LEP, LEPR, POMC, and PCSK1 in severe obesity. In this retrospective study, genotyping was performed on at least 1 of the LEP, LEPR, POMC, and PCSK1 genes in 1486 probands with severe obesity (600 children, 886 adults). The phenotype was collected in 60 subjects with heterozygous variants and 16 with homozygous variants. We analyzed variant frequency, body mass index (BMI), age of obesity onset, food impulsivity, and endocrine abnormalities. The frequency of subjects with homozygous variants was 1.7% (n = 26), and 6.7% (n = 100) with heterozygous variants. Adults with homozygous variants had a higher BMI (66 vs 53 kg/m2, P = .015), an earlier onset of obesity (0.4 vs 5.4 years, P < .001), more often food impulsivity (83% vs 42%, P = .04), and endocrine abnormalities (75% vs 26%, P < .01). The BMI was higher for subjects with high-impact heterozygous variants (61 vs 50 kg/m², P = .045) and those with a second heterozygous variant on the pathway (65 vs 49 kg/m², P < .01). In children, no significant differences were found for the age of obesity onset and BMI. Heterozygous variants in LEP, LEPR, POMC, and PCSK1 are frequent in severe obesity and sometimes associated with a phenotype close to that of homozygotes. These data suggest a systematic search for variants in severe early-onset obesity, to discuss therapy that targets this key pathway."

Thirty-six individuals with PWS (58.3% women) were included. Results showed that PWS patients had a good awareness of the illness and of the effects of medication, in contrast to a lack of awareness of illness' social consequences. Awareness of obesity/overweight was excellent, as was the awareness of excessive appetite. Awareness of excessive food intake was only mild. Insight correlated with age and functionality, but not with BMI.

The transition of care of young adults with PWS is a challenge due to the complexity of the disease and the vulnerability of the patients. Multidisciplinary transition clinics are optimal but difficult to implement in clinics with few transitions. The description of transition care meetings was limited to the pediatric and adult endocrinologists and nurses. The presentation of our checklist was developed to optimize the organization of the transition of young adults with PWS. Two to four patients with PWS are transferred to adult care every year in our hospital. Transition with the adapted program was more comfortable for patients and identification of the individual patient's comorbidities and special needs could clearly be addressed. In smaller settings, an adapted model including a proper introduction and presentation of the adult team and clinic, careful information about comorbidities and special needs, together with a checklist can optimize the transition of care to adult care."

The authors encourage the use of this approach in the clinical setting to confirm and establish the diagnosis and genetic defect which may account for the secondary genetic conditions that may be seen in those with isodisomy 15, impacting surveillance and counseling with more accurate recurrence risks. Other similarly affected individuals due to other gene disorders or cytogenetic anomalies such as Rett syndrome or microdeletions would also be identified with this streamlined approach."

Among them, the SNORD116 gene appears critical for the expression of the PWS phenotype. We aimed to clarify the role of SNORD116 in cellular and animal models with regard to growth hormone therapy (GHT), the main approved treatment for PWS. We collected serum and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from GH-treated PWS patients to differentiate into dopaminergic neurons, and in parallel used a Snord116 knockout mouse model. We analyzed the expression of factors potentially linked to GH responsiveness. We found elevated levels of circulating IGFBP7 in naive PWS patients, with IGFBP7 levels normalizing under GHT. We found elevated IGFBP7 levels in the brains of Snord116 knockout mice and in iPSC-derived neurons from a SNORD116-deleted PWS patient. High circulating levels of IGFBP7 in PWS patients may result from both increased IGFBP7 expression and decreased IGFBP7 cleavage, by downregulation of the proconvertase PC1. SNORD116 deletion affects IGFBP7 levels, while IGFBP7 decreases under GHT in PWS patients. Modulation of the IGFBP7 level, which interacts with IGF1, has implications in the pathophysiology and management of PWS under GHT."

The enhanced versus attenuated connectivity in distinct frontal regions may contribute to not only autistic features but also other behavioral characteristics, and it provides a clue for better understanding of the brain-behavior relationship in PWS."

    "title": "A retrospective analysis of growth hormone therapy in children with Schaaf-Yang syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Short stature is a common phenotype in children with Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS). Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and SYS share several phenotypic features including short stature, muscular hypotonia and developmental delay/intellectual disability. Evidence exists that similar to PWS, growth hormone (GH) deficiency may also be a feature of SYS. Recombinant human GH (rhGH) therapy has been approved for PWS, but the effects of rhGH therapy in individuals with SYS have not yet been documented. This retrospective, questionnaire-based study analyzes the prevalence of rhGH therapy in children with SYS, the effects of rhGH therapy on anthropometric measures, and parental perception of the treatment. Twenty-six individuals with SYS were sent a clinical questionnaire and a request for growth charts. We found a significant increase in height z-score (p* = 0.04) as well as a significant decrease in body mass index 6 months after rhGH therapy initiation (p* = 0.04). Furthermore, height z-scores of the treated group (mean z-score = -1.00) were significantly higher than those of the untreated group (mean z-score = -3.36, p = 0.01) at time of enrollment. All parents reported an increase in muscle strength and endurance, and several families noted beneficial effects such as improved cognition and motor development."

    "abstract": "The 15q11.1-13.1 duplication, also known as Dup15q syndrome, is a rare congenital disease affecting 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 60,000 children worldwide. This condition is characterized by the presence of at least one extra copy of genetical material within the Prader-Willi/Angelman Critical Region (PWACR) of the referred 15q11.2-q13.1 chromosome. <i>Case Report</i>. Our study presents the clinical and genetical features of the first patient with a <i>denovo</i> 15q11.2 interstitial duplication on the maternal allele (inv Dup15q) that mimics a milder Prader-Willi syndrome probably due to an atypical disruption of the <i>SNHG</i>14 gene. Methylation-specific MLPA analysis has confirmed the presence of a very unlikely duplication that lies between breakpoint 1 (BP1) and the middle of BP2 and BP3 (BP3). This atypical alteration might be linked to the milder patient's clinical phenotype. This is the first Dup15q patient reported in Ecuador and of the very few in South America. This aberration has never been described in a patient with Dup15q, and the unusual clinical presentation is probably due to the atypical distal breakpoint occurring within the gene <i>SNHG14</i> which lies between BP2 and BP3 and does not therefore contain the whole PWACR. If the duplication disrupted the gene, then it is possible that it is the cause of, or contributing to, the patient's clinical phenotype."

However, a majority of genomic variation studies have focused on single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), with limited genome-wide analysis of CNVs in large cohorts, especially in populations that are under-represented in genetic studies including people of African descent. We carried out a genome-wide copy number analysis in > 3400 healthy Bantu Africans from Tanzania. Signal intensity data from high density (> 2.5 million probes) genotyping arrays were used for CNV calling with three algorithms including PennCNV, DNAcopy and VanillaICE. Stringent quality metrics and filtering criteria were applied to obtain high confidence CNVs. We identified over 400,000 CNVs larger than 1 kilobase (kb), for an average of 120 CNVs (SE = 2.57) per individual. We detected 866 large CNVs (≥ 300 kb), some of which overlapped genomic regions previously associated with multiple congenital anomaly syndromes, including Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome (Type1) and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Furthermore, several of the common CNVs seen in our cohort (≥ 5%) overlap genes previously associated with developmental disorders. These findings may help refine the phenotypic outcomes and penetrance of variations affecting genes and genomic regions previously implicated in diseases. Our study provides one of the largest datasets of CNVs from individuals of African ancestry, enabling improved clinical evaluation and disease association of CNVs observed in research and clinical studies in African populations."

    "abstract": "We sought to obtain a better understanding of the burden of short stature using a systematic literature review. Studies of the burden of short stature, of any cause in adults and children, were searched using Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane databases in April 2020, capturing publications from 2008 onwards. Case series and populations with adult-onset growth hormone deficiency (GHD) were excluded. Of 1684 publications identified, 41 studies (33 in children, 8 in adults) were included. All studies assessed human burden. Most study populations in children included short stature due to GHD, idiopathic short stature (ISS) and short stature after being born small for gestational age (SGA). In these populations, four studies showed that quality of life (QoL) in children with short stature was significantly worse than in children with normal stature. A significant association between QoL and short stature was observed in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (3 studies), achondroplasia (1 study) and transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia (1 study), and in samples with mixed causes of short stature (3 studies). Three studies (one in GHD/ISS/SGA and two in CKD) found no significant association between short stature and QoL, and several studies did not report statistical significance. Approximately half of adult studies showed that QoL was reduced with short stature, and the other half showed no association. Two studies, one in adults with Prader-Willi syndrome and one in children with GHD, suggested a potential association between short stature and poorer cognitive outcomes. Three studies demonstrated an increased caregiver burden in parents of children with short stature. Evidence suggests that, compared with those with normal stature, children and adults with short stature of any cause may experience poorer QoL. Further research could extend our understanding of the human burden in this field."

    "abstract": "Human brain organoids represent remarkable platforms for recapitulating features of human brain development and diseases. Existing organoid models do not resolve fine brain subregions, such as different nuclei in the hypothalamus. We report the generation of arcuate organoids (ARCOs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to model the development of the human hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. Single-cell RNA sequencing of ARCOs revealed significant molecular heterogeneity underlying different arcuate cell types, and machine learning-aided analysis based on the neonatal human hypothalamus single-nucleus transcriptome further showed a human arcuate nucleus molecular signature. We also explored ARCOs generated from Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) patient iPSCs. These organoids exhibit aberrant differentiation and transcriptomic dysregulation similar to postnatal hypothalamus of PWS patients, indicative of cellular differentiation deficits and exacerbated inflammatory responses. Thus, patient iPSC-derived ARCOs represent a promising experimental model for investigating nucleus-specific features and disease-relevant mechanisms during early human arcuate development."

Body weight was measured at home and self-reported. Patients (52.9% women, 44.8% disomic) were assessed, with a mean age of 28.05 ± 8.73 years and body mass index (BMI) of 36.76 ± 10.74 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Seventy percent lived in the Paris region (France) and were confined with their parents. The mean weight change was 0.96 ± 3.28 kg.

A retrospective review of the Kid's Inpatient Database was performed from 2000 to 2012 to identify all pediatric patients with scoliosis undergoing spinal fusion. Cohorts were created on the basis of PWS diagnosis and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Statistical analysis was performed for differences in post-operative outcomes between these two patient cohorts. Between 2000 and 2012, the number of spinal fusions performed increased by 24.6 and 32.2% in the PWS and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis populations, respectively. There was no difference between the incidence of major complications in PWS patients when compared to AIS (1.7% vs. 1.0% in idiopathic scoliosis; p = 0.362). Although there was no significant difference in the rate of overall minor complications, PWS patients were demonstrated to be more likely to experience post-operative pneumonia (p < 0.0001) and implant complications (p < 0.001). Patients with scoliosis associated with PWS do not have any increased risk of major complications following spinal deformity correction when compared to patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Two important minor complications to keep in mind when surgically treating scoliosis in PWS patients include pulmonary and implant-related complications. Retrospective comparative study, Level III."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare, genetic, multisymptom, neurodevelopmental disease due to lack of the expression of the paternal genes in the q11 to q13 region of chromosome 15. The main characteristics of PWS are muscular hypotonia, hyperphagia, obesity, behavioral problems, cognitive disabilities, and endocrine deficiencies, including growth hormone (GH) deficiency. Sleep apnea and abnormal sleep patterns are common in PWS. GH treatment might theoretically have a negative impact on respiration. Here we present the effect of GH treatment on polysomnographic measurements. Thirty-seven adults, 15 men and 22 women, with confirmed PWS were randomly assigned to 1 year of GH treatment (n = 19) or placebo (n = 18) followed by 2 years of GH treatment to all. Polysomnographic measurements were performed every 6 months. A mixed-effect regression model was used for comparison over time in the subgroup that received GH for 3 years. At baseline median age was 29.5 years, body mass index 27.1, insulin-like growth factor 115 µg/L, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 1.4 (range, 0.0-13.9), and sleep efficiency (SE) 89.0% (range, 41.0%-99.0%). No differences in sleep or respiratory parameters were seen between GH- and placebo-treated patients. SE continuously improved throughout the study, also after adjustment for BMI, and the length of the longest apnea increased. AHI inconsistently increased within normal range. SE improved during GH treatment and no clinical, significantly negative impact on respiration was seen. The etiology of breathing disorders is multifactorial and awareness of them should always be present in adults with PWS with or without GH treatment."

Epigenetic causes of sex-dependent differences in the brain are analyzed in conjunction with the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders. Special attention is devoted to the epigenetic regulation of the melanoma-associated antigen-like gene 2 (<i>MAGEL2)</i> found in Prader-Willi syndrome, which is known to be accompanied by autistic symptoms."

Among perinatal characteristics, there was only a tendency towards lower birth weight SDS in group UPD 15 (<i>p</i> = 0.06). We also compared data at rhGH start in relation to genetic diagnosis age-group 1: age ≤9 months, group 2: >9 months ≤ 2 years, group 3: > 2 years. Group 1 had the earliest rhGH start (<i>p</i> = 0.00), with lower body mass index (BMI) SDS (<i>p</i> = 0.00) and a tendency towards a higher IGF1 level compared to group 3 (<i>p</i> = 0.05). Genetic background in children with PWS is related to time of diagnosis and rhGH start, with a difference in IGF1 level before the therapy, but it seems to have little impact on perinatal data. Early genetic diagnosis leads to early rhGH treatment with favourable lower BMI SDS."

    "abstract": "The 15q duplication syndrome (dup15q) is due to the presence of at least one additional derived copy of the Prader-Willi syndrome/Angelman syndrome (PWS/AS) critical region that is approximately 5 Mb long within chromosome 15q11.2-q13.1. This report describes distinct roles of the origin of interstitial (int) dup15q underlining the critical importance of maternally active imprinted genes in the contribution to complete penetrance but different phenotypes of neuropsychotic disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in a Korean family. The proband's mother as a consultant visited our hospital for her offspring's genetic counseling and segregation analysis. She had two daughters diagnosed as SCZ or ASD and one son diagnosed as ASD. To resolve the potential genetic cause of SCZ and ASD in the proband and her sibling, whole genomic screening of chromosomal rearrangements by array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was performed using SurePrint G3 Human CGH + SNP Microarray 4 × 180 K. Results of the array-CGH analysis revealed an interstitial duplication at 15q11.2-q13.1 (duplication size of 5.4 Mb) in the mother and her three offspring with SCZ or ASD. Our case, together with previous findings of high occurrence of psychotic disorder, suggest that maternally expressed gene product in the critical region of PWS/AS might mediate the risk of neurodevelopmental disorder (ASD) as well as psychotic disorder (SCZ). Multiple cytogenetic and molecular methods are recommended for investigating children with 15q11.2-q13.1 duplication and neuropsychotic disorders."

    "abstract": "Intrauterine and postnatal growth disturbances are major clinical features of imprinting disorders, a molecularly defined group of congenital syndromes caused by molecular alterations affecting parentally imprinted genes. These genes are expressed monoallelically and in a parent-of-origin manner, and they have an impact on human growth and development. In fact, several genes with an exclusive expression from the paternal allele have been shown to promote foetal growth, whereas maternally expressed genes suppress it. The evolution of this correlation might be explained by the different interests of the maternal and paternal genomes, aiming for the conservation of maternal resources for multiple offspring versus extracting maximal maternal resources. Since not all imprinted genes in higher mammals show the same imprinting pattern in different species, the findings from animal models are not always transferable to human. Therefore, human imprinting disorders might serve as models to understand the complex regulation and interaction of imprinted loci. This knowledge is a prerequisite for the development of precise diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for patients affected by imprinting disorders. In this review we will specifically overview the current knowledge on imprinting disorders associated with growth retardation, and its increasing relevance in a personalised medicine direction and the need for a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach."

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is a common method of gene expression regulation, and this form of regulation occurs in the neurodevelopmental disorder Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Gene expression regulation via methylation is important for humans, although there is little understanding of the role of methylation in neuronal differentiation. We characterized the cellular differentiation potential of iPS cells derived from a patient with PWS with abnormal methylation (M-iPWS cells). A comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array revealed that, unlike iPWS cells (deletion genes type), the abnormally methylated M-iPWS cells had no deletion in the15q11.2-q13 chromosome region. In addition, methylation-specific PCR showed that M-iPWS cells had strong methylation in CpG island of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN) on both alleles. To assess the effect of abnormal methylation on cell differentiation, the M-iPWS and iPWS cells were induced to differentiate into embryoid bodies (EBs). The results suggest that iPWS and M-iPWS cells are defective at differentiation into ectoderm. Neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurons derived from M-iPWS cells had fewer NSCs and mature neurons with low expression of NSCs and neuronal markers. We conclude that expression of the downstream of genes in the PWS region regulated by methylation is involved in neuronal differentiation."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder caused by the lack of expression of genes on the paternally inherited chromosome 15q11.2-q13 region. The three main genetic subtypes are represented by paternal 15q11-q13 deletion, maternal uniparental disomy 15, and imprinting defect. Clinical picture of PWS changes across life stages. The main clinical characteristics are represented by short stature, developmental delay, cognitive disability and behavioral diseases. Hypotonia and poor suck resulting in failure to thrive are typical of infancy. As the subjects with PWS age, clinical manifestations such as hyperphagia, temperature instability, high pain threshold, hypersomnia and multiple endocrine abnormalities including growth hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiencies, hypogonadism and central adrenal insufficiency due to hypothalamic dysfunction occur. Obesity and its complications are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in PWS. Several mechanisms for the aetiology of obesity in PWS have been hypothesized, which include aberration in hypothalamic pathways of satiety control resulting in hyperphagia, disruption in hormones regulating appetite and satiety and reduced energy expenditure. However, despite the advancement in the research field of the genetic basis of obesity in PWS, there are contradictory data on the management. Although it is mandatory to adopt obesity strategy prevention from infancy, there is promising evidence regarding the management of obesity in adulthood with current obesity drugs along with lifestyle interventions, although the data are limited. Therefore, the current manuscript provides a review of the current evidence on obesity and PWS, covering physiopathological aspects, obesity-related complications and conservative management."

    "abstract": "Scoliosis is frequently seen in children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). There is still concern that growth hormone (GH) treatment might increase the risk of onset or progression of scoliosis. Short-term data suggested no adverse effects of GH on scoliosis, but long-term effects of GH treatment on development of scoliosis in PWS are unknown. This study investigated the effects of 8 years of GH treatment on scoliosis in children with PWS. Open-label, prospective cohort study in 103 children with PWS receiving GH for 8 years was analyzed. Prevalence and severity of scoliosis were compared to a group of 23 age-matched GH-untreated children with PWS. Spine X-rays and DEXA-scans were performed, and Cobb angel was measured by two independent observers. After 8 years of GH treatment, at median age of 10.8 years, prevalence of scoliosis was 77.7%. No difference in prevalence or severity of scoliosis was found between GH-treated and age-matched untreated children with PWS (P = 0.409 and P = 0.709, respectively). Height SDS and trunkLBM were significantly higher in GH-treated children. Higher bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was found in children without scoliosis after 8 years of GH. Bone mineral apparent density of lumbar spine (BMADLS) SDS was associated with lower Cobb angle (r = -0.270, P = 0.008). Eight years of GH treatment has no adverse effects on the prevalence and severity of scoliosis in children with PWS until 11 years of age. As BMADLS SDS is inversely associated with Cobb angle, it is pivotal to optimize the BMD status in children with PWS."

However, the risk of becoming obese differs highly between people. Individual's differences in lifestyle, genetic, and neuroendocrine factors play a role in satiety, hunger and regulation of body weight. In a small percentage of children and adults with obesity, an underlying hormonal or genetic cause can be found. The aim of this review is to present and compare data on the extreme ends of the obesity and undernutrition spectrum in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), acquired hypothalamic obesity in craniopharyngioma patients, and anorexia nervosa.

    "abstract": "Eating habits leading to obesity may reflect nonhomeostatic behavior based on excessive immediate-reward seeking. However, it is currently unknown to what extent excess weight is associated with functional alterations in the brain's reward system in children. We tested the integrity of reward circuits using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging in a population of 230 children aged 8-12 years. The major components of the reward system were identified within the ventral striatum network defined on the basis of the nucleus accumbens connectivity pattern. The functional structure of the cerebral cortex was characterized using a combination of local functional connectivity measures. Higher body mass index was associated with weaker connectivity between the cortical and subcortical elements of the reward system, and enhanced the integration of the sensorimotor cortex to superior parietal areas relevant to body image formation. Obese children, unlike WHO-defined overweight condition, showed functional structure alterations in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala region similar to those previously observed in primary obsessive-compulsive disorder and Prader-Willi syndrome associated with obsessive eating behavior. Results further support the view that childhood obesity is not simply a deviant habit with restricted physical health consequences but is associated with reward system dysfunction characterizing behavioral control disorders."

    "abstract": "The smallest genomic region causing Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) deletes the non-coding RNA SNORD116 cluster; however, the function of SNORD116 remains a mystery. Previous work in the field revealed the tantalizing possibility that expression of NHLH2, a gene previously implicated in both obesity and hypogonadism, was downregulated in PWS patients and differentiated stem cells. In silico RNA: RNA modeling identified several potential interaction domains between SNORD116 and NHLH2 mRNA. One of these interaction domains was highly conserved in most vertebrate NHLH2 mRNAs examined. A construct containing the Nhlh2 mRNA, including its 3'-UTR, linked to a c-myc tag was transfected into a hypothalamic neuron cell line in the presence and absence of exogenously-expressed Snord116. Nhlh2 mRNA expression was upregulated in the presence of Snord116 dependent on the length and type of 3'UTR used on the construct. Furthermore, use of actinomycin D to stop new transcription in N29/2 cells demonstrated that the upregulation occurred through increased stability of the Nhlh2 mRNA in the 45 minutes immediately following transcription. In silico modeling also revealed that a single nucleotide variant (SNV) in the NHLH2 mRNA could reduce the predicted interaction strength of the NHLH2:SNORD116 diad. Indeed, use of an Nhlh2 mRNA construct containing this SNV significantly reduces the ability of Snord116 to increase Nhlh2 mRNA levels. For the first time, these data identify a motif and mechanism for SNORD116-mediated regulation of NHLH2, clarifying the mechanism by which deletion of the SNORD116 snoRNAs locus leads to PWS phenotypes."

The present study aimed to examine the growth and dietary intake of children with PWS. All children with genetically confirmed PWS attending Children's Health Ireland (CHI) at Tallaght (n = 44) were invited to participate. Anthropometry was performed and body composition measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Three-day food diaries were used to evaluate dietary intake and the presence of early feeding issues was assessed. Serum haemoglobin, ferritin and vitamin D levels were measured. Nineteen children participated, with a mean (range) age of 7.6 (0.6-18.1) years. Most were female (n = 14, 74%). Twenty-percent (n = 3) were underweight, 60% (n = 9) were healthy weight, n = 1 was overweight and n = 2 were obese. Mean (range) percentage body fat was 25.7% (10%-40%). Eigthy-three percent reported early feeding issues. Ninety-four percent (n = 16) achieved ≤ 100% of estimated average requirement (EAR) for energy. Mean daily energy intake for ≤ 5 years old was 722 kcal (9 kcal cm<sup>-1</sup> /72-112% EAR); for those ≥ 12 years, it was 1203 kcal (8.3 kcal cm<sup>-1</sup> /41%-82% EAR). Suboptimal calcium, vitamin D, iron, zinc and fibre intake was evident. Iron deficiency anaemia and vitamin D insufficiency occurred in two children. The present study provides the first Irish data for PWS and shows that energy intake does not appear to be excessive, with four in five patients being underweight or of a normal BMI.

    "abstract": "To evaluate the clinical value of BACs-on-Beads (BoBs) assay in detection of microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. A total of 6,814 cases of amniotic fluid cells collected from January 2015 to July 2020 in our hospital were analyzed by chromosomal karyotyping and BoBs assay. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) provided further validation for the cases of microdeletion and microduplication. Thirty microdeletion and microduplication syndromes were identified by BoBs with an incidence of ~1/227, including 22q11.2 microduplication (0.044%, 3/6814), DiGeorge I syndrome (0.044%, 3/6814), 17p11.2 microduplication (0.015%, 1/6814), Smith-Magenis syndrome (0.015%, 1/6814), 17p11.2p11.3 microduplication (0.015%, 1/6814), Williams-Beuren syndrome (0.088%, 6/6814), 7q11.2 microduplication (0.029%, 2/6814), DiGeorge II syndrome (0.015%, 1/6814), 18p11.32p11.21 microduplication (0.015%, 1/6814), Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (0.029%, 2/6814), 4p16.3 microduplication (0.015%, 1/6814), Langer-Giedion syndrome (0.015%, 1/6814), Miller-Dieker syndrome (0.015%, 1/6814), Cri du Chat syndrome (0.015%, 1/6814), Xp22.31 microdeletion (0.059%, 4/6814), Prader-Willi syndrome (0.015%, 1/6814). High concordance was obtained between BoBs and FISH or CMA. However, only four cases were detected by chromosomal karyotyping. BoBs assay can rapidly detect microdeletion and microduplication syndromes, which compensates the shortcomings of conventional chromosomal karyotyping and greatly improves the efficiency and accuracy of prenatal diagnosis."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of measuring a postprandial increase in energy expenditure (ΔEE) using a state-of-the-art whole-body calorimetry unit (WBCU) in children and youth with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Five participants (aged 10-25 y) received both a standard and a high-protein diet in a random order (crossover design). Resting energy expenditure, postprandial ΔEE 6 h after intake of a standard [15% of total energy (TE)] and a high-protein (30% TE) meal, and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were measured in a WBCU. No differences were observed in ΔEE comparing the 2 meals. Mean RER was lower following the high-protein meal (0.80 ± 0.01) compared with the standard meal (0.87 ± 0.02) (<i>P </i>= 0.009). Despite the high participant burden, it was feasible to conduct this metabolic test in children and youth with PWS. This study paves the way for further studies targeting EE in this patient population."

    "abstract": "To report the first noninvasive urodynamic screening of lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) in children, adolescents, and young adults with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). We recruited 37 PWS patients with/without lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) from our hospital. Uroflowmetry was performed in 36 patients. In addition, 20 patients underwent postvoid residual urine (PVR) measurement by transabdominal ultrasound. LUTD is defined as abnormal uroflow patterns, low peak flow rate (Q<sub>max</sub> ), or elevated PVR by age. Videourodynamic study (VUDS) was performed in selected cases. Mean and median age of the patients were 17.7 ± 7.8 years and 16 years. Male to female ratio was 15/22. Two patients were excluded from the following analysis because of voided volume less than or equal to 50 ml. Of the remaining 34 uroflowmetry examination, normal voiding pattern (bell shape) was observed in 22 (64.7%) patients. Abnormal uroflowmetry pattern were obstructive in 6 (17.6%), staccato in 3 (8.8%), intermittent in 2 (5.8%), tower in 1 (2.9%), and plateau in 0 patients. Ten (29.4%) patients had a Q<sub>max</sub> less than 15 ml/s. Of 20 patients undergoing PVR tests 10 (50%) had elevated PVR by age ( > 6% of estimated bladder volume). In all, 17/34 (50.0%) PWS patients had at least one abnormality of the noninvasive tests. Of the three cases undergoing VUDS all showed detrusor sphincter dyssynergia. Half of PWS patients with/without LUTS had LUTD. Noninvasive study such as uroflowmetry and postvoid residual urine by ultrasound is recommended to all patients with PWS."

    "title": "A Comprehensive Review of Genetically Engineered Mouse Models for Prader-Willi Syndrome Research.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurogenetic multifactorial disorder caused by the deletion or inactivation of paternally imprinted genes on human chromosome 15q11-q13. The affected homologous locus is on mouse chromosome 7C. The positional conservation and organization of genes including the imprinting pattern between mice and men implies similar physiological functions of this locus. Therefore, considerable efforts to recreate the pathogenesis of PWS have been accomplished in mouse models. We provide a summary of different mouse models that were generated for the analysis of PWS and discuss their impact on our current understanding of corresponding genes, their putative functions and the pathogenesis of PWS. Murine models of PWS unveiled the contribution of each affected gene to this multi-facetted disease, and also enabled the establishment of the minimal critical genomic region (<i>PWScr</i>) responsible for core symptoms, highlighting the importance of non-protein coding genes in the PWS locus. Although the underlying disease-causing mechanisms of PWS remain widely unresolved and existing mouse models do not fully capture the entire spectrum of the human PWS disorder, continuous improvements of genetically engineered mouse models have proven to be very powerful and valuable tools in PWS research."

Hypothalamic dysfunction causes dysregulation of energy balance and endocrine deficiencies, including hypogonadism. Although hypogonadism is prevalent in males and females with PWS, knowledge about this condition is limited. In this review, we outline the current knowledge on the clinical, biochemical, genetic and histological features of hypogonadism in PWS and its treatment. This was based on current literature and the proceedings and outcomes of the International PWS annual conference held in November 2019. We also present our expert opinion regarding the diagnosis, treatment, care and counselling of children and adults with PWS-associated hypogonadism. Finally, we highlight additional areas of interest related to this topic and make recommendations for future studies."

Two 1-year studies did not show a difference between GH or placebo on BMD in young adults with PWS. However, there are no studies investigating BMD during longer-term GH treatment in young adults with PWS. Open-label, a prospective study in 43 young adults with PWS. BMD of the total body (BMDTBSDS) and lumbar spine (BMADLSSDS) measured by DXA. In the total group, estimated mean (95% CI) of BMDTB remained similar during 3 years of GH, being -0.76 (-1.11 to -0.41) SDS at start and -0.90 (-1.27 to -0.54) SDS after 3 years (P = 0.11), as did BMADLS, being -0.36 (-0.72 to 0.01) SDS and -0.46 (-0.77 to -0.16) SDS, respectively (P = 0.16). In men, there was a significant decrease in BMDTBSDS during 3 years of GH, while BMADLSSDS remained similar. In women, both BMDTBSDS and BMADLSSDS remained similar. BMDTBSDS was associated with female sex, lean body mass and age. The majority of patients received sex steroid replacement therapy (SSRT). During 3 years of combined GH and SSRT treatment, BMD remained stable in the normal range in young adults with PWS. However, men showed a decline in BMDTBSDS, probably due to insufficient SSRT. We recommended to continue GH treatment in young adults with PWS and to start SSRT during adolescence unless puberty progresses normally."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by maladaptive behaviors, amongst which hyperphagia is a life-long concern for individuals with PWS and their caregivers. The current study examined the contribution of hyperphagia and other factors to caregiver burden across lifespan, in 204 caregivers of individuals with PWS living in the US, using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and the hyperphagia questionnaire (HQ-CT). We found a strong relationship between ZBI and HQ-CT especially in individuals with PWS older than 4 y and showed that HQ-CT scores of individuals with PWS is positively correlated with ZBI scores of their caregivers. The weight status of individuals with PWS was not associated with HQ-CT and ZBI scores, except for obese individuals who had significantly higher HQ-CT scores when compared to normal weight PWS individuals. We looked at PWS symptoms and care-related issues that impacted individuals and caregivers the most. We found that care-related tasks had the biggest negative impact on caregivers of children aged 0-4 y, whereas anxiety, temper tantrums, and oppositional behaviors of older individuals with PWS had the biggest impact on their caregivers concomitant with their high caregiver burden. Finally, we assessed the variability of HQ-CT and ZBI over 6 months in a subgroup of 83 participants. Overall, neither measure differed between 6 months and baseline. Most individual's absolute HQ-CT score changes were between 0-2 units, whereas absolute ZBI score changes were between 0-6 points. Changes in the caregiver's or individual's life had little or no effect on HQ-CT and ZBI scores. This study demonstrates a relationship between hyperphagia and caregiver burden and sheds light on predominant symptoms in children and adolescents that likely underly PWS caregiver burden. The stability and relationship between HQ-CT and ZBI support ZBI as an additional outcome measure in PWS clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder that in many cases is associated with mental health disorders, in addition to characteristic symptoms such as hyperphagia. The current Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has led to massive restrictions in health care and social life worldwide. People with PWS represent a particularly vulnerable population group to these restrictions, with unknown impact on their mental health. We conducted an online questionnaire to assess the impact of the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of people with PWS. One hundred and eight caregivers completed the survey about individuals with PWS. Individuals with PWS > 6 years (n = 89) were included for evaluation with regard to psychopathological change. Respondents frequently reported an increase in psychopathological symptoms associated with PWS during the lockdown, with 51.7% reporting increased temper outbursts, 43.8% showing signs of sadness, 38.2% being anxious, 55.0% more irritable, and 39.3% showing more food seeking behaviour. Adjusted for the type of accommodation food seeking behaviour and irritability is increased to a significantly lesser extent in people with PWS accommodated in specialised care facilities compared with those living in their family home. No significant difference could be found between the sexes. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the mental health of individuals with PWS, evidenced by an increase in behaviours associated with PWS, including temper outbursts, food-seeking, and irritability, which again underlines their need for specialised care. Individuals living with their families were particularly vulnerable, indicating that they and their families are in special need of support."

    "abstract": "Temple syndrome (TS14) can be originated by maternal uniparental disomy (UPD(14)mat), paternal deletion, or epimutation, leading to disturbances in 14q32.2 imprinted region. The most frequent phenotypic manifestations are prenatal and postnatal growth failure, hypotonia, developmental delay, small hands/feet, precocious puberty, and truncal obesity. However, the diagnosis can be challenging due to the clinical overlap with other imprinting disorders such as Silver-Russell or Prader-Willi syndromes. Although rare, TS14 has been also reported in patients with concomitant UPD(14)mat and mosaic trisomy 14. In the present report, the clinical and genetic profiles of two new patients with TS14 are described. SNParray and MS-MLPA, allowed the determination of segmental UPD(14)mat and the hypomethylation of MEG3 gene. Additionally, in one of our patients we also observed by cytogenetics a small supernumerary marker chromosome that led to partial trisomy 14 in mosaic. Only few patients with concomitant UPD(14)mat and mosaic partial trisomy 14 have been reported. Our patients share cardinal TS14 phenotypic features that are associated to the genetic abnormalities detected; however, we also observed some clinical features such as fatty liver disease that had not previously been reported as part of this syndrome. The detailed clinical, cytogenetical and molecular description of these two new patients, contributes to a more accurately delineation of this syndrome."

Molecular analysis is essential for making a correct diagnosis. This study involved a retrospective analysis of 4512 prenatal diagnosis samples and explored the molecular characteristics and prenatal phenotypes of UPD using a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Out of the 4512 samples, a total of seven cases of UPD were detected with an overall frequency of 0.16%. Among the seven cases of UPD, two cases are associated with chromosomal aberrations (2/7), four cases (4/7) had abnormal ultrasonographic findings. One case presented with iso-UPD (14), and two case presented with mixed hetero/iso-UPD (15), which were confirmed by Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) as maternal UPD (15) associated with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Four cases had iso-UPD for chromosome 1, 3, 14, and 16, respectively; this is consistent with the monosomy rescue mechanism. Another three cases presented with mixed hetero/isodisomy were consistent with a trisomy rescue mechanism. The prenatal phenotypes of UPD are variable and molecular analysis is essential for making a correct diagnosis and genetic counselling of UPD. The SNP array is a useful genetic test in prenatal diagnosis cases with UPD."

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been increasingly shown to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes in children and adults, including food-intake behaviors in patients with PWS. This study further reports the positive effects of brief tDCS sessions on Go/NoGo task performance involving food and non-food stimuli images, alterations in N2 brain amplitude, and genetic subgroup differences (maternal disomy 15, UPD; 15q11-q13 deletion, DEL) before and after tDCS as assessed by event-related potentials (ERPs) in 10 adults with PWS. The results indicate a group effect on baseline NoGo N2 amplitude in PWS patients with DEL vs UPD (<i>p</i> =0.046) and a decrease in NoGo N2 amplitude following tDCS (<i>p</i> = 0.031). Our tDCS approach also demonstrated a trend towards decreased response time. Collectively, these results replicate and expand prior work highlighting neurophysiological differences in patients with PWS according to genetic subtype and demonstrate the feasibility in examining neuromodulatory effects of tDCS on information processing in this patient population to stimulate additional research and treatment."

    "abstract": "Angelman syndrome (AS) is caused by loss of information from the 15q11.2-13 region on the maternal chromosome with striking phenotypic difference from Prader-Willi syndrome in which information is lost from the same region on the paternal chromosome. Motivation for social contact and sensory seeking behaviors are often noted as characteristics of the phenotype of AS and it has been argued that the strong drive for social contact supports a kinship theory interpretation of genomic imprinting. In this study we developed an experimental paradigm for quantifying the motivation for social contact in AS and examined differences across the genetic subtypes that cause AS [deletion, imprinting centre defect (ICD), uniparental disomy and UBE3A mutation]. Using single case experimental designs we examined the rate of acquisition of behavioral responses using operant learning paradigms for 21 children with AS whilst systematically varying the nature of social and sensory reinforcement. Variability in rates of acquisition was influenced by the nature of rewarding stimuli. Across the total sample both sensory stimuli and social contact could increase the rate of rewarded behavior with difference between children in the most effective reward. A striking difference in the rewarding properties of social contact across genetic subtypes was evidenced by non-deletion genetic causes of AS showing significantly higher rates of responding than the deletion cause in the social reinforcement paradigm. The results indicate that reinforcer assessment can beneficially inform behavioral interventions and that within syndrome variability in the behavioral phenotype of AS is likely driven by genetic difference. The non-deletion cause of AS, and particularly the ICD group, may be the optimal group for further study of genomic imprinting."

    "abstract": "To explore motor praxis in adults with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) in comparison with a control group of people with intellectual disability (ID) and to examine the relationship with brain structural measurements. Thirty adult participants with PWS and 132 with ID of nongenetic etiology (matched by age, sex, and ID level) were assessed using a comprehensive evaluation of the praxis function, which included pantomime of tool use, imitation of meaningful and meaningless gestures, motor sequencing, and constructional praxis. Results support specific praxis difficulties in PWS, with worse performance in the imitation of motor actions and better performance in constructional praxis than ID peers. Compared with both control groups, PWS showed increased gray matter volume in sensorimotor and subcortical regions. However, we found no obvious association between these alterations and praxis performance. Instead, praxis scores correlated with regional volume measures in distributed apparently normal brain areas. Our findings are consistent in showing significant impairment in gesture imitation abilities in PWS and, otherwise, further indicate that the visuospatial praxis domain is relatively preserved. Praxis disability in PWS was not associated with a specific, focal alteration of brain anatomy. Altered imitation gestures could, therefore, be a consequence of widespread brain dysfunction. However, the specific contribution of key brain structures (e.g., areas containing mirror neurons) should be more finely tested in future research."

    "title": "Epigenetics in Prader-Willi Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1 in 20,000 individuals worldwide. Symptom progression in PWS is classically characterized by two nutritional stages. Stage 1 is hypotonia characterized by poor muscle tone that leads to poor feeding behavior causing failure to thrive in early neonatal life. Stage 2 is followed by the development of extreme hyperphagia, also known as insatiable eating and fixation on food that often leads to obesity in early childhood. Other major features of PWS include obsessive-compulsive and hoarding behaviors, intellectual disability, and sleep abnormalities. PWS is genetic disorder mapping to imprinted 15q11.2-q13.3 locus, specifically at the paternally expressed <i>SNORD116</i> locus of small nucleolar RNAs and noncoding host gene transcripts. <i>SNORD116</i> is processed into several noncoding components and is hypothesized to orchestrate diurnal changes in metabolism through epigenetics, according to functional studies. Here, we review the current status of epigenetic mechanisms in PWS, with an emphasis on an emerging role for <i>SNORD116</i> in circadian and sleep phenotypes. We also summarize current ongoing therapeutic strategies, as well as potential implications for more common human metabolic and psychiatric disorders."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is associated to distinctive clinical symptoms, including obesity, cognitive and behavioral disorders, and bone impairment. Irisin is a myokine that acts on several target organs including brain adipose tissue and bone. The present study was finalized to explore circulating levels of irisin in children and adult PWS patients. Seventy-eight subjects with PWS, 26 children (15 females, mean age 9.48 ± 3.6 years) and 52 adults (30 females, mean age 30.6 ± 10.7) were enrolled. Irisin serum levels were measured in patients and controls. Its levels were related with anthropometric and metabolic parameters, cognitive performance and bone mineral density either in pediatric or adult PWS. Multiple regression analysis was also performed. Irisin serum levels in PWS patients did not show different compared with controls. A more in-depth analysis showed that both pediatric and adult PWS with DEL15 displayed significantly reduced irisin levels compared to controls. Otherwise, no differences in irisin concentration were found in UPD15 patients with respect to controls. Our study revealed that in pediatric PWS the 25(OH) vitamin-D levels affected irisin serum concentration. Indeed, patients who were not supplemented with vitamin D showed lower irisin levels than controls and patients performing the supplementation. Multiple regression analysis showed that irisin levels in pediatric and adult PWS were predicted by the genetic background and 25(OH)-vitamin D levels, whereas in a group of 29 adult PWS also by intelligent quotient. We demonstrated the possible role of genetic background and vitamin-D supplementation on irisin serum levels in PWS patients."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from the loss of expression of maternally imprinted genes located in the paternal chromosomal region, 15q11-13. Impaired hypothalamic development and function is the cause of most of the phenotypes comprising the developmental trajectory of Prader-Willi syndrome: from anorexia at birth to excessive weight gain preceding hyperphagia, and early severe obesity with hormonal deficiencies, behavioural problems, and dysautonomia. Growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, premature adrenarche, corticotropin deficiency, precocious puberty, and glucose metabolism disorders are the main endocrine dysfunctions observed. Additionally, as a result of hypothalamic dysfunction, oxytocin and ghrelin systems are impaired in most patients. Standard pituitary and gonadal hormone replacement therapies are required. In this Review, we discuss Prader-Willi syndrome as a model of hypothalamic dysfunction, and provide a comprehensive description of the accumulated knowledge on genetics, pathophysiology, and treatment approaches of this rare disorder."

    "abstract": "Sleep disorders are common in people with intellectual disability (ID) and autism, with growing evidence of diverse sleep profiles across ID associated genetic syndromes. Documenting the prevalence and profile of specific sleep disorders in syndromes will quantify syndrome-driven 'risk', inform prognosis and enhance understanding of aetiology of sleep disorders. Following PRISMA guidelines for meta-analysis, we searched Ovid PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science and PubMed Central with use of syndrome-specific keywords and 60 sleep-related search terms. We screened and extracted papers that reported sleep disorder prevalence data for five or more individuals within a genetic syndrome, and applied quality criteria to produce a quality-effects prevalence model of six types of sleep disorder across nineteen syndromes. Relative risk estimates were calculated for the prevalence of each sleep disorder in each syndrome. Two hundred and seventy three papers were identified, generating 463 prevalence estimates for Angelman, CHARGE, Cornelia de Lange, Down, fragile X, Prader-Willi, Rett, Smith-Magenis and Williams syndromes, mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS disorders), neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis complex. Prevalence estimates were higher in genetic syndromes than published equivalents for typically developing individuals, with few exceptions. Between-syndrome differences for some disorders were evident; sleep-disordered breathing was most prevalent in MPS disorders (72-77%), while excessive daytime sleepiness was highest in Smith-Magenis syndrome (60%). Conversely, insomnia, which was reported at a higher rate than TD estimates in all syndromes except fragile X, was not associated with specific genetic risk. This suggests insomnia could emerge because of the individual's environment or associated developmental delay, rather than any specific genetic syndromes. Due to the broad scope of the meta-analysis, only syndromes previously identified as reporting preliminary sleep research were included. Other syndromes may also experience elevated prevalence rates of specific types of sleep disorder. Only English language papers were included. Differing prevalence rates between types of sleep disorder suggest differing causal mechanisms, such as cranio-facial morphology in Down and Prader-Willi syndromes and the build-up of mucopolysaccharides in MPS disorders. Priorities for clinical assessment and intervention for sleep disorders are discussed."

    "abstract": "Pathogenic variants involving the MYT1L gene lead to an autosomal dominant form of syndromic obesity, characterized by polyphagia, intellectual disability/developmental delay, and behavioral problems, and that a characteristic facial phenotype does not seem to be recognizable. Trio whole exome sequencing was performed in a 10-year-old Brazilian male presenting polyphagia, severe early-onset obesity, intellectual disability, speech delay, macrocephaly, frontal bossing, telecanthus, strabismus, and hypogenitalism. Additionally, we performed a literature review of patients carrying non-copy number MYT1L variants. A de novo genetic variant not previously reported in MYT1L (NM_015025.4:c.2990C>A) was identified in the proband and classified as pathogenic. From a literature search, 22 further patients carrying non-copy number MYT1L variants were identified, evidencing that although the associated phenotype is quite variable, intellectual disability/developmental and speech delays are always present. Further, most patients have obesity or overweight due to polyphagia. Macrocephaly, strabismus, behavioral problems, and hand/feet malformations are also recurrent features. We described the first Brazilian case of MYT1L related syndrome and highlighted clinical characteristics based on the literature. Other syndromic forms of obesity such as Prader-Willi, Bardet-Biedl, Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann, MORM, Cohen, Alstrom, and Kleefstra type 1 syndromes should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Further, although obesity is frequent, it is not an obligatory feature of all carriers of MYT1L mutations."

The prevalence of dysmorphic features was studied in 355 PWS participants (61% deletion, 36% maternal disomy [UPD], and 3% imprinting defects) from the National Institute of Health PWS Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network. The effect of growth hormone (GH) treatment on growth and dysmorphic features was compared. Among participants, upslanting palpebral fissures were seen in 23%; strabismus in 42%; abnormal dentition in 32%; small hands in 63% and small feet in 70%; hypopigmentation in 30%; striae in 32% and skin picking in 26%. Compared to those with UPD, participants with deletions were found to be heavier (p = 0.002), had smaller head circumference (HC) (p = 0.009), higher incidence of a flat occiput (p = 0.005); low-anterior hairline (p = 0.04); abnormal dentition (p = 0.009); abdominal striae (p = 0.045), nail abnormalities (p = 0.050), and fair-haired (p < 0.001). Participants in both genetic groups receiving GH were taller (p = 0.005), had larger HCs (p = 0.005), and longer hands (p = 0.049). This study suggested that PWS genetic subtypes and GH treatment can influence growth and dysmorphic features that may impact clinical diagnosis of PWS, such as stature, head shape and appearance of the eyes, nose, and genitalia."

    "abstract": "Oxytocin contributes to the regulation of cytoskeletal and synaptic proteins and could, therefore, affect the mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism. Both the Prader-Willi syndrome and Schaaf-Yang syndrome exhibit autistic symptoms involving the MAGEL2 gene. Magel2-deficient mice show a deficit in social behavior that is rescued following the postnatal administration of oxytocin. Here, in Magel2-deficient mice, we showed that the neurite outgrowth of primary cultures of immature hippocampal neurons is reduced. Treatment with oxytocin reversed this abnormality. In the hippocampus of Magel2-deficient pups, we further demonstrated that several transcripts of neurite outgrowth-associated proteins, synaptic vesicle proteins, and cell-adhesion molecules are decreased. In the juvenile stage, when neurons are mature, normalization or even overexpression of most of these markers was observed, suggesting a delay in the neuronal maturation of Magel2-deficient pups. Moreover, we found reduced transcripts of the excitatory postsynaptic marker, Psd95 in the hippocampus and we observed a decrease of PSD95/VGLUT2 colocalization in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions in Magel2-deficient mice, indicating a defect in glutamatergic synapses. Postnatal administration of oxytocin upregulated postsynaptic transcripts in pups; however, it did not restore the level of markers of glutamatergic synapses in Magel2-deficient mice. Overall, Magel2 deficiency leads to abnormal neurite outgrowth and reduced glutamatergic synapses during development, suggesting abnormal neuronal maturation. Oxytocin stimulates the expression of numerous genes involved in neurite outgrowth and synapse formation in early development stages. Postnatal oxytocin administration has a strong effect on development that should be considered for certain neuropsychiatric conditions in infancy."

    "abstract": "We describe a patient with Temple syndrome resulting from maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 14 who also has low-level mosaicism for trisomy 14. UPD was initially suspected when SNP microarray analysis detected a large region of homozygosity on chromosome 14 and the patient's clinical features were consistent with the phenotype of upd(14)mat. However, SNP arrays cannot prove UPD, as homozygosity may also result from identity by descent. Methylation assays diagnose imprinting disorders such as Prader-Willi, Angelman and Temple syndromes; they detect methylation defects that occur in imprinted loci, which have parent-of-origin-specific expression and have the advantage of making a diagnosis without parental samples. However, in this patient methylation analysis using endpoint PCR detected biparental inheritance. Therefore, sequencing analysis was performed and diagnosed upd(14)mat. Re-examination of the microarray suggested that the explanation for the discrepancy between the array and methylation testing was low-level mosaicism for trisomy 14 and fluorescence in situ hybridization testing detected a trisomic cell line. Thus, this patient's Temple syndrome is a result of a maternal M1 error, which gave a trisomic zygote, followed by loss of the paternal chromosome 14 in an early mitotic division to give maternal UPD with low-level mosaicism for trisomy 14. The methylation assay detected the paternal allele in the trisomic line. The diagnostic failure of the methylation assay in this patient highlights a significant shortcoming of methylation endpoint analysis, especially for Temple syndrome, and underscores the need to use other methods in cases with mosaicism."

    "abstract": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) represents a group of connective tissue disorders characterized by the fragility of the soft connective tissues resulting in widespread skin, ligament, joint, blood vessel and internal organ involvement. The clinical spectrum is highly variable in terms of clinical features, complications, severity, biochemical characteristics and genes mutations. The kyphoscoliotic type EDS (EDS VIA) is a rare variant of the disease, with an incidence of 1:100.000 live births. EDS VIA presents at birth as severe muscular hypotonia, early onset of progressive kyphoscoliosis, marked hyperelasticity and fragility of the skin with abnormal scarring, severe joint hypermobility, luxations and osteopenia without a tendency to fractures. This condition is due to a mutation in the PLOD1 gene, and less commonly in FKBP14 gene, which results in the erroneous development of collagen molecules with consequent mechanical instability of the affected tissue. A female newborn, found to be floppy at birth, presented a remarkable physical examination for joint hypermobility, muscle weakness, hyperelastic skin, a slight curve of the spine, the absence of the inferior labial and lingual frenulum. Due to severe hypotonia, neuromuscular disorders such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), genetic diseases such as Prader Willi syndrome (PWS), myopathies and connective tissue disorders were considered in the differential diagnosis. Targeted gene sequencing were performed for SMN1, PLOD1, FKBP14, COL6A1, COL6A2, COL6A3. The urinary lysyl and hydroxy-lysyl pyridinoline ratio was diagnostic before discovering the homozygous duplication in the PLOD1 gene, which confirmed kyphoscoliotic EDS diagnosis. In front of a floppy infant, a large variety of disorders should be considered, including some connective diseases. The presence at the birth of kyphoscoliosis, associated with joint hypermobility and the absence of the lingual and lower lip frenulum, should suggest an EDS."

Sleep alterations and sleep disorders such as Sleep-disordered breathing and Central disorders of hypersomnolence are frequently recognized (either isolated or in comorbidity). The aim of the review is to highlight the pathophysiology and the clinical features of sleep disorders in PWS, providing the basis for early diagnosis and management. We reviewed the genetic features of the syndrome and the possible relationship with sleep alterations in animal models, and we described sleep phenotypes, diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches in humans. Moreover, we performed a meta-analysis of cerebrospinal fluid orexin levels in patients with PWS; significantly lower levels of orexin were detected in PWS with respect to control subjects (although significantly higher than the ones of narcoleptic patients). Sleep disorders in humans with PWS are multifaceted and are often the result of different mechanisms. Since hypothalamic dysfunction seems to partially influence metabolic, respiratory and sleep/wake characteristics of this syndrome, additional studies are required in this framework."

Demographic, clinical, genetic, and laboratory data and follow-up information of the patients were evaluated. The median age of patients at presentation was 1.5 years, and 50% were females. Genetic analysis showed microdeletion in 69.2%, uniparental disomy in 11.5%, imprinting defect in 1.9% and methylation abnormality in 17.3%. Hypotonia (55.7%), feeding difficulties (36.5%) and obesity (30.7%) were the most common complaints. Cryptorchidism and micropenis were present in 69.2% and 15.3% of males, respectively. At presentation, 25% had short stature, 44.2% were obese, 9.6% were overweight and 17.3% were underweight. Median age of obese patients was significantly higher than underweight patients. Central hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency were present in 30.7% and 4.7%, respectively. Hypogonadism was present in 75% at normal age of puberty. GH treatment was started in 40% at a mean age of 4.7±2.7 years. After two years of GH treatment, a significant increase in height SDS was observed. However, body mass index (BMI) standard deviation (SDS) remained unchanged. The most frequent complaints were hypotonia and feeding difficulty at first presentation. Obesity was the initial finding in 44.2%. GH treatment was started in less than half of the patients. While GH treatment significantly increased height SDS, BMI SDS remained unchanged, possibly due to the relatively older age at GH start."

Growth hormone (GH) deficiency and other hormone deficiencies are common due to hypothalamic dysfunction. In children with PWS GH treatment has been widely demonstrated to improve body composition, normalise height and improve psychomotor development. In adults with PWS, GH's main effects are to maintain normal body structure and metabolism. The positive effects of GH treatment on body composition, physical fitness and beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk markers, behaviour and quality of life in adults with PWS are also well established from several studies. GH treatment is approved for treatment of children with PWS in many countries, but until recently not as a treatment in young adults in the transition period or for adults in general. In this commentary we want to draw attention to the uneven global use of GH treatment, specifically in adults with PWS, and advocate for GH treatment to be approved internationally, not just for children, but also for adults with PWS and based only on the diagnosis of genetically confirmed PWS."

Turner syndrome, Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Williams syndrome and 18q deletion syndrome were evaluated. Our analysis confirmed that AITDs show peculiar phenotypic patterns when they occur in association with some genetic disorders, especially chromosomopathies. To improve clinical practice and healthcare in children and adolescents with genetic syndromes, an accurate screening and monitoring of thyroid function and autoimmunity should be performed. Furthermore, maintaining adequate thyroid hormone levels is important to avoid aggravating growth and cognitive deficits that are not infrequently present in the syndromes analyzed."

Detailed prenatal screening and laboratory examinations were performed, while karyotype analysis and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) of the amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood were applied for genetic analysis. CMA analysis showed that four fetuses harbored a microdeletion and one fetus showed a microduplication at 15q11.2 BP1-BP2, two fetuses had a microdeletion at 15q11-q13 BP2-BP3, and one fetus had an additional microdeletion at 16p13.11. There is no clear standard for the clinical diagnosis of 15q11-q13 microdeletion and microduplication, some of them have clinical phenotypes or are clinically affected. Therefore, parents of such fetuses should be informed of the possibility of microdeletions or microduplications to mitigate the psychological burden, and medical consultation and assistance should be provided when communicating the results of the mid-gestation screening."

Among PWS genetic subtypes, there were statistically significant differences in metabolizing status for cytochromes 2D6, 2C19, 2C9, 3A4 and 1A2 acting on substrates such as fluoxetine, risperidone, sertraline, modafinil, aripiprazole, citalopram, and escitalopram. Gonadal steroid therapy may further impact metabolism of 2C19, 2C9, 3A4 and 1A2 substrates. The status of growth hormone treatment may affect CYP3A4 activity with gender specificity. Pharmacogenetic testing together with PWS genetic subtyping may inform psychotropic medication dosing parameters and risk for adverse events."

    "abstract": "The present study investigated the influence of emotional contexts on mental flexibility in adults with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) using a voluntary task-switching paradigm that was implemented with emotionally valenced pictures. The study aims were to assess whether adults with PWS have impaired switching abilities, whether the deficit is specific to PWS or linked to intellectual disabilities, and the influence of emotional contexts on performance. The task-switching performance of 30 adults with PWS was compared with that of 30 healthy adults matched on chronological age, and to that of 30 adults with intellectual disabilities but without PWS, matched on intellectual quotient level and chronological age. Indicators of switching performance were switching cost and repetition bias. Emotional contexts were operationalised with positive, neutral and negative task-irrelevant pictures. Adults with PWS showed a large increase in switching costs compared with the two control groups, and this effect did not vary across emotional contexts. More fine-tuned examination revealed subtle performance modulations: negative contexts tended to increase the repetition bias in all three groups while positive contexts slowed down global performance in PWS. The results confirmed previous studies, showing impaired switching abilities in PWS over and beyond the influence of intellectual level, but revealed no robust variations in switching deficits across emotional contexts."

    "abstract": "Behavioural support for young people with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is necessary in home and school environments. The Trauma Informed Practice (TIP) framework has been used to support young people with complex behavioural needs in school settings. To identify parent and professional perspectives on behavioural challenges experienced by young people with PWS and strategies for supports, to inform understanding of how they are aligned with the TIP framework. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight families with a 12-21 year old child with PWS, four clinicians and two teachers to investigate the contexts and mechanisms associated with challenging, calm and productive behaviours. Data were analysed using directed content analysis, using TIP principles as a framework. Strategies to support young people with PWS aligned with the four overarching TIP Principles:Empowerment, voice and choice; Creating safe environments; Creating a collaborative environment; and Trustworthiness and transparency. Additional Novel domains included: Behavioural underpinnings, Modifying environments and Supporting family capacity. These novel domains can be used to supplement the TIP framework for guidance on how to support young people with PWS. Development and implementation of strategies to reduce behavioural difficulties in young people with PWS through positive support mechanisms could improve function and social engagement within their families and communities."

    "abstract": "Single-minded homolog 1 (SIM1) is a transcription factor that plays a role in the development of both the hypothalamus and pituitary. SIM1 gene mutations are known to cause obesity in humans, and chromosomal deletions encompassing SIM1 and other genes necessary for pituitary development can cause a Prader-Willi-like syndrome with obesity and hypopituitarism. There have been no reported cases of hypopituitarism linked to a single SIM1 mutation. A 21-month-old male presented to endocrinology clinic with excessive weight gain and severe obesity. History was also notable for excessive drinking and urination. Endocrine workup revealed central hypothyroidism, partial diabetes insipidus, and central adrenal insufficiency. Genetic evaluation revealed a novel mutation in the SIM1 gene. No other genetic abnormalities to account for his obesity and hypopituitarism were identified. While we cannot definitively state this mutation is pathogenic, it is notable that SIM1 plays a role in the development of all three of the patient's affected hormone axes. He is now 6 years old and remains on treatment for his pituitary hormone deficiencies and continues to exhibit excessive weight gain despite lifestyle interventions. Mutations in SIM1 are a well-recognized cause of monogenic human obesity, and there have been case reports of Prader-Willi-like syndrome and hypopituitarism in patients with chromosomal deletions that contain the SIM1 gene. SIM1 is expressed during the development of the hypothalamus, specifically in neuroendocrine lineages that give rise to the hormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and somatostatin. Pituitary testing should be considered in patients with severe obesity and a known genetic abnormality affecting the SIM1 gene, particularly in the pediatric population."

    "abstract": "Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are neurodevelopmental disorders caused by loss of function of maternally expressed UBE3A and paternally expressed contiguous genes on chromosome 15q11-13, respectively. A majority of these syndromes suffer from a large deletion of the relevant chromosome (AS Del or PWS Del), which includes biallelically expressed gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit (GABAaR) genes, while remaining individuals present without the deletion (AS non-Del or PWS non-Del). We previously reported that AS Del, but not AS non-Del individuals, show aberrantly desynchronized somatosensory-evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) and speculated that it might reflect GABAergic dysfunction due to the hemizygosity of GABAaR genes. To verify its pathophysiological impact on PWS and AS, we analyzed the SEFs of PWS individuals. SEFs were recorded from eight PWS Del and two PWS non-Del individuals. The latency and strength of the first peak (N1m) were compared with those of AS Del/non-Del individuals and controls, most of which were obtained earlier. In contrast to AS, both PWS Del and PWS non-Del showed normal SEF waveforms. Desynchronized response with delayed N1m peak latency was exclusively indicated in AS Del. N1m strength was statistically higher in AS Del and AS non-Del, but not in PWS Del and PWS non-Del. Our results indicate that the pathophysiological impact of the hemizygosity of GABAaR genes is lower in PWS than AS. UBE3A deficiency and the hemizygosity of GABAaR genes could synergistically deteriorate neuronal function, resulting in aberrant SEFs in AS Del."

To evaluate quality of life and caregiver burden in children with Prader-Willi syndrome. All children with Prader-Willi syndrome, attending a tertiary referral centre, were invited to participate (n = 44). Quality of life was evaluated using the PedsQL questionnaire. Family impact modules and parent proxy reports evaluated the impact on the quality of life of the child and family. Additional challenges were captured using a burden questionnaire. Nineteen children participated. Median age was 7.9 years (0.6-18.1 years). Majority were female (n = 14, 74%). Median age at diagnosis was 2.5 weeks (range birth-2 years 8 months). Growth hormone treatment was in place for the majority (n = 14, 74%). Increased weight and age were identified as significantly impacting on family functioning and relationships. Parents perceived increased weight and age to have a significant negative impact on their child's psychosocial health and social functioning. Caregivers of children >12 years reported an increased burden of care. Disruption to routines, restriction of social activities and psychological difficulties were reported as increasing caregiver burden. Prader-Willi syndrome impacts significantly on quality of life for both the affected child and the family."

Due to its extreme rarity and wide range of clinical severity, clinical suspicion is difficult for a physician. In the current study, its frequency among the Korean pediatric patients with developmental delay (DD) or intellectual disability (ID) was assessed. As the first report of Korean patients with SYS, our study aims to increase the awareness of this condition among the physicians taking care of the pediatric patients with DD/ID and hypotonia.The patients diagnosed with SYS by whole-exome sequencing (WES) among the 460 Korean pediatric patients with DD/ID were included, and their clinical and molecular features were reviewed.Four patients (0.9%) were diagnosed with SYS. Profound DD (4 patients), multiple anomalies including joint contractures and facial dysmorphism (4 patients), generalized hypotonia (3 patients), and severe respiratory difficulty requiring mechanical ventilation (3 patients) were noted in most cases, similar to those in previous reports. Sleep apnea (2 patients), autistic features (2 patients), a high grade of gastroesophageal reflux (1 patient), and seizures (1 patient) were found as well. A total of 3 different truncating MAGEL2 mutations were identified. A previously-reported mutation, to be the most common one, c.1996dupC, was found in 2 patients. The other 2 mutations, c.2217delC and c.3449_3450delTT were novel mutations. As MAGEL2 is maternally imprinted, 2 patients had inherited the MAGEL2 mutation from their respective healthy fathers.SYS is an extremely rare cause of DD/ID. However, hypotonia, joint contractures, profound DD/ID and facial dysmorphism are the suggestive clinical features for SYS. As a maternally imprinted disorder, it should be reminded that SYS may be inherited in form of a mutation from a healthy father."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by lack of the paternal copy of maternally imprinted, paternally expressed genes at the chromosome 15q11-13 region. In most cases, it is caused by a paternal deletion or a maternal disomy of chromosome 15. Behavioral problems with temper outbursts are common and often combined with physical aggressiveness and self-injury. They are the most frequent cause for a reduced quality of life in adulthood and represent a serious challenge for the individual and those surrounding the individual in everyday life. Until now, no promising pharmaceutical treatment option has been established, and only a few case reports on treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been reported. In this case series, we investigated the effect of the SSRI sertraline in 14 individuals with PWS frequently showing severe temper outbursts with aggressiveness and self-injuries. After 6 months of treatment with sertraline, 13 of 14 patients (92.6%) either no longer displayed temper outbursts or showed a significant decrease in frequency and severity of temper outbursts. In one case, treatment was stopped due to severe sleep abnormalities. We conclude that sertraline is a promising and safe treatment option for severe temper outbursts in patients with PWS."

However, the CBCL has not been thoroughly validated in neurogenetic syndromes (NGS). We investigated the structural validity of the CBCL in NGS. Based on 152 preschoolers with Angelman, fragile X, Prader-Willi, and Williams syndromes, we employed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of CBCL narrowband, broadband, and DSM-oriented scales. CFA models largely supported the unidimensionality of most narrowband scales and the two-factor structure of internalizing and externalizing broadband scales. However, there was limited evidence for the unidimensionality of most DSM-oriented scales. Psychologists may consider using the CBCL as a psychometrically sound narrowband and broadband measure of challenging behaviors but should exercise caution when interpreting DSM-oriented scales for preschoolers with NGS. Our findings underscore a continued need to enhance assessment measures for identifying early precursors of child psychopathology in pediatric populations with atypical developmental trajectories."

Due to the low base-rate of children with PWS, developing behavioral interventions for individuals with PWS is faced with the challenge of enrolling enough local participants for adequate study of behavioral intervention efficacy. However, these types of studies are greatly needed in PWS and telehealth methodology may be useful in addressing this challenge. This article is a follow-up to a previous feasibility study (Dimitropoulos et al., 2017) and reports on the preliminary efficacy of a telehealth intervention delivered to 15 children, ages 6-12, with PWS. Overall, children demonstrated significantly improved cognitive and affective processes in pretend play and general cognitive flexibility following the 6-week remote intervention. These findings are limited by the lack of control group and small sample size which should be considered when interpreting results. Overall, these preliminary findings point to the potential role pretend play can serve as a means of enacting cognitive and behavioral change via telehealth."

To evaluate the effects of 3 months of twice daily intranasal oxytocin (dose range 16-40 IU/day), compared to placebo, on behaviour and hyperphagia in children with PWS. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in the Dutch PWS Reference Center. Twenty-six children with PWS aged 3-11 years. (Change in) behaviour and hyperphagia measured by Oxytocin Questionnaire and Dykens hyperphagia questionnaire. In the total group, no significant effects of oxytocin on social behaviour or hyperphagia were found. However, in boys, the Oxytocin Questionnaire scores improved significantly during oxytocin treatment, compared to a deterioration during placebo (4.5 (-0.8 to 15.3) vs. -4.0 (-11.3 to 0.8), P = .025). The Dykens hyperphagia questionnaire scores remained similar during oxytocin treatment, while there was a deterioration during placebo (0.0 (-0.8 to 4.3) vs. -3.5 (-6.0 to 0.0), P = .046). Patients with a deletion had significant improvements in both questionnaire scores during oxytocin treatment, but deteriorations during placebo. Oxytocin treatment was well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events. Intranasal oxytocin treatment has positive effects on social and eating behaviour in 3-11 years aged boys with PWS and in children with a deletion without safety concerns. Intranasal oxytocin in children with PWS might be considered, but individual effects should be carefully evaluated and treatment discontinued if no effects are found."

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to evaluate the effects of GH on body composition, bone health and cardiovascular health in adults with PWS. A systematic computerized literature search of the PubMed database was conducted by two independent reviewers. Inclusion criteria were individuals over the age of 16 years with a genetic diagnosis of PWS who had received GH therapy, together with assessment of body composition, bone health or cardiovascular health. Twenty full-text papers met the inclusion criteria, encompassing 364 unique patients. No differences in body mass index (BMI) were noted, although 2 studies reported increased BMI after GH cessation. Data demonstrated statistically significant increases in lean body mass and reductions in percentage fat mass. Studies reported inconsistent effects of GH on cholesterol and echocardiography parameters. No studies reported differences in bone mineral density, although one reported improved bone geometry. Minor adverse events including pretibial oedema, headache and transient impaired glucose tolerance were reported in 7 studies. These data suggest that GH is safe and well tolerated in adults with PWS, with evidence of improvement in body composition. Further longitudinal studies are still required to investigate the effects of GH on bone and cardiovascular health. Where GH is used in adults with PWS, this should be managed by a specialist multidisciplinary team with regular monitoring initiated."

Data from patients previously naïve to treatment with GH who began therapy with somatropin were collected from 2006 to 2016 in the observational American Norditropin® Studies: Web-Enabled Research (ANSWER) Program® and NordiNet® International Outcome Study. Variables affecting change from baseline in height standard deviation scores (HSDS; n = 129) and body mass index standard deviation scores (BMI SDS; n = 98) were determined. Patients included in both HSDS and BMI SDS analyses were treated with a mean GH dose of 0.03 mg/kg/d (SD, 0.01 mg/kg/d). Results from the HSDS analysis revealed that baseline age and years on treatment had a significant impact on the change in HSDS. In the BMI SDS analysis, longer GH treatment time led to a greater change in BMI SDS from baseline, and patients with a higher BMI at the start of treatment had a greater decrease in BMI over time. GH is effective in the management of children with PWS. Earlier treatment resulted in a greater gain in height, and a longer treatment period resulted in better outcomes for both height and BMI.

The OX system prominently targets brain structures involved in the regulation of wake-sleep state switching, and also orchestrates multiple physiological functions. The degeneration and dysregulation of the OX system promotes narcoleptic phenotypes both in humans and animals. Hence, this review begins with the already proven involvement of OX in narcolepsy, but it mainly discusses the new pre-clinical and clinical insights of the role of OX in three major neurological disorders characterized by sleep impairment which have been recently associated with OX dysfunction, such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke and Prader Willi syndrome, and have been emerged over the past 10 years to be strongly associated with the OX dysfunction and should be more considered in the future. In the light of the impairment of the OX system in these neurological disorders, it is conceivable to speculate that the integrity of the OX system is necessary for a healthy functioning body."

Aberrant expression and dysregulation of histone modification enzymes has been associated with the development of several CNS disorders, revealing these enzymes as putative targets for drug development and novel therapeutic approaches. SETDB1 is a histone lysine methyltransferase responsible for the di- and tri-methylation of histone 3 (H3) at lysine (K) 9 in euchromatic regions further promoting gene silencing through heterochromatin formation. By this way, SETDB1 has been shown to regulate gene expression and influence normal cellular homeostasis required for nervous system function while it is also implicated in the pathogenesis of CNS disorders. Among them, brain tumors, schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, autism spectrum disorders along with alcohol-induced fetal neurobehavioral deficits and Prader-Willi syndrome are representative examples, indicating the aberrant expression and function of SETDB1 as a common pathogenic factor. In this review, we focus on SETDB1-associated molecular mechanisms implicated in CNS physiology and disease while we further discuss current pharmacological approaches targeting SETDB1 enzymatic activity with beneficial effects."

A longitudinal study of the case management approach to transition, initiated in a university hospital in France in September 2016. Patients with the endocrine or metabolic disease diagnosed during childhood and transferred to adult care were included. The transition programme includes three steps based on case management: liaising with paediatric services, personalising care pathways, and liaising with structures outside the hospital (general practitioners, agencies in the educational and social sector). The cohort included 500 patients, with malignant brain tumour (n = 56 (11%)), obesity (n = 55 (11%)), type 1 diabetes (n = 54 (11%)), or other disease (n = 335 (67%)). Their median age at transfer was 19, and the sex ratio was 0.5. At median 21 months of follow-up, 439 (88%) had a regular follow-up in or outside the hospital, 47 (9%) had irregular follow-up (absence at the last appointment or no appointment scheduled within the time recommended), 4 had stopped care on doctor's advice, 4 had died, 3 had moved, and 3 had refused care. The programme involved 9615 case management actions; 7% of patients required more than 50 actions. Patients requiring most support were usually those affected by a rare genetic form of obesity. Case managers successfully addressed the complex needs of patients. Over time, the cohort will provide unprecedented long-term outcome results for patients with various conditions who experienced this form of transition."

Intervention effects were represented by Hedges'g and pooled to calculate effect sizes using a random-effects model. Ten relevant studies comprising data from 302 participants were finally included. We observed no significant difference in cognitive performance between the GH treatment group and the control group (p = 0.197). GH treatment was shown to remarkably improve motor development in PWS children compared with the control treatment (p < 0.001), with moderate positive treatment effects (Hedges'g [95% CI] = 0.71 [0.38, 1.03]). There were no significant differences between the GH group and the control group based on objective assessments of behavioral development (p = 0.53). The meta-analysis suggested that GH treatment had a significantly positive effect on motor development, with moderate treatment effects in PWS children; however, there was no evidence of effects on cognitive or behavioral development."

    "abstract": "The effects of intranasal oxytocin and placebo on hyperphagia and repetitive behaviors were compared in children and adolescents with Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS). Children and adolescents with PWS were enrolled in an 8-week double-blind placebo-controlled intranasal oxytocin randomized trial. Twenty-three (23) subjects were assigned to oxytocin (N = 11) or placebo (N = 12). Hyperphagia was measured with the Hyperphagia Questionnaire (HQ), and repetitive behavior was measured with Repetitive Behavior Scale- Revised (RBS-R). There were modest significant treatment by-time interactions indicating reduction in hyperphagia and repetitive behaviors across time for placebo but no reduction for oxytocin. Total HQ score showed a greater average reduction of 1.81 points/week for the placebo group vs. oxytocin, with maximum reduction at week 4. There were also greater reductions on HQ-Drive and HQ-Behavior subscales on placebo vs. oxytocin. RBS-R subscales followed similar patterns to the HQ, with a significantly greater reduction in sameness subscale behaviors (average 0.825 points/week) in the placebo group compared to the oxytocin group. Oxytocin was well tolerated, and the only adverse event that was both more common and possibly related to oxytocin vs. placebo was nocturia (n = 1 vs 0). Placebo was associated with modest improvement in hyperphagia and repetitive behaviors in childhood PWS whereas intranasal oxytocin was not associated with improvement in these domains. More work is needed to understand the meaning and mechanism of these findings on hyperphagia and repetitive behaviors in PWS."

    "abstract": "Kleefstra syndrome (KS) is associated with developmental delay, autism, intellectual disability, psychosis, and regression. Research has not been conducted to assess the impact of KS on parents. A mixed-method study was conducted to assess the impact on parental well-being by evaluating parents' well-being, identifying factors of parental experience predicting well-being, and exploring the parental experience. Parents completed an online survey containing the PedsQL™ Family Impact Module (FIM) and a questionnaire created by the researchers. One-Way T-Test compared parents of children with KS to parents of children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Multiple linear regression used parents' total scale scores on PedsQL™ FIM to identify factors influencing parental well-being. Constant comparative analysis used open-ended responses to explore the parental experience of having a child with KS. Parents of children with KS had statistically lower scores in daily activity and social functioning, but statistically higher scores in communication and emotional functioning compared to parents of children with PWS. However, the power was below 0.80, meaning additional research needs to be completed to confirm these findings. The linear multiple regression was not significant. Most importantly, the themes of establishing the diagnosis, importance of knowledge, sense of community, KS and relationships with others, how life changed, and what the future will hold, characterized the parental experience. Knowledge and support were important to parents who had a child recently diagnosed with KS. Therefore, parents should be provided resources about KS and support groups at diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Few short-term studies of weight loss have been performed in adult patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) undergoing metabolic rehabilitation. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 45 adult obese PWS patients undergoing a long-term multidisciplinary metabolic rehabilitation program based on diet and physical activity. Body composition was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 36 (80%) patients. The mean (95% CI) weight change was -3.6 (-7.6 to 0.4, <i>p</i> = 0.08) kg at 3 years and -4.6 (-8.5 to -0.8, <i>p</i> = 0.02) kg at 6 years, and that of BMI was -1.7 (-3.4 to 0.1, <i>p</i> = 0.06) kg/m<sup>2</sup> at 3 years and -2.1 (-3.8 to -0.4, <i>p</i> = 0.02) kg/m<sup>2</sup> at 6 years. A decrease of about 2% in fat mass per unit of body mass was observed, which is in line with the expectations for moderate weight loss. A possibly clinically relevant decrease in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was also observed. These long-term results are important for patients with PWS, which is characterized by severe hyperphagia, behavioral disturbances, and cognitive impairment and is generally considered \"resistant\" to classical weight loss interventions."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisymptomatic, rare, genetic, neurodevelopmental disorder in adults mainly characterized by hyperphagia, cognitive dysfunction, behavioral problems and risk of morbid obesity. Although endocrine insufficiencies are common, hypocortisolism is rare and knowledge on long-term cortisol concentrations is lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term cortisol levels in PWS by measurements of hair cortisol. Twenty-nine adults with PWS, 15 men and 14 women, median age 29 years, median BMI 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, were included. Scalp hair samples were analyzed for cortisol content using liquid-chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. In addition, a questionnaire on auxology, medication and stress were included. For comparison, 105 age- and sex-matched participants from the population-based Lifelines Cohort study were included as controls. The mean hair cortisol between the groups were compared and associations between BMI and stress were assessed by a generalized linear regression model. In the PWS group large variations in hair cortisol was seen. Mean hair cortisol was 12.8 ± 25.4 pg/mg compared to 3.8 ± 7.3 pg/mg in controls (p = 0.001). The linear regression model similarly showed higher cortisol levels in patients with PWS, which remained consistent after adjusting for BMI and stress (p = 0.023). Furthermore, hair cortisol increased with BMI (p = 0.012) and reported stress (p = 0.014). Long-term cortisol concentrations were higher in patients with PWS compared to controls and increased with BMI and stress, suggesting an adequate cortisol response to chronic stress. Hair cortisol demonstrate promising applications in the context of PWS treatment and disease management."

    "abstract": "Mammals have two complete sets of chromosomes, one from each parent with equal autosomal gene expression. Less than one percentage of human genes are imprinted or show expression from only one parent without changing gene structure, usually by DNA methylation, but reversible in gametogenesis. Many imprinted genes affect fetal growth and development accounting for several human disorders reviewed in this report. Disorders include Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, the first examples of imprinting errors in humans, chromosome 15q11.2-q13.3 duplication, Silver-Russell syndrome, Beckwith-Weidemann syndrome, GNAS gene-related inactivation disorders (e.g. Albright hereditary osteodystrophy), uniparental chromosome 14 disomy, chromosome 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, parent of origin effects in 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletion (Burnside-Butler) syndrome and 15q11-q13 single gene imprinted disorders. Periconceptional and intrauterine life can be influenced by environmental factors and nutrition impacting DNA methylation. This process not only alters development of the fetus, but pregnancy complications may result from large fetal size. Epigenetic processes control imprinted gene functions and regulation with susceptibility to diseases as described. A better understanding of these processes will impact on care and treatment of affected individuals."

However, female aphallia and ectopia of the labium majorum appear to be some of the rarest forms of external genitalia malformations. Aphallia is mostly described in males with a frequency of less than one per 40 000 male newborns. Although syndromic forms of aphallia in females have been reported, for example, in Robinow, CHARGE, and Prader-Willi syndrome, reports of isolated female aphallia are meager. Here, we describe the first case of isolated agenesis of the clitoris with an ectopic labium majorum and review the literature of this uncommon malformation and its potential dysmorphogenetic mechanism. We emphasize the need for a routine exhaustive physical examination to identify and characterize this unusual malformation correctly so that families can be appropriately counseled as to cause and potential complications."

It leads to considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly when not recognized and treated adequately. Long-term nocturnal noninvasive ventilation is the mainstay of treatment but evidence suggests that CPAP may be effective in stable patients. Specific perioperative management is required to reduce complications. Some unique syndromes associated with obesity and hypoventilation include rapid-onset obesity with hypoventilation, hypothalamic, autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD), and Prader-Willi syndrome. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (early or late-onset) is a genetic disorder resulting in hypoventilation. Several acquired causes of chronic central hypoventilation also exist.

Approximately 15% of children with PWS will need surgical intervention for their scoliosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of curing or controlling moderate and severe infantile scoliosis curves in children with PWS. This single institution, retrospective study of patients with PWS and infantile scoliosis reviewed 34 consecutive children with >24 months follow-up from initiation of serial spinal casting. Cobb angle comparison measurements of radiographs taken precasting, during treatment, and at follow-up were performed. Rib-vertebral angle difference, Nash-Moe rotation, and space available for lung measurements were followed. Outcomes were stratified as \"Cured,\" \"Braced,\" and \"Surgery.\" Average age for first cast for the entire study was 32 months (range, 14 to 64), undergoing 8 casts (range, 3 to 18) over 25 months (range, 9 to 57) for an initial curve of 54 degrees (range, 27 to 106 degrees), which improved to 27 degrees (range, 11 to 78 degrees). In total, 12 patients (35%) were in the Cured group, following 6 casts over 17 months, with an initial curve of 44±14 degrees improving to 17±5 degrees at the end of treatment, and 20±18 degrees at 68-month follow-up. In total, 18 patients were in the Braced group, with curves initially improving from 55±14 degrees to 35±14 degrees, but at 47±20 degrees at 51-month follow-up. Four patients needed surgery, with initial curves 85 degrees (range, 54 to 106 degrees), but surgery could be postponed 56 months (range, 40 to 73) by casting. Rib-vertebral angle difference was not prognostic. Serial spinal casting is effective in for treating infantile scoliosis in children with PWS. One third of patients had their curve resolved, at least temporarily, where they were braced and cast free. The others were able to delay surgery for a number of years. Initial curves <50 degrees in children <3 years of age seem to have the best prognosis. Level IV."

This study compared changes in mRNA levels of UBE3A and SNORD116 located within the 15q11-q13 region between these disorders and their subtypes and related these to the clinical phenotypes. The study cohort included 58 participants affected with a C15 imprinting disorder (PWS = 27, AS = 21, Dup15q = 10) and 20 typically developing controls. Semi-quantitative analysis of mRNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed using reverse transcription droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for UBE3A and SNORD116 normalised to a panel of internal control genes determined using the geNorm approach. Participants completed an intellectual/developmental functioning assessment and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2nd Edition. The Dup15q group was the only condition with significantly increased UBE3A mRNA levels when compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Both the AS and Dup15q groups also had significantly elevated SNORD116 mRNA levels compared to controls (AS: p < 0.0001; Dup15q: p = 0.002). Both UBE3A and SNORD116 mRNA levels were positively correlated with all developmental functioning scores in the deletion AS group (p < 0.001), and autism features (p < 0.001) in the non-deletion PWS group. The findings suggest presence of novel interactions between expression of UBE3A and SNORD116 in PBMCs and brain specific processes underlying motor and language impairments and autism features in these disorders."

Limited literature exists on the association between molecular classes, growth hormone use, and the prevalence of psychiatric phenotypes in PWS. In this study, we analyzed nine psychiatric phenotypes (depressed mood, anxiety, skin picking, nail picking, compulsive counting, compulsive ordering, plays with strings, visual hallucinations, and delusions) recognized in PWS and investigated associations with growth hormone treatment (GHT), deletions (DEL) and uniparental disomy (UPD) in a cohort of 172 individuals with PWS who met the criteria for analysis. Associations were explored using Pearson chi-square tests and univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses to control for confounding exposures. This observational study of the largest dataset of patients with PWS to date suggested the following genetic subtype and phenotype correlations in psychiatric behaviors: (1) skin picking was more frequent in those with DEL vs. UPD; (2) anxiety was more common in those with UPD vs. DEL; and (3) an increased frequency of anxiety was noted in the UPD group treated with GHT compared to the DEL group. No other significant associations were found between the genetic subtype or GHT including for depressed mood, nail picking, compulsive counting, compulsive ordering, playing with strings, and visual hallucinations. Further studies will be required before any conclusions can be reached."

    "abstract": "Obesity, defined by an excess of body fat impacting on health, is a complex disease resulting from the interaction between many genetic/epigenetic factors and environmental triggers. For some clinical situations with severe obesity, it has been possible to classify these obesity forms according to the molecular alterations. These include: (i) syndromic obesity, which associates severe early-onset obesity with neurodevelopmental disorders and/or polymalformative syndrome and (ii) non-syndromic monogenic obesity, due to gene variants most often located in the leptin-melanocortin pathway. In addition to severe obesity, patients affected by these diseases display complex somatic conditions, eventually including obesity comorbidities, neuropsychological and psychiatric disorders. These conditions render the clinical management of these patients particularly challenging. Patients' early diagnosis is critical to allow specialized and multidisciplinary care, with a necessary interaction between the health and social sectors. Up to now, the management of genetic obesity was only based, above all, on controlling the patient's environment, which involves limiting access to food, ensuring a reassuring daily eating environment that limits impulsiveness, and the practice of adapted, supported, and supervised physical activity. Bariatric surgery has also been undertaken in genetic obesity cases with uncertain outcomes. The context is rapidly changing, as new innovative therapies are currently being tested both for syndromic and monogenic forms of obesity. This review focuses on care management and new therapeutic opportunities in genetic obesity, including the use of the melanocortin 4 agonist, setmelanotide. The results from ongoing trials will hopefully pave the way to a future precision medicine approach for genetic obesity."

This receptor has been implicated in numerous health issues including obesity, gastrointestinal disorders, type II diabetes, and regulation of body weight in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, and there has been growing interest in studying its mechanism of behavior to unlock further applications of GHSR-targeted therapeutics. In addition, the GHSR is expressed in various types of cancer including prostate, breast, and testicular cancers, while aberrant expression has been reported in cardiac disease. Targeted molecular imaging of the GHSR could provide insights into its role in biological processes related to these disease states. Over the past decade, imaging probes targeting this receptor have been discovered for the imaging modalities PET, SPECT, and optical imaging. High-affinity analogues of ghrelin, the endogenous ligand for the GHSR, as well as small molecule inhibitors have been developed and evaluated both <i>in vitro</i> and in pre-clinical models. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular imaging agents targeting the GHSR reported to the end of 2019."

The primary aim was to determine if Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis B94 (B. lactis B94) improves stool frequency, with secondary aims of stool form and gastrointestinal symptoms. Exploratory aims included diet quality and fecal microbiota composition. Following a 4-week baseline, 25 adults with PWS were randomized to consume B. lactis B94 by capsule (15 billion) or placebo for 4 weeks, followed by 4-week washout in a double-blind, crossover design. Stool frequency and Bristol Stool Form (BSF) were assessed daily, and Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and dietary intake (7-days food records), per period. Fecal microbiota per period was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and taxa of interest by qPCR (n = 24). No adverse events were reported. Stool frequency at baseline (n = 25; 2.0 ± 0.1 stools/day), GSRS syndromes, and microbiota composition did not differ with the probiotic intervention overall; however, a delayed, carry-over effect on BSF types 6 and 7 was seen. Diet quality by HEI-2015 was 65.4 ± 8.5. In adults with PWS, B. lactis B94 exhibited little effect on laxation over 4 weeks; however, further research is needed."

    "abstract": "Early institution of GH therapy in children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) yields beneficial effects on their phenotype and is associated with a persistent improvement of body composition, both in the transition age and in adulthood. Reports from GH stimulation testing in PWS adults, however, suggest that GH deficiency (GHD) is not a universal feature of the syndrome, and the current Consensus Guidelines suggest to perform a reassessment of persistent GHD so as to continue GH therapy after reaching adult height. Few data about GH responsiveness to stimulation testing throughout the transitional period in PWS are available to date. Thus, we investigated the prevalence of GHD in a large cohort of patients with PWS during the transition phase. One hundred forty-one PWS patients, 72 females and 69 males, aged 15.4-24.9 years, were evaluated by dynamic testing with growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) plus arginine (GHRH + ARG). To define GHD, both BMI-dependent and BMI-independent diagnostic cut-off limits were considered. According to BMI-dependent criteria, 10.7% of normal weight (NW), 18.5% of overweight and 22.1% of obese PWS maintained a status of GHD. Similar results were obtained by adopting a cut-off limit specific for the adult age (26.2%), as well as criteria for the transition phase in NW subjects (25%). Our study shows that about 20% of patients with PWS fulfilled the criteria for GHD during the transitional age, suggesting the need of an integrated analysis of GH/IGF-I axis, in the context of the general clinical picture and other endocrine abnormalities, in all subjects after attainment of final stature."

These three IDs include fetal and postnatal growth failure, feeding difficulty, and muscular hypotonia as major clinical features. However, the mechanism that causes overlapping phenotypes has not been clarified. To investigate the presence or absence of methylation signatures associated with overlapping phenotypes, we performed genome-wide methylation analysis (GWMA). GWMA was carried out on 36 patients with three IDs (SRS [n = 16], TS14 [n = 7], PWS [n = 13]) and 11 child controls using HumanMethylation450 BeadChip including 475,000 CpG sites across the human genome. To reveal an aberrantly methylated region shared by SRS, TS14, and PWS groups, we compared genome-wide methylation data of the three groups with those of control subjects. All the identified regions were known as SRS-, TS14-, and PWS-related imprinting-associated differentially methylated regions (iDMRs), and there was no hypermethylated or hypomethylated region shared by different ID groups. To examine the methylation pattern shared by SRS, TS14, and PWS groups, we performed clustering analysis based on GWMA data. The result focusing on 620 probes at the 62 known iDMRs (except for SRS-, TS14-, and PWS-related iDMRs) classified patients into two categories: (1) category A, grossly normal methylation patterns mainly consisting of SRS group patients; and (2) category B, broad and mild hypermethylation patterns mainly consisting of TS14 and PWS group patients. However, we found no obvious relationship between these methylation patterns and phenotypes of patients. GWMA in three IDs found no methylation signatures shared by SRS, TS14, and PWS groups. Although clustering analysis showed similar mild hypermethylation patterns in TS14 and PWS groups, further study is needed to clarify the effect of methylation patterns on the overlapping phenotypes."

    "abstract": "Addictive disorders have been much investigated and many studies have underlined the role of environmental factors such as social interaction in the vulnerability to and maintenance of addictive behaviors. Research on addiction pathophysiology now suggests that certain behavioral disorders are addictive, one example being food addiction. Yet, despite the growing body of knowledge on addiction, it is still unknown why only some of the individuals exposed to a drug become addicted to it. This observation has prompted the consideration of genetic heritage, neurodevelopmental trajectories, and gene-environment interactions in addiction vulnerability. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder in which children become addicted to food and show early social impairment. PWS is caused by the deficiency of imprinted genes located on the 15q11-q13 chromosome. Among them, the SNORD116 gene was identified as the minimal gene responsible for the PWS phenotype. Several studies have also indicated the role of the Snord116 gene in animal and cellular models to explain PWS pathophysiology and phenotype (including social impairment and food addiction). We thus present here the evidence suggesting the potential involvement of the SNORD116 gene in addictive disorders."

The phenotype of SHFYNG in childhood partially overlaps with that of the well-established Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS, OMIM #176270). While larger numbers of younger individuals with SHFYNG have been recently published, the phenotype in adulthood is not well established. We recruited 7 adult individuals (aged 18 to 36) with molecularly confirmed SHFYNG and collected data regarding the clinical profile including eating habits, sleep, behavior, personal autonomy, psychiatric abnormalities and other medical conditions, as well as information about the respective phenotypes in childhood. Within our small cohort, we identified a range of common features, such as disturbed sleep, hypoactivity, social withdrawal and anxiety, but also noted considerable differences at the level of personal autonomy and skills. Behavioral problems were frequent, and a majority of individuals displayed weight gain and food-seeking behavior, along with mild intellectual disability or borderline intellectual function. Classical symptoms of SHFYNG in childhood were reported for most individuals. Our findings indicate a high variability of the functional abilities and social participation of adults with SHFYNG. A high prevalence of obesity within our cohort was notable, and uncontrollable food intake was a major concern for some caregivers. The phenotypes of PWS and SHFYNG in adulthood might be more difficult to discern than the phenotypes in childhood. Molecular genetic testing for SHFYNG should therefore be considered in adults with the suspected diagnosis of PWS, if testing for PWS has been negative."

However, its metabolic correlate in paediatric patients with respect to PWS is unknown. This cross-sectional study investigated circulating ANGPTL8 and adipocytokines levels in 28 PWS and 28 age-, sex- and BMI-matched children and adolescents (age, 7.0-17.8y) in relation to NAFLD and metabolic homeostasis assessed by OGTT, paediatric metabolic index (PMI) and fatty liver index (FLI), liver ultrasonography (US), as well as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) for analysis of fat (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM). At the set level of significance, PWS children showed lower values of FFM (p < 0.01) but healthier insulin profiles (p < 0.01) and PMI values (p < 0.05) than matched controls. By US, the prevalence of NAFLD was similar between groups but less severe in PWS than controls. Analysis of ANGPTL8 levels showed no difference between groups, yet only in PWS ANGPTL8 levels were associated with ALT levels, FLI values and NAFLD. In stepwise multivariable regression analysis on merged data, ANGPTL8 levels were independently predicted by BMI SDS, leptin levels and NAFLD. ANGPTL8 levels are similar in PWS and controls and, overall, they are directly associated with the presence and severity of NAFLD in patients with PWS."

    "abstract": "Puberty in children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is usually delayed and/or incomplete but in some patients premature/early adrenarche is observed. We assessed the premature adrenarche (PA) in PWS patients during the recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy and influence of PA on the course of central puberty (CP), rhGH efficacy and safety, and patients' metabolic state. Forty-nine PWS patients were treated with rhGH, 11 presented with PA (group 1) and 14 had normal course of adrenarche (group 2). PA was observed in 22.5% of the PWS children treated with rhGH. The mean time between the rhGH start and the adrenarche, the rhGH dose, the growth velocity and the insulin-like growth factor 1 SD (IGF1 SD) during the treatment, as well as the time of CP, final height SD and BMI SD were similar in both groups. There were also no significant differences in the metabolic assessment-the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and lipid profile results. PA may be a part of the clinical picture of PWS, apart from hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and it seems to have no influence on CP in PWS patients. The rhGH efficacy and safety were comparable in the patients with PA and the normal course of adrenarche."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi-Syndrome (PWS) is characterized by hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. Recent research suggests starting growth hormone-treatment (GHT) as soon as possible. The aim of this study is to analyze possible differences in auxological parameters, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism between two groups of children with PWS that started GHT either during or after their first year of life. Retrospective longitudinal study of 62 children (31 males) with genetically confirmed PWS. Upon diagnosis all children were offered GHT, some started immediately, others commenced later. Cohort A (n = 21; 11 males) started GHT at 0.3-0.99 yrs. (mean 0.72 yrs) and Cohort B (n = 41; 20 males) commenced GHT at 1.02-2.54 yrs. (mean 1.42 yrs) of age. Fasting morning blood samples and auxological parameters were obtained before the start of therapy and semi-annually thereafter. Differences between the two cohorts were estimated with a linear mixed-effect model. Mean length/height-SDS<sub>PWS</sub> differed significantly between the groups [1 yr: A: 0.37 (±0.83) vs B: 0.05 (±0.56); 5 yrs.: A: 0.81 (±0.67) vs B: 0.54 (±0.64); p = 0.012]. No significant differences were found in BMI, lean body mass or body fat. Low-density cholesterol was significantly lower in A than in B [LDL: 1 yr: A: 79 (±20) mg/dl vs B: 90 (±19) mg/dl; 5 yrs.: A: 91(±18) mg/dl vs 104 (±26) mg/dl; p = 0.024]. We found significant differences in the glucose homeostasis between the groups [fasting insulin: p = 0.012; HOMA-IR: p = 0.006; HbA1c: p < 0.001; blood glucose: p = 0.022]. An early start of GHT during the first year of life seems to have a favorable effect on height-SDS and metabolic parameters."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by multiple endocrine, metabolic, respiratory, cognitive, and behavioral/psychiatric symptoms that may lead to severe emotional strain in their caregivers. In this study, we evaluated parenting stress by the Parenting Stress Index-short form (PSI/SF) and parent-reported behavioral symptoms by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18) in families of children with PWS. Sixty-seven home-resident PWS patients and their families were recruited in this study. The patients' mean age was 14.9 ± 8.3 years, and 33 (50.8%) were male. High parenting stress was reported by 41.5% families, as determined by high total stress scores of PSI/SF. The patients in high stress families were significantly older than those in low stress families (18.2 ± 8.0 vs. 12.6 ± 7.8 years, p = .007). CBCL/6-18 was used to evaluate the somatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms of PWS patients aged between 6 and 18 in the subgroup of the 35 families. In this subgroup, 37.1% of families reported high parenting stress. High stress families reported a higher T-score in anxiety/depression, withdrawn behavior, somatic complaints, thought problems, attention problems, and delinquent and aggressive behavior of their children with PWS. After multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis, the T-score of somatic complaints was the only factor related to high parenting stress, with an odds ratio of 1.279. Our data demonstrated the high care burden of families with PWS and highlighted the importance of having dedicated medical care for both somatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) increases the risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) due to obesity, hypotonia, and abnormal ventilatory responses. We evaluated post-adenotonsillectomy complications, polysomnography changes, and quality of life in children with OSA and PWS. Systematic review and meta-analysis. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis by searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus. Two researchers independently reviewed studies about adenotonsillectomy for OSA in patients <21 years with PWS. We extracted study design, patient numbers, age, complications, polysomnography, and quality of life. We pooled postoperative changes in apnea hypopnea index (AHI) for meta-analysis. We applied Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies (MINORS) criteria to assess study quality. The initial search yielded 169 studies. We included 68 patients from eight studies with moderate to high risk of bias. Six studies reported on complications and 12 of 51 patients (24%) had at least one. Velopharyngeal insufficiency was the most commonly reported complication (7/51, 14%). We included seven studies in meta-analysis. Mean postoperative improvement in AHI was 7.7 (95% CI: 4.9-10.5). Postoperatively 20% (95% CI: 3%-43%) had resolution of OSA with AHI < 1.5 while 67% (95% CI: 50%-82%) had improvement from severe/moderate OSA to mild/resolved (AHI < 5). Two studies evaluated quality of life and demonstrated improvement. Children with PWS undergoing adenotonsillectomy for OSA have a substantial risk of postoperative complications that may require additional interventions, especially velopharyngeal insufficiency. Despite improvements in polysomnography and quality of life, many patients had residual OSA. This information can be used to counsel families when considering OSA treatment options.

    "abstract": "<i>SNORD115</i> has been proposed to promote the activity of serotonin (HTR2C) receptor via its ability to base pair with its pre-mRNA and regulate alternative RNA splicing and/or A-to-I RNA editing. Because <i>SNORD115</i> genes are deleted in most patients with the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), diminished HTR2C receptor activity could contribute to the impaired emotional response and/or compulsive overeating characteristic of this disease. In order to test this appealing but never demonstrated hypothesis in vivo, we created a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated <i>Snord115</i> knockout mouse. Surprisingly, we uncovered only modest region-specific alterations in <i>Htr2c</i> RNA editing profiles, while <i>Htr2c</i> alternative RNA splicing was unchanged. These subtle changes, whose functional relevance remains uncertain, were not accompanied by any discernible defects in anxio-depressive-like phenotypes. Energy balance and eating behavior were also normal, even after exposure to high-fat diet. Our study raises questions concerning the physiological role of <i>SNORD115</i>, notably its involvement in behavioural disturbance associated with PWS."

Twelve subjects with PWS (11-35 years old) were included. The subjects underwent 10 daily 20-minute sessions of tDCS in 2 weeks. The anode was positioned over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the cathode over the contralateral region. We observed amelioration of hyperphagic and food craving symptoms (P < 0.05), as well as amelioration of behavioral symptoms measured with the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (P < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first proof-of-concept trial to report the positive effects of increasing excitability of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, using tDCS, for the behavioral, hyperphagia, and food craving symptoms in PWS, which is a low-cost, well-studied, safe alternative for brain stimulation."

This paper aimed to determine rates of sport and physical activity participation in an Australian sample of adults with intellectual disability, compared with rates of participation in the general Australian population. A secondary aim was to investigate factors that may contribute to participation of adults with intellectual disability. Participants were part of the Australian Child to Adult Development (ACAD) study, consisting of a community sample with intellectual disability (n = 305), groups of adults with autism (n = 94), Down syndrome (n = 64), fragile X syndrome (n = 52), Williams syndrome (n = 45), and Prader-Willi syndrome (n = 30). Participation in sport/physical activity was reported over the past 3 months. Rates of participation were reported for adults with intellectual disability and compared with rates in a general Australian population sample. The relationship between participation in physical activity and age, degree of intellectual disability, physical mobility, living situation, socio-economic disadvantage, and behaviour and emotional problems were also conducted. Participants in the ACAD community sample with intellectual disability participated in sport/physical activity at lower rates than the general Australian population (42% compared with 71%). Having no physical mobility impairment was significantly associated with higher rates of participation. Those with Down syndrome participated in sport/physical activity at higher rates than the community sample with intellectual disability, while no difference in sport/physical activity participation was observed in the groups with autism or other syndromes. Australian adults with intellectual disability participate in sport and physical activity at lower rates than the general population. Having a physical mobility impairment was associated with lower rates of participation. However, people living in supported accommodation were more likely to participate than those in other living situations. Having Down syndrome was associated with a higher participation rate than the community sample."

    "title": "Genetic Determinants of Childhood Obesity.",
    "abstract": "Obesity represents a major health burden to both developed and developing countries. Furthermore, the incidence of obesity is increasing in children. Obesity contributes substantially to mortality in the United States by increasing the risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular-related diseases, and other comorbidities. Despite environmental changes over past decades, including increases in high-calorie foods and sedentary lifestyles, there is very clear evidence of a genetic predisposition to obesity risk. Childhood obesity cases can be categorized in one of two ways: syndromic or non-syndromic. Syndromic obesity includes disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and Alström syndrome. Non-syndromic cases of obesity can be further separated into rarer instances of monogenic obesity and much more common forms of polygenic obesity. The advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing has driven significant advances in our understanding of the genetic contribution to childhood obesity. Many rare and common genetic variants have been shown to contribute to the heritability in obesity, although the molecular mechanisms underlying most of these variants remain unclear. An important caveat of GWAS efforts is that they do not strictly represent gene target discoveries, rather simply the uncovering of robust genetic signals. One clear example of this is with progress in understanding the key obesity signal harbored within an intronic region of the FTO gene. It has been shown that the non-coding region in which the variant actually resides in fact influences the expression of genes distal to FTO instead, specifically IRX3 and IRX5. Such discoveries suggest that associated non-coding variants can be embedded within or next to one gene, but commonly influence the expression of other, more distal effector genes. Advances in genetics and genomics are therefore contributing to a deeper understanding of childhood obesity, allowing for development of clinical tools and therapeutic agents."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder with a characteristic behavioural phenotype. A multidisciplinary approach to care is required to prevent multiple medical complications in individuals affected by PWS. The aim of this study was to describe the rehabilitation, medical care, educational and social support provided to school-aged French PWS patients with varying neuropsychological profiles. Data were obtained from a French multicentre study that included patients aged 4-20 years with diverse genetic syndromes. Nineteen PWS subjects with a mean age of 9.2 years were included. The mean full-scale intellectual quotient (IQ) was 58 (Wechsler scale). There were frequent dissociations between verbal and performance IQ that were not associated with a specific profile. We also observed lower autonomy and communication scores (5.3 years and 5.9 years equivalent, respectively, Vineland scale), the absence of hyperactivity (Conners scale), and the presence of behavioural abnormalities (CBCL scale). Multidisciplinary medical supervision was generally coordinated by the paediatric endocrinologist and did not always include follow-up with all of the recommended specialists, in particular with a paediatric psychiatrist. Analysis of multidisciplinary rehabilitation conducted in public and private-sector establishment revealed failings in psychological support, occupational therapy and dietary follow-up. Regarding education, most children younger than 10 years were in normal schools, while older individuals were often cared for in medico-social institutions. In conclusion, children and adolescents with PWS generally received appropriate care. Though there have been considerable improvements in the management of children with PWS, reference centres should continue reinforcing the coordination of multidisciplinary supervision."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized by neonatal hypotonia, developmental delay and hyperphagia/obesity. This disorder is caused by the absence of paternally expressed gene products from chromosome 15q11-q13. We previously demonstrated that knocking out ZNF274, a Kruppel-associated box-A-domain zinc finger protein capable of recruiting epigenetic machinery to deposit the H3K9me3 repressive histone modification, can activate expression from the normally silent maternal allele of SNORD116 in neurons derived from PWS induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, ZNF274 has many other targets in the genome in addition to SNORD116. Depleting ZNF274 will surely affect the expression of other important genes and disrupt other pathways. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to delete ZNF274 binding sites at the SNORD116 locus to determine whether activation of the maternal copy of SNORD116 could be achieved without altering ZNF274 protein levels. We obtained similar activation of gene expression from the normally silenced maternal allele in neurons derived from PWS iPSCs, compared with ZNF274 knockout, demonstrating that ZNF274 is directly involved in the repression of SNORD116. These results suggest that interfering with ZNF274 binding at the maternal SNORD116 locus is a potential therapeutic strategy for PWS."

    "abstract": "Autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) is the most frequent cause of acquired thyroid dysfunction, most commonly presenting either as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' Disease. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is characterized by the presence of thyroid-specific autoantibodies, more commonly anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies in the serum and the typical inhomogeneous echostructure of the thyroid on a thyroid ultrasound examination. Hashimoto's thyroiditis can for a long time be accompanied by normal thyroid function and hypothyroidism can only progressively be established. Graves' disease is much less frequent in childhood and adolescence and presents with overt hyperthyroidism. After the onset of puberty, ATD affects females with a higher incidence than males, while during the prepubertal period there is not such a clear preponderance of affected females. ATD can occur either isolated or in the context of other autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1D), celiac disease, alopecia areata, vitiligo, etc. Especially at the pediatric age, a higher incidence of ATD is also observed in the context of specific genetic syndromes, such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, or 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Nevertheless, although thyroid dysfunction may also be observed in other genetic syndromes, such as Prader-Willi or Williams syndrome, the thyroid dysfunction in these syndromes is not the result of thyroid autoimmunity. Interestingly, there is emerging evidence supporting a possible link between autoimmunity and RASopathies. In this review article the incidence, as well as the clinical manifestation and accompanied pathologies of ATD in specific genetic syndromes will be presented and regular follow-up for the early identification of the disorder will be proposed."

    "title": "Prader-Willi syndrome: reflections on seminal studies and future therapies.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the loss of function of the paternally inherited 15q11-q13 locus. This region is governed by genomic imprinting, a phenomenon in which genes are expressed exclusively from one parental allele. The genomic imprinting of the 15q11-q13 locus is established in the germline and is largely controlled by a bipartite imprinting centre. One part, termed the Prader-Willi syndrome imprinting center (PWS-IC), comprises a CpG island that is unmethylated on the paternal allele and methylated on the maternal allele. The second part, termed the Angelman syndrome imprinting centre, is required to silence the PWS_IC in the maternal germline. The loss of the paternal contribution of the imprinted 15q11-q13 locus most frequently occurs owing to a large deletion of the entire imprinted region but can also occur through maternal uniparental disomy or an imprinting defect. While PWS is considered a contiguous gene syndrome based on large-deletion and uniparental disomy patients, the lack of expression of only non-coding RNA transcripts from the <i>SNURF-SNRPN/SNHG14</i> may be the primary cause of PWS. Patients with small atypical deletions of the paternal <i>SNORD116</i> cluster alone appear to have most of the PWS related clinical phenotypes. The loss of the maternal contribution of the 15q11-q13 locus causes a separate and distinct condition called Angelman syndrome. Importantly, while much has been learned about the regulation and expression of genes and transcripts deriving from the 15q11-q13 locus, there remains much to be learned about how these genes and transcripts contribute at the molecular level to the clinical traits and developmental aspects of PWS that have been observed."

In all, 48 patients confirmed by genetic tests were enrolled, 32 were under 2 years of age and 16 were older children. There were 37 (77.1%) patients with paternal 15q11-13 deletions, 11 (22.9%) patients with maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD), and no patients with imprinting defect (ID). Compared with infants, a significantly higher proportion of older children with PWS were overweight or obese (15/16 children <i>vs.</i> 4/32 infants) and children had a higher serum level of free thyroxine (FT4) (0.9±0.2 <i>vs.</i> 0.7±0.7) and thyroxine (T4) (9.0±2.5 <i>vs.</i> 7.5±1.7).

However, the sources of muscle dysfunction and their contribution to mobility are unclear. The purposes of this study were to 1) compare plantar flexor function between adults with and without PWS; and 2) to examine the relationship between plantar flexor function and gait speed in adults with PWS. Participants included 10 adults with PWS, 10 adults without PWS and with obesity, and 10 adults without PWS and without obesity (matched on age and sex). Plantar flexor function was assessed using isokinetic dynamometry (peak torque [PT], early/late rate of torque development [RTD]), Hoffman reflex (H/M ratio), ultrasound imaging (cross-sectional area [CSA], echo intensity, pennation angle, and fascicle length), and peak propulsive force and plantar flexor moment during gait. Outcomes were compared between groups using one-way MANOVA. Associations between plantar flexor outcomes and gait speed were assessed using Pearson correlation in the PWS group. Adults with PWS had lower absolute and normalized early RTD, and lower H/M ratio than controls with and without obesity; lower absolute PT and late RTD than controls with obesity (all P < 0.05). Cross-sectional area, propulsive force, and plantarflexor moment were lower, and echo intensity was higher, in adults with PWS compared with controls without obesity (all P < 0.05). Greater absolute PT (r = 0.64), absolute early RTD (r = 0.62), absolute late RTD (r = 0.64), gastrocnemii CSA (r = 0.55), and propulsive force (r = 0.58) were associated with faster gait speed (all P < 0.05). Adults with PWS have impaired plantar flexor function likely attributable to reduced neuromuscular function and altered muscle morphology, which are associated with slower gait speeds."

SIM1 is a member of the class I basic helix-loop-helix-PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) transcription factor family, that includes several other conserved proteins, including the hypoxia-inducible factors, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, neuronal PAS proteins, and the CLOCK circadian regulator. Recent studies of HIF-a-ARNT and CLOCK-BMAL1 protein complexes have revealed the organization of their bHLH, PASA, and PASB domains and provided insight into how these heterodimeric protein complexes form; however, experimental structures for SIM1 have been lacking. Here, we describe the first full-length atomic structural model for human SIM1 with its binding partner ARNT in a heterodimeric complex and analyze several pathogenic variants utilizing state-of-the-art simulations and algorithms. Using local and global positional deviation metrics, deductions to the structural basis for the individual mutants are addressed in terms of the deleterious structural reorganizations that could alter protein function. We propose new experiments to probe these hypotheses and examine an interesting SIM1 dynamic behavior. The conformational dynamics demonstrates conformational changes on local and global regions that represent a mechanism for dysfunction in variants presented. In addition, we used our ab initio hybrid model for further prediction of variant hotspots that can be engineered to test for counter variant (restoration of wild-type function) or basic research probe."

PWS is caused by absence of expression of paternally inherited imprinted genes on chromosome 15q11-q13. The syndrome typically occurs due to one of three genetic mechanisms: paternal deletion of involved genes, maternal uniparental disomy, or imprinting center defects. These genetic anomalies lead to well-described clinical phenotype that includes hypotonia, hypothalamic dysfunction, social and behavioral issues, life-threatening hyperphagia, and elevated probability of obesity. Adolescents with PWS are at the highest risk for development of life-threatening obesity due to increased access to food, decreased physical activity, and hyperphagia. Currently, the only treatment for the hyperphagia is environmental control, including locked kitchens and continuous supervision of the affected individual. Caloric intake must be restricted to prevent obesity, which subsequently increases the hunger drive even more. Research and clinical practice have demonstrated that increasing physical activity along with insuring a well-balanced, nutritionally dense diet can improve overall weight control in adolescents with PWS."

Much of the initial research on MAGEs focused on exploiting their antigenicity and restricted expression pattern to target them with cancer immunotherapy. Beyond their potential clinical application and role in tumorigenesis, recent studies have shown that MAGE proteins regulate diverse cellular and developmental pathways, implicating them in many diseases besides cancer, including lung, renal, and neurodevelopmental disorders. At the molecular level, many MAGEs bind to E3 RING ubiquitin ligases and, thus, regulate their substrate specificity, ligase activity, and subcellular localization. On a broader scale, the <i>MAGE</i> genes likely expanded in eutherian mammals to protect the germline from environmental stress and aid in stress adaptation, and this stress tolerance may explain why many cancers aberrantly express <i>MAGEs</i> Here, we present an updated, comprehensive review on the MAGE family that highlights general characteristics, emphasizes recent comparative studies in mice, and describes the diverse functions exerted by individual MAGEs."

We conducted a single-center retrospective study including pregnancies with confirmed hydramnios (defined as deepest pocket ≥8 cm) between January 2013 and May 2017. Twin pregnancies, secondary hydramnios discovered after the diagnosis of a causal pathology, and pregnancies of unknown outcome were excluded. All pregnancies underwent a targeted scan, and selected cases underwent MRI or amniocentesis. A total of 158 patients with confirmed hydramnios were included. Hydramnios was associated with a fetal pathology in 37 cases (23.4%), with diabetes in 39 (24.6%), isolated macrosomia in 16 (10.1%), and considered idiopathic in 66 (41.7%). Ultrasonography established a diagnosis of the underlying pathology in 73% of cases. Amniocentesis was done in 31 cases (20%) and it allowed diagnosis of chromosome anomalies, esophageal atresia, myotonic dystrophy congenital type, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Bartter syndrome. MRI was done in 15 cases (10%) and it allowed one additional diagnosis of esophageal atresia. The diagnostic yields of MRI and amniocentesis were 91.7% and 95.2%, respectively. There were five false positive diagnoses at ultrasonography, and one false positive diagnosis at MRI. Hydramnios can be associated with a wide variety of underlying pathologies. Diagnostic ultrasound can attain a diagnosis in the majority of cases. Amniocentesis offers a valuable complementary assessment."

    "abstract": "Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS) is a genetic disorder caused by truncating variants in the MAGEL2 gene located in the maternally imprinted Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) region at 15q11-13. The SYS phenotype shares features with PWS, a syndrome with known high incidence of sleep disorders. However, the spectrum of sleep-disorders in SYS has not been described. We performed a retrospective analysis of polysomnograms from 22 patients in an international SYS cohort. Sleep characteristics for individuals with the common c.1996dupC variant (n = 10) were compared to other truncating variants (n = 11). We collected 33 sleep study reports from 22 patients, ages 2 months - 18.5 years (mean 6.5 years). Mean sleep efficiency was 70.5% (range 45%-93%) with arousal index 14.1/h (1.2-45/h). The mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was 19.1/h (0.9-49/h) with mean obstructive AHI (oAHI) of 16.3/h (0.6-49/h). Mean central apnea index was 2.8/h (0-14/h). Mean oxygen desaturation index was 20.8/h (range 0-85/hr). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was diagnosed in 81%, and 62% had moderate or severe OSA. Elevated central apnea index occurred in 9.5%. Comparison by genotype groups and age did not reveal any difference in OSA findings. Periodic limb movement index (PLMI) was elevated in 4/15 (26%). OSA is frequently identified on polysomnography in patients with SYS. The mean PLMI is elevated compared to normative data. Patients with SYS should have routine polysomnography screening due to high risk of sleep disorders."

    "title": "Variability and change over time of weight and BMI among adolescents and adults with Prader-Willi syndrome: a 6-month text-based observational study.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder in which hyperphagia (excessive appetite) is a hallmark feature. Understanding how weight changes over time in this population is important for capturing the contemporary natural history of the disorder as well as assessing the impact of new treatments for hyperphagia. Therefore, we aimed to determine the feasibility of a remote assessment of weight change over time in PWS. We developed a text message-based, prospective cohort study of adolescents and adults with PWS to assess changes in weight and body mass index (BMI) over a six-month period. Weight was collected weekly, while changes in height, living situation, access to food, activity level, and medication were collected at three-month intervals. One hundred and sixty-five participants enrolled in the study, with a mean age of 19.7 years (range 12-48). There was considerable variability in weight across participants (range: 76.8-207.7 kg). Thirty-three percent of the participants were normal weight, while 15% were overweight and 52% were obese. Overall, the weight of the study participants increased over the study period (mean weight change + 2.35%), while BMI was relatively stable, albeit high (mean BMI of 31.4 at baseline, mean BMI percent change + 1.42%). Changes in living situation, activity, food access, and medication had limited impact on weight and BMI changes. Multivariable analysis found that time, sex, age, and percentage of life on growth hormone (GH) therapy were statistically significant fixed effects. Participants submitted more than 95% of possible weight data points across the 26 weeks of the study. This remote, observational study of weight change in PWS showed small increases in weight and BMI over a six-month period. Participants were highly compliant with this text message-based study, suggesting that mobile technology-based data collection was manageable for the participants. We anticipate that the results of this study will inform clinical trials for hyperphagia/obesity related therapies in PWS and provide a basis for understanding the efficacy of new therapies for hyperphagia in the real-world setting."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a developmental disorder caused by loss of maternally imprinted genes on 15q11-q13, including melanoma antigen gene family member L2 (MAGEL2). The clinical phenotypes of PWS suggest impaired hypothalamic neuroendocrine function; however, the exact cellular defects are unknown. Here, we report deficits in secretory granule (SG) abundance and bioactive neuropeptide production upon loss of MAGEL2 in humans and mice. Unbiased proteomic analysis of Magel2pΔ/m+ mice revealed a reduction in components of SG in the hypothalamus that was confirmed in 2 PWS patient-derived neuronal cell models. Mechanistically, we show that proper endosomal trafficking by the MAGEL2-regulated WASH complex is required to prevent aberrant lysosomal degradation of SG proteins and reduction of mature SG abundance. Importantly, loss of MAGEL2 in mice, NGN2-induced neurons, and human patients led to reduced neuropeptide production. Thus, MAGEL2 plays an important role in hypothalamic neuroendocrine function, and cellular defects in this pathway may contribute to PWS disease etiology. Moreover, these findings suggest unanticipated approaches for therapeutic intervention."

Annual mortality of patients with PWS is high (3%). In half of the patients, the cause of death is obesity related and/or of cardiopulmonary origin. Health problems leading to this increased mortality often remain undetected due to the complexity and rareness of the syndrome. To assess the prevalence of health problems in adults with PWS retrospectively. We systematically screened 115 PWS adults for undiagnosed health problems. All patients visited the multidisciplinary outpatient clinic for rare endocrine syndromes at the Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands. We collected the results of medical questionnaires, interviews, physical examinations, biochemical measurements, polygraphy, polysomnography, and radiology. Presence or absence of endocrine and nonendocrine comorbidities in relation to living situation, body mass index, genotype, and demographic factors. Seventy patients (61%) had undiagnosed health problems, while 1 in every 4 patients had multiple undiagnosed health problems simultaneously. All males and 93% of females had hypogonadism, 74% had scoliosis, 18% had hypertension, 19% had hypercholesterolemia, 17% had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 17% had hypothyroidism. Unfavorable lifestyles were common: 22% exercised too little (according to PWS criteria) and 37% did not see a dietitian. Systematic screening revealed many undiagnosed health problems in PWS adults. Based on patient characteristics, we provide an algorithm for diagnostics and treatment, with the aim to prevent early complications and reduce mortality in this vulnerable patient group."

We herein investigated age-dependent differences in thyroid hormone levels in PWS children. Free T4 (FT4), free T3 (FT3) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations were retrospectively compared between genetically confirmed PWS children (N = 43, median age: 11.2 months) and controls (N = 85, median age: 14.5 months) matched for age, sex, body weight-SD score (SDS), height-SDS, body mass index-SDS and serum albumin level, a marker of the nutritional status. Subjects were subdivided into two groups based on their age: an infant group aged between 1 and 11 months (PWS: N = 22, controls: N = 30) and a toddler group aged between 12 and 47 months (PWS: N = 21, controls: N = 55). None of the subjects had ever been treated with growth hormone or levothyroxine. After adjustments for confounding variables, in the infant group, FT4 levels (pmol/L) were significantly lower in PWS (11.24 in PWS vs 14.32 in controls, P = .0002), whereas no significant differences were observed in FT3 or TSH levels. In the toddler group, no significant differences were noted in FT4 (12.23 in PWS vs 15.31 in controls, P = .10), FT3 or TSH levels. The FT3/FT4 ratio was significantly increased in PWS in both groups. FT4 levels were positively correlated with age in PWS. Infants with PWS had lower FT4 levels, but FT3 levels were normal, indicating that the levothyroxine replacement therapy may not need to be routinely performed."

    "abstract": "The Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare developmental disorder that contributed by multiple genes. Phenotypically, infants with PWS exhibit hypotonia and developmental delay, whilst older children and adults have cognitive impairments, neuropsychiatric symptoms, impaired motor development, neurological anomalies, endocrine dysfunctions like growth hormone (GH) deficiency, and hyperphagia that leads to obesity. Although mechanisms remain elusive, GH treatment has been recommended as the standard treatment for PWS children. In addition to better motor development, improved body composition and linear growth have been well established, but mental flexibility and behavioural problems remained largely untouched. This review will systemically analyze the recent clinical trials of GH treatment on PWS patients. The emphasis is on the mental and behavioural improvements by GH treatment, and a few concerns to initiate GH treatment. This review will finally propose possible future explorations on basic studies that may shed new light on clinical trials of GH treatment on PWS."

Here we present the case of prenatal diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome, which was suspected with whole-genome NIPS. Whole-genome noninvasive prenatal screening showed a high risk for trisomy 15. Amniocentesis followed by FISH analysis and SNP-based chromosomal microarray was performed. Simultaneous analysis of maternal and fetal samples with SNP microarrays demonstrated maternal uniparental disomy (UPD). The presented case is the first case of PWS described in detail, which was suspected by NIPS results. It demonstrates that the choice of confirmation methods concerning the time needed is crucial for the right diagnosis. We suppose that prenatal testing of UPD is essential for chromosome regions, which play a key role in the appearance of various gene-imprinting failure syndromes like PWS or AS."

    "abstract": "<i>Background</i>: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is conventionally regarded as a model of genetic obesity carrying a metabolically healthier profile and fat compartmentalization than subjects with non-syndromic obesity. Serum uric acid (sUA) is a recognized surrogate marker of metabolic derangement. As no information is currently available on sUA levels in adults with PWS, we aimed to analyze sUA in a large cohort of adult patients with PWS in comparison to a control counterpart; secondly, we aimed to investigate the metabolic and non-metabolic determinants of sUA in PWS. <i>Methods</i>: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 89 consecutive adult patients with genetically confirmed PWS spanning a wide BMI range (17.2-56.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). As controls, 180 age-, sex- and BMI-matched healthy controls were included. sUA levels were analyzed in relation to the PWS status, metabolic variables, hormone status, body composition, and resting energy expenditure (REE). Bivariate correlation and multivariable regression studies were used to test for predictors of sUA in PWS. <i>Results</i>: Despite having similar BMI values, patients with PWS presented with higher FM (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), lower FFM (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and REE values than controls (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). In PWS, sUA levels were non-significantly different between subjects with and without obesity (5.4 ± 1.3 vs. 4.9 ± 1.1 mg/dL, <i>p</i> = 0.09), and did not vary significantly in relation to genotype, sex steroid or GH replacement, as well as psychiatric treatments. Rates of hyperuricaemia (19.1% vs. 33.7%, <i>p</i> < 0.01) and absolute sUA levels were lower in patients with PWS compared to controls owing to significant differences between subgroups with obesity (5.5 ± 1.4 vs. 6.6 ± 1.6 mg/dL, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). In merged populations, sUA increased in parallel with age, BMI, FM, FFM, REE, glucolipid homeostasis, and inflammatory markers. In a separate analysis in PWS, however, sUA correlations with BMI, FM, and inflammatory markers were null. Stepwise multivariable regression analysis in the PWS group adjusted for karyotype, age, sex, FM, FFM, obesity, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol, showed that sUA levels were independently associated with FFM (β = 0.35, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and, albeit less significantly, with triglycerides (β = 0.23, <i>p</i> < 0.05). The introduction of height-normalized FFM (FFM index) in the regression model, however, abrogated the predictive role of FFM on sUA. <i>Conclusions</i>: FFM mass is a strong predictor of sUA. PWS is associated to lower sUA levels than controls likely due to genetic predisposition to different body composition and healthier metabolic phenotype. Further studies are warranted to assess purine metabolism and the clinical significance of the FFM index in PWS."

This study compared responses to a physical activity intervention in bone parameters and remodeling markers in youth with PWS (<i>n</i> = 45) and youth with non-syndromic obesity (NSO; <i>n</i> = 66). Measurements occurred at baseline (PRE) and after 24 weeks (POST) of a home-based active games intervention with strengthening and jumping exercises (intervention group = I) or after a no-intervention period (control group = C). Dual x-ray absorptiometry scans of the hip and lumbar spine (L1-L4) determined BMD and bone mineral content (BMC). Bone markers included fasting bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx). Both I and C groups increased their hip BMD and BMC (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Youth with PWS-I increased their spine BMC from PRE to POST (<i>p</i> < 0.001) but not youth with PWS-C (<i>p</i> = 1.000). Youth with NSO (I and C) increased their spine BMC between PRE and POST (all <i>p</i> < 0.001). Youth with PWS showed lower BAP (108.28 ± 9.19 vs. 139.07 ± 6.41 U/L; <i>p</i> = 0.006) and similar CTx (2.07 ± 0.11 vs.1.84 ± 0.14 ng/dL; <i>p</i> = 0.193) than those with NSO regardless of time. Likely, the novelty of the intervention exercises for those with PWS contributed to gains in spine BMC beyond growth. Bone remodeling markers were unaltered by the intervention."

We used known cases of pathogenic deletions from ISCA database to specifically define regions critical for the target syndromes. Our approach to detect microdeletions, from whole genome sequencing data, is based on sample normalization and read counting for individual bins. We performed both an in-silico study using artificially created data sets and a laboratory test on mixed DNA samples, with known microdeletions, to assess the sensitivity of prediction for varying fetal fractions, deletion lengths, and sequencing read counts. The in-silico study showed sensitivity of 79.3% for 10% fetal fraction with 20M read count, which further increased to 98.4% if we searched only for deletions longer than 3Mb. The test on laboratory-prepared mixed samples was in agreement with in-silico results, while we were able to correctly detect 24 out of 29 control samples. Our results suggest that it is possible to incorporate microaberration detection into basic NIPT as part of the offered screening/diagnostics procedure, however, accuracy and reliability depends on several specific factors."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a prototypic genetic condition related to imprinting. Causative mechanisms include paternal 15q11-q13 deletion, maternal chromosome 15 uniparental disomy (UPD15), Prader-Willi Syndrome/Angelman Syndrome (PWS/AS) critical region imprinting defects, and complex chromosomal rearrangements. Maternal UPD15-related PWS poses risks of concomitant autosomal recessive (AR) disorders when the mother carries a pathogenic variant in one of the genes on chromosome 15 associated with autosomal recessive inherited disease. Co-occurrence of autosomal recessive conditions in the setting of UPD leads to increased complexity of the clinical phenotype, and may delay the diagnosis of PWS. We report a patient with PWS and associated congenital ichthyosis due to maternal UPD15, and a homozygous novel pathogenic variant in ceramide synthase 3 (CERS3). We also review the literature of associated disorders reported in the setting of maternal UPD15-related PWS and provide a summary of the previously described CERS3 variants. This represents the second case of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) in the setting of PWS and UPD15. There needs to be a high index of suspicion of this genetic mechanism when there is unexpected phenotype or evolution of the clinical course in a patient with PWS."

    "abstract": "Cardiac death is the second most prevalent cause in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Paediatric patients with PWS often present cardiac autonomic dysfunction during wakefulness, obesity and sleep-disordered breathing. However, the extent of cardiac autonomic modulation during sleep in PWS has not been documented. The objective of this study was to assess alterations in cardiac autonomic modulation of paediatric patients with PWS during different sleep stages. Thirty-nine participants in three groups: 14 PWS, 13 sex and age-matched lean controls (LG) and 12 obese-matched controls (OB). All participants underwent overnight polysomnography, including continuous electrocardiogram recordings. Heart rate variability (HRV) was analysed during representative periods of each sleep stage through time and frequency domains calculated across 5-min periods. Between-within ANOVAs were employed (p < .05). The results show that total HRV was lower in PWS than OB and LG during slow-wave sleep (SWS) (standard deviation of all NN intervals [SDNN] ms, p = .006). Parasympathetic modulation assessed by time-domain analysis was lower during SWS in PWS compared to both OB and LG (square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals [RMSSD] ms, p = .004; SDSD, standard deviation of differences between adjacent NN intervals [SDSD] ms, p = .02; number of adjacent NN intervals differing by >50 ms [NN50] ms, p = .03; proportion of adjacent NN intervals differing by >50 ms [pNN50] ms, p = .01). Sympathovagal balance assessed by frequency-domain analysis was lower during both N2 and SWS than during the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage, but not different among groups. In conclusion, this group of paediatric patients with PWS had impaired cardiac autonomic balance due to reduced parasympathetic modulation during SWS. This result could imply an underlying increased cardiovascular risk in PWS even during early age and independent of obesity."

    "abstract": "Monogenic non-syndromic obesity is characterized by severe early-onset obesity with abnormal eating behaviour and endocrine disorders. Genes contributing to these rare forms of obesity are mainly located in the leptin/melanocortin pathway, with typically an autosomal additive inheritance of obesity. The normal function of this hypothalamic pathway is essential for the control of energy balance. Genetic variants are involved in 5-30 % of severe early-onset obesity depending on explored populations. Compared to other genes in the pathway especially leptin (LEP), leptin receptor (LEPR), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and prohormone convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1), Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R)-linked obesity is characterized by obesity of variable severity with no notable endocrine phenotypes. Managing patients with monogenic non-syndromic obesity is clinically challenging since they display complex phenotypes and the obesity is often morbid and refractory to classical treatments. Until recent years, there has been a lack of effective and targeted pharmaceutical molecules except for leptin therapy that was available for leptin deficiency. The picture has changed and new promising molecules acting on the leptin-melanocortin pathway such as setmelanotide -a new MC4R agonist- are now emerging as novel targeted therapeutic opportunities."

    "abstract": "Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by truncating variants in the paternal allele of MAGEL2, located in the Prader-Willi critical region, 15q11-q13. Although the phenotypes of SYS overlap those of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), including neonatal hypotonia, feeding problems, and developmental delay/intellectual disability, SYS patients show autism spectrum disorder and joint contractures, which are atypical phenotypes for PWS. Therefore, we hypothesized that the truncated Magel2 protein could potentially produce gain-of-function toxic effects. To test the hypothesis, we generated two engineered mouse models; one, an overexpression model that expressed the N-terminal region of Magel2 that was FLAG tagged with a strong ubiquitous promoter, and another, a genome-edited model that carried a truncating variant in Magel2 generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. In the overexpression model, all transgenic mice died in the fetal or neonatal period indicating embryonic or neonatal lethality of the transgene. Therefore, overexpression of the truncated Magel2 could show toxic effects. In the genome-edited model, we generated a mouse model carrying a frameshift variant (c.1690_1924del; p(Glu564Serfs*130)) in Magel2. Model mice carrying the frameshift variant in the paternal or maternal allele of Magel2 were termed Magel2P:fs and Magel2M:fs, respectively. The imprinted expression and spatial distribution of truncating Magel2 transcripts in the brain were maintained. Although neonatal Magel2P:fs mice were lighter than wildtype littermates, Magel2P:fs males and females weighed the same as their wildtype littermates by eight and four weeks of age, respectively. Collectively, the overexpression mouse model may recapitulate fetal or neonatal death, which are the severest phenotypes for SYS. In contrast, the genome-edited mouse model maintains genomic imprinting and distribution of truncated Magel2 transcripts in the brain, but only partially recapitulates SYS phenotypes. Therefore, our results imply that simple gain-of-function toxic effects may not explain the patho-mechanism of SYS, but rather suggest a range of effects due to Magel2 variants as in human SYS patients."

Interestingly, the fungal community, as well as specific genera, were different between PWS and controls. The majority of the variation in the gut microbiota was not attributed to differences in dietary intake or the impact of genotype. Hyperphagia scores were associated with fungal α-diversity and relative abundance of several taxa, such as <i>Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Clostridium</i>, <i>SMB53</i>, and <i>Candida</i>.

    "abstract": "The role of epigenetic regulation is in large parts connected to cancer, but additionally, its therapeutic claim in neurological disorders has emerged. Inhibition of histone H3 lysine N-methyltransferase, especially G9a, has been recently shown to restore candidate genes from silenced parental chromosomes in the imprinting disorder Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). In addition to this epigenetic approach, pitolisant as G-protein coupled histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor (H<sub>3</sub>R) antagonist has demonstrated promising therapeutic effects for Prader-Willi syndrome. To combine these pioneering principles of drug action, we aimed to identify compounds that combine both activities, guided by the pharmacophore blueprint for both targets. However, pitolisant as selective H<sub>3</sub>R inverse agonist with FDA and EMA-approval did not show the required inhibition at G9a. Pharmacological characterization of the prominent G9a inhibitor A-366, that is as well an inhibitor of the epigenetic reader protein Spindlin1, revealed its high affinity at H<sub>3</sub>R while showing subtype selectivity among subsets of the histaminergic and dopaminergic receptor families. This work moves prominent G9a ligands forward as pharmacological tools to prove for a potentially combined, symptomatic and causal, therapy in PWS by bridging the gap between drug development for G-protein coupled receptors and G9a as an epigenetic effector in a multi-targeting approach."

To explore this possibility, we reviewed the current knowledge on Prader-Willi syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by the absence of expression of some of the genes of the chromosome 15q11-13 region inherited from the father. Indeed, we found that the associations between genes of the PW locus and the modification identified in the relevant behavioral, physiological, and brain imaging studies followed the structure of the RDoC matrix and its six domains (positive valence, negative valence, social processing, cognitive systems, arousal/regulatory systems, and sensorimotor systems)."

Furthermore, abnormal specimens were verified by chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The results demonstrated that the success rate of karyotyping and BoBs™ assay in PND was 98.09% and 100%, respectively. BoBs™ assay was concordant with karyotyping for Trisomy 21, Trisomy 18, and Trisomy 13, sex chromosomal aneuploidy, Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, and mosaicism.

According to the reports, we estimated that the detection rates of karyotyping, BoBs™, and CMA in the present study were 4.28%, 4.93%, and 5%, respectively, which is consistent with the results of a previous study. The respective costs for the three methods were about $135-145, $270-290, and $540-580. BoBs™ assay is considered a reliable, rapid test for use in PND. A variety of comprehensive technological applications can complement each other in PND, in order to maximize the diagnosis rate and reduce the occurrence of birth defects."

    "title": "Caring and living with Prader-Willi syndrome in Italy: integrating children, adults and parents' experiences through a multicentre narrative medicine research.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) significantly impacts health-related quality of life; however, its relational and existential aspects remain unknown in Italian clinical and social debate. The project aimed to investigate the impact of PWS on illness experience through narrative medicine (NM) to understand the daily life, needs and resources of patients with PWS and their caregivers, and to furnish insights for clinical practice. The project involved 10 medical centres of the Italian Network for Rare Diseases and PWS family associations and targeted underage and adult patients with PWS and their caregivers. Written interviews, composed by a sociodemographic survey and a narrative, were collected through the project's website. Three dedicated illness plots employed evocative and open words to facilitate individual expression and to encourage reflection. Narratives were analysed through NVivo software. Researchers discussed the results with the project's steering committee. Twenty-one children and adolescents and 34 adults with PWS joined the project, as well as 138 caregivers. A PWS diagnosis or the caregiving of a patient with PWS older than 5 years represented the eligibility criteria, as well as the willingness to share their illness experience by writing and the ability to communicate in Italian. The analysis of narratives led to understanding the PWS social and relational issues concerning diagnosis and current management, PWS daily experiences and social contexts, PWS implications in the working sphere and participants' future perspectives. Narratives demonstrated that PWS management affects relationships and work-life balance and that social stigma remains present. The project represented the first effort to investigate the impact of PWS on illness experience in Italy through NM while considering the perspectives of patients with PWS and their caregivers. The findings indicated that a multiprofessional approach is fundamental to ensure adequate treatment and provided elements for its improvement."

    "abstract": "To discuss the advantages and technical limitations of various molecular genetic techniques in the diagnosis of two infants featuring all-round developmental retardation. The two patients were initially screened by using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). For patient 1, his parents were also subjected to CMA analysis, and the data was analyzed by using ChAS and UPD-tool software. For patient 2, methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) was carried out. Patient 1 was diagnosed with maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) type Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) by CMA and UPD-tool family analysis. His chromosomes 15 were of maternal UPD with homology/heterology. Patient 2 was diagnosed with deletion type PWS by combined CMA and MS-PCR. Correct selection of laboratory methods based on the advantages and limitations of various molecular techniques can help with diagnosis of genomic imprinting disorders and enable better treatment and prognosis through early intervention."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) syndromes are two clinically distinct imprinted disorders characterized by genetic abnormalities at 15q11-q13. Early diagnosis of both syndromes provides improved treatment and accurate genetic counseling. Whole blood (WB) is the most common DNA source of many methodologies to detect PWS and AS, however, the need of WB makes a massive screening difficult in newborns due to economic and technical limitations. The aim of this study was to adapt a Methylation-sensitive High-Resolution Melting (MS-HRM) approach from dried blood spot (DBS) samples, assessing the different DNA isolation techniques and diagnostic performance. Over a 1-year period, we collected 125 DBS cards, of which 45 had already been diagnosed by MS-HRM (20 PWS, 1 AS, and 24 healthy individuals). We tested three different DBS-DNA extraction techniques assessing the DNA concentration and quality, followed by MS-HRM and statistical comparison. Each DBS-DNA extraction method was capable of accuracy in detecting all PWS and AS individuals. However, the efficiency to detect healthy individuals varied according to methodology. In our experience, DNA extracted from DBS analyzed by the MS-HRM methodology provides an accurate approach for genetic screening of imprinting related disorders in newborns, offering several benefits compared to traditional whole blood methods."

    "abstract": "The brain is one of the organs that are preferentially targeted by adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, a posttranscriptional modification. This chemical modification affects neuronal development and functions at multiple levels, leading to normal brain homeostasis by increasing the complexity of the transcriptome. This includes modulation of the properties of ion channel and neurotransmitter receptors by recoding, redirection of miRNA targets by changing sequence complementarity, and suppression of immune response by altering RNA structure. Therefore, from another perspective, it appears that the brain is highly vulnerable to dysregulation of A-to-I RNA editing. Here, we focus on how aberrant A-to-I RNA editing is involved in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases of humans including epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders, brain tumors, and encephalopathy caused by autoimmunity. In addition, we provide information regarding animal models to better understand the mechanisms behind disease phenotype."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by multiple respiratory, cognitive, endocrine, and behavioral symptoms, such as central apnea, intellectual disabilities, exaggerated stress responses, and temper tantrums. The locus coeruleus noradrenergic system (LC-NE) modulates a diverse range of behaviors, including arousal, learning, pain modulation, and stress-induced negative affective states, which are possibly correlated with the pathogenesis of PWS phenotypes. Therefore, we evaluated the LC-NE neuronal activity of necdin-deficient mice, an animal model of PWS. Heterozygous necdin-deficient mice (B6.Cg-Ndn<sup>tm1ky</sup>) were bred from wild-type (WT) females to generate WT (+m/+p) and heterozygotes (+m/-p) animals, which were examined of LC-NE neuronal activity, developmental reflexes, and plethysmography. On slice electrophysiology, LC-NE neurons of Ndn<sup>tm1ky</sup> mice with necdin deficiency showed significantly decreased spontaneous activities and impaired excitability, which was mediated by enhanced A-type voltage-dependent potassium currents. Ndn<sup>tm1ky</sup> mice also exhibited the neonatal phenotypes of PWS, such as hypotonia and blunt respiratory responses to hypercapnia. LC-NE neuronal firing activity decreased in necdin-deficient mice, suggesting that LC, the primary source of norepinephrine in the central nervous system, is possibly involved in PWS pathogenesis."

Most studies use the growth-hormone-releasing hormone plus arginine (GHRH-arginine) test. No data are available on the glucagon stimulation test (GST) in PWS. We compared the utility of fixed-dose (1 mg) GST versus GHRH-arginine test in diagnosing GHD. Adults and late adolescents with PWS underwent both tests on separate days. In the GHRH-arginine test, GHD was defined according to body mass index. In the GST, two cutoffs were analyzed: peak GH concentration < 3 ng/mL and < 1 ng/mL. For analyses, patients were divided into two groups according to body weight (≤ 90 kg and > 90 kg). We analyzed 34 patients: 22 weighing ≤ 90 kg and 12 weighing > 90 kg. In patients weighing ≤ 90 kg, the two tests were concordant in 16 (72.72%) patients (k = 0.476, p = 0.009 with GST cutoff < 3 ng/mL, and k = 0.450, p = 0.035 with GST cutoff < 1 ng/mL). In patients weighing > 90 kg, the two tests were not concordant with GST cutoff < 3 ng/mL, but were concordant in 11 (91.6%) patients (k = 0.833, p = 0.003) with GST cutoff < 1 ng/mL. GH peaks on the two tests correlated (r = 0.725, p = 0.008). Fixed-dose (1 mg) GST using a peak GH cutoff of < 3 ng/mL or < 1 ng/mL promises to be useful for screening for GHD in adults and late adolescents with PWS. However, in those weighing > 90 kg, the < 1 ng/mL cutoff seems better. Larger studies are necessary to establish definitive glucagon doses and cutoffs, especially in extremely obese patients."

    "abstract": "Oxytocin (Oxt) is a nine amino acid peptide important in energy regulation and is essential to stress-related disorders. Specifically, low Oxt levels are associated with obesity in human subjects and diet-induced or genetically modified animal models. The striking evidence that Oxt is linked to energy regulation is that Oxt- and oxytocin receptor (Oxtr)-deficient mice show a phenotype characterized by late onset obesity. Oxt-/- or Oxtr-/- develop weight gain without increasing food intake, suggesting that a lack of Oxt reduce metabolic rate. Oxt is differentially expressed in skeletal muscle exerting a protective effect toward the slow-twitch muscle after cold stress challenge in mice. We hypothesized that Oxt potentiates the slow-twitch muscle as it does with the uterus, triggering \"the oxytonic contractions\". Physiologically, this is important to augment muscle strength in fight/flight response and is consistent with the augmented energetic need at time of labor and for the protection of the offspring when Oxt secretion spikes. The normophagic obesity of Oxt-/- or Oxtr-/- mice could have been caused by decreased skeletal muscle tonicity which drove the metabolic phenotype. In this review, we summarized our findings together with the recent literature on this fascinating subjects in a \"new <i>oxytonic</i> perspective\" over the physicology of Oxt."

    "abstract": "The proportion of assisted reproductive technology (ART)-conceived livebirths of patients with imprinting disorders (IDs) is higher than that of the general population. Whether this is due to ART or confounding effects of advanced parental age was not investigated. We examined the association of ART and parental ages at childbirth for the development of eight epimutation-mediated imprinting disorders (epi-IDs). We enrolled 136 patients with epi-IDs and obtained general population ART data from the Japanese robust nationwide registry. We compared the proportion of ART-conceived livebirths and maternal childbearing ages between patients with epi-IDs and the general population. The proportion of ART-conceived livebirths in patients with epi-IDs was higher than that in mothers aged ≥ 30 years, the age group in which more than 90% of ART procedures performed. The maternal childbearing ages of patients with epi-IDs were widely distributed from 19 to 45 (median: 32) within the approximate 2.5th to 97.5th percentiles of maternal childbearing ages of the general population. In addition, we compared the proportion of ART-conceived livebirths and parental ages at childbirth across patients with eight epi-IDs. We demonstrated that more than 90% of ART-conceived patients with epi-IDs were found in Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) patients, and parental ages were almost consistent in patients with eight epi-IDs, except Prader-Willi syndrome. According to the prerequisite that most of the ART procedures in Japan are performed on mothers aged ≥ 30 years, ART can be a risk factor for the development of epi-IDs, particularly SRS and BWS, for mothers aged ≥ 30 years."

    "abstract": "Pubertal timing is regulated by the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, nutritional and epigenetic factors. Criteria for determining normal pubertal timing, and thus the definition of precocious puberty, have evolved based on published population studies. The significance of the genetic influence on pubertal timing is supported by familial pubertal timing and twin studies. In contrast to the many monogenic causes associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, only four monogenic causes of central precocious puberty (CPP) have been described. Loss-of-function mutations in Makorin Ring Finger Protein 3(MKRN3), a maternally imprinted gene on chromosome 15 within the Prader-Willi syndrome locus, are the most common identified genetic cause of CPP. More recently, several mutations in a second maternally imprinted gene, Delta-like noncanonical Notch ligand 1 (DLK1), have also been associated with CPP. Polymorphisms in both genes have also been associated with the age of menarche in genome-wide association studies. Mutations in the genes encoding kisspeptin (KISS1) and its receptor (KISS1R), potent activators of GnRH secretion, have also been described in association with CPP, but remain rare monogenic causes. CPP has both short- and long-term health implications for children, highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanisms contributing to early puberty. Additionally, given the role of mutations in the imprinted genes MKRN3 and DLK1 in pubertal timing, other imprinted candidate genes should be considered for a role in puberty initiation."

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks are endogenous oscillators that control ∼24-hour physiology and behaviors in virtually all organisms. The circadian oscillator comprises interconnected transcriptional and translational feedback loops, but also requires finely coordinated protein homeostasis including protein degradation and maturation. However, the mechanisms underlying the mammalian clock protein maturation is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that necdin, one of the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)-causative genes, is highly expressed in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the pacemaker of circadian clocks in mammals. Mice deficient in necdin show abnormal behaviors during an 8-hour advance jet-lag paradigm and disrupted clock gene expression in the liver. By using yeast two hybrid screening, we identified BMAL1, the core component of the circadian clock, and co-chaperone SGT1 as two necdin-interactive proteins. BMAL1 and SGT1 associated with the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of necdin, respectively. Mechanistically, necdin enables SGT1-HSP90 chaperone machinery to stabilize BMAL1. Depletion of necdin or SGT1/HSP90 leads to degradation of BMAL1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, resulting in alterations in both clock gene expression and circadian rhythms. Taken together, our data identify the PWS-associated protein necdin as a novel regulator of the circadian clock, and further emphasize the critical roles of chaperone machinery in circadian clock regulation."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the most common genetic inherited obesity syndrome. Obesity-related complications, mostly related to chronic low-grade systemic inflammation (LGI), are the commonest cause of mortality and morbidity in PWS adults. Phase angle (PhA) is an easy tool to screen a state of LGI in healthy subjects and in subjects with obesity and is obtained from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). The aim of this study was to validate the PhA in PWS adults as a potential biomarker of LGI. In this single-center, cross-sectional study, fifteen PWS adults (six males, aged 19-41 years, and body mass index (BMI) 31.0-68.0 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and fifteen control subjects matched by gender, age, and BMI were evaluated. PhA values were significantly lower (<i>p</i> < 0.001), while high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were significantly higher (<i>p</i> < 0.001) in PWS adults compared with controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001), without a gender difference in the latter. After adjustment for gender, BMI, and waist circumference, significant correlation was found between PhA and hs-CRP levels (r = -0.69, <i>p</i> = 0.01). At the ROC analysis, the threshold value of PhA predicting the highest hs-CRP levels above the median value was found at PhA ≤ 4.8° (<i>p</i> = 0.01; AUC, 0.82; standard error, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.00). These results suggest that PWS adults had a significant higher degree of LGI compared with their counterparts. Moreover, our finding suggest that PhA is a valid biomarker of LGI also in PWS adults."

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate lobule-specific cerebellar structural alterations relevant to clinical behavioral characteristics of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We performed a case-control study of 21 Japanese individuals with PWS (age; median 21.0, range 13-50 years, 14 males, 7 females) and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls with typical development. Participants underwent 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Three-dimensional T<sub>1</sub>-weighted images were assessed for cerebellar lobular volume and adjusted for total intracerebellar volume (TIV) using a spatially unbiased atlas template to give a relative volume ratio. A region of interest analysis included the deep cerebellar nuclei. A correlation analysis was performed between the volumetric data and the clinical behavioral scores derived from the standard questionnaires (hyperphagia, autism, obsession, and maladaptive index) for global intelligence assessment in paired subgroups. In individuals with PWS, TIV was significantly reduced compared with that of controls (p < 0.05, family-wise error corrected; mean [standard deviation], 1014.1 [93.0] mm<sup>3</sup>). Decreased relative lobular volume ratios were observed in posterior inferior lobules with age, sex, and TIV as covariates (Crus I, Crus II, lobules VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, and IX). However, increased ratios were found in the dentate nuclei bilaterally in individuals with PWS (p < 0.01); the mean (standard deviation) × 10<sup>-3</sup> was as follows: left, 1.58 (0.26); right, 1.67 (0.30). The altered lobular volume ratios showed negative correlations with hyperphagic and autistic characteristics and positive correlations with obsessive and intellectual characteristics. This study provides the first objective evidence of topographic patterns of volume differences in cerebellar structures consistent with clinical behavioral characteristics in individuals with PWS and strongly suggests a cerebellar contribution to altered functional brain connectivity in PWS."

In genomic imprinting disorders, parent-specific genetic expression is altered causing imbalances in behaviors influenced by parental investment. We use this natural experiment to test the theory that parent-offspring conflict contributed to the evolution of vocal music by moderating infant demands for parental attention. Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome, a genomic imprinting disorder resulting from increased relative maternal genetic contribution, show enhanced relaxation responses to song, consistent with <i>reduced</i> demand for parental investment (Mehr et al., 2017, <i>Psychological Science</i>). We report the necessary complementary pattern here: individuals with Angelman syndrome, a genomic imprinting disorder resulting from increased relative paternal genetic contribution, demonstrate a relatively reduced relaxation response to song, suggesting <i>increased</i> demand for parental attention. These results support the extension of genetic conflict theories to psychological resources like parental attention."

To explore effects of varying dietary macronutrients on appetite-regulating hormones [acyl ghrelin (AG) and desacyl ghrelin (DAG), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) and insulin] in children with PWS and healthy children (HC). Randomized, cross-over experiments compared two test diets [high protein-low carbohydrate (HP-LC) and high protein-low fat (HP-LF)] to a STANDARD meal (55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 15% protein). Experiment 1 included ten children with PWS (median age 6.63 years; BMI z 1.05); experiment 2 had seven HC (median age 12.54 years; BMI z 0.95). Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 60-minute intervals for 4 hours. Independent linear mixed models were adjusted for age, sex and BMI z-score. Fasting and post-prandial AG and DAG concentrations are elevated in PWS children; the ratio of AG/DAG is normal. Food consumption reduced AG and DAG concentrations in both PWS and HC. GLP-1 levels were higher in PWS after the HP-LC and HP-LF meals than the STANDARD meal (P = .02-0.04). The fasting proinsulin to insulin ratio (0.08 vs 0.05) was higher in children with PWS (P = .05) than in HC. Average appetite scores in HC declined after all three meals (P = .02) but were lower after the HP-LC and HP-LF meals than the STANDARD meal. Altered processing of proinsulin and increased GLP-1 secretion in children with PWS after a high protein meal intake might enhance satiety and reduce energy intake."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare disorder caused by the loss of expression of genes on the paternal copy of chromosome 15q11-13. The main molecular subtypes of PWS are the deletion of 15q11-13 and non-deletion, and differences in neurobehavioral phenotype are recognized between the subtypes. This study aimed to investigate growth trajectories in PWS and associations between PWS subtype (deletion vs. non-deletion) and height, weight and body mass index (BMI). Growth data were available for 125 individuals with PWS (63 males, 62 females), of which 72 (57.6%) had the deletion subtype. There was a median of 28 observations per individual (range 2-85), producing 3565 data points distributed from birth to 18 years of age. Linear mixed models with cubic splines, subject-specific random effects and an autoregressive correlation structure were used to model the longitudinal growth data whilst accounting for the nature of repeated measures. Height was similar for males in both PWS subtypes, with non-deletion females being shorter than deletion females for older ages. Weight and BMI were estimated to be higher in the deletion subtype compared to the non-deletion subtype, with the size of difference increasing with advancing age for weight. These results suggest that individuals with deletion PWS are more prone to obesity."

The present study developed a low‑coverage next‑generation sequencing method to detect CAs in spontaneous miscarriage and assess its clinical performance. In total, 1,401 patients who had experienced an abortion were enrolled in the present study and divided into two groups. In group I, 437 samples that had been previously validated by array CGH were used to establish a method to detect CAs using a semiconductor sequencing platform. In group II, 964 samples, which were not verified, were assessed using established methods with respect to clinical significance. Copy number variant (CNV)‑positive and euploidy samples were verified by array CGH and short tandem repeat profiling, respectively, based on quantitative fluorescent PCR. The low‑coverage sequencing method detected CNVs >1 Mb in length and a total of 3.5 million unique reads. Similar results to array CGH were obtained in group I, except for six CNVs <1 Mb long. In group II, there were 341 aneuploidies, 195 CNVs, 25 mosaicisms and 403 euploidies. Overall, among the 1,401 abortion samples, there were 536 aneuploidies, 263 CNVs, 34 mosaicisms, and 568 euploidies. Trisomies were present in all autosomal chromosomes. The most common aneuploidies were T16, monosomy X, T22, T15, T21 and T13. Furthermore, one tetrasomy 21, one CNV associated with Wolf‑Hirschhorn syndrome, one associated with DiGeorge syndrome and one associated with both Prader‑Willi and Angelman syndromes were identified. These four cases were confirmed by short tandem repeat profiling and array CGH. Quantitative fluorescent PCR revealed nine polyploidy samples. The present method demonstrated equivalent efficacy to that of array CGH in detecting CNVs >1 Mb, with advantages of requiring less input DNA and lower cost."

    "abstract": "Most studies on locomotion of individuals with the Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) have been performed in a laboratory setting using quantitative motion analysis. Recently, wireless inertial sensors have been successfully employed for gait analysis in different pathological states with the advantages of reproducing a testing condition very close to those encountered in daily living. Using such devices, it is possible not only to characterize the conventional spatio-temporal parameters, but also extract information on further less conventional metrics, such as the harmonic ratio (HR), a measure of step-to-step symmetry based on trunk acceleration processing. In the present study, this technique was used to quantify gait parameters during level walking in 20 adults with PWS who were compared to 20 unaffected individuals. While no differences between the two groups were found in terms of spatio-temporal parameters, individuals with PWS exhibited significantly reduced values of HR in the antero-posterior and vertical directions. Such results, which indicate a poorer gait symmetry in PWS, suggest that upper body accelerations, as well as HR, provide novel information on gait in people with PWS that could not be extracted from spatio-temporal parameters only."

It is a chronic metabolic disorder associated with multiple cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, stroke, and insulin resistance. Many obese adolescents remain obese into adulthood, with increased morbidity and mortality. As childhood obesity is a risk factor for adult obesity, the childhood obesity-related disorders account for an increased risk of cardiovascular consequences in adults, in addition to the effects already exerted by the fat mass in adulthood. Several papers have already described the cardiovascular implications of idiopathic obesity, while few data are available about syndromic obesity, due to the small sample size, not homogeneous phenotypes, and younger age at death. The aim of this mini-review is to give a comprehensive overview on knowledge about cardiovascular implications of idiopathic and syndromic obesity to allow the reader a quick comparison between them.

Fasting glucose and insulin remained similar during the three-year study, glucose being 4.6 (4.4 to 4.8) mmol/l at start and 4.6 (4.5 to 4.7) mmol/l after 3 years of growth hormone, p = 0.93 and insulin being 59.5 (42.2 to 81.5) pmol/l and 55.0 (42.4 to 69.2) pmol/l, resp., p = 0.54. There were no growth hormone-related adverse events during the study. Three years of growth hormone treatment in young adults with PWS maintains the positive effects on body composition attained during childhood. Thus, adults with PWS benefit from longer-term growth hormone treatment. EudraCT, EudraCT number 2011-001313-14. Registered 17 October 2012."

    "abstract": "The chromosome 15q11-q13 region of the human genome is regulated by genomic imprinting, an epigenetic phenomenon in which genes are expressed exclusively from one parental allele. Several genes within the 15q11-q13 region are expressed exclusively from the paternally inherited chromosome 15. At least one gene UBE3A, shows exclusive expression of the maternal allele, but this allele-specific expression is restricted to neurons. The appropriate regulation of imprinted gene expression across chromosome 15q11-q13 has important implications for human disease. Three different neurodevelopmental disorders result from aberrant expression of imprinted genes in this region: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Angelman syndrome (AS), and 15q duplication syndrome."

    "abstract": "Nutritional intervention for maintaining an appropriate body composition is central to the management of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Despite evidence that visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with increased metabolic risks, the effects of nutritional intervention on fat distribution have not been evaluated for PWS children. We herein investigated fat distribution in 20 genetically diagnosed PWS children (9 males and 11 females); 17 of which received nutritional intervention with or without growth hormone (GH) treatment [GH-treated group (n = 8), GH-untreated group (n = 9)]. GH treatment continued for median of 4.9 years. GH treatment significantly increased height standard deviation score (SDS) whereas body weight SDS and body mass index SDS were not affected in GH-treated group. In GH-untreated group, height SDS significantly decreased during approximately 5 years of follow-up. Fat distribution was evaluated at the median age of 6.93 years in GH-treated group and 7.01 years in GH-untreated group. VAT was maintained within the reference range in both groups. Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) was elevated in GH-untreated groups compared to reference values whereas it was not in GH-treated group. The remaining three subjects, who had never received nutritional intervention or GH treatment, showed increased VAT and SAT. In conclusion, nutritional intervention is beneficial in maintaining VAT within the reference range during childhood, although excessive nutritional intervention may cause unfavorable effect on linear growth."

We analyzed longitudinally cardiorespiratory polygraphy of 62 PWS children (aged 0-2.5 years at baseline). Twenty-one children (Group A) started GH-therapy during and 41 children (Group B) after their first year of life. Data were acquired before, at 3 and 6 months, then 1.2, 2.2, and 3.2 years after GH onset. Outcomes were determined with the obstructive apnea hypopnea index (OAHI), central apnea index (CAI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), and by measuring obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). We observed no significant differences in OAHI, CAI, ODI, and SpO2 depending on treatment onset. At baseline, 5/21 patients (23.8%) in Group A versus 15/41 patients (36.6%) in Group B showed pathological sleep apnea (OAHI ≥1.5). Pathological OSA increased significantly in Group A during the first 3 months of therapy but dropped below baseline after 1 year in both groups. ODI changed during GH therapy in both groups (from 4.0 to 2.6 in Group A, and 3.6 to 1.6 in Group B; baseline to 3.2 years; p < 0.05). OSA in PWS children appears to develop independently of treatment onset. Treatment may therefore safely be initiated early but should be accompanied by regular sleep analysis."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the loss of function of a set of imprinted genes on chromosome 15q11-15q13. One of these genes, NDN, encodes necdin, a protein that is important for neuronal differentiation and survival. Loss of Ndn in mice causes defects in the formation and function of the nervous system. Necdin is a member of the melanoma-associated antigen gene (MAGE) protein family. The functions of MAGE proteins depend highly on their interactions with other proteins, and in particular MAGE proteins interact with E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases to form MAGE-RING E3 ligase-deubiquitinase complexes. Here, we used proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) and mass spectrometry (MS) to determine the network of protein-protein interactions (interactome) of the necdin protein. This process yielded novel as well as known necdin-proximate proteins that cluster into a protein network. Next, we used BioID-MS to define the interactomes of necdin proteins carrying coding variants. Variant necdin proteins had interactomes that were distinct from wildtype necdin. BioID-MS is not only a useful tool to identify protein-protein interactions, but also to analyze the effects of variants of unknown significance on the interactomes of proteins involved in genetic disease."

    "abstract": "The lack of available measures that can reliably characterize early developmental skills in children with neurogenetic syndromes (NGS) poses a significant challenge for research on early development in these populations. Although syndrome-specific measures may sometimes be necessary, a more cost- and time-efficient solution would be to identify existing measures that are appropriate for use in special populations or optimize existing measures to be used in these groups. Reliability is an important metric of psychometric rigor to consider when auditing and optimizing assessment tools for NGS. In this study, we use Generalizability Theory, an extension of classical test theory, as a novel approach for more comprehensively characterizing the reliability of existing measures and making decisions about their use in the field of NGS research. We conducted generalizability analyses on a popular early social communication screener, the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales-Infant-Toddler Checklist (CSBS-ITC), collected on 172 children (41 Angelman syndrome, 30 Prader-Willi syndrome, 42 Williams syndrome, 59 low-risk controls). Overall, the CSBS-ITC demonstrated at least adequate reliability in the NGS groups included in this study, particularly for the Prader-Willi and Williams syndrome groups. However, the sources of systematic error variance in the CSBS-ITC varied greatly between the low-risk control and NGS groups. Moreover, as unassessed in previous research, the CSBS-ITC demonstrated substantial differences in variance sources among the NGS groups. Reliability of CSBS-ITC scores was highest when averaging across all measurement points for a given child and was generally similar or better in the NGS groups compared to the low-risk control group. Our findings suggest that the CSBS-ITC communicates different information about the reliability of stability versus change, in low-risk control and NGS samples, respectively, and that psychometric approaches like Generalizability Theory can provide more complete information about the reliability of existing measures and inform decisions about how measures are used in research on early development in NGS."

Genetic syndromes with high risk of psychiatric disorders may constitute a model for studies investigating this phenomenon. One of such genetically determined neurodevelopmental disorders is the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Therefore, we aimed to profile a broad panel of immune-inflammatory markers in patients with PWS, taking into account co-morbid psychopathology. Participants were 20 children with PWS, and 20 healthy children matched for age, sex and body mass index. Behavioural symptoms and co-occurring psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). We found significantly elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-13 in patients with PWS. There were significant positive correlations between the levels of IL-1β and scores of the following externalizing and internalizing CBCL domains: withdrawn/depressed, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent and aggressive behaviour in PWS children. Moreover, higher levels of IL-13 were associated with more severe psychopathology in terms of social and attention problems as well as delinquent and aggressive behaviour. Our findings imply that subclinical inflammation, observed as elevated IL-1β and IL-13 levels, appears only in PWS patients and is correlated to several psychopathological symptoms."

Participants went on the Modified Atkins Diet for 4 months and then returned to have anthropometry repeated including repeat labs and behavior questionnaires. Seven children (ages 6-12) were enrolled in the study. Four participants completed the 4-month diet trial; two were unable to comply with the diet and stopped prematurely. One patient lost 2.9 kg; the others maintained their weight. Adverse effects were increases in LDL (expected based on larger studies) and hypercalciuria (with no renal stones) for one patient. Positive effects on hyperphagia and behavior were noted subjectively by families. The Modified Atkins Diet can be a feasible low carbohydrate option for children with Prader-Willi Syndrome for weight management. Long-term use of the diet in patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome needs to be studied further."

CHDs are more common among children with dysmorphic syndromes. The current study aims to estimate the prevalence of many CHDs in different dysmorphic syndromes. Methods This was a retrospective chart review study conducted on all dysmorphic syndrome patients who attended genetic clinics at King Khalid National Guard Hospital in King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from 2005 to 2016. Dysmorphic pediatric patients less than 14 years old who had genetic testing to confirm their diagnosis were included in the study. Patients who did not have any previous echocardiography were excluded. Results A total of 212 individuals (47% males and 53% females) were included. Eighty-five percent of Down syndrome patients had CHDs, and the most common CHD was an atrial septal defect (ASD) (51%). In patients with Turner syndrome, 45% of them had CHDs, and bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) (40%) was the most common defect. In DiGeorge syndrome, 81% of patients had CHDs, and ventricular septal defect (VSD) (41%) was the most common. In Williams syndrome, 83% of patients had CHDs. All patients with Noonan, Edwards, CHARGE (coloboma, heart defects, atresia choanae (also known as choanal atresia), growth retardation, genital abnormalities, and ear abnormalities), and Rubinstein-Taybi syndromes were found to have CHDs. In Patau syndrome and Joubert syndrome, 50% of patients in each had CHDs. Patients with Prader Willi syndrome had normal findings in the echocardiogram. Conclusion The highest prevalence of CHDs was found in Down syndrome. This study has a significant impact on the future of managing and directing the resources to improve the quality of life for syndromic patients. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to increase the local data in the field of CHDs in Saudi Arabia among syndromic patients."

(2) Study Design: One hundred and twenty PWS patients (69 females and 51 males), aged 29.1 ± 9.4 years, body mass index (BMI) 36.7 ± 9.9, were evaluated. The following indexes were assessed in each subject: body mass index (BMI), fat-free mass index (FFMI), fat mass index (FMI), tri-ponderal mass index (TMI), waist-to-height ratio (WtHR) and the body mass fat index (BMFI), which adjusts the BMI for the percentage of body fat and waist circumference. Thereafter, a threshold value adjusted for age and sex, which could identify MetS, was calculated for each index. (3) Results: A significant correlation was found among all indexes (<i>p</i> < 0.0001 for all). However, when the area under the curve (AUC) was compared, BMFI performed better than FMI (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and BMI better than TMI (<i>p</i> < 0.05), but only in females. (4) Conclusions: Besides small differences, all the indexes taken into consideration seem to have the same ability to identify MetS in adults with PWS. Consequently, the most easily calculated index, i.e., BMI, should be considered as the best choice. The use of thresholds appropriate for sex and age can further improve its accuracy."

To identify copy number variants in puberty-related, imprinted genes to determine their role in CPP. Probands with idiopathic CPP had chromosomal microarray (CMA) and targeted deletion/duplication testing for MKRN3 and DLK1. Sixteen female probands without MKRN3 or DLK1 variants identified by Sanger sequencing were studied. Whole gene deletions of MKRN3 were identified in 2 subjects (13%): a complete deletion of MKRN3 in Patient A (pubertal onset at 7 years) and a larger deletion involving MAGEL2, MKRN3, and NDN in Patient B (pubertal onset 5.5 years). Both were paternally inherited. Patient B had no typical features of PWS, other than obesity, which was also present in her unaffected family.

PWS involves a complex inheritance pattern and is caused by an absence of gene expression on the paternally inherited 15q11.2-q13 region, either due to deletion, maternal uniparental disomy or imprinting defect. The syndrome is characterized principally by severe neonatal hypotonia, a weak suck in infancy that is later followed by hyperphagia and obesity, developmental delay, intellectual disability and short stature. In the case of the chromosome 15q26-qter deletion syndrome or Drayer's syndrome, very few reports have been published. Its characteristics include intrauterine growth restriction, postnatal growth failure, varying degrees of intellectual disability, developmental delay, typical facial appearance and diaphragmatic hernia. The present paper describes a female patient in whom clinical findings were suggestive of PWS and deletion in the 15q26-qter region. Both karyotyping and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction were shown to be normal. Nevertheless, fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a 15qter deletion that was later mapped by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-array. The deleted genomic region involves the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) gene, which is related to short stature, developmental delay and intellectual disability. This case had various clinical characteristics in common with the cases of 15q26-qter deletionand characteristics compatible with PWS."

We present a prepubertal girl with PWS who developed diabetes. Case presentation Our case was diagnosed with PWS in infancy following investigation for profound central hypotonia and feeding difficulties. She commenced growth hormone (GH) aged 8 years for short stature and treatment improved linear growth. At age 12 years, she presented with polydipsia, polyuria and vulvovaginitis. She was overweight (BMI SDS +1.43). Diabetes was diagnosed (Blood glucose = 24.2 mmol/L, HbA1c = 121 mmol/mol or 13.2%). She was not acidotic and had negative blood ketones. Autoantibodies typical of type 1 diabetes were negative. She was initially treated with basal bolus insulin regime. GH was discontinued 3 months later due to concerns regarding GH-induced insulin resistance. Off GH, insulin requirements reduced to zero, allowing Metformin monotherapy. However off GH, she reported significant lethargy with static growth and increased weight. Combinations of Metformin with differing insulin regimes did not improve glucose levels. Liraglutide (GLP-1 agonist) and Metformin did not improve glucose levels nor her weight. Liraglutide and Empaglifozin (SGLT-2 inhibitor) therapy used in combination were well tolerated and demonstrated rapid normalisation of blood glucose and improvement in her HbA1c to within target (48 mmol/mol) which was sustained after 6 months of treatment. Conclusions Newer treatments for type 2 diabetes (e. g. GLP-1 agonists or SGLT-2 inhibitors) offer potential treatment options for those with diabetes and PWS when conventional treatments are ineffective."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by metabolic alteration and sleep abnormalities mostly related to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disturbances. The disease is caused by genomic imprinting defects that are inherited through the paternal line. Among the genes located in the PWS region on chromosome 15 (15q11-q13), small nucleolar RNA 116 (Snord116) has been previously associated with intrusions of REM sleep into wakefulness in humans and mice. Here, we further explore sleep regulation of PWS by reporting a study with PWScrm+/p- mouse line, which carries a paternal deletion of Snord116. We focused our study on both macrostructural electrophysiological components of sleep, distributed among REMs and nonrapid eye movements. Of note, here, we study a novel electroencephalography (EEG) graphoelements of sleep for mouse studies, the well-known spindles. EEG biomarkers are often linked to the functional properties of cortical neurons and can be instrumental in translational studies. Thus, to better understand specific properties, we isolated and characterized the intrinsic activity of cortical neurons using in vitro microelectrode array. Our results confirm that the loss of Snord116 gene in mice influences specific properties of REM sleep, such as theta rhythms and, for the first time, the organization of REM episodes throughout sleep-wake cycles. Moreover, the analysis of sleep spindles present novel specific phenotype in PWS mice, indicating that a new catalog of sleep biomarkers can be informative in preclinical studies of PWS."

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and laboratory data as well as the immune functions of patients diagnosed with a microdeletion syndrome. 39 patients diagnosed with microdeletion syndrome who were monitored at the Pediatric Genetics and Immunology clinics at Dr. Behcet Uz Children's Hospital were included in this study. All data for this research were obtained from patient records and by individual consultation with their parents. Of the 39 patients, 15 were monitored for a diagnosis of Williams syndrome, 12 for DiGeorge syndrome, 4 for Prader-Willi syndrome, 2 for Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, 1 for a 1p36 deletion, 1 for Smith-Magenis syndrome, 2 for Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 2 (TRPS2), and 2 for Cri-du-chat syndrome. Of these 39 patients, 10 (25.6%) had a medical history of frequent upper respiratory tract infections. One of the cases with TRPS2 and another with Smith-Magenis syndrome had previously received intravenous antibiotic therapy for infectious disease. Five of the 12 patients with DiGeorge syndrome had low T lymphocytes. Two of the patients with DiGeorge syndrome with a history of frequent infections, with hypogammaglobinemia, and low lymphocytes were receiving regular intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement. It must be taken into account that patients with microdeletion syndromes, especially those with DiGeorge syndrome, may also have immunodeficiencies; therefore, these patients should be closely monitored to prevent development of any complications."

    "title": "Colocalization of Oxtr with Prader-Willi syndrome transcripts in the trigeminal ganglion of neonatal mice.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by deficient expression of the paternal copy of several contiguous genes on chromosome 15q11-q13 and affects multiple organ systems in the body, including the nervous system. Feeding and suckling deficits in infants with PWS are replaced with excessive feeding and obesity in childhood through adulthood. Clinical trials using intranasal oxytocin (OXT) show promise to improve feeding deficits in infants with PWS. The mechanism and location of action of exogenous OXT are unknown. We have recently shown in neonatal mice that OXT receptors (OXTR) are present in several regions of the face with direct roles in feeding. Here we show that the trigeminal ganglion, which provides sensory innervation to the face, is a rich source of Oxtr and a site of cellular co-expression with PWS gene transcripts. We also quantified OXTR ligand binding in mice deficient in Magel2, a PWS gene, within the trigeminal ganglion and regions that are anatomically relevant to feeding behavior and innervated by the trigeminal ganglion including the lateral periodontium, rostral periodontium, tongue, olfactory epithelium, whisker pads and brainstem. We found that peripheral OXTR ligand binding in the head is mostly intact in Magel2-deficient mice, although it is reduced in the lateral periodontium (gums) of neonatal Magel2-deficient mice compared to wild-type controls. These data suggest that OXT via orofacial OXTR may play a peripheral role to modulate sensory-motor reflexes necessary for suckling and may be part of the mechanism by which intranasal OXT shows promise for therapeutic benefit in PWS."

    "title": "Growth hormone treatment in Prader-Willi syndrome patients: systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Growth hormone (GH) treatment is currently recommended in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) patients. To evaluate the impact (efficacy and safety) of the use of recombinant human GH (rhGH) as a treatment for PWS. We performed a systematic review and, where possible, meta-analysis for the following outcomes: growth, body mass index, body composition, cognitive function, quality of life, head circumference, motor development/strength, behaviour and adverse effects. We included all PWS patients, with all types of genetic defects and with or without GH deficiency, who participated in rhGH studies performed in infancy, childhood and adolescence, that were either randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (double-blinded or not) or non-randomised controlled trials (NRCTs) (cohort and before and after studies). The databases used were MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Central. In 16 RCTs and 20 NRCTs selected, the treated group had an improvement in height (1.67 SD scores (SDS); 1.54 to 1.81); body mass index z-scores (-0.67 SDS; -0.87 to -0.47) and fat mass proportion (-6.5% SDS; -8.46 to -4.54) compared with the control group. Data about cognition could not be aggregated. <b>Conclusion</b> Based on high quality evidence, rhGH treatment favoured an improvement of stature, body composition and body mass index, modifying the disease's natural history; rhGH treatment may also be implicated in improved cognition and motor development in PWS patients at a young age. The current review was approved by the ethical committee of our institution. The results will be disseminated through conference presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals.

    "title": "Imprinting disorders in children born after ART: a Nordic study from the CoNARTaS group.",
    "abstract": "Is the risk of imprinting disorders increased in children conceived after ART? We found an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 2.84 [95% CI: 1.34-6.01] for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome in ART children, while the risk of Prader-Willi syndrome, Silver-Russell syndrome or Angelman syndrome was not increased in children conceived after ART. Earlier studies, most of them small, have suggested an association between ART and imprinting disorders. This was a binational register-based cohort study. All children conceived by ART in Denmark (n = 45 393, born between 1994 and 2014) and in Finland (n = 29 244, born between 1990 and 2014) were identified. The full background populations born during the same time periods in the two countries were included as controls. Odds ratios of imprinting disorders in ART children compared with naturally conceived (NC) children were calculated. The median follow-up time was 8 years and 9 months for ART children and 11 years and 9 months for NC children. From the national health registries in Denmark and Finland, we identified all children diagnosed with Prader-Willi syndrome (n = 143), Silver-Russell syndrome (n = 69), Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (n = 105) and Angelman syndrome (n = 72) born between 1994/1990 and 2014, respectively. We identified a total of 388 children diagnosed with imprinting disorders; 16 of these were conceived after ART. The overall AOR for the four imprinting disorders in ART children compared with NC children was 1.35 [95% CI: 0.80-2.29], but since eight ART children were diagnosed with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, the AOR for this specific imprinting disorder was 2.84 [95% CI: 1.34-6.01]. The absolute risk of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome in children conceived after ART was still low: 10.7 out of 100 000 newborns. The risks of Prader-Willi syndrome, Silver-Russell syndrome and Angelman syndrome were not increased in children conceived after ART. Imprinting disorders are rare events and our results are based on few ART children with imprinting disorders. The aetiology is complex and only partly clarified, and the clinical diagnoses are challenged by a broad phenotypic spectrum. In the existing studies, results on the risk of imprinting disorders in children conceived after ART are ambiguous. This study adds that the risk of imprinting disorders in ART children is very small and perhaps restricted to Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.

    "title": "The 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 Microdeletion (<i>Burnside-Butler</i>) Syndrome: In Silico Analyses of the Four Coding Genes Reveal Functional Associations with Neurodevelopmental Phenotypes.",
    "abstract": "The 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion (<i>Burnside-Butler</i>) syndrome is emerging as the most frequent pathogenic copy number variation (CNV) in humans associated with neurodevelopmental disorders with changes in brain morphology, behavior, and cognition. In this study, we explored functions and interactions of the four protein-coding genes in this region, namely <i>NIPA1</i>, <i>NIPA2</i>, <i>CYFIP1</i>, and <i>TUBGCP5</i>, and elucidate their role, in solo and in concert, in the causation of neurodevelopmental disorders. First, we investigated the STRING protein-protein interactions encompassing all four genes and ascertained their predicted Gene Ontology (GO) functions, such as biological processes involved in their interactions, pathways and molecular functions. These include magnesium ion transport molecular function, regulation of axonogenesis and axon extension, regulation and production of bone morphogenetic protein and regulation of cellular growth and development. We gathered a list of significantly associated cardinal maladies for each gene from searchable genomic disease websites, namely MalaCards.org: HGMD, OMIM, ClinVar, GTR, Orphanet, DISEASES, Novoseek, and GeneCards.org. Through tabulations of such disease data, we ascertained the cardinal disease association of each gene, as well as their expanded putative disease associations. This enabled further tabulation of disease data to ascertain the role of each gene in the top ten overlapping significant neurodevelopmental disorders among the disease association data sets: (1) Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS); (2) Angelman Syndrome (AS); (3) 15q11.2 Deletion Syndrome with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder & Learning Disability; (4) Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); (5) Schizophrenia; (6) Epilepsy; (7) Down Syndrome; (8) Microcephaly; (9) Developmental Disorder, and (10) Peripheral Nervous System Disease. The cardinal disease associations for each of the four contiguous 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 genes are <i>NIPA1</i>- Spastic Paraplegia 6; <i>NIPA2</i>-Angelman Syndrome and Prader-Willi Syndrome; <i>CYFIP1</i>-Fragile X Syndrome and Autism; <i>TUBGCP5</i>-Prader-Willi Syndrome. The four genes are individually associated with PWS, ASD, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and Down syndrome. Except for <i>TUBGCP5</i>, the other three genes are associated with AS. Unlike the other genes, <i>TUBGCP5</i> is also not associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and learning disability, developmental disorder, or peripheral nervous system disease. <i>CYFIP1</i> was the only gene not associated with microcephaly but was the only gene associated with developmental disorders. Collectively, all four genes were associated with up to three-fourths of the ten overlapping neurodevelopmental disorders and are deleted in this most prevalent known pathogenic copy number variation now recognized among humans with these clinical findings."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisystem genetic disorder, which has a typical eating behavior and growth pattern. In the infancy period, children with PWS have low body weight followed by hyperphagia in later childhood. Disease-specific growth charts have been recommended for monitoring PWS patients. Previous literature demonstrated growth differences among individuals with PWS of different ethnicity. A retrospective multicenter study was performed in PWS patients from different areas of Thailand included collaboration with the Thai PWS support group during 2000-2017. Baseline characteristics and anthropometric data were reviewed. Both growth hormone and non-growth hormone received patients were included, but the data after receiving GH were excluded before curve construction. Growth charts for Thai PWS compared to the 50th normative centile were constructed using Generalized Least Squares (GLS) methods. Curve smoothing was performed by Fractional Polynomials and Exponential Transformation. One hundred and thirteen patients with genetically confirmed PWS (55 males and 58 females) were enrolled. Fifty percent of patients were diagnosed less than 6 months of age. We developed growth charts for non-growth hormone treated Thai children with PWS aged between 0 and 18 years. A growth pattern was similar to other ethnicities while there were some differences. Mean birth weight of PWS patients was less than that of typical newborns. Mean adult height at 18 years of age in Thai children with PWS was lower than that in American children, but taller than Japanese. Mean weight of Thai PWS males at 18 years of age was more than those from other countries. This study is the first to document PWS-specific growth charts in Southeast Asian population. These growth charts will be useful in improving the quality of patient care and in evaluating the impact of growth hormone treatment in the future."

    "abstract": "Imprinted genes are highly expressed in the hypothalamus; however, whether specific imprinted genes affect hypothalamic neuromodulators and their functions is unknown. It has been suggested that Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by lack of paternal expression at chromosome 15q11-q13, is characterized by hypothalamic insufficiency. Here, we investigate the role of the paternally expressed Snord116 gene within the context of sleep and metabolic abnormalities of PWS, and we report a significant role of this imprinted gene in the function and organization of the 2 main neuromodulatory systems of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) - namely, the orexin (OX) and melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) - systems. We observed that the dynamics between neuronal discharge in the LH and the sleep-wake states of mice with paternal deletion of Snord116 (PWScrm+/p-) are compromised. This abnormal state-dependent neuronal activity is paralleled by a significant reduction in OX neurons in the LH of mutant mice. Therefore, we propose that an imbalance between OX- and MCH-expressing neurons in the LH of mutant mice reflects a series of deficits manifested in the PWS, such as dysregulation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, food intake, and temperature control."

Over 10 years' safety and effectiveness data for biosimilar rhGH can now be presented. PATRO Children and PATRO Adults are multicenter, longitudinal, observational, post-marketing surveillance studies. Eligible patients include children 0-18 years and adults receiving biosimilar rhGH treatment. Adverse events (AEs) are monitored for safety evaluation. Growth variables in children and metabolic data in adults are recorded for effectiveness evaluation. As of January 2019, data from 136 children (48% male) were reported from Swedish centers. Mean age in rhGH treatment-naïve patients at study entry (n = 114) was 7.5 years, with mean 3.6 years treatment duration. No severe AEs of diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, or malignancy were reported. The most frequently reported AE was nasopharyngitis (n = 16 patients). No clinically relevant anti-hGH or neutralizing antibodies were observed. The mean change from baseline in height standard deviation score (SDS) in naïve prepubertal GH deficiency patients was + 0.79 at 1 year, + 1.27 at 2 years, and + 1.55 at 3 years. Data from 293 adults (44% rhGH-naïve, 51% male) were included. Fatigue was the most frequently reported AE (n = 26 patients). The incidence of new neoplasms or existing neoplasm progression was 23.8 patients per 1000 patient-years. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was reported in four patients. At baseline in rhGH-naïve adults, mean (SD) body mass index (BMI) was 29.1 (5.6) kg/m<sup>2</sup> and mean (SD) insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I SDS was - 3.0 (1.4). Mean daily dose increased from 0.1 mg at baseline to 0.3 mg after 4 years. IGF-I SDS normalized during the first year of treatment. Mean BMI and glucose were unchanged over 4 years, while low-/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio decreased. For the first time, Swedish data from the PATRO Children and Adults studies are presented. The 10-year data suggest that biosimilar rhGH is well tolerated across pediatric and adult indications. Safety and effectiveness were similar to previous reports for other rhGH preparations. These results need to be confirmed in larger cohorts, highlighting the importance of long-term post-marketing studies."

    "abstract": "This study examined sensitivity of eye tracking measures to hyperphagia severity in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Gaze data were collected in 57 children with PWS, age 3-11 years, and 47 typically developing peers at two study sites during free visual exploration of complex stimulus arrays that included images of food, animals, and household objects. Analysis of the number and duration of fixations as well as gaze perseverations revealed that food items are not exceptionally salient for children with PWS. Instead, increased attention to food in the context of other high-interest items (e.g., animals) was associated with caregiver reports of more severe hyperphagia and more advanced nutritional phase. The study also provided preliminary evidence of possible genetic subtype and sex differences as well as demonstrated that multiple investigators in a wide range of settings can effectively implement the eye tracking protocol. The results indicate that gaze characteristics derived from eye tracking may be a promising objective marker of hyperphagia in PWS for use in research and clinical trials."

    "title": "Three scenarios illustrating ethical concerns when considering bariatric surgery in obese adolescents with Prader-Willi syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is one of the 25 syndromic forms of obesity, in which patients present-in addition to different degrees of obesity-intellectual disability, endocrine disturbs, hyperphagia and/or other signs of hypothalamic dysfunction. In front of a severe/extreme obesity and the failure of non-invasive treatments, bariatric surgery is proposed as a therapeutic option. The complexity of the clinical condition, which could affect the long-term effects of bariatric surgery, and the frequent association with a mild to severe intellectual disability raise some ethical concerns in the treatment of obese PWS adolescents. This article analyses these issues referring to the principles of healthcare ethics: beneficence/non-maleficence (proportionality of treatments; minimisation of risks); respect of autonomy; justice. Based on these principles, three hypothetical scenarios are defined: (1) obese PWS adolescent, capable of making an autonomous decision; (2) obese PWS adolescent with a severe intellectual disability, whose parents agree with bariatric surgery; (3) obese PWS adolescent with a life-threatening condition and a severe intellectual disability, whose parents do not agree with bariatric surgery. The currently available evidence on efficacy and safety of bariatric surgery in PWS adolescents with extreme or severe obesity and the lack of adequate long-term follow-up suggests great caution even in a very life-threatening condition. Clinicians must always obtain a full IQ assessment of patients by psychologists. A multidisciplinary team is needed to analyse the clinical, psychological, social and ethical aspects and organise support for patient and parents, involving also the hospital ethical committee or, if necessary, legal authorities."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is an imprinted neurodevelopmental disease characterized by cognitive impairments, developmental delay, hyperphagia, obesity, and sleep abnormalities. It is caused by a lack of expression of the paternally active genes in the PWS imprinting center on chromosome 15 (15q11.2-q13). Owing to the imprinted gene regulation, the same genes in the maternal chromosome, 15q11-q13, are intact in structure but repressed at the transcriptional level because of the epigenetic mechanism. The specific molecular defect underlying PWS provides an opportunity to explore epigenetic therapy to reactivate the expression of repressed PWS genes inherited from the maternal chromosome. The purpose of this review is to summarize the main advances in the molecular study of PWS and discuss current and future perspectives on the development of CRISPR/Cas9- mediated epigenome editing in the epigenetic therapy of PWS. Twelve studies on the molecular mechanism or epigenetic therapy of PWS were included in the review. Although our understanding of the molecular basis of PWS has changed fundamentally, there has been a little progress in the epigenetic therapy of PWS that targets its underlying genetic defects."

    "abstract": "Deletion of a non-imprinted 500kb genomic region at chromosome 15q11.2, between breakpoints 1 and 2 of the Prader-Willi/Angelman locus (BP1-BP2 deletion), has been associated in previous studies with phenotypes including congenital cardiovascular malformations (CVM). Previous studies investigating association between BP1-BP2 deletion and CVM have tended to recruit cases with rarer and more severe CVM phenotypes; the impact of CVM on relatively unselected population cohorts, anticipated to contain chiefly less severe but commoner CHD phenotypes, is relatively unexplored. More precisely defining the impact of BP1-BP2 deletion on CVM risk could be useful to guide genetic counselling, since the deletion is frequently identified in the neurodevelopmental clinic. Using the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort of ~500,000 individuals, we identified individuals with CVM and investigated the association with deletions at the BP1-BP2 locus. In addition, we assessed the association of BP1-BP2 deletions with neuropsychiatric diagnoses, cognitive function and academic achievement. Cases of CVM had an increased prevalence of the deletion compared with controls (0.64%; OR = 1.73 [95% CI 1.08-2.75]; p = 0.03), as did those with neuropsychiatric diagnoses (0.68%; OR = 1.84 [95% CI 1.23-2.75]; p = 0.004). We conclude that BP1-BP2 deletion moderately increases the risk of the generally milder, but commoner, CVM phenotypes seen in this unselected population, in addition to its previously demonstrated association in case/control studies ascertained for CVM."

K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activation is mechanistically involved in the regulation of appetite in the arcuate nucleus; the regulation of hyperinsulinemia, glycemic control, appetite and satiety in the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus; insulin secretion by β-cells; and the synthesis and β-oxidation of fatty acids in adipocytes. K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activators have been evaluated in hyperphagic obese animal models and were shown to reduce hyperphagia, induce fat loss and weight loss in older animals, reduce the accumulation of excess body fat in growing animals, reduce circulating and hepatic lipids, and improve glycemic control. Recent experience with a K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activator in Prader-Willi syndrome is consistent with the therapeutic responses observed in animal models. K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activation, given the breadth of impact and animal model and clinical results, is a viable target in hyperphagic obesity."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by hyperphagia with progressive, severe obesity, and an increased risk of obesity-related comorbidities in adult life. Although low dietary vitamin D intake and low 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) levels are commonly reported in PWS in the context of bone metabolism, the association of low 25OHD levels with fat mass has not been extensively evaluated in PWS adults. The aims of this study were to investigate the following in PWS adults: (1) 25OHD levels and the dietary vitamin D intake; (2) associations among 25OHD levels with anthropometric measurements and fat mass; (3) specific cut-off values for body mass index (BMI) and fat mass predictive of the 25OHD levels. In this cross-sectional, single-center study we enrolled 30 participants, 15 PWS adults (age 19-41 years and 40% males) and 15 control subjects matched by age, sex, and BMI from the same geographical area (latitude 40° 49' N; elevation 17 m). Fat mass was assessed using a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) phase-sensitive system. The 25OHD levels were determined by a direct competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay. Dietary vitamin D intake data was collected by three-day food records. The 25OHD levels in the PWS adults were constantly lower across all categories of BMI and fat mass compared with their obese counterpart. The 25OHD levels were negatively associated with BMI (<i>p</i> = 0.04), waist circumference (<i>p</i> = 0.03), fat mass (<i>p</i> = 0.04), and dietary vitamin D intake (<i>p</i> < 0.001). During multiple regression analysis, dietary vitamin D intake was entered at the first step (<i>p</i> < 0.001), thus explaining 84% of 25OHD level variability. The threshold values of BMI and fat mass predicting the lowest decrease in the 25OHD levels were found at BMI ≥ 42 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<i>p</i> = 0.01) and fat mass ≥ 42 Kg (<i>p</i> = 0.003). In conclusion, our data indicate that: (i) 25OHD levels and dietary vitamin D intake were lower in PWS adults than in the control, independent of body fat differences; (ii) 25OHD levels were inversely associated with BMI, waist circumference, and fat mass, but low dietary vitamin D intake was the major determinant of low vitamin D status in these patients; (iii) sample-specific cut-off values of BMI and fat mass might help to predict risks of the lowest 25OHD level decreases in PWS adults. The presence of trained nutritionists in the integrated care teams of PWS adults is strongly suggested in order to provide an accurate nutritional assessment and tailored vitamin D supplementations."

    "title": "CRISPR/Cas9 Epigenome Editing Potential for Rare Imprinting Diseases: A Review.",
    "abstract": "Imprinting diseases (IDs) are rare congenital disorders caused by aberrant dosages of imprinted genes. Rare IDs are comprised by a group of several distinct disorders that share a great deal of homology in terms of genetic etiologies and symptoms. Disruption of genetic or epigenetic mechanisms can cause issues with regulating the expression of imprinted genes, thus leading to disease. Genetic mutations affect the imprinted genes, duplications, deletions, and uniparental disomy (UPD) are reoccurring phenomena causing imprinting diseases. Epigenetic alterations on methylation marks in imprinting control centers (ICRs) also alters the expression patterns and the majority of patients with rare IDs carries intact but either silenced or overexpressed imprinted genes. Canonical CRISPR/Cas9 editing relying on double-stranded DNA break repair has little to offer in terms of therapeutics for rare IDs. Instead CRISPR/Cas9 can be used in a more sophisticated way by targeting the epigenome. Catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) tethered with effector enzymes such as DNA de- and methyltransferases and histone code editors in addition to systems such as CRISPRa and CRISPRi have been shown to have high epigenome editing efficiency in eukaryotic cells. This new era of CRISPR epigenome editors could arguably be a game-changer for curing and treating rare IDs by refined activation and silencing of disturbed imprinted gene expression. This review describes major CRISPR-based epigenome editors and points out their potential use in research and therapy of rare imprinting diseases."

Protein truncating mutations in MAGEL2 cause Schaaf-Yang syndrome, and MAGEL2 is one of a small set of genes deleted in Prader-Willi syndrome. Excessive daytime sleepiness, night-time or early morning waking, and narcoleptic symptoms are seen in people with Prader-Willi syndrome and Schaaf-Yang syndrome, while mice carrying a gene-targeted Magel2 deletion have disrupted circadian rhythms. These phenotypes suggest that MAGEL2 is important for the robustness of the circadian rhythm. However, a cellular role for MAGEL2 has yet to be elucidated. MAGEL2 influences the ubiquitination of substrate proteins to target them for further modification or to alter their stability through proteasomal degradation pathways. Here, we characterized relationships among MAGEL2 and proteins that regulate circadian rhythm. The effect of MAGEL2 on the key circadian rhythm protein cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) was assessed using in vivo proximity labelling (BioID), immunofluorescence microscopy and ubiquitination assays. We demonstrate that MAGEL2 modulates the ubiquitination of CRY1. Further studies will clarify the cellular role MAGEL2 normally plays in circadian rhythm, in part through ubiquitination and regulation of stability of the CRY1 protein."

Clinical findings suggesting the benefits of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists for glycemic control of DM in PWS have been recently increasing. However, there are only a few reports describing the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for PWS. We present a diabetic female with PWS, whose glycemic control was deteriorated at the age of 19 but improved to a certain extent by introducing the GLP-1 analog liraglutide. At the age of 20, the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin was administered. Subsequently, her HbA1c level and body weight markedly decreased. Improvement in both insulin resistance and secretion was observed during the subsequent six months. In addition to GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors may be a potential approach for the management of DM in PWS, especially in young patients whose pancreatic insulin secretion capabilities are still preserved."

Distinct prenatal features of PWS pregnancies included abnormal fetal growth [fetal growth restriction (FGR) (37.3%), increased head to abdominal circumference ratio (44.8%), decreased abdominal circumference (49.2%)], markedly decreased fetal movements (DFM) (80.4%), and polyhydramnios (42.0%) (P < 0.001 for all). The combination of abnormal growth accompanied by polyhydramnios or DFM was highly suggestive for PWS. Recognition of the unique PWS phenotype should alert obstetricians to consider the possibility of PWS, perform the diagnostic methylation test, provide appropriate counseling, and plan optimal management of the affected pregnancy."

    "title": "Circulating microRNA Associated to Different Stages of Liver Steatosis in Prader-Willi Syndrome and Non-Syndromic Obesity.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare and poorly characterized disease. Recent genomic and transcriptomic studies contributed to elucidate the molecular bases of the syndrome. In this study, we characterized the expression of circulating miRNAs in patients with PWS compared to those with non-syndromic obesity in association with liver steatosis. MiRNAs were studied by qRT-PCR in serum samples from 30 PWS and 30 non-syndromic obese subjects. MiRNA expression was associated with the presence of the syndrome and to the grade of liver steatosis. MiR-122-5p, miR-151a, miR-92a-3p were up-regulated in obese (4.38-fold, <i>p</i> < 0.01; 2.72-fold, <i>p</i> < 0.05; 1.34-fold <i>p</i> < 0.05, respectively) and were able to differentiate obese from PWS (AUC = 0.81, sens/spec 78/71%). When stratifying groups according to the presence of steatosis, the expression of miR-151a-5p, miR-92a-3p, miR-106b-5p, and miR-93-5p were lower in PWS with steatosis grade 1. Within the group with steatosis grade 1, miR-151a-5p was significantly distinguished PWS from obese (AUC = 0.85, sens/spec 80/85%) and the combination of miR-106b-5p and miR-93-5p showed higher performances in discriminating different grades of steatosis in PWS (AUC = 0.84, sens/spec 93/74%). MiRNAs represent a tool to better classify and characterize PWS, providing new information about the clinical picture and the extent of steatosis."

    "title": "Specific Dietary Components and Gut Microbiota Composition are Associated with Obesity in Children and Adolescents with Prader-Willi Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder associated with impaired body composition, hyperphagia, and excessive weight gain. Strict dietary restrictions from an early age is crucial to prevent or delay the early onset of obesity, which is the main driver of comorbidities in these patients. The aim of this study was to identify dietary and gut microbiota components closely linked to weight status of these patients. We studied a cohort of children and adolescents with genetic diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome (<i>N</i> = 31), in which we determined adiposity by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and dietary composition with 4-day food records. Furthermore, we obtained fecal samples to assess microbiota composition by 16S sequencing. Multivariate regression models showed that body mass index standard deviation score (BMI-SDS) and body fat mass were directly associated with saturated fat intake and meat consumption, and inversely associated with fruit consumption. Furthermore, the gut microbiome from normal weight patients was characterized by higher phylogenetic diversity compared to those overweight or obese, with differential abundance of several genera, including <i>Alistipes</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i>, and <i>Murimonas</i>. Notably, <i>Alistipes</i> abundance was inversely correlated to adiposity, lipid and glucose homeostasis parameters, and meat intake. Our results suggest that limiting meat and increasing fruit intake might be beneficial for body weight management in children and adolescents with Prader-Willi syndrome."

    "abstract": "Biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are lacking but would facilitate drug development for the core deficits of the disorder. We evaluated markers proposed for characterization of differences in social communication and interaction in adults with ASD versus healthy controls (HC) for utility as biomarkers. Data pooled from an observational study and baseline data from a placebo-controlled study were analyzed. Between-group differences were observed in eye-tracking tasks for activity monitoring, biomotion, human activity preference, composite score (p = 0.0001-0.037) and pupillometry (various tasks, p = 0.017-0.05). Impaired olfaction was more common in the ASD sample versus HC (p = 0.018). Our preliminary results suggest the potential use for stratification and response sub-analyses outcome-prediction of specific eye-tracking tasks, pupillometry and olfaction tests in ASD trials."

    "title": "Clinical characteristics and epilepsy in genomic imprinting disorders: Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are considered sister imprinting disorders. Although both AS and PWS congenital neurodevelopmental disorders have chromosome 15q11.3-q13 dysfunction, their molecular mechanisms differ owing to genomic imprinting, which results in different parent-of-the-origin gene expressions. Recently, several randomized controlled trials have been proceeded to treat specific symptoms of AS and PWS. Due to the advance of clinical management, early diagnosis for patients with AS and PWS is important. PWS is induced by multiple paternal gene dysfunctions, including those in MKRN3, MAGEL2, NDN, SNURF-SNPRPN, NPAP1, and a cluster of small nucleolar RNA genes. PWS patients exhibit characteristic facial features, endocrinological, and behavioral phenotypes, including short and obese figures, hyperphagia, growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism, autism, or obsessive- compulsive-like behaviors. In addition, hypotonia, poor feeding, failure to thrive, and typical facial features are major factors for early diagnosis of PWS. For PWS patients, epilepsy is not common and easy to treat. Conversely, AS is a single-gene disorder induced by ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A dysfunction, which only expresses from a maternal allele. AS patients develop epilepsy in their early lives and their seizures are difficult to control. The distinctive gait pattern, excessive laughter, and characteristic electroencephalography features, which contain anterior-dominated, high-voltage triphasic delta waves intermixed with epileptic spikes, result in early suspicion of AS. Often, polytherapy, including the combination of valproate, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and benzodiazepines, is required for controlling seizures of AS patients. Notably, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and vigabatrin should be avoided, since these may induce nonconvulsive status epilepticus. AS and PWS presented with distinct clinical manifestations according to specific molecular defects due to genomic imprinting. Early diagnosis and teamwork intervention, including geneticists, neurologists, rehabilitation physicians, and pulmonologists, are important. Epilepsy is common in patients with AS, and after proper treatment, seizures could be effectively controlled in late childhood or early adulthood for both AS and PWS patients."

    "title": "Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Levoffoxacin in an Obese Adolescent: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "To describe the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin in an obese adolescent patient in the pediatric intensive care unit. A single-patient medical record review was conducted. A 168-kg, 15-year-old female with past medical history of Prader-Willi syndrome and asthma initially presented with respiratory distress secondary to asthma exacerbation. She failed non-invasive ventilation and was subsequently intubated for respiratory failure and progressed to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. On hospital day 1 (HD 1) an infectious workup was begun because of a fever, worsening clinical status, and initiation of vasopressors and an empiric antimicrobial regimen of cefepime and clindamycin. The urine culture subsequently grew Escherichia coli and the respiratory culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She continued to be febrile, which was thought to be due to an intra-abdominal abscess. On HD 14, the antimicrobial regimen was changed to levofloxacin because of continued fevers and no significant clinical improvement. Levofloxacin was initiated at 1000 mg IV every 24 hours. Levofloxacin serum levels were obtained at 0.5, 3.5, and 11.5 hours after infusion, which were 8.61, 5.76, and 2.7 mg/L, respectively. These concentrations translated into a peak level of 8.79 mg/L, a half-life of 6.4 hours, and an AUC of 80 mg·hr/L, which are discordant from the expected peak of 16 mg/L, a half-life of 8 hours, and an AUC of 120 mg·hr/L. Based on these values, the levofloxacin regimen was adjusted to 1000 mg IV every 12 hours, and repeat levels 0.5, 3.5, and 11.5 hours after infusion were 9.91, 6.56, and 3.27 mg/L, respectively, corresponding to a peak of 10.5 mg/L, a half-life of 5.18 hours, and an AUC of 200 mg·hr/L. After the adjustment in levofloxacin regimen, she became afebrile, WBC resolution and improvement in her overall clinical status, and she received a total duration for levofloxacin of 21 days. A levofloxacin regimen of 1000 mg IV every 12 hours was successful in providing for an appropriate AUC exposure and was associated with a successful clinical outcome in this morbidly obese adolescent."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), an imprinting disorder, results from the loss of expression of a paternal gene on chromosome 15q11-q13. Progressive obesity and its associated complications lead to increased morbidity and early death in PWS patients. The management techniques available for morbid obesity in adolescents and adults with PWS are limited. Herein, we report successful weight reduction in an adolescent PWS case showing morbid obesity and respiratory failure. An 18-year-old girl with PWS presented with diffuse cellulitis and dyspnea due to severe obesity. Her body weight had increased from 146 to 161 kg despite dietary restriction to 800 kcal/day, and a mechanical ventilator was required for dyspnea. During mechanical ventilation, the patient was managed using diuretics and by restricting fluid intake; her daily calorie intake was reduced to 200 kcal. This aggressive calorie and water restriction continued for 3 weeks and reduced her body weight to 118.6 kg. After transfer to the general ward, the patient was provided with growth hormone therapy and intensive aquatic rehabilitation and was administered liraglutide; as a result, her weight further decreased to 104 kg (body mass index [BMI], 50.8 kg/m2), and she was discharged. Following discharge, she maintained her BMI and adapted to 1,000 kcal/day for 1 year. Aggressive water and calorie restriction were observed as an effective method for rapid weight reduction in PWS patients, and liraglutide appeared useful in maintaining weight reduction in adolescent and adult PWS."

    "title": "Central Adrenal Insufficiency Is Rare in Adults With Prader-Willi Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is associated with several hypothalamic-pituitary hormone deficiencies. There is no agreement on the prevalence of central adrenal insufficiency (CAI) in adults with PWS. In some countries, it is general practice to prescribe stress-dose hydrocortisone during physical or psychological stress in patients with PWS. Side effects of frequent hydrocortisone use are weight gain, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension-already major problems in adults with PWS. However, undertreatment of CAI can cause significant morbidity-or even mortality. To prevent both over- and undertreatment with hydrocortisone, we assessed the prevalence of CAI in a large international cohort of adults with PWS. As the synacthen test shows variable results in PWS, we only use the metyrapone test (MTP) and insulin tolerance test (ITT). Metyrapone test or ITT in adults with PWS (N = 82) and review of medical files for symptoms of hypocortisolism related to surgery (N = 645). Outpatient clinic. Eighty-two adults with genetically confirmed PWS. For MTP, 11-deoxycortisol > 230 nmol/L was considered sufficient. For ITT, cortisol > 500 nmol/L (Dutch, French, and Swedish patients) or > 450 nmol/L (British patients) was considered sufficient. Central adrenal insufficiency was excluded in 81 of 82 patients. Among the 645 patients whose medical files were reviewed, 200 had undergone surgery without perioperative hydrocortisone treatment. None of them had displayed any features of hypocortisolism. Central adrenal insufficiency is rare (1.2%) in adults with PWS. Based on these results, we recommend against routinely prescribing hydrocortisone stress-doses in adults with PWS."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic form of hyperphagia leading to severe obesity, accompanied by endocrine, musculoskeletal, and neurological dysfunction. PWS is caused by the inactivation of contiguous genes on chromosome 15q11-q13, and mice with gene-targeted mutations in one or more of these PWS genes recapitulate PWS-like phenotypes. In addition to evaluating the potential effectiveness of a therapeutic for the treatment of PWS, animal models can be used to elucidate the deficiencies in appetitive and energy balance pathways that lead to hyperphagia and obesity. Various therapeutics have been tested for their effects on ingestive behavior, hyperphagia, and obesity in clinical trials for PWS, with encouraging preliminary results on small groups of participants with PWS. Here, we summarize ingestive behavior-related therapeutics tested in PWS animal models and summarize published data from clinical trials that have evaluated the effect of therapeutics on ingestive behavior in individuals with PWS. We then discuss strategies to accelerate the discovery and translation of therapies into clinical practice in PWS."

    "abstract": "Visuomotor impairments characterize numerous neurological disorders and neurogenetic syndromes, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Dravet, Fragile X, Prader-Willi, Turner, and Williams syndromes. Despite recent advances in systems neuroscience, the biological basis underlying visuomotor functional impairments associated with these clinical conditions is poorly understood. In this study, we used neuroimaging connectomic approaches to map the visuomotor integration (VMI) system in the human brain and investigated the topology approximation of the VMI network to the Allen Human Brain Atlas, a whole-brain transcriptome-wide atlas of cortical genetic expression. We found the genetic expression of four genes-TBR1, SCN1A, MAGEL2, and CACNB4-to be prominently associated with visuomotor integrators in the human cortex. TBR1 gene transcripts, an ASD gene whose expression is related to neural development of the cortex and the hippocampus, showed a central spatial allocation within the VMI system. Our findings delineate gene expression traits underlying the VMI system in the human cortex, where specific genes, such as TBR1, are likely to play a central role in its neuronal organization, as well as on specific phenotypes of neurogenetic syndromes."

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the first multi-systemic genetic disorder known to be caused by imprinting defect. The clinical manifestations of PWS vary with age. At the prenatal stage, decreased fetal movements are frequent. The major clinical manifestations during neonatal period include hypotonia, weak cry, poor suck and feeding difficulties. Growth retardation and delayed language and motor development are observed during infancy. Short stature, small hands and feet, cognitive deficiency are noticed in the childhood. At adolescence, prominent growth retardation, obesity, gonadal dysplasia, abnormal behavior and learning difficulties are the major issues. Morbid obesity caused by insatiable appetite is the major factor for prognosis. Early diagnosis and intervention play a significance role in improving the quality of life, preventing serious complications and prolonging survival. This guideline covers the clinical manifestations, developmental process, pathogenesis, molecular diagnosis and genetic counseling of PWS, with an aim to provide reference for clinicians for early identification, proper intervention and genetic counseling for this disease."
